2589_22574_000034_000000	train-clean-360	It was the middle of autumn and had rained all day 
none	none	Through the lozenge panes of the wide oriel window the world appeared in the slowly gathering dusk not a little dismal The drops that clung trickling to the dim glass added rain and gloom to the landscape beyond whither the eye passed as if vaguely seeking that help in the distance which the dripping hollyhocks and sodden sunflowers bordering the little lawn or the honeysuckle covering the wide porch from which the slow rain dropped ceaselessly upon the pebble paving below could not give steepy slopes hedge divided into small fields some green and dotted with red cattle others crowded with shocks of bedraggled and drooping corn which looked suffering and patient 
2589_22574_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The room to which the window having this prospect belonged was large and low with a dark floor of uncarpeted oak 
none	none	It opened immediately upon the porch and although a good fire of logs blazed on the hearth was chilly to the sense of the old man who with his feet on the skin of a fallow deer sat gazing sadly into the flames which shone rosy through the thin hands spread out before them 
2589_22574_000035_000002	train-clean-360	At the opposite corner of the great low arched chimney sat a lady past the prime of life but still beautiful though the beauty was all but merged in the loveliness that rises from the heart to the face of such as have taken the greatest step in life that is as the old proverb says the step out of doors 
2589_22574_000035_000003	train-clean-360	She was plainly yet rather richly dressed in garments of an old fashioned and well preserved look 
2589_22574_000035_000004	train-clean-360	Her hair was cut short above her forehead and frizzed out in bunches of little curls on each side 
none	none	On her head was a covering of dark stuff like a nun s veil which fell behind and on her shoulders 
2589_22574_000035_000006	train-clean-360	Close round her neck was a string of amber beads that gave a soft harmonious light to her complexion 
none	none	Her dark eyes looked as if they found repose there so quietly did they rest on the face of the old man who was plainly a clergyman It was a small pale thin delicately and symmetrically formed face yet not the less a strong one with endurance on the somewhat sad brow and force in the closed lips while a good conscience looked clear out of the grey eyes They had been talking about the fast gathering tide of opinion which driven on by the wind of words had already begun to beat so furiously against the moles and ramparts of Church and kingdom 
2589_22574_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The execution of lord Strafford was news that had not yet begun to hiss the speaker 
none	none	It is indeed an evil time said the old man
2589_22574_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 The world has seldom seen its like 
2589_22574_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 But tell me master Herbert said the lady why comes it in this our day 
none	none	For our sins or for the sins of our fathers
2589_22574_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Be it far from me to presume to set forth the ways of Providence returned her guest 
none	none	I meddle not like some that should be wiser with the calling of the prophet It is enough for me to know that ever and again the pride of man will gather to a mighty and a fearful head and like a swollen mill pond overfed of rains burst the banks that confine it whether they be the laws of the land or the ordinances of the church usurping on the fruitful meadows the hope of life for man and beast 
2589_22574_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Alas he went on with a new suggestion from the image he had been using if the beginning of strife be as the letting out of water what shall be the end of that strife whose beginning is the letting out of blood 
none	none	Think you then good sir that thus it has always been 
2589_22574_000040_000001	train-clean-360	that such times of fierce ungodly tempest must ever follow upon seasons of peace and comfort even as your cousin of holy memory in his verses concerning the church militant writes 
2589_22574_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Thus also sin and darkness follow still The church and sun with all their power and skill 
none	none	Truly it seems so But I thank God the days of my pilgrimage are nearly numbered 
2589_22574_000042_000002	train-clean-360	To judge by the tokens the wise man gives us the mourners are already going about my streets 
2589_22574_000042_000003	train-clean-360	The almond tree flourisheth at least 
none	none	He smiled as he spoke laying his hand on his grey head
2589_22574_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 But think of those whom we must leave behind us master Herbert How will it fare with them said the lady in troubled tone and glancing in the direction of the window 
2589_22574_000045_000000	train-clean-360	In the window sat a girl gazing from it with the look of a child who had uttered all her incantations and could imagine no abatement in the steady rain pour 
2589_22574_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall leave behind us strong hearts and sound heads too said mister Herbert And I bethink me there will be none stronger or sounder than those of your young cousins my late pupils of whom I hear brave things from Oxford and in whose affection my spirit constantly rejoices 
2589_22574_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 You will be glad to hear such good news of your relatives Dorothy said the lady addressing her daughter 
2589_22574_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Even as she said the words the setting sun broke through the mass of grey cloud and poured over the earth a level flood of radiance in which the red wheat glowed and the drops that hung on every ear flashed like diamonds 
2589_22574_000048_000001	train-clean-360	The girl s hair caught it as she turned her face to answer her mother and an aureole of brown tinted gold gleamed for a moment about her head 
none	none	I am glad that you are pleased madam but you know I have never seen them or heard of them except from master Herbert who has indeed often spoke rare things of them Mistress Dorothy will still know the reason why said the clergyman smiling and the two resumed their conversation 
2589_22574_000050_000001	train-clean-360	But the girl rose and turning again to the window stood for a moment rapt in the transfiguration passing upon the world 
2589_22574_000050_000002	train-clean-360	The vault of grey was utterly shattered but gathering glory from ruin was hurrying in rosy masses away from under the loftier vault of blue 
2589_22574_000050_000003	train-clean-360	The ordered shocks upon twenty fields sent their long purple shadows across the flush and the evening wind like the sighing that follows departed tears was shaking the jewels from their feathery tops 
2589_22574_000050_000004	train-clean-360	The sunflowers and hollyhocks no longer cowered under the tyranny of the rain but bowed beneath the weight of the gems that adorned them 
2589_22574_000050_000005	train-clean-360	A flame burned as upon an altar on the top of every tree and the very pools that lay on the distant road had their message of light to give to the hopeless earth 
2589_22574_000050_000006	train-clean-360	As she gazed another hue than that of the sunset yet rosy too gradually flushed the face of the maiden She turned suddenly from the window and left the room shaking a shower of diamonds from the honeysuckle as she passed out through the porch upon the gravel walk 
2589_22574_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Possibly her elders found her departure a relief for although they took no notice of it their talk became more confidential and was soon mingled with many names both of rank and note with a familiarity which to a stranger might have seemed out of keeping with the humbler character of their surroundings 
2589_22574_000052_000000	train-clean-360	But when Dorothy Vaughan had passed a corner of the house to another garden more ancient in aspect and in some things quaint even to grotesqueness she was in front of a portion of the house which indicated a far statelier past closed and done with like the rooms within those shuttered windows 
none	none	The inhabited wing she had left looked like the dwelling of a yeoman farming his own land nor did this appearance greatly belie the present position of the family For generations it had been slowly descending in the scale of worldly account and the small portion of the house occupied by the widow and daughter of sir Ringwood Vaughan was larger than their means could match with correspondent outlay 
2589_22574_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Such however was the character of lady Vaughan that although she mingled little with the great families in the neighbourhood she was so much respected that she would have been a welcome visitor to most of them 
2589_22574_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The reverend mister Matthew Herbert was a clergyman from the Welsh border a man of some note and influence who had been the personal friend both of his late relative George Herbert and of the famous doctor Donne 
2589_22574_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Strongly attached to the English church and recoiling with disgust from the practices of the puritans as much perhaps from refinement of taste as abhorrence of schism he had never yet fallen into such a passion for episcopacy as to feel any cordiality towards the schemes of the archbishop 
2589_22574_000053_000002	train-clean-360	To those who knew him his silence concerning it was a louder protest against the policy of Laud than the fiercest denunciations of the puritans 
none	none	Once only had he been heard to utter himself unguardedly in respect of the primate and that was amongst friends and after the second glass permitted of his cousin George Tut laud me no Laud he said A skipping bishop is worse than a skipping king Once also he had been overheard murmuring to himself by way of consolement Bishops pass the church remains He had been a great friend of the late sir Ringwood and although the distance from his parish was too great to be travelled often he seldom let a year go by without paying a visit to his friend s widow and daughter Turning her back on the cenotaph of their former greatness Dorothy dived into a long pleached alley careless of the drip from overhead and hurrying through it came to a circular patch of thin grass rounded by a lofty hedge of yew trees in the midst of which stood what had once been a sun dial It mattered little however that only the stump of a gnomon was left seeing the hedge around it had grown to such a height in relation to the diameter of the circle that it was only for a very brief hour or so in the middle of a summer s day when of all periods the passage of Time seems least to concern humanity that it could have served to measure his march The spot had indeed a time forsaken look as if it lay buried in the bosom of the past and the present had forgotten it Before emerging from the alley she slackened her pace half stopped and stooping a little in her tucked up skirt threw a bird like glance around the opener space then stepping into it she looked up to the little disc of sky across which the clouds their roses already withered sailed dim and grey once more while behind them the stars were beginning to recall their half forgotten message from regions unknown to men A moment and she went up to the dial stood there for another moment and was on the point of turning to leave the spot when as if with one great bound a youth stood between her and the entrance of the alley Ah ha mistress Dorothy you do not escape me so he cried spreading out his arms as if to turn back some runaway creature But mistress Dorothy was startled and mistress Dorothy did not choose to be startled and therefore mistress Dorothy was dignified if not angry I do not like such behaviour Richard she said It ill suits with the time Why did you hide behind the hedge and then leap forth so rudely I thought you saw me answered the youth Pardon my heedlessness Dorothy I hope I have not startled you too much As he spoke he stooped over the hand he had caught and would have carried it to his lips but the girl half pettishly snatched it away and with a strange mixture of dignity sadness and annoyance in her tone said There has been something too much of this Richard and I begin to be ashamed of it Ashamed echoed the youth Of what There is nothing but me to be ashamed of and what can I have done since yesterday No Richard I am not ashamed of you but I am ashamed of of this way of meeting and and Surely that is strange when we can no more remember the day in which we have not met than that in which we met first No dear Dorothy It is not our meeting Richard and if you would but think as honestly as you speak you would not require to lay upon me the burden of explanation It is this foolish way we have got into of late kissing hands and and always meeting by the old sun dial or in some other over quiet spot Why do you not come to the house My mother would give you the same welcome as any time these last how many years Richard Are you quite sure of that Dorothy Well I did fancy she spoke with something more of ceremony the last time you met But consider she has seen so much less of you of late Yet I am sure she has all but a mother s love in her heart towards you For your mother was dear to her as her own soul I would it were so Dorothy For then perhaps your mother would not shrink from being my mother too When we are married Dorothy Married exclaimed the girl What of marrying indeed And she turned sideways from him with an indignant motion Richard she went on after a marked and yet but momentary pause for the youth had not had time to say a word it has been very wrong in me to meet you after this fashion I know it now for see what such things lead to If you knew it you have done me wrong Dearest Dorothy exclaimed the youth taking her hand again of which this time she seemed hardly aware did you not know from the very vanished first that I loved you with all my heart and that to tell you so would have been to tell the sun that he shines warm at noon in midsummer And I did think you had a little something for me Dorothy your old playmate that you did not give to every other acquaintance Think of the houses we have built and the caves we have dug together of our rabbits and urchins and pigeons and peacocks We are children no longer returned Dorothy To behave as if we were would be to keep our eyes shut after we are awake I like you Richard you know but why this where is the use of all this new sort of thing Come up with me to the house where master Herbert is now talking to my mother in the large parlour The good man will be glad to see you I doubt it Dorothy He and my father as I am given to understand think so differently in respect of affairs now pending betwixt the parliament and the king that It were more becoming Richard if the door of your lips opened to the king first and let the parliament follow Well said returned the youth with a smile But let it be my excuse that I speak as I am wont to hear The girl s hand had lain quiet in that of the youth but now it started from it like a scared bird She stepped two paces back and drew herself up And you Richard she said interrogatively What would you ask Dorothy returned the youth taking a step nearer to which she responded by another backward ere she replied I would know whom you choose to serve whether God or Satan whether you are of those who would set at nought the laws of the land Insist on their fulfilment they say by king as well as people interrupted Richard They would tear their mother in pieces Their mother repeated Richard bewildered Their mother the church explained Dorothy Oh said Richard Nay they would but cast out of her the wolves in sheep s clothing that devour the lambs The girl was silent Anger glowed on her forehead and flashed from her grey eyes She stood one moment then turned to leave him but half turned again to say scornfully I must go at once to my mother I knew not I had left her with such a wolf as master Herbert is like to prove Master Herbert is no bishop Dorothy The bishops then are the wolves master Heywood said the girl with growing indignation Dear Dorothy I am but repeating what I hear For my own part I know little of these matters And what are they to us if we love one another I tell you I am a child no longer flamed Dorothy You were seventeen last saint George s Day and I shall be nineteen next saint Michael s saint George for merry England cried Dorothy saint Michael for the Truth cried Richard So be it Good bye then said the girl going What DO you mean Dorothy said Richard and she stood to hear but with her back towards him and as it were hovering midway in a pace Did not saint Michael also slay his dragon Why should the knights part company Believe me Dorothy I care more for a smile from you than for all the bishops in the church or all the presbyters out of it You take needless pains to prove yourself a foolish boy Richard and if I go not to my mother at once I fear I shall learn to despise you which I would not willingly Despise me Do you take me for a coward then Dorothy I say not that I doubt not for the matter of swords and pistols you are much like other male creatures but I protest I could never love a man who preferred my company to the service of his king She glided into the alley and sped along its vaulted twilight her white dress gleaming and clouding by fits as she went The youth stood for a moment petrified then started to overtake her but stood stock still at the entrance of the alley and followed her only with his eyes as she went When Dorothy reached the house she did not run up to her room that she might weep unseen She was still too much annoyed with Richard to regret having taken such leave of him She only swallowed down a little balloonful of sobs and went straight into the parlour where her mother and mister Herbert still sat and resumed her seat in the bay window Her heightened colour an occasional toss of her head backwards like that with which a horse seeks ease from the bearing rein generally followed by a renewal of the attempt to swallow something of upward tendency were the only signs of her discomposure and none of them were observed by her mother or her guest Could she have known however what feelings had already begun to rouse themselves in the mind of him whose boyishness was an offence to her she would have found it more difficult to keep such composure Dorothy s was a face whose forms were already so decided that should no softening influences from the central regions gain the ascendancy beyond a doubt age must render it hard and unlovely In all the roundness and freshness of girlhood it was handsome rather than beautiful beautiful rather than lovely And yet it was strongly attractive for it bore clear indication of a nature to be trusted If her grey eyes were a little cold they were honest eyes with a rare look of steadfastness and if her lips were a little too closely pressed it was clearly from any cause rather than bad temper Neither head hands nor feet were small but they were fine in form and movement and for the rest of her person tall and strong as Richard was Dorothy looked further advanced in the journey of life than he She needed hardly however have treated his indifference to the politics of the time with so much severity seeing her own acquaintance with and interest in them dated from that same afternoon during which from lack of other employment and the weariness of a long morning of slow dismal rain she had been listening to mister Herbert as he dwelt feelingly on the arrogance of puritan encroachment and the grossness of presbyterian insolence both to kingly prerogative and episcopal authority and drew a touching picture of the irritant thwartings and pitiful insults to which the gentle monarch was exposed in his attempts to support the dignity of his divine office and to cast its protecting skirt over the defenceless church and if it was with less sympathy that he spoke of the fears which haunted the captive metropolitan Dorothy at least could detect no hidden sarcasm in the tone in which he expressed his hope that Laud s devotion to the beauty of holiness might not result in the dignity of martyrdom as might well be feared by those who were assured that the whole guilt of Strafford lay in his return to his duty and his subsequent devotion to the interests of his royal master to all this the girl had listened and her still sufficiently uncertain knowledge of the affairs of the nation had ere the talk was over blossomed in a vague sense of partizanship It was chiefly her desire after the communion of sympathy with Richard that had led her into the mistake of such a hasty disclosure of her new feelings But her following words had touched him whether to fine issues or not remained yet poised on the knife edge of the balancing will His first emotion partook of anger As soon as she was out of sight a spell seemed broken and words came A boy indeed mistress Dorothy he said If ever it come to what certain persons prophesy you may wish me in truth and that for the sake of your precious bishops the boy you call me now Yes you are right mistress though I would it had been another who told me so Boy indeed I am or have been without a thought in my head but of her The sound of my father s voice has been but as the wind of the winnowing fan In me it has found but chaff If you will have me take a side though you will find me so far worthy of you that I shall take the side that seems to me the right one were all the fair Dorothies of the universe on the other In very truth I should be somewhat sorry to find the king and the bishops in the right lest my lady should flatter herself and despise me that I had chosen after her showing forsooth This is master Herbert s doing for never before did I hear her speak after such fashion While he thus spoke with himself he stood like the genius of the spot a still dusky figure on the edge of the night into which his dress of brown velvet rich and sombre at once in the sunlight all but merged Nearly for the first time in his life he was experiencing the difficulty of making up his mind not however upon any of the important questions his inattention to which had exposed him to such sudden and unexpected severity but merely as to whether he should seek her again in the company of her mother and mister Herbert or return home The result of his deliberation springing partly no doubt from anger but that of no very virulent type was that he turned his back on the alley passed through a small opening in the yew hedge crossed a neglected corner of woodland by ways better known to him than to any one else and came out upon the main road leading to the gates of his father s park CHAPTER II RICHARD AND HIS FATHER Richard Heywood as to bodily fashion was a tall and already powerful youth The clear brown of his complexion spoke of plentiful sunshine and air A merry sparkle in the depths of his hazel eyes relieved the shadows of rather notably heavy lids themselves heavily overbrowed with a suggestion of character which had not yet asserted itself to those who knew him best Correspondingly his nose although of a Greek type was more notable for substance than clearness of line or modelling while his lips had a boyish fulness along with a definiteness of bow like curve which manly resolve had not yet begun to compress and straighten out His chin was at least large enough not to contradict the promise of his face his shoulders were square and his chest and limbs well developed altogether it was at present a fair tabernacle of whatever sort the indwelling divinity might yet turn out fashioning it further after his own nature His father and he were the only male descendants of an old Monmouthshire family of neither Welsh nor Norman but as pure Saxon blood as might be had within the clip of the ocean Roger the father had once only or twice in his lifetime been heard boast in humorous fashion that although but a simple squire he could on this side the fog of tradition which nearer or further shrouds all origin count a longer descent than any of the titled families in the county not excluding the earl of Worcester himself His character also would have gone far to support any assertion he might have chosen to make as to the purity of his strain A notable immobility of nature his friends called it firmness his enemies obstinacy a seeming disregard of what others might think of him a certain sternness of manner an unreadiness as it were to open his door to the people about him a searching regard with which he was wont to peruse the face of anyone holding talk with him when he seemed always to give heed to the looks rather than the words of him who spoke these peculiarities had combined to produce a certain awe of him in his inferiors and a dislike not unavowed in his equals With his superiors he came seldom in contact and to them his behaviour was still more distant and unbending But although from these causes he was far from being a favourite in the county he was a man of such known and acknowledged probity that until of late when party spirit ran high and drew almost everybody whether of consequence or not to one side or the other there was nobody who would not have trusted Roger Heywood to the uttermost Even now foes as well as friends acknowledged that he was to be depended upon while his own son looked up to him with a reverence that in some measure overshadowed his affection Such a character as this had necessarily been slow in formation and the opinions which had been modified by it and had reacted upon it had been as unalterably as deliberately adopted But affairs had approached a crisis between king and parliament before one of his friends knew that there were in his mind any opinions upon them in process of formation so reserved and monosyllabic had been his share in any conversation upon topics which had for a long time been growing every hour of more and more absorbing interest to all men either of consequence intelligence property or adventure At last however it had become clear to the great annoyance of not a few amongst his neighbours that Heywood s leanings were to the parliament But he had never yet sought to influence his son in regard to the great questions at issue His house was one of those ancient dwellings which have grown under the hands to fit the wants of successive generations and look as if they had never been other than old two storied at most and many gabled with marvellous accretions and projections the haunts of yet more wonderful shadows There in a room he called his study shabby and small containing a library more notable for quality and selection than size Richard the next morning sought and found him Father he said entering with some haste after the usual request for admission I am here my son answered Roger without lifting his eyes from the small folio in which he was reading I want to know father whether when men differ a man is bound to take a side Nay Richard but a man is bound NOT to take a side save upon reasons well considered and found good It may be father if you had seen fit to send me to Oxford I should have been better able to judge now I had my reasons son Richard Readier perhaps you might have been but fitter no Tell me what points you have in question That I can hardly say sir I only know there are points at issue betwixt king and parliament which men appear to consider of mightiest consequence Will you tell me father why you have never instructed me in these affairs of church and state I trust it is not because you count me unworthy of your confidence Far from it my son My silence hath respect to thy hearing and to the judgment yet unawakened in thee Who would lay in the arms of a child that which must crush him to the earth Years did I take to meditate ere I resolved and I know not yet if thou hast in thee the power of meditation At least father I could try to understand if you would unfold your mind When you know what the matters at issue are my son that is when you are able to ask me questions worthy of answer I shall be ready to answer thee so far as my judgment will reach I thank you father In the meantime I am as one who knocks and the door is not opened unto him Rather art thou as one who loiters on the door step and lifts up neither ring nor voice Surely sir I must first know the news Thou hast ears keep them open But at least you know my son that on the twelfth day of May last my lord of Strafford lost his head Who took it from him sir King or parliament Even that might be made a question but I answer the High Court of Parliament my son Was the judgment a right one or a wrong sir Did he deserve the doom Ah there you put a question indeed Many men say RIGHT and many men say WRONG One man I doubt me much was wrong in the share HE bore therein Who was he sir Nay nay I will not forestall thine own judgment But in good sooth I might be more ready to speak my mind were it not that I greatly doubt some of those who cry loudest for liberty I fear that had they once the power they would be the first to trample her under foot Liberty with some men means MY liberty to do and THINE to suffer But all in good time my son The dawn is nigh You will tell me at least father what is the bone of contention My son where there is contention a bone shall not fail It is but a leg bone now it will be a rib to morrow and by and by doubtless it will be the skull itself If you care for none of these things sir will not master Flowerdew have a hard name for you I know not what it means but it sounds of the gallows said Richard looking rather doubtful as to how his father might take it Possibly my son I care more for the contention than the bone for while thieves quarrel honest men go their own ways But what ignorance I have kept thee in and yet left thee to bear the reproach of a puritan said the father smiling grimly Thou meanest master Flowerdew would call me a Gallio and thou takest the Roman proconsul for a gallows bird Verily thou art not destined to prolong the renown of thy race for letters I marvel what thy cousin Thomas would say to the darkness of thy ignorance See what comes of not sending me to Oxford sir I know not who is my cousin Thomas A man both of learning and wisdom my son though I fear me his diet is too strong for the stomach of this degenerate age while the dressing of his dishes is on the other hand too cunningly devised for their liking But it is no marvel thou shouldest be ignorant of him being as yet no reader of books Neither is he a close kinsman being of the Lincolnshire branch of the Heywoods Now I know whom you mean sir but I thought he was a writer of stage plays and such things as on all sides I hear called foolish and mummery There be among those who call themselves the godly who will endure no mummery but of their own inventing Cousin Thomas hath written a multitude of plays but that he studied at Cambridge and to good purpose this book which I was reading when you entered bears good witness What is the book father Stay I will read thee a portion The greater part is of learning rather than wisdom the gathered opinions of the wise and good concerning things both high and strange but I will read thee some verses bearing his own mind which is indeed worthy to be set down with theirs He read that wonderful poem ending the second Book of the Hierarchy and having finished it looked at his son I do not understand it sir said Richard I did not expect you would returned his father Here take the book and read for thyself If light should dawn upon the page as thou readest perhaps thou wilt understand what I now say that I care but little for the bones concerning which king and parliament contend but I do care that men thou and I my son should be free to walk in any path whereon it may please God to draw us Take the book my son and read again But read no farther save with caution for it dealeth with many things wherein old Thomas is too readily satisfied with hearsay for testimony Richard took the small folio and carried it to his own chamber where he read and partly understood the poem But he was not ripe enough either in philosophy or religion for such meditations Having executed his task for as such he regarded it he turned to look through the strange mixture of wisdom and credulity composing the volume One tale after another of witch and demon and magician firmly believed and honestly recorded by his worthy relative drew him on until he sat forgetful of everything but the world of marvels before him to none of which however did he accord a wider credence than sprung from the interest of the moment He was roused by a noise of quarrel in the farmyard towards which his window looked and laying aside reading hastened out to learn the cause CHAPTER III THE WITCH It was a bright Autumn morning A dry wind had been blowing all night through the shocks and already some of the farmers had begun to carry to their barns the sheaves which had stood hopelessly dripping the day before Ere Richard reached the yard he saw over the top of the wall the first load of wheat sheaves from the harvest field standing at the door of the barn and high uplifted thereon the figure of Faithful Stopchase one of the men a well known frequenter of puritan assemblies all the country round who was holding forth and that with much freedom in tones that sounded very like vituperation if not malediction against some one invisible He soon found that the object of his wrath was a certain Welshwoman named Rees by her neighbours considered objectionable on the ground of witchcraft against whom this much could with truth be urged that she was so far from thinking it disreputable that she took no pains to repudiate the imputation of it Her dress had it been judged by eyes of our day would have been against her but it was only old fashioned not even antiquated common in Queen Elizabeth s time it lingered still in remote country places a gown of dark stuff made with a long waist and short skirt over a huge farthingale a ruff which stuck up and out high and far from her throat and a conical Welsh hat invading the heavens Stopchase having descried her in the yard had taken the opportunity of breaking out upon her in language as far removed from that of conventional politeness as his puritanical principles would permit Doubtless he considered it a rebuking of Satan but forgot that although one of the godly he could hardly on that ground lay claim to larger privilege in the use of bad language than the archangel Michael For the old woman although too prudent to reply she scorned to flee and stood regarding him fixedly Richard sought to interfere and check the torrent of abuse but it had already gathered so much head that the man seemed even unaware of his attempt Presently however he began to quail in the midst of his storming The green eyes of the old woman fixed upon him seemed to be slowly fascinating him At length in the very midst of a volley of scriptural epithets he fell suddenly silent turned from her and with the fork on which he had been leaning began to pitch the sheaves into the barn The moment he turned his back Goody Rees turned hers and walked slowly away She had scarcely reached the yard gate however before the cow boy a delighted spectator and auditor of the affair had loosed the fierce watch dog which flew after her Fortunately Richard saw what took place but the animal which was generally chained up did not heed his recall and the poor woman had already felt his teeth when Richard got him by the throat She looked pale and frightened but kept her composure wonderfully and when Richard who was prejudiced in her favour from having once heard Dorothy speak friendlily to her expressed his great annoyance that she should have been so insulted on his father s premises received his apologies with dignity and good faith He dragged the dog back rechained him and was in the act of administering sound and righteous chastisement to the cow boy when Stopchase staggered tumbled off the cart and falling upon his head lay motionless Richard hurried to him and finding his neck twisted and his head bent to one side concluded he was killed The woman who had accompanied him from the field stood for a moment uttering loud cries then suddenly bethinking herself sped after the witch Richard was soon satisfied he could do nothing for him Presently the woman came running back followed at a more leisurely pace by Goody Rees whose countenance was grave and even to the twitch about her mouth inscrutable She walked up to where the man lay looked at him for a moment or two as if considering his case then sat down on the ground beside him and requested Richard to move him so that his head should lie on her lap This done she laid hold of it with a hand on each ear and pulled at his neck at the same time turning his head in the right direction There came a snap and the neck was straight She then began to stroke it with gentle yet firm hand In a few moments he began to breathe As soon as she saw his chest move she called for a wisp of hay and having shaped it a little drew herself from under his head substituting the hay Then rising without a word she walked from the yard Stopchase lay for a while gradually coming to himself then scrambled all at once to his feet and staggered to his pitchfork which lay where it had fallen It is of the mercy of the Lord that I fell not upon the prongs of the pitchfork he said as he slowly stooped and lifted it He had no notion that he had lain more than a few seconds and of the return of Goody Rees and her ministrations he knew nothing while such an awe of herself and her influences had she left behind her that neither the woman nor the cow boy ventured to allude to her and even Richard influenced partly no doubt by late reading was more inclined to think than speak about her For the man himself little knowing how close death had come to him but inwardly reproached because of his passionate outbreak he firmly believed that he had had a narrow escape from the net of the great fowler whose decoy the old woman was commissioned not only to cause his bodily death but to work in him first such a frame of mind as should render his soul the lawful prey of the enemy CHAPTER IV A CHAPTER OF FOOLS The same afternoon as it happened a little company of rustics who had just issued from the low hatch door of the village inn stood for a moment under the sign of the Crown and Mitre which swung huskily creaking from the bough of an ancient thorn tree then passed on to the road and took their way together Hope you then said one of them as continuing their previous conversation that we shall escape unhurt It is a parlous business Not as one of us is afeard as I knows on But the old earl he do have a most unregenerate temper and you had better look to t my masters I tell thee master Upstill it s not the old earl as I m afeard on but the young lord For thou knows as well as ere a one it be not without cause that men do call him a wizard for a wizard he be and that of the worst sort We shall be out again afore sundown shannot we said another That I trust Up to the which hour the High Court of Parliament assembled will have power to protect its own eh John Croning Nay that I cannot tell It be a parlous job and for mine own part whether for the love I bear to the truth or the hatred I cherish toward the scarlet Antichrist with her seven tails Tush tush John Seven heads man and ten horns Those are the numbers master Flowerdew read Nay I know not for your horns but for the rest I say seven tails Did not honest master Flowerdew set forth unto us last meeting that the scarlet woman sat upon seven hills eh Have with you there master Sycamore Well for the sake of sound argument I grant you But we ha got to do with no heads nor no tails neither save and except as you may say the sting is in the tail and then or I greatly mistake it s not seven times seven as will serve to count the stings come of the tails what may Very true said another it be the stings and not the tails we want news of But think you his lordship will yield them up without gainsaying to us the messengers of the High Parliament now assembled For mine own part said John Croning though I fear it come of the old Adam yet left in me I do count it a sorrowful thing that the earl should be such a vile recusant He never fails with a friendly word or it may be a jest a foolish jest but honest for any one gentle or simple he may meet More than once has he boarded me in that fashion What do you think he said to me now one day as I was a mowin of the grass in the court close by the white horse that spout up the water high as a house from his nose drills Says he to me for he come down the grand staircase and steps out and spies me at the work with my old scythe and come across to me and says he Why Thomas says he not knowin of my name Why Thomas says he you look like old Time himself a mowing of us all down says he For sure my lord says I your lordship reads it aright for all flesh is grass and all the glory of man is as the flower of the field He look humble at that for great man as he be his earthly tabernacle though more than sizeable is but a frail one and that he do know And says he Where did you read that Thomas I am not a larned man please your lordship says I and I cannot honestly say I read it nowheres but I heerd the words from a book your lordship have had news of they do call it the Holy Bible But they tell me that they of your lordship s persuasion like it not You are very much mistaken there Thomas says he I read my Bible most days only not the English Bible which is full of errors but the Latin which is all as God gave it says he And thereby I had not where to answer withal I fear you proved a poor champion of the truth master Croning Confess now Cast down Upstill had he not both sun and wind of me standing so to say on his own hearth stone Had it not been so I could have called hard names with the best of you though that is by rights the gift of the preachers of the truth See how the good master Flowerdew excelleth therein sprinkling them abroad from the watering pot of the gospel Verily when my mind is too feeble to grasp his argument my memory lays fast hold upon the hard names and while I hold by them I have it all in a nutshell Fortified occasionally by a pottle of ale and keeping their spirits constantly stirred by much talking they had been all day occupied in searching the Catholic houses of the neighbourhood for arms What authority they had for it never came to be clearly understood Plainly they believed themselves possessed of all that was needful or such men would never have dared it As it was they prosecuted it with such a bold front that not until they were gone did it occur to some who had yielded what arms they possessed to question whether they had done wisely in acknowledging such fellows as parliamentary officials without demanding their warrant Their day s gleanings up to this point of swords and pikes guns and pistols they had left in charge of the host of the inn whence they had just issued and were now bent on crowning their day s triumph with a supreme act of daring the renown of which they enlarged in their own imaginations while undermining the courage needful for its performance by enhancing its terrors as they went At length two lofty hexagonal towers appeared and the consciousness that the final test of their resolution drew nigh took immediate form in a fluttering at the heart which however gave no outward sign but that of silence and indeed they were still too full of the importance of unaccustomed authority to fear any contempt for it on the part of others It happened that at this moment Raglan Castle was full of merry making upon occasion of the marriage of one of lady Herbert s waiting gentlewomen to an officer of the household and in these festivities the earl of Worcester and all his guests were taking a part Among the numerous members of the household was one who from being a turnspit had risen chiefly in virtue of an immovably lugubrious expression of countenance to be the earl s fool From this peculiarity his fellow servants had given him the nickname of The Hangman but the man himself had chosen the role of a puritan parson as affording the best ground work for the display of a humour suitable to the expression of countenance with which his mother had endowed him That mother was Goody Rees concerning whom as already hinted strange things were whispered In the earlier part of his career the fool had not unfrequently found his mother s reputation a sufficient shelter from persecution and indeed there might have been reason to suppose that it was for her son s sake she encouraged her own evil repute a distinction involving considerable risk seeing the time had not yet arrived when the disbelief in such powers was sufficiently advanced for the safety of those reported to possess them In her turn however she ran a risk somewhat less than ordinary from the fact that her boy was a domestic in the family of one whose eldest son the heir to the earldom lay under a similar suspicion for not a few of the household were far from satisfied that lord Herbert s known occupations in the Yellow Tower were not principally ostensible and that he and his man had nothing to do with the black art or some other of the many regions of occult science in which the ambition after unlawful power may hopefully exercise itself Upon occasion of a family fete merriment was in those days carried further on the part of both masters and servants than in the greatly altered relations and conditions of the present day would be desirable or indeed possible In this instance the fun broke out in the arranging of a mock marriage between Thomas Rees commonly called Tom Fool and a young girl who served under the cook Half the jest lay in the contrast between the long face of the bridegroom both congenitally and wilfully miserable and that of the bride broad as a harvest moon and rosy almost to purple The bridegroom never smiled and spoke with his jaws rather than his lips while the bride seldom uttered a syllable without grinning from ear to ear and displaying a marvellous appointment of huge and brilliant teeth Entering solemnly into the joke Tom expressed himself willing to marry the girl but represented as an insurmountable difficulty that he had no clothes for the occasion Thereupon the earl drawing from his pocket his bunch of keys directed him to go and take what he liked from his wardrobe Now the earl was a man of large circumference and the fool as lank in person as in countenance Tom took the keys and was some time gone during which many conjectures were hazarded as to the style in which he would choose to appear When he re entered the great hall where the company was assembled the roar of laughter which followed his appearance made the glass of its great cupola ring again For not merely was he dressed in the earl s beaver hat and satin cloak splendid with plush and gold and silver lace but he had indued a corresponding suit of his clothes as well even to his silk stockings garters and roses and with the help of many pillows and other such farcing so filled the garments which otherwise had hung upon him like a shawl from a peg and made of himself such a sweet creature of bombast that with ludicrous unlikeness of countenance he bore in figure no distant resemblance to the earl himself Meantime lady Elizabeth had been busy with the scullery maid whom she had attired in a splendid brocade of her grandmother s with all suitable belongings of ruff high collar and lace wings such as Queen Elizabeth is represented with in Oliver s portrait Upon her appearance a few minutes after Tom s the laughter broke out afresh in redoubled peals and the merriment was at its height when the warder of one of the gates entered and whispered in his master s ear the arrival of the bumpkins and their mission announced he informed his lordship with all the importance and dignity they knew how to assume The earl burst into a fresh laugh But presently it quavered a little and ceased while over the amusement still beaming on his countenance gathered a slight shade of anxiety for who could tell what tempest such a mere whirling of straws might not forerun A few words of the warder s had reached Tom where he stood a little aside his solemn countenance radiating disapproval of the tumultuous folly around him He took three strides towards the earl Wherein lieth the new jest he asked with dignity A set of country louts my lord answered the earl are at the gate affirming the right of search in this your lordship s house of Raglan For what Arms my lord And wherefore On what ground On the ground that your lordship is a vile recusant a papist and therefore a traitor no doubt although they use not the word said the earl I shall be round with them said Tom embracing the assumed proportions in front of him and turning to the door Ere the earl had time to conceive his intent he had hurried from the hall followed by fresh shouts of laughter For he had forgotten to stuff himself behind and when the company caught sight of his back as he strode out the tenuity of the foundation for such a huge hill of flesh was absurd as Falstaff s ha p orth of bread to the intolerable deal of sack But the next moment the earl had caught the intended joke and although a trifle concerned about the affair was of too mirth loving a nature to interfere with Tom s project the result of which would doubtless be highly satisfactory at least to those not primarily concerned He instantly called for silence and explained to the assembly what he believed to be Tom Fool s intent and as there was nothing to be seen from the hall the windows of which were at a great height from the floor and Tom s scheme would be fatally imperilled by the visible presence of spectators from some at least of whom gravity of demeanour could not be expected gave hasty instructions to several of his sons and daughters to disperse the company to upper windows having a view of one or the other court for no one could tell where the fool s humour might find its principal arena The next moment in the plain dress of rough brownish cloth which he always wore except upon state occasions he followed the fool to the gate where he found him talking through the wicket grating to the rustics who having passed drawbridge and portcullises of which neither the former had been raised nor the latter lowered for many years now stood on the other side of the gate demanding admittance In the parley Tom Fool was imitating his master s voice and every one of the peculiarities of his speech to perfection addressing them with extreme courtesy as if he took them for gentlemen of no ordinary consideration a point in his conception of his part which he never forgot throughout the whole business To the dismay of his master he was even more than admitting almost boasting that there was an enormous quantity of weapons in the castle sufficient at least to arm ten thousand horsemen a prodigious statement for at the uttermost there was not more than the tenth part of that amount still a somewhat larger provision no doubt than the intruders had expected to find The pseudo earl went on to say that the armoury consisted of one strong room only the door of which was so cunningly concealed and secured that no one but himself knew where it was or if found could open it But such he said was his respect to the will of the most august parliament that he would himself conduct them to the said armoury and deliver over upon the spot into their safe custody the whole mass of weapons to carry away with them And thereupon he proceeded to open the gate By this time the door of the neighbouring guard room was crowded with the heads of eager listeners but the presence of the earl kept them quiet and at a sign from him they drew back ere the men entered The earl himself took a position where he would be covered by the opening wicket Tom received them into bodily presence with the notification that having suspected their object he had sent all his people out of the way in order to avoid the least danger of a broil Bowing to them with the utmost politeness as they entered he requested them to step forward into the court while he closed the wicket behind them but took the opportunity of whispering to one of the men just inside the door of the guardhouse who the moment Tom had led the rustics away approached the earl and told him what he had said What can the rascal mean said the earl to himself but he told the man to carry the fool s message exactly as he had received it and quietly followed Tom and his companions some of whom conceiving fresh importance from the overstrained politeness with which they had been received were now attempting a transformation of their usual loundering gait into a martial stride with the result of a foolish strut very unlike the dignified progress of the sham earl whose weak back roused in them no suspicion and who had taken care they should not see his face Across the paved court and through the hall to the inner court Tom led them and the earl followed The twilight was falling The hall was empty of life and filled with a sombre dusk echoing to every step as they passed through it They did not see the flash of eyes and glimmer of smiles from the minstrel s gallery and the solitude size and gloom had even on their dull natures a palpable influence The whole castle seemed deserted as they followed the false earl across the second court with the true one stealing after them like a knave little imagining that bright eyes were watching them from the curtains of every window like stars from the clear spaces and cloudy edges of heaven To the north west corner of the court he led them and through a sculptured doorway up the straight wide ascent of stone called the grand staircase At the top he turned to the right along a dim corridor from which he entered a suite of bedrooms and dressing rooms over whose black floors he led the trampling hob nailed shoes without pity either for their polish or the labour of the housemaids in restoring it In this way he reached the stair in the bell tower ascending which he brought them into a narrow dark passage ending again in a downward stair at the foot of which they found themselves in the long picture gallery having entered it in the recess of one of its large windows At the other end of the gallery he crossed into the dining room then through an ante chamber entered the drawing room where the ladies apprised of their approach kept still behind curtains and high chairs until they had passed through on their way to cross the archway of the main entrance and through the library gain the region of household economy and cookery Thither I will not drag my reader after them Indeed the earl who had been dogging them like a Fate ever emerging on their track but never beheld had already began to pay his part of the penalty of the joke in fatigue for he was not only unwieldy in person but far from robust being very subject to gout He owed his good spirits to a noble nature and not to animal well being When they crossed from the picture gallery to the dining room he went down the stair between and into the oak parlour adjoining the great hall There he threw himself into an easy chair which always stood for him in the great bay window looking over the moat to the huge keep of the castle and commanding through its western light the stone bridge which crossed it There he lay back at his ease and instructed by the message Tom had committed to the serjeant of the guard waited the result As for his double he went stalking on in front of his victims never turning to show his face he knew they would follow were it but for the fear of being left alone Close behind him they kept scarce daring to whisper from growing awe of the vast place The fumes of the beer had by this time evaporated and the heavy obscurity which pervaded the whole building enhanced their growing apprehensions On and on the fool led them up and down going and returning but ever in new tracks for the marvellous old place was interminably burrowed with connecting passages and communications of every sort some of them the merest ducts which had to be all but crept through and which would have certainly arrested the progress of the earl had he followed so far no one about the place understood its crenkles so well as Tom For the greater part of an hour he led them thus until having been on their legs the whole day they were thoroughly wearied as well as awe struck At length in a gloomy chamber where one could not see the face of another the pseudo earl turned full upon them and said in his most solemn tones Arrived thus far my masters it is borne in upon me with rebuke that before undertaking to guide you to the armoury I should have acquainted you with the strange fact that at times I am myself unable to find the place of which we are in search and I begin to fear it is so now and that we are at this moment the sport of a certain member of my family of whom it may be your worships have heard things not more strange than true Against his machinations I am powerless All that is left us is to go to him and entreat him to unsay his spells A confused murmur of objections arose Then your worships will remain here while I go to the Yellow Tower and come to you again said the mock earl making as if he would leave them But they crowded round him with earnest refusals to be abandoned for in their very souls they felt the fact that they were upon enchanted ground and in the dark Then follow me he said and conducted them into the open air of the inner court almost opposite the archway in its buildings leading to the stone bridge whose gothic structure bestrid the moat of the keep For Raglan Castle had this peculiarity that its keep was surrounded by a moat of its own separating it from the rest of the castle so that save by bridge no one within any more than without the walls could reach it On to the bridge Tom led the way followed by his dupes now full in the view of the earl where he sat in his parlour window When they had reached the centre of it however and glancing up at the awful bulk of stone towering above them its walls strangely dented and furrowed so as to such as they might well suggest frightful means to wicked ends they stood stock still refusing to go a step further while their chief speaker Upstill emboldened by anger fear and the meek behaviour of the supposed earl broke out in a torrent of arrogance wherein his intention was to brandish the terrors of the High Parliament over the heads of his lordship of Worcester and all recusants He had not got far however before a shrill whistle pierced the air and the next instant arose a chaos of horrible appalling and harrowing noises such a roaring in the words of their own report of the matter to the reverend master Flowerdew as if the mouth of hell had been wide open and all the devils conjured up doubtless they meant by the arts of the wizard whose dwelling was that same tower of fearful fame before which they now stood The skin contracting chill of terror uplifted their hair The mystery that enveloped the origin of the sounds gave them an unearthliness which froze the very fountains of their life and rendered them incapable even of motion They stared at each other with a ghastly observance which descried no comfort only like images of horror Man s hand is not able to taste how long they might have thus stood nor his tongue to conceive what the consequences might have been had not a more healthy terror presently supervened Across the tumult of sounds like a fiercer flash through the flames of a furnace shot a hideous long drawn yell and the same instant came a man running at full speed through the archway from the court casting terror stricken glances behind him and shouting with a voice half choked to a shriek Look to yourselves my masters the lions are got loose All the world knew that ever since King James had set the fashion by taking so much pleasure in the lions at the Tower strange beasts had been kept in the castle of Raglan The new terror broke the spell of the old and the parliamentary commissioners fled But which was the way from the castle Which the path to the lions den In an agony of horrible dread they rushed hither and thither about the court where now the white horse as steady as marble should be when first they crossed it was to their excited vision prancing wildly about the great basin from whose charmed circle he could not break foaming at the mouth and casting huge water jets from his nostrils into the perturbed air while from the surface of the moat a great column of water shot up nearly as high as the citadel whose return into the moat was like a tempest and with all the elemental tumult was mingled the howling of wild beasts The doors of the hall and the gates to the bowling green being shut the poor wretches could not find their way out of the court but ran from door to door like madmen only to find all closed against them From every window around the court from the apartments of the waiting gentlewomen from the picture gallery from the officers rooms eager and merry eyes looked down on the spot themselves unseen and unsuspected for all voices were hushed and for anything the bumpkins heard or saw they might have been in a place deserted of men and possessed only by evil spirits whose pranks were now tormenting them At last Upstill who had fallen on the bridge at his first start and had ever since been rushing about with a limp and a leap alternated managed to open the door of the hall and its eastern door having been left open shot across and into the outer court where he made for the gate followed at varied distance by the rest of the routed commissioners of search as each had discovered the way his forerunner fled With trembling hands Upstill raised the latch of the wicket and to his delight found it unlocked He darted through passed the twin portcullises and was presently thundering over the draw bridge which trembling under his heavy steps seemed on the point of rising to heave him back into the jaws of the lion or worse still the clutches of the enchanter Not one looked behind him not even when having passed through the white stone gate also purposely left open for their escape and rattled down the multitude of steps that told how deep was the moat they had just crossed where the last of them nearly broke his neck by rolling almost from top to bottom they reached the outermost the brick gate and so left the awful region of enchantment and feline fury commingled Not until the castle was out of sight and their leader had sunk senseless on the turf by the roadside did they dare a backward look The moment he came to himself they started again for home at what poor speed they could make and reached the Crown and Mitre in sad plight where however they found some compensation in the pleasure of setting forth their adventures with the heroic manner in which although vanquished by the irresistible force of enchantment they had yet brought off their forces without the loss of a single man Their story spread over the country enlarged and embellished at every fresh stage in its progress When the tale reached mother Rees it filled her with fresh awe of the great magician the renowned lord Herbert She little thought the whole affair was a jest of her own son s Firmly believing in all kinds of magic and witchcraft but as innocent of conscious dealing with the powers of ill as the whitest winged angel betwixt earth s garret and heaven s threshold she owed her evil repute amongst her neighbours to a rare therapeutic faculty accompanied by a keen sympathetic instinct which greatly sharpened her powers of observation in the quest after what was amiss while her touch was so delicate so informed with present mind and came therefore into such rapport with any living organism the secret of whose suffering it sought to discover that sprained muscles dislocated joints and broken bones seemed at its soft approach to re arrange their disturbed parts and yield to the power of her composing will as to a re ordering harmony Add to this that she understood more of the virtues of some herbs than any doctor in the parish which in the condition of general practice at the time is not perhaps to say much and that she firmly believed in the might of certain charms and occasionally used them and I have given reason enough why while regarded by all with disapprobation she should be by many both courted and feared For her own part she had a leaning to the puritans chiefly from respect to the memory of a good hearted weak but intellectually gifted and therefore admired husband but the ridicule of her yet more gifted son had a good deal shaken this predilection so that she now spent what powers of discrimination and choice she possessed solely upon persons heedless of principles in themselves and regarding them only in their vital results Hence it was a matter of absolute indifference to her which of the parties now dividing the country was in the right or which should lose which win provided no personal evil befel the men or women for whom she cherished a preference Like many another she was hardly aware of the jurisdiction of conscience save in respect of immediate personal relations CHAPTER V ANIMADVERSIONS From the time when the conversation recorded had in some measure dispelled the fog between them Roger and Richard Heywood drew rapidly nearer to each other The father had been but waiting until his son should begin to ask him questions for watchfulness of himself and others had taught him how useless information is to those who have not first desired it how poor in influence how soon forgotten and now that the fitting condition had presented itself he was ready with less of reserve than in the relation between them was common amongst the puritans he began to pour his very soul into that of his son All his influence went with that party which holding that the natural flow of the reformation of the church from popery had stagnated in episcopacy consisted chiefly of those who in demanding the overthrow of that form of church government sought to substitute for it what they called presbyterianism but mister Heywood belonged to another division of it which although less influential at present was destined to come by and by to the front in the strength of the conviction that to stop with presbyterianism was merely to change the name of the swamp a party whose distinctive and animating spirit was the love of freedom which indeed degenerating into a passion among its inferior members broke out upon occasion in the wildest vagaries of speech and doctrine but on the other hand justified itself in its leaders chief amongst whom were Milton and Cromwell inasmuch as they accorded to the consciences of others the freedom they demanded for their own the love of liberty with them not meaning merely the love of enjoying freedom but that respect for the thing itself which renders a man incapable of violating it in another Roger Heywood was in fact already a pupil of Milton whose anonymous pamphlet of Reformation touching Church Discipline had already reached him and opened with him the way for all his following works Richard with whom my story has really to do but for the understanding of whom it is necessary that the character and mental position of his father should in some measure be set forth proved an apt pupil and was soon possessed with such a passion for justice and liberty as embodied in the political doctrines now presented for his acceptance that it was impossible for him to understand how any honest man could be of a different mind No youth indeed of simple and noble nature as yet unmarred by any dominant phase of selfishness could have failed to catch fire from the enthusiasm of such a father an enthusiasm glowing yet restrained wherein party spirit had a less share than principle which in relation to such a time is to say much Richard s heart swelled within him at the vistas of grandeur opened by his father s words and swelled yet higher when he read to him passages from the pamphlet to which I have referred It seemed to him as to most young people under mental excitement that he had but to tell the facts of the case to draw all men to his side enlisting them in the army destined to sweep every form of tyranny and especially spiritual usurpation and arrogance from the face of the earth Being one who took everybody at the spoken word Richard never thought of seeking Dorothy again at their former place of meeting Nor in the new enthusiasm born in him did his thoughts for a good many days turn to her so often or dwell so much upon her as to cause any keen sense of their separation The flood of new thoughts and feelings had transported him beyond the ignorant present In truth also he was a little angry with Dorothy for showing a foolish preference for the church party so plainly in the wrong was it And what could SHE know about the question by his indifference to which she had been so scandalised but to which he had been indifferent only until rightly informed thereon If he had ever given her just cause to think him childish certainly she should never apply the word to him again If he could but see her he would soon convince her indeed he MUST see her for the truth was not his to keep but to share It was his duty to acquaint her with the fact that the parliament was the army of God fighting the great red dragon one of whose seven heads was prelacy the horn upon it the king and Laud its crown He wanted a stroll he would take the path through the woods and the shrubbery to the old sun dial She would not be there of course but he would walk up the pleached alley and call at the house Reasoning thus within himself one day he rose and went But as he approached the wood Dorothy s great mastiff which she had reared from a pup with her own hand came leaping out to welcome him and he was prepared to find her not far off When he entered the yew circle there she stood leaning on the dial as if like old Time she too had gone to sleep there and was dreaming ancient dreams over again She did not move at the first sounds of his approach and when at length as he stood silent by her side she lifted her head but without looking at him he saw the traces of tears on her cheeks The heart of the youth smote him Weeping Dorothy he said Yes she answered simply I trust I am not the cause of your trouble Dorothy You returned the girl quickly and the colour rushed to her pale cheeks No indeed How should you trouble me My mother is ill Considering his age Richard was not much given to vanity and it was something better that prevented him from feeling pleased at being thus exonerated she looked so sweet and sad that the love which new interests had placed in abeyance returned in full tide Even when a child he had scarcely ever seen her in tears it was to him a new aspect of her being Dear Dorothy he said I am very much grieved to learn this of your beautiful mother She IS beautiful responded the girl and her voice was softer than he had ever heard it before but she will die and I shall be left alone No Dorothy that you shall never be exclaimed Richard with a confidence bordering on presumption Master Herbert is with her now resumed Dorothy heedless of his words You do not mean her life is even now in danger said Richard in a tone of sudden awe I hope not but indeed I cannot tell I left master Herbert comforting her with the assurance that she was taken away from the evil to come And I trust madam the dear old man went on to say that my departure will not long be delayed for darkness will cover the earth and gross darkness the people Those were his very words Nay nay said Richard hastily the good man is deceived the people that sit in darkness shall see a great light The girl looked at him with strange interrogation Do not be angry sweet Dorothy Richard went on Old men may mistake as well as youths As for the realm of England the sun of righteousness will speedily arise thereon for the dawn draws nigh and master Herbert may be just as far deceived concerning your mother s condition for she has been but sickly for a long time and yet has survived many winters Dorothy looked at him still and was silent At length she spoke and her words came slowly and with weight And what prophet s mantle if I may make so bold has fallen upon Richard Heywood that the word in his mouth should outweigh that of an aged servant of the church Can it be that the great light of which he speaks is Richard Heywood himself As master Herbert is a good man and a servant of God said Richard coldly stung by her sarcasm but not choosing to reply to it his word weighs mightily but as a servant of the church his word is no weightier than my father s who is also a minister of the true tabernacle that wherein all who are kings over themselves are priests unto God though truly he pretends to no prophecy beyond the understanding of the signs of the times Dorothy saw that a wonderful change such as had been incredible upon any but the witness of her own eyes and ears had passed on her old playmate He was in truth a boy no longer Their relative position was no more what she had been of late accustomed to consider it But with the change a gulf had begun to yawn between them Alas Richard she said mistaking what he meant by the signs of the times those who arrogate the gift of the Holy Ghost while their sole inspiration is the presumption of their own hearts and an overweening contempt of authority may well mistake signs of their own causing for signs from heaven I but repeat the very words of good master Herbert I thought such swelling words hardly sounded like your own Dorothy But tell me why should the persuasion of man or woman hang upon the words of a fellow mortal Is not the gift of the Spirit free to each who asks it And are we not told that each must be fully persuaded in his own mind Nay Richard now I have thee Hang you not by the word of your father who is one and despise the authority of the true church which is many The true church were indeed an authority but where shall we find it Anyhow the true church is one thing and prelatical episcopacy another But I have yet to learn what authority even the true church could have over a man s conscience You need to be reminded Richard that the Lord of the church gave power to his apostles to bind or loose I do not need to be so reminded Dorothy but I do not need to be shown first that that power was over men s consciences and second that it was transmitted to others by the apostles waiving the question as to the doubtful ordination of English prelates Fire flashed from Dorothy s eyes Richard Heywood she said the demon of spiritual pride has already entered into you and blown you up with a self sufficiency which I never saw in you before or I would never never have companied with you as I am now ashamed to think I have done so long even to the danger of my soul s health In that case I may comfort myself mistress Dorothy Vaughan said Richard that you will no longer count me a boy But do you then no longer desire that I should take one part OR the other and show myself a man Am I man enough yet for the woman thou art Dorothy But Dorothy he added with sudden change of tone for she had in anger turned to leave him I love you dearly and I am truly sorry if I have spoken so as to offend you I came hither eager to share with you the great things I have learned since you left me with just contempt a fortnight ago Then it is I whose foolish words have cast you into the seat of the scorner Alas alas my poor Richard Never never more while you thus rebel against authority and revile sacred things will I hold counsel with you And again she turned to go Dorothy cried the youth turning pale with agony to find on the brink of what an abyss of loss his zeal had set him wilt thou then never speak to me more and I love thee as the daylight Never more till thou repent and turn I will but give thee one piece of counsel and then leave thee if for ever that rests with thee There has lately appeared like the frog out of the mouth of the dragon a certain tractate or treatise small in bulk but large with the wind of evil doctrine Doubtless it will reach your father s house ere long if it be not as is more likely already there for it is the vile work of one they call a puritan though where even the writer can vainly imagine the purity of such work to lie let the pamphlet itself raise the question Read the evil thing or I will not say read it but glance the eye over it It is styled Animadversions upon Truly I cannot recall the long drawn title It is filled even as a toad with poison so full of evil and scurrilous sayings against good men rating and abusing them as the very off scouring of the earth that you cannot yet be so far gone in evil as not to be reclaimed by seeing whither such men and their inspiration would lead you Farewell Richard With the words and without a look Dorothy who had been standing sideways in act to go swept up the pleached alley her step so stately and her head so high that Richard slowly as she walked away dared not follow her but stood like one forbid When she had vanished and the light shone in full at the far end he gave a great sigh and turned away and the old dial was forsaken The scrap of title Dorothy had given was enough to enable Richard to recognise the pamphlet as one a copy of which his father had received only a few days before and over the reading of which they had again and again laughed unrestrainedly As he walked home he sought in vain to recall anything in it deserving of such reprobation as Dorothy had branded it withal Had it been written on the other side no search would have been necessary for party spirit from which how could such a youth be free when the greatest men of his time were deeply tainted while it blinds the eyes in one direction makes them doubly keen in another As it was the abuse in the pamphlet referred to appeared to him only warrantable indignation and the arrogance of an imperfect love leading him to utter desertion of his newly adopted principles he scorned as presumptuous that exercise of her own judgment on the part of Dorothy which had led to their separation bitterly resenting the change in his playmate who now an angry woman had decreed his degradation from the commonest privileges of friendship until such time as he should abjure his convictions become a renegade to the truth and abandon the hope of resulting freedom which the strife of parties held out an act of tyranny the reflection upon which raised such a swelling in his throat as he had never felt but once before when a favourite foal got staked in trying to clear a fence Having neither friend nor sister to whom to confess that he was in trouble have confided it he could not in any case seeing it involved blame of the woman his love for whom now first when on the point of losing her for ever threatened to overmaster him he wandered to the stables which he found empty of men and nearly so of horses half involuntarily sought the stall of the mare his father had given him on his last birthday laid his head on the neck bent round to greet him and sighed a sore response to her soft low tremulous whinny As he stood thus overcome by the bitter sense of wrong from the one he loved best in the world something darkened the stable door and a voice he knew reached his ear Mistaking the head she saw across an empty stall for that of one of the farm servants Goody Rees was calling aloud to know if he wanted a charm for the toothache Richard looked up And what may your charm be mistress Rees he asked Aha is it thou young master returned the woman Thou wilt marvel to see me about the place so soon again but verily desired to know how that godly man Faithful Stopchase found himself after his fall Nay mistress Rees make no apology for coming amongst thy friends I warrant thee against further rudeness of man or beast I have taken them to task and truly I will break his head who wags tongue against thee As for Stopchase he does well enough in all except owing thee thanks which he declines to pay But for thy charm good mistress Rees what is it tell me She took a step inside the door sent her small eyes peering first into every corner her sight could reach and then said Are we alone we two master Richard There s a cat in the next stall mistress if she can hear she can t speak Don t be too sure of that master Richard Be there no one else Not a body soul there may be who knows I know there is none I will tell thee my charm or what else I may that thou would wish to know for he is a true gentleman who will help a woman because she is a woman be she as old and ugly as Goody Rees herself Hearken my pretty sir it is the tooth of a corpse drawn after he hath lain a se en night in the mould wilt buy my master Or did not I see thee now asking comfort from thy horse for the She paused a moment peered narrowly at him from under lowered eyebrows and went on heartache eh master Richard Old eyes can see through velvet doublets All the world knows yours can see farther than other people s returned Richard Heaven knows whence they have their sharpness But suppose it were a heartache now have you got e er a charm to cure that The best of all charms my young master is a kiss from the maiden and what would thou give me for the spell that should set her by thy side at the old dial under a warm harvest moon all the long hours twixt midnight and the crowing of the black cock eh my master What wilt thou give me Not a brass farthing if she came not of her own good will murmured Richard turning towards his mare But come mistress Rees you know you couldn t do it even if you were the black witch the neighbours would have you though I for my part will not hear a word against you never since you set my poor old dog upon his legs again though to be sure he will die one of these days and that no one can help dogs have such short lives poor fools Thou knows not what old mother Rees can do Tell me young master did she ever say and not do eh now You said you would cure my dog and you did answered Richard And I say now if thou will I will set thee and her together by the old dial to morrow night and it shall be a warm and moonlit night on purpose for ye an ye will It were to no good purpose mistress Rees for we parted this day and that for ever I much fear me said Richard with a deep sigh but getting some little comfort even out of a witch s sympathy Tut tut tut Lovers quarrels Who knows not what they mean Crying and kissing crying and kissing that s what they mean Come now what did thou and she quarrel about The old woman if not a witch at least looked very like one with her two hands resting on the wide round ledge of her farthingale her head thrown back and from under her peaked hat that pointed away behind her two greenish eyes peering with a half coaxing yet sharp and probing gaze into those of the youth But how could he make a confidante of one like her What could she understand of such questions as had raised the wall of partition betwixt him and Dorothy Unwilling to offend her however he hesitated to give her offer a plain refusal and turning away in silence affected to have caught sight of something suspicious about his mare s near hock I see I see said the old woman grimly but not ill naturedly and nodded her head so that her hat described great arcs across the sky thou art ashamed to confess that thou lovest thy father s whims more than thy lady s favours Well well Such lovers are hardly for my trouble But here came the voice of mister Heywood calling his groom She started glanced around her as if seeking a covert then peered from the door and glided noiselessly out CHAPTER VI PREPARATIONS 
2589_22581_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Great was the merriment in Raglan Castle over the discomfiture of the bumpkins and many were the compliments Tom received in parlour nursery kitchen guard room everywhere on the success of his hastily formed scheme for the chastisement of their presumption 
2589_22581_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The household had looked for a merry time on the occasion of the wedding but had not expected such a full cup of delight as had been pressed out for them betwixt the self importance of the overweening yokels and the inventive faculties of Tom Fool 
none	none	All the evening one standing in any open spot of the castle might have heard now on the one now on the other side renewed bursts of merriment ripple the air but as the still autumn night crept on the intervals between grew longer and longer until at length all sounds ceased and silence took up her ancient reign broken only by the occasional stamp of a horse or howl of a watch dog But the earl who from simplicity of nature and peace of conscience combined was perhaps better fitted for the enjoyment of the joke in a time when such ludifications were not yet considered unsuitable to the dignity of the highest position than any other member of his household had through it all showed a countenance in which although eyes lips and voice shared in the laughter there yet lurked a thoughtful doubt concerning the result 
2589_22581_000004_000001	train-clean-360	For he knew that in some shape or other and that certainly not the true one the affair would be spread over the country where now prejudice against the Catholics was strong and dangerous in proportion to the unreason of those who cherished it 
2589_22581_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Now also it was becoming pretty plain that except the king yielded every prerogative and became the puppet which the mingled pride and apprehension of the Parliament would have him their differences must ere long be referred to the arbitration of the sword in which case there was no shadow of doubt in the mind of the earl as to the part befitting a peer of the realm 
2589_22581_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The king was a protestant but no less the king and not this man but his parents had sinned in forsaking the church of which sin their offspring had now to bear the penalty reaping the whirlwind sprung from the stormy seeds by them sown 
2589_22581_000004_000004	train-clean-360	For what were the puritans but the lawfully begotten children of the so called reformation whose spirit they inherited and in whose footsteps they so closely followed 
2589_22581_000004_000005	train-clean-360	In the midst of such reflections dawned slowly in the mind of the devout old man the enchanting hope that perhaps he might be made the messenger of God to lead back to the true fold the wandering feet of his king 
2589_22581_000004_000006	train-clean-360	But fail or speed in any result so long as his castle held together it should stand for the king 
2589_22581_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Faithful catholic as he was the brave old man was English to the backbone 
none	none	And there was no time to lose 
2589_22581_000005_000001	train-clean-360	This visit of search let it have originated how it might and be as despicable in itself as it was ludicrous in its result showed but too clearly how strong the current of popular feeling was setting against all the mounds of social distinction and not kingly prerogative alone 
2589_22581_000005_000002	train-clean-360	What preparations might be needful must be prudent 
none	none	That same night then long after the rest of the household had retired three men took advantage of a fine half moon to make a circuit of the castle first along the counterscarp of the moat and next along all accessible portions of the walls and battlements They halted often and with much observation of the defences held earnest talk together sometimes eagerly contending rather than disputing but far more often mutually suggesting and agreeing 
2589_22581_000006_000001	train-clean-360	At length one of them whom the others called Caspar retired and the earl was left with his son Edward lord Herbert the only person in the castle who had gone to neither window nor door to delight himself with the discomfiture of the parliamentary commissioners 
2589_22581_000007_000000	train-clean-360	They entered the long picture gallery faintly lighted from its large windows to the court but chiefly from the oriel which formed the northern end of it where they now sat down the earl being for the second time that night weary 
2589_22581_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Behind them was a long dim line of portraits broken only by the great chimney piece supported by human figures all of carved stone and before them nearly as dim was the moon massed landscape a lovely view of the woodland pasture and red tilth to the northward of the castle 
2589_22581_000008_000000	train-clean-360	They sat silent for a while and the younger said 
2589_22581_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear you are fatigued my lord 
2589_22581_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It is late for you to be out of bed nature is mortal 
none	none	Thou sayest well nature is mortal my son 
2589_22581_000010_000001	train-clean-360	But therein lies the comfort it cannot last 
none	none	It were hard to say whether of the two houses stands the more in need of the hand of the maker
2589_22581_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Were it not for villanous saltpetre my lord the castle would hold out well enough 
none	none	And were it not for villanous gout which is a traitor within it I see not why this other should not hold out as long 
2589_22581_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Be sure Herbert I shall not render the keep for the taking of the outworks 
none	none	I fear said his son wishing to change the subject this part where we now are is the most liable to hurt from artillery Yes but the ground in front is not such as they would readiest plant it upon said the earl
2589_22581_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Do not let us forecast evil only prepare for it 
none	none	We shall do our best my lord with your lordship s good counsel to guide us
2589_22581_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 You shall lack nothing Herbert that either counsel or purse of mine may reach unto 
2589_22581_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I thank your lordship for much depends upon both 
2589_22581_000017_000001	train-clean-360	And so I fear will his majesty find if it conies to the worst 
2589_22581_000018_000000	train-clean-360	A brief pause followed 
none	none	Thinkest thou not Herbert said the earl slowly and thoughtfully it ill suits that a subject should have and to spare and his liege go begging
2589_22581_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 My father is pleased to say so 
none	none	I am but evil pleased to say so 
2589_22581_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Bethink thee son what man can be pleased to part with his money 
2589_22581_000021_000002	train-clean-360	And while my king is poor I must be rich for him 
none	none	Thou wilt not accuse me Herbert after I am gone to the rest that I wasted thy substance lad
2589_22581_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 So long as you still keep wherewithal to give I shall be content my lord 
none	none	Well time will show I but tell thee what runneth in my mind for thou and I Herbert have bosomed no secrets 
2589_22581_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I will to bed 
2589_22581_000023_000003	train-clean-360	We must go the round again to morrow with the sun to hold as a candle 
2589_22581_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The next day the same party made a similar circuit three times in the morning at noon and in the evening that the full light might uncover what the shadows had hid and that the shadows might show what a perpendicular light could not reveal 
none	none	There is all the difference as to discovery whether a thing is lying under the shadow of another or casting one of its own 
2589_22581_000025_000000	train-clean-360	After this came a review of the outer fortifications if indeed they were worthy of the name enclosing the gardens the old tilting yard now used as a bowling green the home farmyard and other such outlying portions under the stewardship of sir Ralph Blackstone and the governorship of Charles Somerset the earl s youngest son 
2589_22581_000025_000001	train-clean-360	It was here that the most was wanted and the next few days were chiefly spent in surveying these works and drawing plans for their extension strengthening and connection especially about the stables armourer s shop and smithy where the building of new defences was almost immediately set on foot 
none	none	A thorough examination of the machinery of the various portcullises and drawbridges followed next an overhauling of the bolts chains and other defences of the gates Then came an inspection of the ordnance from cannons down to drakes through a gradation of names as uncouth to our ears and as unknown to the artillery descended from them as many of the Christian names of the puritans are to their descendants of the present day 
2589_22581_000026_000002	train-clean-360	At length to conclude the inspection lord Herbert and the master of the armoury held consultation with the head armourer and the mighty accumulation of weapons of all sorts was passed under the most rigid scrutiny many of them were sent to the forge and others carried to the ground floor of the keep 
none	none	Presently things began to look busy in a quiet way about the place Men were at work blasting the rocks in a quarry not far off whence laden carts went creeping to the castle but this was oftener in the night 
2589_22581_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Some of them drove into the paved court for here and there a buttress was wanted inside and of the battlements not a few were weather beaten and out of repair 
none	none	These the earl would have let alone on the ground that they were no longer more than ornamental and therefore had better be repaired AFTER the siege if such should befall for the big guns would knock them about like cards but Caspar reminded him that every time the ball from a cannon culvering or saker missed the parapet it remained a sufficient bar to the bullet that might equally avail to carry off the defenceless gunner 
2589_22581_000027_000003	train-clean-360	The earl however although he yielded maintained that the flying of the wall when struck was a more than counterbalancing danger 
2589_22581_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The stock of provisions began to increase 
2589_22581_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The dry larder which lay under the court between the kitchen and buttery was by degrees filled with gammons and flitches of bacon well dried and smoked Wheat barley oats and pease were stored in the granary and potatoes in a pit dug in the orchard 
2589_22581_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Strange faces in the guard room caused wonderings and questions amongst the women 
none	none	The stables began to fill with horses and more man to go about the farmyard and outhouses CHAPTER VII REFLECTIONS Left alone with Lady his mare Richard could not help brooding rather than pondering over what the old woman had said Not that for a moment he contemplated as a possibility the acceptance of the witch s offer To come himself into any such close relations with her as that would imply was in repulsiveness second only to the idea of subjecting Dorothy to her influences For something to occupy his hands that his mind might be restless at will he gave his mare a careful currying then an extra feed of oats and then a gallop after which it was time to go to bed I doubt if anything but the consciousness of crime will keep healthy youth awake and as such consciousness is generally far from it youth seldom counts the watches of the night Richard soon fell fast asleep and dreamed that his patron saint alas for his protestantism appeared to him handed him a lance headed with a single flashing diamond and told him to go and therewith kill the dragon But just as he was asking the way to the dragon s den that he might perform his behest the saint vanished and feeling the lance melting away in his grasp he gradually woke to find it gone After a long talk with his father in the study he was left to his own resources for the remainder of the day and as it passed and the night drew on the offer of the witch kept growing upon his imagination and his longing to see Dorothy became stronger and stronger until at last it was almost too intense to be borne He had never before known such a possession and was more than half inclined to attribute it to the arts of mother Rees His father was busy in his study below writing letters an employment which now occupied much of his time and Richard sat alone in a chamber in the upper part of one of the many gables of the house which he had occupied longer than he could remember Its one small projecting lozenge paned window looked towards Dorothy s home Some years ago he had been able to see her window from it through a gap in the trees by favour of which indeed they had indulged in a system of communications by means of coloured flags so satisfactory that Dorothy not only pressed into the service all the old frocks she could find but got into trouble by cutting up one almost new for the enlargement of the somewhat limited scope of their telegraphy In this window he now sat sending his soul through the darkness milky with the clouded light of half an old moon towards the ancient sun dial where Time stood so still that sometimes Richard had known an hour there pass in a moment Never until now had he felt enmity in space it had been hitherto rather as a bridge to bear him to Dorothy than a gulf to divide him from her presence but now through the interpenetrative power of feeling their alienation had affected all around as well as within him and space appeared as a solid enemy and darkness as an unfriendly enchantress each doing what it could to separate betwixt him and the being to whom his soul was drawn as no there was no AS for such drawing No opposition of mere circumstances could have created the feeling it was the sense of an inward separation taking form outwardly For Richard was now but too well convinced that he had no power of persuasion equal to the task of making Dorothy see things as he saw them The dividing influence of imperfect opposing goods is potent as that of warring good and evil with this important difference that the former is but for a season and will one day bind as strongly as it parted while the latter is essential absolute impassible eternal To Dorothy Richard seemed guilty of overweening arrogance and its attendant presumption she could not see the form ethereal to which he bowed To Richard Dorothy appeared the dupe of superstition he could not see the god that dwelt within the idol To Dorothy Richard seemed to be one who gave the holy name of truth to nothing but the offspring of his own vain fancy To Richard Dorothy appeared one who so little loved the truth that she was ready to accept anything presented to her as such by those who themselves loved the word more than the spirit and the chrysalis of safety better than the wings of power But it is only for a time that any good can to the good appear evil and at this very moment Nature who in her blindness is stronger to bind than the farthest seeing intellect to loose was urging him into her presence and the heart of Dorothy notwithstanding her initiative in the separation was leaning as lovingly as sadly after the youth she had left alone with the defaced sun dial the symbol of Time s weariness Had they however been permitted to meet as they would the natural result of ever renewed dissension would have been a thorough separation in heart no heavenly twilights of loneliness giving time for the love which grows like the grass to recover from the scorching heat of intellectual jar and friction The waning moon at length peered warily from behind a bank of cloud and her dim light melting through the darkness filled the night with a dream of the day Richard was no more of a poet or dreamer of dreams than is any honest youth so long as love holds the bandage of custom away from his eyes The poets are they who all their life long contrive to see over or through the bandage but they would I doubt have but few readers had not nature decreed that all youths and maidens shall for a period be it long or short become aware that they too are of the race of the singers shall in the journey of their life at least pass through the zone of song some of them recognise it as the region of truth and continue to believe in it still when it seems to have vanished from around them others scoff as it disappears and curse themselves for dupes Through this zone Richard was now passing Hence the moon wore to him a sorrowful face and he felt a vague sympathy in her regard that of one who was herself in trouble half the light of her lord s countenance withdrawn For science had not for him interfered with the shows of things by a partial revelation of their realities He had not learned that the face of the moon is the face of a corpse world that the sadness upon it is the sadness of utter loss that her light has in it no dissolved smile is but the reflex from a lifeless mirror that of all the orbs we know best she can have least to do with lovers longings and losses she alone having no love left in her the cold cinder of a quenched world Not an out burnt cinder though she needs but to be cast again into the furnace of the sun As it was Richard had gazed at her hardly for a minute when he found the tears running down his face and starting up ashamed of the unmanly weakness hardly knew what he was doing before he found himself in the open air From the hall clock came the first stroke of twelve as he closed the door behind him It was the hour at which mother Rees had offered him a meeting with Dorothy but it was assuredly with no expectation of seeing her that he turned his steps towards her dwelling CHAPTER VIII AN ADVENTURE When he reached the spot at which he usually turned off by a gap in the hedge to NEEDLE his way through the unpathed wood he yielded to the impulses of memory and habit and sought the yew circle where for some moments he stood by the dumb disfeatured stone which seemed to slumber in the moonlight a monument slowly vanishing from above a vanished grave Indeed it might well have been the grave of buried Time for what fitter monument could he have than a mutilated sun dial what better enclosure than such a hedge of yews and more suitable light than that of the dying moon Or was it but that the heart of the youth receiving these things as into a concave mirror reprojected them into space all shadowy with its own ghostliness and gloom Close by the dial like the dark way into regions where time is not yawned the mouth of the pleached alley Beyond that was her window on which the moon must now be shining He entered the alley and walked softly towards the house Suddenly down the dark tunnel came rushing upon him Dorothy s mastiff with a noise as of twenty soft feet and a growl as if his throat had been full of teeth changing to a boisterous welcome when he discovered who the stranger was Fearful of disturbing the household Richard soon quieted the dog which was in the habit of obeying him almost as readily as his mistress and fearful of disturbing sleepers or watchers approached the house like a thief To gain a sight of Dorothy s window he had to pass that of the parlour and then the porch which he did on the grass that his steps might be noiseless But here the dog started from his heel and bounded into the porch leading after him the eyes of Richard who thereupon saw what would have else remained undiscovered two figures namely standing in its deep shadow Judging it his part as a friend of the family to see who at so late an hour and so near the house seemed thus to avoid discovery Richard drew nearer and the next moment saw that the door was open behind them and that they were Dorothy and a young man The gates will be shut said Dorothy It is no matter old Eccles will open to me at any hour was the answer Still it were well you went without delay said Dorothy and her voice trembled a little for she had caught sight of Richard Now not only are anger and stupidity near of kin but when a man whose mental movements are naturally deliberate is suddenly spurred he is in great danger of acting like a fool and Richard did act like a fool He strode up to the entrance of the porch and said Do you not hear the lady sir She tells you to go A voice as cool and self possessed as the other was hasty and perturbed replied I am much in the wrong sir if the lady do not turn the command upon yourself Until you have obeyed it she may perhaps see reason for withdrawing it in respect of me Richard stepped into the porch but Dorothy glided between them and gently pushed him out Richard Heywood she said Whew interjected the stranger softly You can claim no right she went on to be here at this hour Pray go you will disturb my mother Who is this man then whose right seems acknowledged asked Richard in ill suppressed fury When you address me like a gentleman such as I used to believe you May I presume to ask when you ceased to regard me as a gentleman mistress Dorothy As soon as I found that you had learned to despise law and religion answered the girl Such a one will hardly succeed in acting the part of a gentleman even had he the blood of the Somersets in his veins I thank you mistress Dorothy said the stranger and will profit by the plain hint Once more tell me to go and I will obey He must go first returned Dorothy Richard had been standing as if stunned but now with an effort recovered himself I will wait for you he said and turned away For whom sir asked Dorothy indignantly You have refused me the gentleman s name answered Richard perhaps I may have the good fortune to persuade himself to be more obliging I shall not keep you waiting long said the young man significantly as Richard walked away To do Richard justice and greatly he needs it I must make the remark that such had been the intimacy betwixt him and Dorothy that he might well imagine himself acquainted with all the friends of her house But the intimacy had been confined to the children the heads of the two houses although good neighbours had not been drawn towards each other and their mutual respect had not ripened into friendship Hence many of the family and social relations of each were unknown to the other and indeed both families led such a retired life that the children knew little of their own relatives even and seldom spoke of any Lady Scudamore the mother of the stranger was first cousin to lady Vaughan They had been very intimate as girls but had not met for years hardly since the former married sir John the son of one of King James s carpet knights Hearing of her cousin s illness she had come to visit her at last under the escort of her son Taken with his new cousin the youth had lingered and lingered and in fact Dorothy had been unable to get rid of him before an hour strange for leave taking in such a quiet and yet hospitable neighbourhood Richard took his stand on the side of the public road opposite the gate but just ere Scudamore came which was hardly a minute after a cloud crept over the moon and as he happened to stand in a line with the bole of a tree Scudamore did not catch sight of him When he turned to walk along the road Richard thought he avoided him and making a great stride or two after him called aloud Stop sir stop You forget your appointments over easily I think Oh you ARE there said the youth turning I am glad you acknowledge my presence said Richard not the better pleased with his new acquaintance that his speech and behaviour had an easy tone of superiority which if indefinably felt by the home bred lad was not therefore to be willingly accorded His easy carriage his light step his still shoulders and lithe spine indicated both birth and training Just the night for a serenade he went on heedless of Richard s remark bright but not too bright cloudy but not too cloudy Sir said Richard amazed at his coolness Oh you want to quarrel with me returned the youth But it takes two to fight as well as to kiss and I will not make one to night I know who you are well enough and have no quarrel with you except indeed it be true as indeed it must for Dorothy tells me so that you have turned roundhead as well as your father What right have you to speak so familiarly of mistress Dorothy said Richard It occurs to me replied Scudamore airily that I had better ask you by what right you haunt her house at midnight But I would not willingly cross you in cold blood I wish you good a night and better luck next time you go courting The moon swam from behind a cloud and her over ripe and fading light seemed to the eyes of Richard to gather upon the figure before him and there revive The youth had on a doublet of some reddish colour ill brought out by the moonlight but its silver lace and the rapier hilt inlaid with silver shone the keener against it A short cloak hung from his left shoulder trimmed also with silver lace and a little cataract of silver fringe fell from the edges of his short trousers into the wide tops of his boots which were adorned with ruffles He wore a large collar of lace and cuffs of the same were folded back from his bare hands A broad brimmed beaver hat its silver band fastened with a jewel holding a plume of willowy feathers completed his attire which he wore with just the slightest of a jaunty air It was hardly the dress for a walk at midnight but he had come in his mother s carriage and had to go home without it Alas now for Richard s share in the freedom to which he had of late imagined himself devoted No sooner had the words last spoken entered his ears than he was but a driven slave ready to rush into any quarrel with the man who spoke them Ere he had gone three paces he had stepped in front of him Whatever rights mistress Dorothy may have given you he said she had none to transfer in respect of my father What do you mean by calling him a roundhead Why is he not one asked the youth simply keeping his ground in spite of the unpleasant proximity of Richard s person I am sorry to have wronged him but I mistook him for a ringleader of the same name I heartily beg your pardon You did not mistake said Richard stupidly Then I did him no wrong rejoined the youth and once more would have gone his way But Richard angrier than ever at finding he had given him such an easy advantage moved with his movement and kept rudely in front of him provoking a quarrel in clownish fashion it must be confessed By heaven said Scudamore if Dorothy had not begged me not to fight with you and as he spoke he slipped suddenly past his antagonist and walked swiftly away Richard plunged after him and seized him roughly by the shoulder Instantaneously he wheeled on the very foot whence he was taking the next stride and as he turned his rapier gleamed in the moonlight The same moment it left his hand he scarce knew how and flew across the hedge Richard who was unarmed had seized the blade and almost by one and the same movement of his wrist wrenched the hilt from the grasp of his adversary and flung the thing from him Then closing with the cavalier slighter and less skilled in such encounters the roundhead almost instantly threw him upon the turf that bordered the road Take that for drawing on an unarmed man he said No reply came The youth lay stunned Then compassion woke in the heart of the angry Richard and he hastened to his help Ere he reached him however he made an attempt to rise but only to stagger and fall again Curse you for a roundhead he cried you ve twisted some of my tackle I can t stand I m sorry returned Richard but why did you bare bilbo on a naked man A right malignant you are Did I returned Scudamore You laid hands on me so suddenly I ask your pardon Accepting the offered aid of Richard he rose but his right knee was so much hurt that he could not walk a step without great pain Full of regret for the suffering he had caused Richard lifted him in his arms and seated him on a low wall of earth which was all that here inclosed lady Vaughan s shrubbery then breaking through the hedge on the opposite side of the way presently returned with the rapier and handed it to him Scudamore accepted it courteously with difficulty replaced it in its sheath rose and once more attempted to walk but gave a groan and would have fallen had not Richard caught him The devil is in it he cried with more annoyance than anger If I am not in my place at my lord s breakfast to morrow there will be questioning That I had leave to accompany my mother makes the mischief If I had stole away it would be another matter It will be hard to bear rebuke and no frolic Come home with me said Richard My father will do his best to atone for the wrong done by his son Set foot across the threshold of a roundhead fanatic In the way of hospitality Not if the choice lay betwixt that and my coffin cried the cavalier Then let me carry you back to lady Vaughan s said Richard with a torturing pang of jealousy which only his sense of right now thoroughly roused enabled him to defy I dare not I should terrify my mother and perhaps kill my cousin Your mother your cousin cried Richard Yes returned Scudamore my mother is there on a visit to her cousin lady Vaughan Alas I am more to blame than I knew said Richard No Scudamore went on heedless of Richard s lamentation I must crawl back to Raglan as I may If I get there before the morning I shall be able to show reason why I should not wait upon my lord at his breakfast You belong to the earl s household then said Richard Yes and I fear I shall be grey headed before I belong to anything else He makes much of the ancient customs of the country I would he would follow them In the good old times I should have been a squire at least by now if indeed I had not earned my spurs but his lordship will never be content without me to hand him his buttered egg at breakfast and fill his cup at dinner with his favourite claret And so I am neither more nor less than a page which rhymes with my age better than suits it But the earl has a will of his own He is a master worth serving though And there is my lady Elizabeth and my lady Mary not to mention my lord Herbert But he concluded rubbing his injured knee with both hands why do I prate of them to a roundhead Why indeed returned Richard Are they not the earl and all his people traitors and that of the worst Are they not the enemies of the truth worshippers of idols bowing the knee to a woman and kissing the very toes of an old man so in love with ignorance that he tortures the philosopher who tells him the truth about the world and its motions Go on master Roundhead I can chastise you and that you know This cursed knee I will stand unarmed within your thrust and never budge a foot said Richard But no he added I dare not lest I should further injure one I have wronged already Let there be a truce between us I am no papist returned Scudamore I speak only as one of the earl s household true men all For them I cast the word in your teeth you roundhead traitor For myself I am of the English church It is but the wolf and the wolf s cub said Richard Prelatical episcopacy is but the old harlot veiled or rather forsooth her bloody scarlet blackened in the sulphur fumes of her coming desolation Curse on roundhead sighed the youth I must crawl home Once more he rose and made an effort to walk But it was of no use walk he could not I must wait till the morning he said when some Christian waggoner may be passing Leave me in peace Nay I am no such boor said Richard Do you think you could ride I could try I will bring you the best mare in Gwent But tell me your name that I may know with whom I have the honour of a feud My name is Roland Scudamore answered the youth Yours I know already and round head as you are you have some smatch of honour in you With an air of condescension he held out his hand which his adversary oppressed with a sense of the injury he had done him did not refuse Richard hurried home and to the stable where he saddled his mare But his father who was still in his study heard the sound of her hoofs in the paved yard and met him as he led her out on the road with an inquiry as to his destination at such an hour Richard told him that he had had a quarrel with a certain young fellow of the name of Scudamore a page of the earl of Worcester whom he had met at lady Vaughan s and recounted the result Was your quarrel a just one my son No sir I was in the wrong Then you are so far in the right now And you are going to help him home Yes sir Have you confessed yourself in the wrong Yes sir Then go my son but beware of private quarrel in such a season of strife This youth and thyself may meet some day in mortal conflict on the battle field and for my part I know not how it may be with another in such a case I would rather slay my friend than my enemy Enlightened by the inward experience of the moment Richard was able to understand and respond to the feeling How different a sudden action flashed off the surface of a man s nature may be from that which had time been given would have unfolded itself from its depths Bare headed Roger Heywood walked beside his son as he led the mare to the spot where Scudamore perforce awaited his return They found him stretched on the roadside plucking handfuls of grass and digging up the turf with his fingers thus and thus alone betraying that he suffered mister Heywood at first refrained from any offer of hospitality believing he would be more inclined to accept it after he had proved the difficulty of riding in which case a previous refusal might stand in the way But although a slight groan escaped as they lifted him to the saddle he gathered up the reins at once and sat erect while they shortened the stirrup leathers Lady seemed to know what was required of her and stood as still as a vaulting horse until Richard took the bridle to lead her away I see said Scudamore you can t trust me with your horse Not so sir answered mister Heywood We cannot trust the horse with you It is quite impossible for you to ride so far alone If you will go you must submit to the attendance of my son on which I am sorry to think you have so good a claim But will you not yet change your mind and be our guest for the night at least We will send a messenger to the castle at earliest dawn Scudamore declined the invitation but with perfect courtesy for there was that about Roger Heywood which rendered it impossible for any man who was himself a gentleman whatever his judgment of him might be to show him disrespect And the moment the mare began to move he felt no further inclination to object to Richard s company at her head for he perceived that should she prove in the least troublesome it would be impossible for him to keep his seat He did not suffer so much however as to lose all his good spirits or fail in his part of a conversation composed chiefly of what we now call chaff both of them for a time avoiding all such topics as might lead to dispute the one from a sense of wrong already done the other from a vague feeling that he was under the protection of the foregone injury Have you known my cousin Dorothy long asked Scudamore Longer than I can remember answered Richard Then you must be more like brother and sister than lovers That I fear is her feeling replied Richard honestly You need not think of me as a rival said Scudamore I never saw the young woman in my life before and although anything of yours being a roundhead s is fair game Your humble servant sir Cavalier interjected Richard Pray use your pleasure I tell you plainly Scudamore went on without heeding the interruption though I admire my cousin as I do any young woman if she be but a shade beyond the passable The ape The coxcomb said Richard to himself I am not therefore dying for her love and I give you this one honest warning that though I would rather see mistress Dorothy in her winding sheet than dame to a roundhead I should be yes I MAY be a more dangerous rival in respect of your mare than of any lady YOU are likely to set eyes upon What do you mean said Richard gruffly I mean that the king having at length resolved to be more of a monarch and less of a saint A saint echoed Richard but the echo was rather a loud one for it startled his mare and shook her rider Don t shout like that cried the cavalier with an oath Saint or sinner I care not He is my king and I am his soldier But with this knee you have given me I shall be fitter for garrison than field duty damn it You do not mean that his majesty has declared open war against the parliament exclaimed Richard Faithless puritan I do answered Scudamore His majesty has at length with reluctance I am sorry to hear taken up arms against his rebellious subjects Land will be cheap by and by Many such rumours have reached us returned Richard quietly The king spares no threats but for blows well Insolent fanatic shouted Vaughan I tell you his majesty is on his way from Scotland with an army of savages and London has declared for the king Richard and his mare simultaneously quickened their pace Then it is time you were in bed mister Scudamore for my mare and I will be wanted he cried God be praised I thank you for the good news It makes me young again to hear it What the devil do you mean by jerking this cursed knee of mine so shouted Scudamore Faith you were young enough in all conscience already you fool You want to keep me in bed as well as send me there Well out of the way you think But I give you honest warning to look after your mare for I vow I have fallen in love with her She s worth three at least of your mistress Dorothies You talk like a Dutch boor said Richard Saith an English lout retorted Scudamore But all things being lawful in love and war not to mention hate and rebellion this mare if I am blessed with a chance shall be well shall be translated You mean from Redware to Raglan Where she shall be entertained in a manner worthy of her which is saying no little if all her paces and points be equal to her walk and her crest I trust you will be more pitiful to my poor Lady said Richard quietly If all they say be true Raglan stables are no place for a mare of her breeding What do you mean roundhead Folk say your stables at Raglan are like other some Raglan matters of the infernal sort Scudamore was silent for a moment Whether the stables be under the pavement or over the leads he returned at last there are not a few in them as good as she of which I hope to satisfy my Lady some day he added patting the mare s neck Wert thou not hurt already I would pitch thee out of the saddle said Richard Were I not hurt in the knee thou couldst not said Scudamore I need not lay hand upon thee Wert thou as sound in limb as thou art in wind thou wouldst feel thyself on the road ere thou knewest thou hadst taken leave of the saddle did I but give the mare the sign she knows By God s grace said the cavalier she shall be mine and teach me the trick of it Richard answered only with a grim laugh and again but more gently this time quickened the mare s pace Little more had passed between them when the six sided towers of Raglan rose on their view Richard had from childhood been familiar with their aspect especially that of the huge one called the Yellow Tower but he had never yet been within the walls that encircled them At any time during his life almost up to the present hour he might have entered without question for the gates were seldom closed and never locked the portcullises sheathed in the wall above hung moveless in their rusty chains and the drawbridges spanned the moat from scarp to counterscarp as if from the first their beams had rested there in solid masonry And still during the day there was little sign of change beyond an indefinable presence of busier life even in the hush of the hot autumnal noon But at night the drawbridges rose and the portcullises descended each with its own peculiar creak and jar and scrape setting the young rooks cawing in reply from every pinnacle and tree top never later than the last moment when the warder could see anything larger than a cat on the brow of the road this side the village For who could tell when or with what force at their command the parliament might claim possession And now another of the frequent reports had arrived that the king had at length resorted to arms It was altogether necessary for such as occupied a stronghold unless willing to yield it to the first who demanded entrance to keep watch and ward Admitted at the great brick gate the outermost of all and turning aside from the steps leading up to the white stone gate and main entrance beyond with its drawbridge and double portcullis Richard by his companion s directions led his mare to the left and rounding the moat of the citadel sought the western gate of the castle which seemed to shelter itself under the great bulk of the Yellow Tower the cannon upon more than one of whose bastions closely commanded it and made up for its inferiority in defence of its own Scudamore had scarcely called ere the warder who had been waked by the sound of the horse s feet began to set the machinery of the portcullis in motion What wounded already master Scudamore he cried as they rode under the archway Yes Eccles answered Scudamore wounded and taken prisoner and brought home for ransom As they spoke Richard made use of his eyes with a vague notion that some knowledge of the place might one day or other be of service but it was little he could see The moon was almost down and her low light prolific of shadows shone straight in through the lifted portcullis but in the gateway where they stood there was nothing for her to show but the groined vault the massy walls and the huge iron studded gate beyond Curse you for a roundhead cried Scudamore in the wrath engendered of a fierce twinge as Heywood sought to help his lamed leg over the saddle Dismount on this side then said Richard regardless of the insult But the warder had caught the word Roundhead he exclaimed Scudamore did not answer until he found himself safe on his feet and by that time he had recovered his good manners This is young mister Heywood of Redware he said and moved towards the wicket leaning on Richard s arm But the old warder stepped in front and stood between them and the gate Not a damned roundhead of the pack shall set foot across this door sill so long as I hold the gate he cried with a fierce gesture of the right arm And therewith he set his back to the wicket Tut tut Eccles returned Scudamore impatiently Good words are worth much and cost little If the old dog bark he gives counsel rejoined Eccles immovable Heywood was amused and stood silent waiting the result He had no particular wish to enter and yet would have liked to see what could be seen of the court Where the doorkeeper is a churl what will folk say of the master of the house said Scudamore They may say as they list it will neither hurt him nor me said Eccles Make haste my good fellow and let us through pleaded Scudamore By Saint George but my leg is in great pain I fear the knee cap is broken in which case I shall not trouble thee much for a week of months As he spoke he stood leaning on Richard s arm and behind them stood Lady still as a horse of bronze I will but drop the portcullis said the warder and then I will carry thee to thy room in my arms But not a cursed roundhead shall enter here I swear Let us through at once said Scudamore trying the imperative Not if the earl himself gave the order persisted the man Ho ho what is that you say Let the gentlemen through cried a voice from somewhere The warder opened the wicket immediately stepped inside and held it open while they entered nor uttered another word But as soon as Richard had got Scudamore clear of the threshold to which he lent not a helping finger he stepped quietly out again closed the wicket behind him and taking Lady by the bridle led her back over the bridge towards the bowling green Scudamore had just time to whisper to Heywood It is my master the earl himself when the voice came again What wounded Rowland How is this And who have you there But that moment Richard heard the sound of his mare s hoofs on the bridge and leaving Scudamore to answer for them both bounded back to the wicket darted through and called her by name Instantly she stood stock still notwithstanding a vicious kick in the ribs from Eccles not unseen of Heywood Enraged at the fellow s insolence he dealt him a sudden blow that stretched him at the mare s feet vaulted into the saddle and had reached the outer gate before he had recovered himself The sleepy porter had just let him through when the warder s signal to let no one out reached him Richard turned with a laugh When next you catch a roundhead he said keep him and giving Lady the rein galloped off leaving the porter staring after him through the bars like a half roused wild beast Not doubting the rumour of open hostilities the warder s design had been to secure the mare and pretend she had run away for a good horse was now more precious than ever The earl s study was over the gate and as he suffered much from gout and slept ill he not unfrequently sought refuge in the night watches with his friends Chaucer Gower and Shakspere Richard drew rein at the last point whence the castle would have been visible in the daytime All he saw was a moving light The walls whence it shone were one day to be as the shell around the kernel of his destiny CHAPTER IX LOVE AND WAR When Richard reached home and recounted the escape he had had an imprecation the first he had ever heard him utter broke from his father s lips With the indiscrimination of party spirit he looked upon the warder s insolence and attempted robbery as the spirit and behaviour of his master the earl being in fact as little capable of such conduct as mister Heywood himself Immediately after their early breakfast the next morning he led his son to a chamber in the roof of the very existence of which he had been ignorant and there discovered to him good store of such armour of both kinds as was then in use which for some years past he had been quietly collecting in view of the time which in the light of the last rumour seemed to have at length arrived when strength would have to decide the antagonism of opposed claims Probably also it was in view of this time seen from afar in silent approach that from the very moment when he took his education into his own hands he had paid thorough attention to Richard s bodily as well as mental accomplishment encouraging him in all manly sports such as wrestling boxing and riding to hounds with the more martial training of sword exercises with and without the target and shooting with the carbine and the new fashioned flint lock pistols The rest of the morning Richard spent in choosing a headpiece and mail plates for breast back neck shoulders arms and thighs The next thing was to set the village tailor at work upon a coat of that thick strong leather dressed soft and pliant which they called buff to wear under his armour After that came the proper equipment of Lady and that of the twenty men whom his father expected to provide from amongst his own tenants and for whom he had already a full provision of clothing and armour they had to be determined on conferred with and fitted one by one so as to avoid drawing attention to the proceeding Hence both mister Heywood and Richard had enough to do and the more that Faithful Stopchase on whom was their chief dependence had not yet recovered sufficiently from the effects of his fall to be equal to the same exertion as formerly of which he was the more impatient that he firmly believed he had been a special object of Satanic assault because of the present value of his counsels and the coming weight of his deeds on the side of the well affected Thus occupied the weeks passed into months During this time Richard called again and again upon Dorothy ostensibly to inquire after her mother Only once however did she appear when she gave him to understand she was so fully occupied that although obliged by his attention he must not expect to see her again But I will be honest Richard she added and let you know plainly that were it otherwise in respect of my mother I yet should not see you for you and I have parted company and are already so far asunder on different roads that I must bid you farewell at once while yet we can hear each other speak There was no anger only a cold sadness in her tone and manner while her bearing was stately as towards one with whom she had never had intimacy Even her sadness seemed to Richard to have respect to the hopeless condition of her mother s health and not at all to the changed relation between him and her I trust at least mistress Dorothy he said with some bitterness you will grant me the justice that what I do I do with a good conscience After all that has been betwixt us I ask for no more What more could the best of men ask for I who am far from making any claim to rank with such I am glad to know it interjected Dorothy am yet capable of hoping that an eye at once keener and kinder than yours may see conscience at the very root of the actions which you Dorothy will doubtless most condemn Was this the boy she had despised for indifference Was it conscience drove you to sprain my cousin Rowland s knee she asked Richard was silent for a moment The sting was too cruel Pray hesitate not to say so if such be your conviction added Dorothy No replied Richard recovering himself I trust it is not such a serious matter as you say but any how it was not conscience but jealousy and anger that drove me to that wrong Did you see the action such at the time No surely else I would not have been guilty of that for which I am truly sorry now Then perhaps the day will come when looking back on what you do now you will regard it with the like disapprobation God grant it may she added with a deep sigh That can hardly be mistress Dorothy I am in the matters to which you refer under the influence of no passion no jealousy no self seeking no Perhaps a deeper search might discover in you each and all of the bosom sins you so stoutly abjure interrupted Dorothy But it is needless for you to defend yourself to me I am not your judge So much the better for me returned Richard I should else have an unjust as well as severe one I on my part hope the day may come when you will find something to repent of in such harshness towards an old friend whom you choose to think in the wrong Richard Heywood God is my witness it is no choice of mine I have no choice what else is there to think I know well enough what you and your father are about But there is nothing save my own conscience and my mother s love I would not part with to be able to believe you honourably right in your own eyes not in mine God forbid That can never be not until fair is foul and foul is fair So saying she held out her hand God be between thee and me Dorothy said Richard with solemnity as he took it in his He spoke with a voice that seemed to him far away and not his own Until now he had never realized the idea of a final separation between him and Dorothy and even now he could hardly believe she was in earnest but felt rather like a child whose nurse threatens to forsake him on the dark road and who begins to weep only from the pitiful imagination of the thing and not any actual fear of her carrying the threat into execution The idea of retaining her love by ceasing to act on his convictions the very possibility of it had never crossed the horizon of his thoughts Had it come to him as the merest intellectual notion he would have perceived at once of such a loyal stock did he come and so loyal had he himself been to truth all his days that to act upon her convictions instead of his own would have been to widen a gulf at least measurable to one infinite and impassable She withdrew the hand which had solemnly pressed his and left the room For a moment he stood gazing after her Even in that moment the vague fear that she would not come again grew to a plain conviction and forcibly repressing the misery that rose in bodily presence from his heart to his throat he left the house hurried down the pleached alley to the old sun dial threw himself on the grass under the yews and wept and longed for war But war was not to be just yet Autumn withered and sank into winter The rain came down on the stubble and the red cattle waded through red mire to and from their pasture the skies grew pale above and the earth grew bare beneath the winds grew sharp and seemed unfriendly the brooks ran foaming to the rivers and the rivers ran roaring to the ocean Then the earth dried a little and the frost came and swelled and hardened it the snow fell and lay vanished and came again But even out of the depth of winter quivered airs and hints of spring until at last the mighty weakling was born And all this time rumour beat the alarum of war and men were growing harder and more determined on both sides some from self opinion some from party spirit some from prejudice antipathy animosity some from sense of duty mingled more and less with the alloys of impulse and advantage But he who was most earnest on the one side was least aware that he who was most earnest on the other was honest as himself To confess uprightness in one of the opposite party seemed to most men to involve treachery to their own or if they were driven to the confession it was too often followed with an attempt at discrediting the noblest of human qualities The hearts of the two young people fared very much as the earth under the altered skies of winter and behaved much as the divided nation A sense of wrong endured kept both from feeling at first the full sorrow of their separation and by the time that the tide of memory had flowed back and covered the rock of offence they had got a little used to the dulness of a day from which its brightest hour had been blotted Dorothy learned very soon to think of Richard as a prodigal brother beyond seas and when they chanced to meet which was but seldom he was to her as a sad ghost in a dream To Richard on the other hand she looked a lovely but scarce worshipful celestial with merely might enough to hold his heart swelling with a sense of wrong in her hand and squeeze it very hard His consolation was that he suffered for the truth s sake for to decline action upon such insight as he had had was a thing as impossible as to alter the relations between the parts of a sphere Dorothy longed for peace and the return of the wandering chickens of the church to the shelter of her wings to be led by her about the paled yard of obedience picking up the barley of righteousness Richard longed for the trumpet blast of Liberty to call her sons together to a war whose battles should never cease until men were free to worship God after the light he had lighted within them and the dragon of priestly authority should breathe out his last fiery breath no more to drive the feebler brethren to seek refuge in the house of hypocrisy At home Dorothy was under few influences except those of her mother and through his letters of mister Matthew Herbert Upon the former a lovely spiritual repose had long since descended Her anxieties were only for her daughter her hopes only for the world beyond the grave The latter was a man of peace who having found in the ordinances of his church everything to aid and nothing to retard his spiritual development had no conception of the nature of the puritanical opposition to its government and rites Through neither could Dorothy come to any true idea of the questions which agitated the politics of both church and state To her the king was a kind of demigod and every priest a fountain of truth Her religion was the sedate and dutiful acceptance of obedient innocence a thing of small account indeed where it is rooted only in sentiment and customary preference but of inestimable value in such cases as hers where action followed upon acceptance Richard again was under the quickening masterdom of a well stored active mind a strong will a judgment that sought to keep its balance even and whose descended scale never rebounded a conscience which through all the mists of human judgment eyed ever the blotted glimmer of some light beyond and all these elements of power were gathered in his own father in whom the customary sternness of the puritan parent had at length blossomed in confidence a phase of love which to such a mind as Richard s was even more enchanting than tenderness To be trusted by such a father to feel his mind and soul present with him acknowledging him a fit associate in great hopes and noble aims was surely and ought to be whatever the sentimentalist may say some comfort for any sorrow a youth is capable of such being in general only too lightly remediable I wonder if any mere youth ever suffered from a disappointment in love half the sense of cureless pain which with one protracted pang gnaws at the heart of the avaricious old man who has dropt a sovereign into his draw well But the relation of Dorothy and Richard although ordinary in outward appearance was of no common kind and while these two thus fell apart from each other in their outer life each judging the other insensible to the call of highest rectitude neither of them knew how much his or her heart was confident of the other s integrity In respect of them the lovely simile in Christabel of the parted cliffs may be carried a little farther for under the dreary sea flowing between them the rock was one still Such a faith may sometimes perhaps often does lie in the heart like a seed buried beyond the reach of the sun thoroughly alive though giving no sign to grow too soon might be to die Things had indeed gone farther with Dorothy and Richard but the lobes of their loves had never been fairly exposed to the sun and wind ere the swollen clods of winter again covered them Once in the cold noon of a lovely day of frost when the lightest step crackled with the breaking of multitudinous crystals when the trees were fringed with furry white and the old spider webs glimmered like filigrane of fairy silver they met on a lonely country road The sun shone red through depths of half frozen vapour and tinged the whiteness of death with a faint warmth of feeling and hope Along the rough lane Richard walked reading what looked like a letter but was a copy his father had procured of a poem still only in manuscript the Lycidas of Milton In the glow to which the alternating hot and cold winds of enthusiasm and bereavement had fanned the fiery particle within him Richard was not only able to understand and enjoy the thought of which the poem was built but was borne aloft on its sad yet hopeful melodies as upon wings of an upsoaring seraph The flow of his feeling suddenly broken by an almost fierce desire to share with Dorothy the tenderness of the magic music of the stately monody and then ere the answering waves of her emotion had subsided to whisper to her that the marvellous spell came from the heart of the same wonderful man from whose brain had issued like Pallas from Jove s what Animadversions upon the Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnus the pamphlet which had so roused all the abhorrence her nature was capable of he lifted his head and saw her but a few paces from him Dorothy caught a glimpse of a countenance radiant with feeling and eyes flashing through a watery film of delight her own eyes fell she said Good morning Richard and passed him without deflecting an inch The bird of song folded its wings and called in its shining the sun lost half his red beams the sprinkled seed pearls vanished and ashes covered the earth he folded the paper laid it in the breast of his doublet and walked home through the glittering meadows with a fresh hurt in his heart Dorothy s time and thoughts were all but occupied with the nursing of her mother who contrary to the expectation of her friends outlived the winter and revived as the spring drew on She read much to her Some of the best books had drifted into the house and settled there but although English printing was now nearly two centuries old they were not many We must not therefore imagine however that the two ladies were ill supplied with spiritual pabulum There are few houses of the present day in which though there be ten times as many books there is so much strong food if there was any lack it was rather of diluents Amongst those she read were Queen Elizabeth s Homilies Hooker s Politie Donne s Sermons and George Herbert s Temple to the dying lady only less dear than her New Testament But even with this last it was only through sympathy with her mother that Dorothy could come into any contact The gems of the mind which alone could catch and reflect such light lay as yet under the soil and much ploughing and breaking of the clods was needful ere they could come largely to the surface But happily for Dorothy there were amongst the books a few of those precious little quartos of Shakspere the first three books of the Faerie Queene and the Countess of Pembroke s Arcadia then much read if we may judge from the fact that although it was not published till after the death of Sidney the eighth edition of it had now been nearly ten years in lady Vaughan s possession Then there was in the drawing room an old spinnet sadly out of tune on which she would yet in spite of the occasional jar and shudder of respondent nerves now and then play at a sitting all the little music she had learned and with whose help she had sometimes even tried to find out an air for words that had taken her fancy Also she had the house to look after the live stock to see to her dog to play with and teach a few sad thoughts and memories to discipline a call now and then from a neighbour or a longer visit from some old friend of her mother s to receive and the few cottagers on all that was left of the estate of Wyfern to care for so that her time was tolerably filled up and she felt little need of anything more to occupy at least her hours and days Meanwhile through all nature s changes through calm and tempest rain and snow through dull refusing winter and the first passing visits of open handed spring the hearts of men were awaiting the outburst of the thunder the blue peaks of whose cloud built cells had long been visible on the horizon of the future Every now and then they would start and listen and ask each other was it the first growl of the storm or but the rumbling of the wheels of the government To the dwellers in Raglan Castle it seemed at least a stormy sign of which the news reached them in the dull November weather that the parliament had set a guard upon Worcester House in the Strand and searched it for persons suspected of high treason lord Herbert doubtless first of all the direction and strength of whose political drift suspicious from the first because of his religious persuasion could hardly be any longer doubtful to the most liberal of its members The news of the terrible insurrection of the catholics in Ireland followed Richard kept his armour bright his mare in good fettle himself and his men in thorough exercise read and talked with his father and waited sometimes with patience sometimes without At length in the early spring the king withdrew to York and a body guard of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood gathered around him Richard renewed the flints of his carbine and pistols In April the king refused entrance into the town of Hull proclaimed the governor a traitor The parliament declared the proclamation a breach of its privileges Richard got new girths The summer passed in various disputes Towards its close the governor of Portsmouth declined to act upon a commission to organize the new levies of the parliament and administered instead thereof an oath of allegiance to the garrison and inhabitants Thereupon the place was besieged by Essex the king proclaimed him a traitor and the parliament retorted by declaring the royal proclamation a libel Richard had his mare new shod On a certain day in August the royal standard with the motto Give to Caesar his due was set up at Nottingham Richard mounted his mare and taking leave of his father led Stopchase and nineteen men more all fairly mounted to offer his services to the parliament as represented by the earl of Essex CHAPTER X DOROTHY S REFUGE With the decay of summer lady Vaughan began again to sink and became at length so weak that Dorothy rarely left her room The departure of Richard Heywood to join the rebels affected her deeply The report of the utter rout of the parliamentary forces at Edgehill lighted up her face for the last time with a glimmer of earthly gladness which the very different news that followed speedily extinguished and after that she declined more rapidly missus Rees told Dorothy that she would yield to the first frost But she lingered many weeks One morning she signed to her daughter to come nearer that she might speak to her Dorothy she whispered I wish much to see good mister Herbert Prithee send for him I know it is an evil time for him to travel being an old man and feeble but he will do his endeavour to come to me I know if but for my husband s sake whom he loved like a brother I cannot die in peace without first taking counsel with him how best to provide for the safety of my little ewe lamb until these storms are overblown Alas alas I did look to Richard Heywood She could say no more Do not take thought about the morrow for me any more than you would for yourself madam said Dorothy You know master Herbert says the one is as the other She kissed her mother s hand as she spoke then hastened from the room and despatched a messenger to Llangattock Before the worthy man arrived lady Vaughan was speechless By signs and looks definite enough and more eloquent than words she committed Dorothy to his protection and died Dorothy behaved with much calmness She would not in her mother s absence act so as would have grieved her presence Little passed between her and mister Herbert until the funeral was over Then they talked of the future Her guardian wished much to leave everything in charge of the old bailiff and take her with him to Llangattock but he hesitated a little because of the bad state of the roads in winter much because of their danger in the troubled condition of affairs and most of all because of the uncertain indeed perilous position of the Episcopalian clergy who might soon find themselves without a roof to shelter them Fearing nothing for himself he must yet in arranging for Dorothy contemplate the worst of threatening possibilities and one thing was pretty certain that matters must grow far worse before they could even begin to mend But they had more time for deliberation given them than they would willingly have taken mister Herbert had caught cold while reading the funeral service and was compelled to delay his return The cold settled into a sort of low fever and for many weeks he lay helpless During this time the sudden affair at Brentford took place after which the king having lost by it far more than he had gained withdrew to Oxford anxious to re open the treaty which the battle had closed The country was now in a sad state Whichever party was uppermost in any district sought to ruin all of the opposite faction Robbery and plunder became common and that not only on the track of armies or the route of smaller bodies of soldiers for bands of mere marauders taking up the cry of the faction that happened in any neighbourhood to have the ascendancy plundered houses robbed travellers and were guilty of all sorts of violence Hence it had become as perilous to stay at home in an unfortified house as to travel and many were the terrors which during the winter tried the courage of the girl and checked the recovery of the old man At length one morning after a midnight alarm mister Herbert thus addressed Dorothy as she waited upon him with his breakfast It fears me much my dear Dorothy that the time will be long ere any but fortified places will be safe abodes It is a question in my mind whether it would not be better to seek refuge for you But stay let me suggest my proposal rather than startle you with it in sudden form complete You are related to the Somersets are you not Yes distantly Is the relationship recognized by them I cannot tell sir I do not even distinctly know what the relationship is And assuredly sir you mean not to propose that I should seek safety from bodily peril with a household which is to say the least so unfriendly to the doctrines you and my blessed mother have always taught me You cannot or indeed must you not have forgotten that they are papists Dorothy had been educated in such a fear of the catholics and such a profound disapproval of those of their doctrines rejected by the reformers of the church of England as was only surpassed in intensity by her absolute abhorrence of the assumptions and negations of the puritans These indeed roused in her a certain sense of disgust which she had never felt in respect of what were considered by her teachers the most erroneous doctrines of the catholics But mister Herbert although his prejudices were nearly as strong and his opinions if not more indigenous at least far better acclimatised than hers had yet reaped this advantage of a longer life that he was better able to atone his dislike of certain opinions with personal regard for those who held them and therefore did not like Dorothy recoil from the idea of obligation to one of a different creed provided always that creed was catholicism and not puritanism For to the church of England the catholics in the presence of her more rampant foes appeared harmless enough now He believed that the honourable feelings of lord Worcester and his family would be hostile to any attempt to proselytize his ward But as far as she was herself concerned he trusted more to the strength of her prejudices than the rectitude of her convictions honest as the girl was to prevent her from being over influenced by the change of spiritual atmosphere for in proportion to the simplicity of her goodness must be her capacity for recognizing the goodness of others catholics or not and for being wrought upon by the virtue that went out from them His hope was that England would have again become the abode of peace long ere any risk to her spiritual well being should have been incurred by this mode of securing her bodily safety and comfort But there was another fact in the absence of which he would have had far more hesitation in seeking for his ewe lamb the protection of sheep the guardians of whose spiritual fold had but too often proved wolves in sheep dogs clothing within the last few days the news had reached him that an old friend named Bayly a true man a priest of the English church and a doctor of divinity had taken up his abode in Raglan castle as one of the household chaplain indeed as report would have it though that was hard of belief save indeed it were for the sake of the protestants within its walls However that might be there was a true shepherd to whose care to entrust his lamb and it was mainly on the strength of this consideration that he had concluded to make his proposal to Dorothy namely that she should seek shelter within the walls of Raglan castle until the storm should be so far over blown as to admit either of her going to Llangattock or returning to her own home He now discussed the matter with her in full and notwithstanding her very natural repugnance to the scheme such was Dorothy s confidence in her friend that she was easily persuaded of its wisdom What the more inclined her to yield was that mister Heywood had written her a letter hardly the less unwelcome for the kindness of its tone in which he offered her the shelter and hospitality of Redware until better days Better days exclaimed Dorothy with contempt If such days as he would count better should ever arrive his house is the last place where I would have them find me She wrote a polite but cold refusal and rejoiced in the hope that he would soon hear of her having sought and found refuge in Raglan with the friends of the king Meanwhile mister Herbert had opened communication with doctor Bayly had satisfied himself that he was still a true son of the church and had solicited his friendly mediation towards the receiving of mistress Dorothy Vaughan into the family of the marquis of Worcester to the dignity of which title the earl had now been raised the parliament to be sure declining to acknowledge the patent conferred by his majesty but that was of no consequence in the estimation of those chiefly concerned On a certain spring morning then the snow still lying in the hollows of the hills Thomas Bayly came to Wyfern to see his old friend Matthew Herbert He was a courteous little man with a courtesy librating on a knife edge of deflection towards obsequiousness on the one hand and condescension on the other for neither of which however was his friend Herbert an object His eye was keen and his forehead good but his carriage inclined to the pompous and his speech to the formal ornate and prolix The shape of his mouth was honest but the closure of the lips indicated self importance The greeting between them was simple and genuine and ere they parted Bayly had promised to do his best in representing the matter to the marquis his daughter in law lady Margaret the wife of lord Herbert and his daughter lady Anne who although the most rigid catholic in the house was already the doctor s special friend It would have been greatly unlike the marquis or any of his family to refuse such a prayer Had not their house been for centuries the abode of hospitality the embodiment of shelter On the mere representation of doctor Bayly and the fact of the relationship which although distant was well enough known within two days mistress Dorothy Vaughan received an invitation to enter the family of the marquis as one of the gentlewomen of lady Margaret s suite It was of course gratefully accepted and as soon as mister Herbert thought himself sufficiently recovered to encounter the fatigues of travelling he urged on the somewhat laggard preparations of Dorothy that he might himself see her safely housed on his way to Llangattock whither he was most anxious to return It was a lovely spring morning when they set out together on horseback for Raglan The sun looked down like a young father upon his earth mothered children peeping out of their beds to greet him after the long winter night The rooks were too busy to caw dibbling deep in the soft red earth with their great beaks The red cattle flaked with white spotted the clear fresh green of the meadows The bare trees had a kind of glory about them like old men waiting for their youth which might come suddenly A few slow clouds were drifting across the pale sky A gentle wind was blowing over the wet fields but when a cloud swept before the sun it blew cold The roads were bad but their horses were used to such and picked their way with the easy carefulness of experience The winter might yet return for a season but this day was of the spring and its promises Earth and air field and sky were full of peace But the heart of England was troubled troubled with passions both good and evil with righteous indignation and unholy scorn with the love of liberty and the joy of license with ambition and aspiration No honest heart could yield long to the comforting of the fair world knowing that some of her fairest fields would soon be crimsoned afresh with the blood of her children But Dorothy s sadness was not all for her country in general Had she put the question honestly to her heart she must have confessed that even the loss of her mother had less to do with a certain weight upon it which the loveliness of the spring day seemed to render heavier than the rarely absent feeling rather than thought that the playmate of her childhood and the offered lover of her youth had thrown himself with all the energy of dawning manhood into the quarrel of the lawless and self glorifying Nor was she altogether free from a sense of blame in the matter Had she been less imperative in her mood and bearing more ready to give than to require sympathy but ah she could not change the past and the present was calling upon her At length the towers of Raglan appeared and a pang of apprehension shot through her bosom She was approaching the unknown Like one on the verge of a second sight her history seemed for a moment about to reveal itself where it lay like a bird in its egg within those massive walls warded by those huge ascending towers Brought up in a retirement that some would have counted loneliness and although used to all gentle and refined ways yet familiar with homeliness and simplicity of mode and ministration she could not help feeling awed at the prospect of entering such a zone of rank and stateliness and observance as the household of the marquis who lived like a prince in expenditure attendance and ceremony She knew little of the fashions of the day and like many modest young people was afraid she might be guilty of some solecism which would make her appear ill bred or at least awkward Since her mother left her she had become aware of a timidity to which she had hitherto been a stranger Ah she said to herself if only my mother were with me At length they reached the brick gate were admitted within the outer wall and following the course taken by Scudamore and Heywood skirted the moat which enringed the huge blind citadel or keep and arrived at the western gate The portcullis rose to admit them and they rode into the echoes of the vaulted gateway Turning to congratulate Dorothy on their safe arrival mister Herbert saw that she was pale and agitated What ails my child he said in a low voice for the warder was near I feel as if entering a prison she replied with a shiver Is thy God the God of the grange and not of the castle returned the old man But sir said Dorothy I have been accustomed to a liberty such as few have enjoyed and these walls and towers Heed not the look of things interrupted her guardian Believe in the Will that with a thought can turn the shadow of death into the morning give gladness for weeping and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness CHAPTER XI RAGLAN CASTLE While he yet spoke their horses of their own accord passed through the gate which Eccles had thrown wide to admit them and carried them into the Fountain court Here indeed was a change of aspect All that Dorothy had hitherto contemplated was the side of the fortress which faced the world frowning and defiant although here and there on the point of breaking into a half smile for the grim suspicious altogether repellent look of the old feudal castle had been gradually vanishing in the additions and alterations of more civilised times But now they were in the heart of the building and saw the face which the house of strength turned upon its own people The spring sunshine filled half the court over the rest lay the shadow of the huge keep towering massive above the three storied line of building which formed the side next it Here was the true face of the Janus building full of eyes and mouths for many bright windows looked down into the court in some of which shone the smiling faces of children and ladies peeping out to see the visitors whose arrival had been announced by the creaking chains of the portcullis and by the doors issued and entered here a lady in rich attire there a gentlemen half in armour and here again a serving man or maid Nearly in the centre of the quadrangle just outside the shadow of the keep stood the giant horse rearing in white marble almost dazzling in the sunshine from whose nostrils spouted the jets of water which gave its name to the court Opposite the gate by which they entered was the little chapel with its triple lancet windows over which lay the picture gallery with its large oriel lights Far above their roof ascended from behind that of the great hall with its fine lantern window seated on the ridge From the other court beyond the hall that upon which the main entrance opened came the sounds of heavy feet in intermittent but measured tread the clanking of arms and a returning voice of loud command the troops of the garrison were being exercised on the slabs of the pitched court From each of the many doors opening into the court they had entered a path paved with coloured tiles led straight through the finest of turf to the marble fountain in the centre into whose shadowed basin the falling water seemed to carry captive as into a prison the sunlight it caught above Its music as it fell made a lovely but strange and sad contrast with the martial sounds from beyond It was but a moment they had to note these things eyes and ears gathered them all at once Two of the warder s men already held their horses while two other men responsive to the warder s whistle came running from the hall and helped them to dismount Hardly had they reached the ground ere a man servant came who led the way to the left towards a porch of carved stone on the same side of the court The door stood open revealing a flight of stairs rather steep but wide and stately going right up between two straight walls At the top stood lady Margaret s gentleman usher mister Harcourt by name who received them with much courtesy and conducting them to a small room on the left of the landing went to announce their arrival to lady Margaret to whose private parlour this was the antechamber Returning in a moment he led them into her presence She received them with a frankness which almost belied the stateliness of her demeanour Through the haze of that reserve which a consciousness of dignity whether true or false so often generates the genial courtesy of her Irish nature for she was an O Brien daughter of the earl of Thomond shone clear and justified her Celtic origin Welcome cousin she said holding out her hand while yet distant half the length of the room across which upborne on slow firm foot she advanced with even stately motion And you also reverend sir she went on turning to mister Herbert I am told we are indebted to you for this welcome addition to our family how welcome none can tell but ladies shut up like ourselves Dorothy was already almost at her ease and the old clergyman soon found lady Margaret so sensible and as well as courteous prejudiced yet further in her favour it must be confessed by the pleasant pretence she made of claiming cousinship on the ground of the identity of her husband s title with his surname that ere he left the castle liberal as he had believed himself he was nevertheless astonished to find how much of friendship had in that brief space been engendered in his bosom towards a catholic lady whom he had never before seen Since the time of Elizabeth when the fear and repugnance of the nation had been so greatly and justly excited by the apparent probability of a marriage betwixt their queen and the detested Philip of Spain a considerable alteration had been gradually wrought in the feelings of a large portion of it in respect of their catholic countrymen a fact which gave strength to the position of the puritans in asserting the essential identity of episcopalian with catholic politics Almost forty years had elapsed since the Gunpowder Plot the queen was a catholic the episcopalian party was itself at length endangered by the extension and development of the very principles on which they had themselves broken away from the church of Rome and the catholics were friendly to the government of the king under which their condition was one of comfort if not influence while under that of the parliament they had every reason to anticipate a revival of persecution Not a few of them doubtless cherished the hope that this revelation of the true spirit of dissent would result in driving the king and his party back into the bosom of the church The king on the other hand while only too glad to receive what aid he might from the loyal families of the old religion yet saw that much caution was necessary lest he should alienate the most earnest of his protestant friends by giving ground for the suspicion that he was inclined to purchase their company operation by a return to the creed of his Scottish grand mother Mary Stuart and his English great great grand mother Margaret Tudor On the part of the clergy there had been for some time a considerable tendency chiefly from the influence of Laud to cultivate the same spirit which actuated the larger portion of the catholic priesthood and although this had never led to retrograde movement in regard to their politics the fact that both were accounted by a third party and that far the most dangerous to either of the other two as in spirit and object one and the same naturally tended to produce a more indulgent regard of each other than had hitherto prevailed And hence in part it was that it had become possible for episcopalian doctor Bayly to be an inmate of Raglan Castle and for good protestant Matthew Herbert to seek refuge for his ward with good catholic lady Margaret Eager to return to the duties of his parish through his illness so long neglected mister Herbert declined her ladyship s invitation to dinner which she assured him consulting a watch that she wore in a ring on her little finger must be all but ready seeing it was now a quarter to eleven and took his leave accompanied by Dorothy s servant to bring back the horse if indeed they should be fortunate enough to escape the requisition of both horses by one party or the other At present however the king s affairs continued rather on the ascendant and the name of the marquis in that country was as yet a tower of strength Dorothy s horse was included in the hospitality shown his mistress and taken to the stables under the mid day shadow of the Library Tower As soon as the parson was gone lady Margaret touched a small silver bell which hung in a stand on the table beside her Conduct mistress Dorothy Vaughan to her room wait upon her there and then attend her hither she said to the maid who answered it I would request a little not unneedful haste cousin she went on for my lord of Worcester is very precise in all matters of household order and likes ill to see any one enter the dining room after he is seated It is his desire that you should dine at his table to day After this I must place you with the rest of my ladies who dine in the housekeeper s room As you think proper madam returned Dorothy a little disappointed but a little relieved also The bell will ring presently said lady Margaret and a quarter of an hour thereafter we shall all be seated She was herself already dressed in a pale blue satin with full skirt and close fitting long peaked boddice fastened in front by several double clasps set with rubies her shoulders were bare and her sleeves looped up with large round star like studs set with diamonds so that her arms also were bare to the elbows Round her neck was a short string of large pearls You take no long time to attire yourself cousin said her ladyship kindly when Dorothy returned Little time was needed madam answered Dorothy for me there is but one colour I fear I shall show but a dull bird amidst the gay plumage of Raglan But I could have better adorned myself had not I heard the bell ere I had begun and feared to lose your ladyship s company and in very deed make my first appearance before my lord as a transgressor of the laws of his household You did well cousin Dorothy for everything goes by law and order here All is reason and rhyme too in this house My lord s father although one of the best and kindest of men is as I said somewhat precise and will as he says himself be king in his own kingdom thinking doubtless of one who is not such I should not talk thus with you cousin were you like some young ladies I know but there is that about you which pleases me greatly and which I take to indicate discretion When first I came to the house not having been accustomed to so severe a punctuality I gave my lord no little annoyance for oftener than once or twice I walked into his dining room not only after grace had been said but after the first course had been sent down to the hall tables My lord took his revenge in calling me the wild Irish woman Here she laughed very sweetly The only one she resumed who does here as he will is my husband Even lord Charles who is governor of the castle must be in his place to the moment but for my husband The bell rang a second time Lady Margaret rose and taking Dorothy s arm led her from the room into a long dim lighted corridor Arrived at the end of it where a second passage met it at right angles she stopped at a door facing them I think we shall find my lord of Worcester here she said in a whisper as she knocked and waited a response He is not here she said He expects me to call on him as I pass We must make haste The second passage in which were several curves and sharp turns led them to a large room nearly square in which were two tables covered for about thirty By the door and along the sides of the room were a good many gentlemen some of them very plainly dressed and others in gayer attire amongst whom Dorothy as they passed through recognised her cousin Scudamore Whether he saw and knew her she could not tell Crossing a small antechamber they entered the drawing room where stood and sat talking a number of ladies and gentlemen to some of whom lady Margaret spoke and presented her cousin greeting others with a familiar nod or smile and yet others with a stately courtesy Then she said Ladies I will lead the way to the dining room My lord marquis would the less willingly have us late that something detains himself Those who dined in the marquis s room followed her Scarcely had she reached the upper end of the table when the marquis entered followed by all his gentlemen some of whom withdrew their service over for the time while others proceeded to wait upon him and his family with any of the nobility who happened to be his guests at the first table I am the laggard to day my lady he said cheerily as he bore his heavy person up the room towards her Ah he went on as lady Margaret stepped forward to meet him leading Dorothy by the hand who is this sober young damsel under my wild Irishwoman s wing Our young cousin Vaughan doubtless whose praises my worthy doctor Bayly has been sounding in my ears He held out his hand to Dorothy and bade her welcome to Raglan The marquis was a man of noble countenance of the type we are ready to imagine peculiar to the great men of the time of queen Elizabeth To this his unwieldy person did not correspond although his movements were still far from being despoiled of that charm which naturally belonged to all that was his Nor did his presence owe anything to his dress which was of that long haired coarse woollen stuff they called frieze worn probably by not another nobleman in the country and regarded as fitter for a yeoman His eyes though he was yet but sixty five or so were already hazy and his voice was husky and a little broken results of the constantly poor health and frequent suffering he had had for many years but he carried it all with to quote the prince of courtesy sir Philip Sydney with a right old man s grace that will seem livelier than his age will afford him The moment he entered the sewer in the antechamber at the other end of the room had given a signal to one waiting at the head of the stair leading down to the hall and his lordship was hardly seated ere although the kitchen was at the corner of the pitched court diagonally opposite he bore the first dish into the room followed by his assistants laden each with another Lady Margaret made Dorothy sit down by her A place on her other side was vacant Where is this truant husband of thine my lady asked the marquis as soon as doctor Bayly had said grace Know you whether he eats at all or when or where It is now three days since he has filled his place at thy side yet is he in the castle Thou knowest my lady I deal not with him who is so soon to sit in this chair as with another but I like it not Know you what occupies him to day I do not my lord answered lady Margaret I have had but one glimpse of him since the morning and if he looks now as he looked then I fear your lordship would be minded rather to drive him from your table than welcome him to a seat beside you As she spoke lady Margaret caught a glimpse of a peculiar expression on Scudamore s face where he stood behind his master s chair Your page my lord she said seems to know something of him if it pleased you to put him to the question Hey Scudamore said the marquis without turning his head what have you seen of my lord Herbert As much as could be seen of him my lord answered Scudamore He was new from the powder mill and his face and hands were as he had been blown three times up the hall chimney I would thou didst pay more heed to what is fitting thou monkey and knewest either place or time for thy foolish jests It will be long ere thou soil one of thy white fingers for king or country said the marquis neither angrily nor merrily Get another flask of claret he added and keep thy wit for thy mates boy Dorothy cast one involuntary glance at her cousin His face was red as fire but as it seemed to her more with suppressed amusement than shame She had not been much longer in the castle before she learned that in the opinion of the household the marquis did his best or worst rather to ruin young Scudamore by indulgence The judgment however was partly the product of jealousy although doubtless the marquis had in his case a little too much relaxed the bonds of discipline The youth was bright and ready and had as yet been found trustworthy his wit was tolerable and a certain gay naivete of speech and manner set off to the best advantage what there was of it but his laughter was sometimes mischievous and on the present occasion Dorothy could not rid herself of the suspicion that he was laughing in his sleeve at his master which caused her to redden in her turn Scudamore saw it and had his own fancies concerning the phenomenon CHAPTER XII THE TWO MARQUISES Dinner over lady Margaret led Dorothy back to her parlour and there proceeded to discover what accomplishments and capabilities she might possess Finding she could embroider play a little on the spinnet sing a song and read aloud both intelligibly and pleasantly she came to the conclusion that the country bred girl was an acquisition destined to grow greatly in value should the day ever arrive which heaven forbid when they would have to settle down to the monotony of a protracted siege Remarking at length that she looked weary she sent her away to be mistress of her time till supper at half past five Weary in truth with her journey but still more weary from the multitude and variety of objects the talk and the constant demand of the general strangeness upon her attention and one form or other of suitable response Dorothy sought her chamber But she scarcely remembered how to reach it She knew it lay a floor higher and easily found the stair up which she had followed her attendant for it rose from the landing of the straight ascent by which she had entered the house She could hardly go wrong either as to the passage at the top of it leading back over the room she had just left below but she could not tell which was her own door Fearing to open the wrong one she passed it and went on to the end of the corridor which was very dimly lighted There she came to an open door through which she saw a small chamber evidently not meant for habitation She entered A little light came in through a crossed loophole sufficient to show her the bare walls with the plaster sticking out between the stones the huge beams above and in the middle of the floor opposite the loop hole a great arblast or crossbow with its strange machinery She had never seen one before but she knew enough to guess at once what it was Through the loophole came a sweet breath of spring air and she saw trees bending in the wind heard their faint far off rustle and saw the green fields shining in the sun Partly from having been so much with Richard her only playmate who was of an ingenious and practical turn a certain degree of interest in mechanical forms and modes had been developed in Dorothy sufficient at least to render her unable to encounter such an implement without feeling a strong impulse to satisfy herself concerning its mechanism its motion and its action Approaching it cautiously and curiously as if it were a live thing which might start up and fly from or perhaps at her for what she knew she gazed at it for a few moments with eyes full of unuttered questions then ventured to lay gentle hold upon what looked like a handle To her dismay a wheezy bang followed which seemed to shake the tower Whether she had discharged an arrow or an iron bolt or a stone or indeed anything at all she could not tell for she had not got so far in her observations as to perceive even that the bow was bent Her heart gave a scared flutter and she started back not merely terrified but ashamed also that she should initiate her life in the castle with meddling and mischief when a low gentle laugh behind her startled her yet more and looking round with her heart in her throat she perceived in the half light of the place a man by the wall behind the arblast watching her Her first impulse was to run and the door was open but she thought she owed an apology ere she retreated What sort of person he was she could not tell for there was not light enough to show a feature of his face I ask your pardon she said I fear I have done mischief Not the least returned the man in a gentle voice with a tone of amusement in it I had never seen a great cross bow Dorothy went on anxious to excuse her meddling I thought this must be one but I was so stupid as not to perceive it was bent and that that was the the handle or do you call it the trigger by which you let it go The man who had at first taken her for one of the maids had by this time discovered from her tone and speech that she was a lady It is a clumsy old fashioned thing he returned but I shall not remove it until I can put something better in its place and it would be a troublesome affair to get even a demiculverin up here not to mention the bad neighbour it would be to the ladies chambers I was just making a small experiment with it on the force of springs I believe I shall yet prove that much may be done with springs more perhaps and certainly at far less expense than with gunpowder which costs greatly is very troublesome to make occupies much space and is always like an unstable half treacherous friend within the gates to say nothing of the expense of cannon ten times that of an engine of timber and springs See what a strong chain your shot has broken Shall I show you how the thing works He spoke in a gentle even rapid voice a little hesitating now and then more through the greater part of this long utterance as if he were thinking to himself than addressing another Neither his tone nor manner were those of an underling but Dorothy s startled nerves had communicated their tremor to her modesty and with a gentle No sir I thank you I must be gone she hurried away Daring now a little more for fear of worse the first door she tried proved that of her own room and it was with a considerable sense of relief as well as with weariness and tremor that she nestled herself into the high window seat and looked out into the quadrangle The shadow of the citadel had gone to pay its afternoon visit to the other court and that of the gateway was thrown upon the chapel partly shrouding the white horse whose watery music was now silent but allowing one red ray which entered by the iron grating above the solid gates to fall on his head and warm its cold whiteness with a tinge of delicate pink The court was more still and silent than in the morning only now and then would a figure pass from one door to another along the side of the buildings or by one of the tiled paths dividing the turf A large peacock was slowly crossing the shadowed grass with a stately strut and rhythmic thrust of his green neck The moment he came out into the sunlight he spread his wheeled fan aloft and slowly pirouetting if the word can be allowed where two legs are needful in the very acme of vanity turned on all sides the quivering splendour of its hundred eyes where blue and green burst in the ecstasy of their union into a vapour of gold that the circle of the universe might see And truly the bird s vanity had not misled his judgment it was a sight to make the hearts of the angels throb out a dainty phrase or two more in the song of their thanksgiving Some pigeons white and blue grey with a lovely mingling and interplay of metallic lustres on their feathery throats but with none of that almost grotesque obtrusion of over driven individuality of kind in which the graciousness of common beauty is now sacrificed to the whim of the fashion the vulgar fancier initiates picked up the crumbs under the windows of lady Margaret s nursery or flew hither and thither among the roofs with wapping and whiffling wing But still from the next court came many and various mingling noises The sounds of drill had long ceased but those of clanking hammers were heard the more clearly now one now two now several together The smaller clearer one was that of the armourer the others those of the great smithy where the horse shoes were made the horses shod the smaller pieces of ordnance repaired locks and chains mended bolts forged and in brief every piece of metal about the castle from the cook s skillet to the winches and chains of the drawbridges set right renewed or replaced The forges were far from where she sat outside the farthest of the two courts across which and the great hall dividing them the clink clink the clank and the ringing clang softened by distance and interposition came musical to her ear The armourer s hammer was the keener the quicker the less intermittent and yet had the most variations of time and note as he shifted the piece on his anvil or changed breastplate for gorget or greave for pauldron or it might be sword for pike head or halbert Mingled with it came now and then the creak and squeak of the wooden wheel at the draw well near the hall door in the farther court and the muffled splash of the bucket as it struck the water deep in the shaft She even thought she could hear the drops dripping back from it as it slowly ascended but that was fancy Everywhere arose the auricular vapour as it were of action undefined and indefinable the hum of the human hive compounded of all confluent noises the chatter of the servants hall and the nursery the stamping of horses the ringing of harness the ripping of the chains of kenneled dogs the hollow stamping of heavy boots the lowing of cattle with sounds besides so strange to the ears of Dorothy that they set her puzzling in vain to account for them not to mention the chaff of the guard rooms by the gates and the scolding and clatter of the kitchen This last indeed was audible only when the doors were open for the walls of the kitchen whether it was that the builders of it counted cookery second only to life or that this had been judged from the nature of the ground outside the corner of all the enclosure most likely to be attacked were far thicker than those of any of the other towers with the one exception of the keep itself As she sat listening to these multitudinous exhalations of life around her yet with a feeling of loneliness and a dim sense of captivity from the consciousness that huge surrounding walls rose between her and the green fields of which from earliest memory she had been as free as the birds and beetles a white rabbit escaped from the arms of its owner little Mary Somerset lady Margaret s only child a merry but delicate girl not yet three years old suddenly darted like a flash of snow across the shadowy green followed in hot haste a moment after by a fine looking boy of thirteen and two younger girls after whom toddled tiny Mary Dorothy sat watching the pursuit accompanied with sweet outcry and frolic laughter when in a moment the sounds of their merriment changed to shrieks of terror and she saw a huge mastiff come bounding she knew not whence and rush straight at the rabbit fierce and fast When the little creature saw him struck with terror it stopped dead cowered on the sward and was stock still But Henry Somerset who was but a few paces from it reached it before the dog and caught it up in his arms The rush of the dog threw him down and they rolled over and over Henry holding fast the poor rabbit By this time Dorothy was half way down the stair the moment she caught sight of the dog she had flown to the rescue When she issued from the porch at the foot of the grand staircase Henry was up again and running for the house with the rabbit yet safe in his arms pursued by the mastiff Evidently the dog had not harmed him but he might get angry The next moment she saw to her joy and dismay both at once that it was her own dog Marquis Marquis she cried calling him by his name He abandoned the pursuit at once and went bounding to her She took him by the back of the neck and the displeasure manifest upon the countenance of his mistress made him cower at her feet and wince from the open hand that threatened him The same instant a lattice window over the gateway was flung open and a voice said Here I am Who called me Dorothy looked up The children had vanished with their rescued darling There was not a creature in the court but herself and there was the marquis leaning half out of the window and looking about Who called me he repeated angrily Dorothy thought All at once the meaning of it flashed upon her and she was confounded ready to sink with annoyance But she was not one to hesitate when a thing HAD to be done Keeping her hold of the dog s neck for his collar was gone she dragged him half way towards the gate then turning up to the marquis a face like a peony replied I am the culprit my lord By saint George you are a brave damsel and there is no culpa that I know of except on the part of that intruding cur And the cur s mistress my lord But indeed he is no cur but a true mastiff What is the animal thy property fair cousin He is more than I bargained for He is mine my lord but I left him chained when I set out from Wyfern this morning That he got loose I confess I am not astonished neither that he tracked me hither for he has the eyes of a gaze hound and the nose of a bloodhound but it amazes me to find him in the castle That must be inquired into said the marquis I am very sorry he has carried himself so ill my lord He has put me to great shame But he hath more in him than mere brute and understands when I beg you to pardon him He misbehaved himself on purpose to be taken to me for at home no one ever dares punish him but myself The marquis laughed If you are so completely his mistress then why did you call on me for help Pardon me my lord I did not so Why I heard thee call me two or three times Alas my lord I called him Marquis when he was a pup Everybody about Redware knows Marquis The animal cocked his ears and started each time his name was uttered and yet seemed to understand well enough that ALL the talk was about him and his misdeeds Ah ha said his lordship with a twinkle in his eye that begets complications Two marquises in Raglan Two kings in England The thing cannot be What is to be done I must take him back my lord I cannot send him for he would not go I dread they will not be able to hold him chained in which evil case I fear me I shall have to go my lord and take the perils of the time as they come Not of necessity so cousin while you can choose between us although I freely grant that a marquis with four legs is to be preferred before a marquis with only two But what if you changed his name I fear it could not be done my lord He has been Marquis all his life And I have been marquis only six months Clearly he hath the better right But there would be constant mistakes between us for I cannot bring myself to lay aside the honour his majesty hath conferred upon me which would be worn now in its newest gloss not cast aside so soon as master Shakspere says Besides it would be a slight to his majesty and that must not be thought of not for all the dogs in parliament or out of it No it would breed factions in the castle too No one of us two must die Then indeed I must go said Dorothy her voice trembling as she spoke for although the words of the marquis were merry she yet feared for her friend Tut tut let the older marquis die he has enjoyed the title I have not Give him to Tom Fool he will drown him in the moat He shall be buried with honour under his rival s favourite apple tree in the orchard What more could dog desire No my lord answered Dorothy Will you allow me to take my leave If I only knew where to find my horse What would you saddle him yourself cousin Vaughan As well as e er a knave in your lordship s stables I am very sorry to displease you but to my dog s death I cannot and will not consent Pardon me my lord The last words brought with them a stifled sob for she scarcely doubted any more that he was in earnest It is assuredly not gratifying to a marquis of the king s making to have one of a damsel s dubbing take the precedence of him I fear you are a roundhead and hold by the parliament But no that cannot be for you are willing to forsake your new cousin for your old dog Nay alas it is your old cousin for your young dog Puritan puritan Well it cannot be helped But what you would ride home alone Evil men are swarming child This sultry weather brings them out like flies I shall not be alone my lord Marquis will take good care of me Indeed my lord marquis will pledge himself to nothing outside his own walls I meant the dog my lord Ah you see how awkward it is However as you will not choose between us and to tell the truth I am not yet quite prepared to die we must needs encounter what is inevitable I will send for one of the keepers to take him to the smithy and get him a proper collar one he can t slip like that he left at home and a chain I must go with him myself my lord They will never manage him else What a demon you have brought into my peaceable house Go with him by all means And mind you choose him a kennel yourself You do not desire him in your chamber do you mistress Dorothy secretly thought it would be the best place for him but she was only too glad to have his life spared No my lord I thank you she said I thank your lordship with all my heart The marquis disappeared from the window Presently young Scudamore came into the court from the staircase by the gate and crossed to the hall in a few minutes returning with the keeper The man would have taken the dog by the neck to lead him away but a certain form of canine curse not loud but deep and a warning word from Dorothy made him withdraw his hand Take care mister Keeper she said he is dangerous I will go with him myself if thou wilt show me whither As it please you mistress answered the keeper and led the way across the court Have you not a word to throw at a poor cousin mistress Dorothy said Rowland when the man was a pace or two in advance No mister Scudamore answered Dorothy not until we have first spoken in my lord Worcester s or my lady Margaret s presence Scudamore fell behind followed her a little way and somewhere vanished Dorothy followed the keeper across the hall the size of which its height especially and the splendour of its windows of stained glass almost awed her then across the next court to the foot of the Library Tower forming the south east corner of it near the two towers flanking the main entrance Here a stair led down through the wall to a lower level outside where were the carpenters and all other workshops the forges the stables and the farmyard buildings As it happened when Dorothy entered the smithy there was her own little horse being shod and Marquis and he interchanged a whine and a whinny of salutation while the men stared at the bright apparition of a young lady in their dingy regions Having heard her business the head smith abandoned everything else to alter an iron collar of which there were several lying about to fit the mastiff the presence of whose mistress proved entirely necessary Dorothy had indeed to put it on him with her own hands for at the sound of the chain attached to it he began to grow furious growling fiercely When the chain had been made fast with a staple driven into a strong kennel post and his mistress proceeded to take her leave of him his growling changed to the most piteous whining but when she actually left him there he flew into a rage of indignant affection After trying the strength of his chain however by three or four bounds each so furious as to lay him sprawling on his back he yielded to the inevitable and sullenly crept into his kennel while Dorothy walked back to the room which had already begun to seem to her a cell CHAPTER XIII THE MAGICIAN S VAULT Dorothy went straight to lady Margaret s parlour and made her humble apology for the trouble and alarm her dog had occasioned Lady Margaret assured her that the children were nothing the worse not having been even much terrified for the dog had not gone a hair s breadth beyond rough play Poor bunny was the only one concerned who had not yet recovered his equanimity He did not seem positively hurt she said but as he would not eat the lovely clover under his nose where he lay in Molly s crib it was clear that the circulation of his animal spirits had been too rudely checked Thereupon Dorothy begged to be taken to the nursery for being familiar with all sorts of tame animals she knew rabbits well As she stood with the little creature in her arms gently stroking its soft whiteness the children gathered round her and she bent herself to initiate a friendship with them while doing her best to comfort and restore their favourite Success in the latter object she found the readiest way to the former Under the sweet galvanism of her stroking hand the rabbit was presently so much better that when she offered him a blade of the neglected clover the equilateral triangle of his queer mouth was immediately set in motion the trefoil vanished and when he was once more placed in the crib he went on with his meal as if nothing had happened The children were in ecstasies and cousin Dorothy was from that moment popular and on the way to be something better When supper time came lady Margaret took her again to the dining room where there was much laughter over the story of the two marquises lord Worcester driving the joke in twenty different directions but so kindly that Dorothy instead of being disconcerted or even discomposed thereby found herself emboldened to take a share in the merriment When the company rose lady Margaret once more led her to her own room where working at her embroidery frame she chatted with her pleasantly for some time Dorothy would have been glad if she had set her work also for she could ill brook doing nothing Notwithstanding her quietness of demeanour amounting at times to an appearance of immobility her nature was really an active one and it was hard for her to sit with her hands in her lap Lady Margaret at length perceived her discomfort I fear my child I am wearying you she said It is only that I want something to do madam said Dorothy I have nothing at hand for you to night returned lady Margaret Suppose we go and find my lord I mean my own lord Herbert I have not seen him since we broke fast together and you have not seen him at all I am afraid he must think of leaving home again soon he seems so anxious to get something or other finished As she spoke she pushed aside her frame and telling Dorothy to go and fetch herself a cloak went into the next room whence she presently returned wrapped in a hooded mantle As soon as Dorothy came she led her along the corridor to a small lobby whence a stair descended to the court issuing close by the gate I shall never learn my way about said Dorothy If it were only the staircases they are more than my memory will hold Lady Margaret gave a merry little laugh Harry set himself to count them the other day she said I do not remember how many he made out altogether but I know he said there were at least thirty stone ones Dorothy s answer was an exclamation But she was not in the mood to dwell upon the mere arithmetic of vastness Invaded by the vision of the mighty structure its aspect rendered yet more imposing by the time which now suited with it she forgot lady Margaret s presence and stood still to gaze The twilight had deepened half way into night There was no moon and in the dusk the huge masses of building rose full of mystery and awe Above the rest the great towers on all sides seemed by indwelling might to soar into the regions of air The pile stood there the epitome of the story of an ancient race the precipitate from its vanished life a hard core that had gathered in the vaporous mass of history the all of solid that remained to witness of the past She came again to herself with a start Lady Margaret had stood quietly waiting for her mood to change Dorothy apologised but her mistress only smiled and said I am in no haste child I like to see another impressed as I was when first I stood just where you stand now Come then I will show you something different She led the way along the southern side of the court until they came to the end of the chapel opposite which an archway pierced the line of building and revealed the mighty bulk of the citadel the only portion of the castle except the kitchen tower continuing impregnable to enlarged means of assault gunpowder itself as yet far from perfect in composition and make and conditioned by clumsy uncertain and ill adjustable artillery was nearly powerless against walls more than ten feet in thickness I have already mentioned that one peculiarity of Raglan was a distinct moat surrounding its keep Immediately from the outer end of the archway a Gothic bridge of stone led across this thirty foot moat to a narrow walk which encompassed the tower The walk was itself encompassed and divided from the moat by a wall with six turrets at equal distances surmounted by battlements At one time the sole entrance to the tower had been by a drawbridge dropping across the walk to the end of the stone bridge from an arched door in the wall whose threshold was some ten or twelve feet from the ground but another entrance had since been made on the level of the walk and by it the two ladies now entered Passing the foot of a great stone staircase they came to the door of what had before the opening of the lower entrance been a vaulted cellar probably at one time a dungeon at a later period a place of storage but now put to a very different use and wearing a stranger aspect than it could ever have borne at any past period of its story a look indeed of mystery inexplicable When Dorothy entered she found herself in a large place the form of which she could ill distinguish in the dull light proceeding from the chinks about the closed doors of a huge furnace The air was filled with gurglings and strange low groanings as of some creature in dire pain Dorothy had as good nerves as ever woman yet she could not help some fright as she stood alone by the door and stared into the gloomy twilight into which her companion had advanced As her eyes became used to the ruddy dusk she could see better but everywhere they lighted on shapes inexplicable whose forms to the first questioning thought suggested instruments of torture but cruel as some of them looked they were almost too strange contorted fantastical for such Still the wood cuts in a certain book she had been familiar with in childhood commonly called Fox s Book of Martyrs kept haunting her mind s eye and were they not Papists into whose hands she had fallen she said to herself amused at the vagaries of her own involuntary suggestions Among the rest one thing specially caught her attention both from its size and its complicated strangeness It was a huge wheel standing near the wall supported between two strong uprights some twelve or fifteen feet in diameter with about fifty spokes from every one of which hung a large weight Its grotesque and threatful character was greatly increased by the mingling of its one substance with its many shadows on the wall behind it So intent was she upon it that she started when lady Margaret spoke Why mistress Dorothy she said you look as if you had wandered into saint Anthony s cave Here is my lord Herbert to welcome his cousin Beside her stood a man rather under the middle stature but as his back was to the furnace this was about all Dorothy could discover of his appearance save that he was in the garb of a workman with bare head and arms and held in his hand a long iron rod ending in a hook Welcome indeed cousin Vaughan he said heartily but without offering his hand which in truth although an honest skilful and well fashioned hand was at the present moment far from fit for a lady s touch There was something in his voice not altogether strange to Dorothy but she could not tell of whom or what it reminded her Are you come to take another lesson on the cross bow he asked with a smile Then she knew he was the same she had met in the looped chamber beside the arblast An occasional slight halt not impediment in his speech was what had remained on her memory Did he always dwell only in the dusky borders of the light Dorothy uttered a little Oh of surprise but immediately recovering herself said I am sorry I did not know it was you my lord I might by this time have been capable of discharging bolt or arrow with good aim in defence of the castle It is not yet too late I hope returned the workman lord I confess I was disappointed to find your curiosity went no further I hoped I had at last found a lady capable of some interest in pursuits like mine For my lady Margaret here she cares not a straw for anything I do and would rather have me keep my hands clean than discover the mechanism of the primum mobile Yes in truth Ned said his wife I would rather have thee with fair hands in my sweet parlour than toiling and moiling in this dirty dungeon with no companion but that horrible fire engine of thine grunting and roaring all night long Why what do you make of Caspar Kaltoff my lady I make not much of him You misjudge his goodfellowship then Truly I think not well of him he always hath secrets with thee and I like it not That they are secrets is thine own fault Peggy How can I teach thee my secrets if thou wilt not open thine ears to hear them I would your lordship would teach me said Dorothy I might not be an apt pupil but I should be both an eager and a humble one By saint Patrick mistress Dorothy but you go straight to steal my husband s heart from me Humble forsooth and eager too Nay nay If I have no part in his brain I can the less yield his heart What would be gladly learned would be gladly taught cousin said lord Herbert There there exclaimed lady Margaret I knew it would be so You discharge your poor dull apprentice the moment you find a clever one And why not I never was able to teach thee anything Ah Ned there you are unkind indeed said lady Margaret with something in her voice that suggested the water springs were swelling My shamrock of four said her husband in the tenderest tone I but jested with thee How shouldst thou be my pupil in anything I can teach I am yours in all that is noble and good I did not mean to vex you sweet heart Tis gone again Ned she answered smiling Give cousin Dorothy her first lesson It shall be that then to which I sought in vain to make thee listen this very morning a certain great saying of my lord of Verulam mistress Dorothy I had learnt it by heart that I might repeat it word for word to my lady but she would none of it May I not hear it madam said Dorothy We will both hear it Herbert if you will pardon your foolish wife and admit her to grace And as she spoke she laid her hand on his sooty arm He answered her only with a smile but such a one as sufficed Listen then ladies both he said My lord of Verulam having quoted the words of Solomon The glory of God is to conceal a thing but the glory of the king is to find it out adds thus of his own thought concerning them as if says my lord according to the innocent play of children the divine majesty took delight to hide his works to the end to have them found out and as if kings could not obtain a greater honour than to be God s playfellows in that game considering the great commandment of wits and means whereby nothing needeth to be hidden from them That was very well for my lord of what did saint thou call him Ned Francis Bacon lord Verulam returned Herbert with a queer smile Very well for my lord of Veryflam resumed lady Margaret with a mock yet bewitching affectation of innocence and ignorance but tell me had he nay I am sure he had not a wild Irishwoman sitting breaking her heart in her bower all day long for his company He could never else have had the heart to say it Mistress Dorothy she went on take the counsel of a forsaken wife and lay it to thy heart never marry a man who loves lathes and pipes and wheels and water and fire and I know not what But do come in ere bed time Herbert and I will sing thee the sweetest of English ditties and make thee such a sack posset as never could be made out of old Ireland any more than the song But her husband that moment sprang from her side and shouting Caspar Caspar bounded to the furnace reached up with his iron rod into the darkness over his head caught something with the hooked end of it and pulled hard A man who from somewhere in the gloomy place had responded like a greyhound to his master s call did the like on the other side Instantly followed a fierce protracted sustained hiss and in a moment the place was filled with a white cloud whence issued still the hideous hiss changing at length to a roar Lady Margaret turned in terror ran out of the keep and fled across the bridge and through the archway before she slackened her pace Dorothy followed but more composedly led by duty not driven by terror and indeed reluctantly forsaking a spot where was so much she did not understand They had fled from the infant roar of the first stock father of steam engines whose cradle was that feudal keep eight centuries old That night Dorothy lay down weary enough It seemed a month since she had been in her own bed at Wyfern so many new and strange things had crowded into her house hitherto so still Every now and then the darkness heaved and rippled with some noise of the night The stamping of horses and the ringing of their halter chains seemed very near her She thought she heard the howl of Marquis from afar and said to herself The poor fellow cannot sleep I must get my lord to let me have him in my chamber Then she listened a while to the sweet flow of the water from the mouth of the white horse which in general went on all night long Suddenly came an awful sound like a howl also but such as never left the throat of dog Again and again at intervals it came with others like it but not the same torturing the dark with a dismal fear Dorothy had never heard the cry of a wild beast but the suggestion that these might be such cries and the recollection that she had heard such beasts were in Raglan Castle came together to her mind She was so weary however that worse noises than these could hardly have kept her awake not even her weariness could prevent them from following her into her dreams CHAPTER XIV SEVERAL PEOPLE Lord Worcester had taken such a liking to Dorothy partly at first because of the good store of merriment with which she and her mastiff had provided him that he was disappointed when he found her place was not to be at his table but the housekeeper s As he said himself however he did not meddle with women s matters and indeed it would not do for lady Margaret to show her so much favour above her other women of whom at least one was her superior in rank and all were relatives as well as herself Dorothy did not much relish their society but she had not much of it except at meals when however they always treated her as an interloper Every day she saw more or less of lady Margaret and found in her such sweetness if not quite evenness of temper as well as gaiety of disposition that she learned to admire as well as love her Sometimes she had her to read to her sometimes to work with her and almost every day she made her practise a little on the harpsichord Hence she not only improved rapidly in performance but grew capable of receiving more and more delight from music There was a fine little organ in the chapel on which blind young Delaware the son of the marquis s master of the horse used to play delightfully and although she never entered the place she would stand outside listening to his music for an hour at a time in the twilight or sometimes even after dark For as yet she indulged without question all the habits of her hitherto free life as far as was possible within the castle walls and the outermost of these were of great circuit enclosing lawns shrubberies wildernesses flower and kitchen gardens orchards great fish ponds little lakes with fountains islands and summer houses not to mention the farmyard and indeed a little park in which were some of the finest trees upon the estate The gentlewomen with whom Dorothy was by her position in the household associated were three in number One was a rather elderly rather plain rather pious lady who did not insist on her pretensions to either of the epithets The second was a short plump round faced good natured smiling woman of sixty excelling in fasts and mortifications which somehow seemed to agree with her body as well as her soul The third was only two or three years older than Dorothy and was pretty except when she began to speak and then for a moment there was a strange discord in her features She took a dislike to Dorothy as she said herself the instant she cast her eyes upon her She could not bear that prim set face she said The country bred heifer evidently thought herself superior to every one in the castle She was persuaded the minx was a sly one and would carry tales So judged mistress Amanda Serafina Fuller after her kind Nor was it wonderful that being such as she was she should recoil with antipathy from one whose nature had a tendency to ripen over soon and stunt its slow orbicular expansion to the premature and false completeness of a narrow and self sufficing conscientiousness Doubtless if Dorothy had shown any marked acknowledgment of the precedency of their rights any eagerness to conciliate the aborigines of the circle the ladies would have been more friendly inclined but while capable of endless love and veneration there was little of the conciliatory in her nature Hence missus Doughty looked upon her with a rather stately indifference my lady Broughton with a mild wish to save her poor proud protestant soul and mistress Amanda Serafina said she hated her but then ever since the Fall there has been a disproportion betwixt the feelings of young ladies and the language in which they represent them missus Doughty neglected her and Dorothy did not know it lady Broughton said solemn things to her and she never saw the point of them but when mistress Amanda half closed her eyes and looked at her in snake Geraldine fashion she met her with a full wide orbed questioning gaze before which Amanda s eyes dropped and she sank full fathom five towards the abyss of real hatred During the dinner hour the three generally talked together in an impregnable manner not that they were by any means bosom friends for two of them had never before united in anything except despising good soft lady Broughton When they were altogether in their mistress s presence they behaved to Dorothy and to each other with studious politeness The ladies Elizabeth and Anne had their gentlewomen also in all only three however who also ate at the housekeeper s table but kept somewhat apart from the rest yet were in a distant way friendly to Dorothy But hers as we have seen was a nature far more capable of attaching itself to a few than of pleasing many and her heart went out to lady Margaret whom she would have come ere long to regard as a mother had she not behaved to her more like an elder sister Lady Margaret s own genuine behaviour had indeed little of the matronly in it when her husband came into the room she seemed to grow instantly younger and her manner changed almost to that of a playful girl It is true Dorothy had been struck with the dignity of her manner amid all the frankness of her reception but she soon found that although her nature was full of all real dignities that which belonged to her carriage never appeared in the society of those she loved and was assumed only like the thin shelter of a veil in the presence of those whom she either knew or trusted less Before her ladies she never appeared without some restraint manifest in a certain measuredness of movement slowness of speech and choice of phrase but before a month was over Dorothy was delighted to find that the reserve instantly vanished when she happened to be left alone with her She took an early opportunity of informing her mistress of the relationship between herself and Scudamore stating that she knew little or nothing of him having seen him only once before she came to the castle The youth on his part took the first fitting opportunity of addressing her in lady Margaret s presence and soon they were known to be cousins all over the castle With lady Margaret s help Dorothy came to a tolerable understanding of Scudamore Indeed her ladyship s judgment seemed but a development of her own feeling concerning him Rowland is not a bad fellow she said but I cannot fully understand whence he comes in such grace with my lord Worcester If it were my husband now I should not marvel he is so much occupied with things and engines that he has as little time as natural inclination to doubt any one who will only speak largely enough to satisfy his idea But my lord of Worcester knows well enough that seldom are two things more unlike than men and their words Yet that is not what I mean to say of your cousin he is no hypocrite means not to be false but has no rule of right in him so far as I can find He is pleasant company his gaiety his quips his readiness of retort his courtesy and what not make him a favourite and my lord hath in a manner reared him which goes to explain much He is quick yet indolent good natured but selfish generous but counting enjoyment the first thing though to speak truth of him I have never known him do a dishonourable action But in a word the star of duty has not yet appeared above his horizon Pardon me Dorothy if I am severe upon him More or less I may misjudge him but this is how I read him and if you wonder that I should be able so to divide him I have but to tell you that I should be unapt indeed if I had not yet learned of my husband to look into the heart of both men and things But madam Dorothy ventured to say have you not even now told me that from very goodness my lord is easily betrayed Well replied my child It is true but only while he has had no reason to mistrust Let him once perceive ground for dissatisfaction or suspicion and his eye is keen as light itself to penetrate and unravel Such good qualities as lady Margaret accorded her cousin were of a sort more fitted to please a less sedate and sober minded damsel than Dorothy who was fashioned rather after the model of a puritan than a royalist maiden Pleased with his address and his behaviour to herself as she could hardly fail to be she yet felt a lingering mistrust of him which sprang quite as much from the immediate impression as from her mistress s judgment of him for it always gave her a sense of not coming near the real man in him There is one thing a hypocrite even can never do and that is hide the natural signs of his hypocrisy and Rowland who was no hypocrite only a man not half so honourable as he chose to take himself for could not conceal his unreality from the eyes of his simple country cousin Little however did Dorothy herself suspect whence she had the idea that it was her girlhood s converse with real sturdy honest straight forward simple manhood in the person of the youth of fiery temper and obstinate opinionated sometimes even rude behaviour whom she had chastised with terms of contemptuous rebuke which had rendered her so soon capable of distinguishing between a profound and a shallow a genuine and an unreal nature even when the latter comprehended a certain power of fascination active enough to be recognisable by most of the women in the castle Concerning this matter it will suffice to say that lord Worcester who ruled his household with such authoritative wisdom that honest doctor Bayly avers he never saw a better ordered family never saw a man drunk or heard an oath amongst his servants all the time he was chaplain in the castle would have been scandalized to know the freedoms his favourite indulged himself in and regarded as privileged familiarities There was much coming and going of visitors more now upon state business than matters of friendship or ceremony and occasional solemn conferences were held in the marquis s private room at which sometimes lord John who was a personal friend of the king s and sometimes lord Charles the governor of the castle with perhaps this or that officer of dignity in the household would be present but whoever was or was not present lord Herbert when at home was always there sometimes alone with his father and commissioners from the king His absences however had grown frequent now that his majesty had appointed him general of South Wales and he had considerable forces under his command mostly raised by himself and maintained at his own and his father s expense It was some time after Dorothy had twice in one day met him darkling before she saw him in the light and was able to peruse his countenance which she did carefully with the mingled instinct and insight of curious and thoughtful girlhood He had come home from a journey changed his clothes and had some food and now he appeared in his wife s parlour to sun himself a little he said When he entered Dorothy who was seated at her mistress s embroidery frame while she was herself busy mending some Flanders lace rose to leave the room But he prayed her to be seated saying gayly I would have you see cousin that I am no beast of prey that loves the darkness I can endure the daylight Come my lady have you nothing to amuse your soldier with No good news to tell him How is my little Molly During the conjugal talk that followed his cousin had good opportunity of making her observations First she saw a fair well proportioned forehead with eyes whose remarkable clearness looked as if it owed itself to the mingling of manly confidence with feminine trustfulness They were dark not very large but rather prominent and full of light His nose was a little aquiline and perfectly formed A soft obedient moustache brushed thoroughly aside revealed right generous lips about which hovered a certain sweetness ever ready to break into the blossom of a smile That and a small tuft below was all the hair he wore upon his face Rare conjunction the whole of the countenance was remarkable both for symmetry and expression the latter mainly a bright intelligence and if strangely enough the predominant sweetness and delicacy at first suggested genius unsupported by practical faculty there was a plentifulness and strength in the chin which helped to correct the suggestion and with the brightness and prominence of the eyes and the radiance of the whole to give a brave almost bold look to a face which could hardly fail to remind those who knew them of the lovely verses of Matthew Raydon describing that of sir Philip Sidney A sweet attractive kinde of grace A full assurance given by lookes Continuall comfort in a face The lineaments of Gospell bookes I trowe that countenance cannot lie Whose thoughts are legible in the eie Notwithstanding the disadvantages of the fashion in the mechanical pursuits to which he had hitherto devoted his life he wore like Milton s Adam his wavy hair down to his shoulders In his youth it had been thick and curling now it was thinner and straighter yet curled where it lay His hands were small with the taper fingers that indicate the artist while his thumb was that of the artizan square at the tip with the first joint curved a good deal back That they were hard and something discoloured was not for Dorothy to wonder at when she remembered what she had both heard and seen of his occupations I may here mention that what aided Dorothy much in the interpretation of lord Herbert s countenance and the understanding of his character for it was not on this first observation of him that she could discover all I have now set down and tended largely to the development of the immense reverence she conceived for him was what she saw of his behaviour to his father one evening not long after when having been invited to the marquis s table she sat nearly opposite him at supper With a willing ear and ready smile for every one who addressed him notably courteous where all were courteous he gave chief observance amounting to an almost tender homage to his father His thoughts seemed to wait upon him with a fearless devotion He listened intently to all his jokes and laughed at them heartily evidently enjoying them even when they were not very good spoke to him with profound though easy respect made haste to hand him whatever he seemed to want preventing Scudamore and indeed conducted himself like a dutiful youth rather than a man over forty Their confident behaviour wherein the authority of the one and the submission of the other were acknowledged with company relative love was beautiful to behold When husband and wife had conferred for a while the former stretched on a settee embroidered by the skilful hands of the latest vanished countess his mother and the latter seated near him on a narrow tall backed chair mending her lace there came a pause in their low toned conversation and his lordship looking up seemed anew to become aware of the presence of Dorothy Well cousin he said how have you fared since we half saw each other a fortnight ago I have fared well indeed my lord I thank you said Dorothy as your lordship may judge knowing whom I serve In two short weeks my lady loads me with kindness enough to requite the loyalty of a life Look you cousin that I should believe such laudation of any less than an angel said his lordship with mock gravity No my lord answered Dorothy There was a moment s pause then lord Herbert laughed aloud Excellent well mistress Dorothy he cried Thank your cousin my lady for a compliment worthy of an Irishwoman I thank you Dorothy said her mistress although Irishwoman as I am my lord hath put me out of love with compliments When they are true and come unbidden my lady said Dorothy What are there such compliments cousin said lord Herbert There are birds of Paradise my lord though rarely encountered Birds of Paradise indeed they alight not in this world Birds of Paradise have no legs they say They need them not my lord Once alighted they fly no more How is it then they alight so seldom Because men shoo them away One flew now from my heart to seek my lady s but your lordship frighted it And so it flew back to Paradise eh mistress Dorothy said lord Herbert smiling archly The supper bell rang and instead of replying Dorothy looked up for her dismissal Go to supper my lady said lord Herbert I have but just dined and will see what Caspar is about I want no supper but my Herbert returned lady Margaret Thou wilt not go to that hateful workshop I have so little time at home now That you must spend it from your lady Go to supper Dorothy CHAPTER XV HUSBAND AND WIFE What an old fashioned damsel it is said lord Herbert when Dorothy had left the room She has led a lonely life answered lady Margaret and has read a many old fashioned books She seems a right companion for thee Peggy and I am glad of it for I shall be much from thee more and more I fear till this bitter weather be gone by Alas Ned hast thou not been more than much from me already Thou wilt certainly be killed though thou hast not yet a scratch on thy blessed body I would it were over and all well So would I and heartily dear heart In very truth I love fighting as little as thou But it is a thing that hath to be done though small honour will ever be mine therefrom I greatly fear me It is one of those affairs in which liking goes farther than goodwill and as I say I love it not only to do my duty Hence doubtless it comes that no luck attends me God knows I fear nothing a man ought not to fear he is my witness but what good service of arms have I yet rendered my king It is but thy face Peggy that draws the smile from me My heart is heavy See how my rascally Welsh yielded before Gloucester when the rogue Waller stole a march upon them and I must be from thence Had I but been there instead of at Oxford thinkest thou they would have laid down their arms nor struck a single blow I like not killing but I can kill and I can be killed Thou knowest sweet wife thy Ned would not run Holy mother exclaimed lady Margaret But I have no good luck at fighting he went on And how again at Monmouth the hare hearts with which I had thought to garrison the place fled at the bare advent of that same parliament beagle Waller By saint George it were easier to make an engine that should mow down a thousand brave men with one sweep of a scythe and I could make it than to put courage into the heart of one runaway rascal It makes me mad to think how they have disgraced me But Monmouth is thine own again Herbert Yes thanks to the love they bear my father not to my generalship Thy husband is a poor soldier Peggy he cannot make soldiers Then why not leave the field to others and labour at thy engines love If thou wilt I tell thee what I will doff my gown and in wrapper and petticoat help thee sweet I will to it with bare arms like thine own Thou wouldst like Una make a sunshine in the shady place Margaret But no Poor soldier as I am I will do my best even where good fortune fails me and glory awaits not my coming Thou knowest that at fourteen days warning I brought four thousand foot and eight hundred horse again to the siege of Gloucester It would ill befit my father s son to spare what he can when he is pouring out his wealth like water at the feet of his king No wife the king shall not find me wanting for in serving my king I serve my God and if I should fail it may hold that an honest failure comes nigh enough a victory to be set down in the chronicles of the high countries But in truth it presses on me sorely and I am troubled at heart that I should be so given over to failure Never heed it my lord The sun comes out clear at last maugre all the region fogs Thanks sweet heart Things do look up a little in the main and if the king had but a dozen more such friends as my lord marquis they would soon be well Why my dove of comfort wouldst thou believe it I did this day as I rode home to seek thy fair face I did count up what sums he hath already spent for his liege and indeed I could not recollect them all but I summed up of pounds already spent by him on his majesty s behalf well towards a hundred and fifty thousand And thou knowest the good man that while he giveth generously like the great Giver he giveth not carelessly but hath respect to what he spendeth Thy father Ned is loyalty and generosity incarnate If thou be but half so good a husband as thy father is a subject I am a happy woman What know saint thou not yet thy husband Peggy In good soberness though Ned surely the saints in heaven will never let such devotion fail of its end My father is but one and the king s foes are many So are his friends but they are lukewarm compared to my father the rich ones of them I mean Would to God I had not lost those seven great troop horses that the pudding fisted clothiers of Gloucester did rob me of I need them sorely now I bought them with mine own or rather with thine sweet heart I had been saving up the money for a carcanet for thy fair neck So my neck be fair in thine eyes my lord it may go bare and be well clad I should in sad earnest be jealous of the pretty stones didst thou give my neck one look the more for their presence Here thou may saint sell these the next time thou goest London wards As she spoke she put up her hand to unclasp her necklace of large pearls but he laid his hand upon it saying Nay Margaret there is no need My father is like the father in the parable he hath enough and to spare I did mean to have the money of him again only as the vaunted horses never came but were swallowed up of Gloucester as Jonah of the whale and have not yet been cast up again I could not bring my tongue to ask him for it and so thy neck is bare of emeralds my dove Back and sides go bare go bare sang lady Margaret with a merry laugh Both foot and hand go cold here she paused for a moment and looked down with a shining thoughtfulness then sang out clear and loud with bold alteration of bishop Stills drinking song But heart God send thee love enough Of the new that will never be old Amen my dove said lord Herbert Thou art in doleful dumps Ned If we had but a masque for thee or a play or even some jugglers with their balls Puh Peggy thou art masque and play both in one and for thy jugglers I trust I can juggle better at my own hand than any troop of them from furthest India Sing me a song sweet heart I will my love answered lady Margaret Rising she went to the harpsichord and sang in sweet unaffected style one of the songs of her native country a merry ditty with a breathing of sadness in the refrain of it like a twilight wind in a bed of bulrushes Thanks my love said lord Herbert when she had finished But I would I could tell its hidden purport for I am one of those who think music none the worse for carrying with it an air of such sound as speaks to the brain as well as the heart Lady Margaret gave a playful sigh Thou hast one fault my Edward thou art a stranger to the tongue in which through my old nurse s tales I learned the language of love I cannot call it my mother tongue but it is my love tongue Why when thou art from me I am loving thee in Irish all day long and thou never knowest what my heart says to thee It is a sad lack in thy all completeness dear heart But I bethink me thy new cousin did sing a fair song in thy own tongue the other day the which if thou canst understand one straw better than my Irish I will learn it for thy sake though truly it is Greek to me I will send for her Shall I As she spoke she rose and rang the bell on the table and a little page in waiting in the antechamber appeared whom she sent to desire the attendance of mistress Dorothy Vaughan Come child said her mistress as she entered I would have thee sing to my lord the song that wandering harper taught thee Madam I have learned of no wandering harper your ladyship means mistress Amanda s Welsh song shall I call her said Dorothy disappointed I mean thee and thy song thou green linnet rejoined lady Margaret What song was it of which I said to thee that the singer deserved for his very song s sake that whereof he made his moan Whence thou hadst it from harper or bagpiper I care not Excuse me madam but why should I sing that you love not to hear It is not I would hear it child but I would have my lord hear it I would fain prove to him that there are songs in plain English as he calls it that have as little import even to an English ear as the plain truth speaking Irish ditties which he will not understand I say WILL not because our bards tell us that Irish was the language of Adam and Eve while yet in Paradise and therefore he could by instinct understand it an he would even as the chickens understand their mother tongue I will sing it at your desire madam but I fear the worse fault will lie in the singing She seated herself at the harpsichord and sang the following song with much feeling and simplicity The refrain of the song if it may be so called instead of closing each stanza preluded it O fair O sweet when I do look on thee In whom all joys so well agree Heart and soul do sing in me This you hear is not my tongue Which once said what I conceived For it was of use bereaved With a cruel answer stung No though tongue to roof be cleaved Fearing lest he chastis d be Heart and soul do sing in me O fair O sweet c Just accord all music makes In thee just accord excelleth Where each part in such peace dwelleth One of other beauty takes Since then truth to all minds telleth That in thee lives harmony Heart and soul do sing in me O fair O sweet c They that heaven have known do say That whoso that grace obtaineth To see what fair sight there reigneth Forced is to sing alway So then since that heaven remaineth In thy face I plainly see Heart and soul do sing in me O fair O sweet c Sweet think not I am at ease For because my chief part singeth This song from death s sorrow springeth As to Swan in last disease For no dumbness nor death bringeth Stay to true love s melody Heart and soul do sing in me There cried lady Margaret with a merry laugh What says the English song to my English husband It says much Margaret returned lord Herbert who had been listening intently it tells me to love you for ever What poet is he who wrote the song mistress Dorothy He is not of our day that I can tell but too plainly It is a good song and saith much I found it near the end of the book called The Countess of Pembroke s Arcadia replied Dorothy And I knew it not Methought I had read all that man of men ever wrote said lord Herbert But I may have read it and let it slip But now that by the help of the music and thy singing cousin Dorothy I am come to understand it truly I shall forget it no more Where got saint thou the music pray It says in the book it was fitted to a certain Spanish tune the name of which I knew not and yet know not how to pronounce but I had the look of the words in my head and when I came upon some Spanish songs in an old chest at home and turning them over saw those words I knew I had found the tune to sir Philip s verses Tell me then my lord why you are pleased with the song said lady Margaret very quietly Come mistress Dorothy said lord Herbert repeat the song to my lady slowly line by line and she will want no exposition thereon When Dorothy had done as he requested lady Margaret put her arm round her husband s neck laid her cheek to his and said I am a goose Ned It is a fair and sweet song I thank you Dorothy You shall sing it to me another time when my lord is away and I shall love to think my lord was ill content with me when I called it a foolish thing But my Irish was a good song too my lord Thy singing of it proves it sweet heart But come my fair minstrel thou hast earned a good guerdon what shall I give thee in return for thy song A boon a boon my lord cried Dorothy It is thine ere thou ask it returned his lordship merrily following up the old fashioned phrase with like formality I must then tell my lord what hath been in my foolish mind ever since my lady took me to the keep and I saw his marvellous array of engines I would glady understand them my lord Who can fail to delight in such inventions as bring about that which before seemed impossible Here came a little sigh with the thought of her old companion Richard and the things they had together contrived Already on the mist of gathering time a halo had begun to glimmer about his head puritan fanatic blasphemer even as she had called him Lord Herbert marked the soundless sigh You shall not sigh in vain mistress Dorothy he said for anything I can give you To one who loves inventions it is easy to explain them I hoped you had a hankering that way when I saw you look so curiously at the cross bow ere you discharged it Was it then charged my lord Indeed as it happened it was A great steel headed arrow lay in the groove I ought to have taken that away when I bent it Some passing horseman may have carried it with him in the body of his plunging steed Oh my lord cried Dorothy aghast Pray do not be alarmed cousin I but jested Had anything happened we should have heard of it It was not in the least likely You will not be long in this house before you learn that we do not speak by the card here We jest not a little But in truth I was disappointed when I found your curiosity so easily allayed Indeed my lord it was not allayed and is still unsatisfied But I had no thought who it was offered me the knowledge I craved Had I known I should never have refused the lesson so courteously offered But I was a stranger in the castle and I thought I feared I You did even as prudence required cousin Dorothy A young maiden cannot be too chary of unbuckling her enchanted armour so long as the country is unknown to her But it would be hard if she were to suffer for her modesty You shall be welcome to my cave I trust you will not find it as the cave of Trophonius to you If I am not there and it is not now as it has been when you might have found me in it every day and almost every hour of the day but if I be not there do not fear Caspar Kaltoff who is a worthy man and as my right hand to do the things my brain deviseth I will speak to him of thee He is full of trust and worthiness and although not of gentle blood is sprung from a long race of artificers the cloak of whose gathered skill seems to have fallen on him He hath been in my service now for many years but you will be the first lady gentle cousin who has ever in all that time wished us good speed in our endeavours How few know he went on thoughtfully after a pause what a joy lies in making things obey thoughts in calling out of the mind as from the vasty deep and setting in visible presence before the bodily eye that which till then had neither local habitation nor name Some such marvels I have to show for marvels I must call them although it is my voice they have obeyed to come and I never lose sight of the marvel even while amusing myself with the merest toy of my own invention He paused and Dorothy ventured to speak I thank you my lord with all my heart When have I leave to visit those marvels When you please If I am not there Caspar will be If Caspar is not there you will find the door open for to enter that chamber without permission would be a breach of law such as not a soul in Raglan would dare be guilty of And were it not so there are few indeed in the place who would venture to set foot in it if I were absent for it is not outside the castle walls only that I am looked upon as a magician The armourer firmly believes that with a word uttered in my den there I could make the weakest wall of the castle impregnable but that it would be at too great a cost If you come to morrow morning you will find me almost certainly But in case you should find neither of us do not touch anything be content with looking for fear of mischance Engines are as tickle to meddle with as incantations them selves If I know myself you may trust me my lord said Dorothy to which he replied with a smile of confidence CHAPTER XVI DOROTHY S INITIATION There was much about the castle itself to interest Dorothy She had already begun the attempt to gather a clear notion of its many parts and their relations but the knowledge of the building could not well advance more rapidly than her acquaintance with its inmates for little was to be done from the outside alone and she could not bear to be met in strange places by strange people So that part of her education I use the word advisedly for to know all about the parts of an old building may do more for the education of minds of a certain stamp than the severest course of logic must wait upon time and opportunity Every day often twice sometimes thrice she would visit the stable yard and have an interview first with the chained Marquis and then with her little horse After that she would seldom miss looking in at the armourer s shop and spending a few minutes in watching him at his work so that she was soon familiar with all sorts of armour favoured in the castle The blacksmiths and the carpenters shops were also an attraction to her and it was not long before she knew all the artisans about the place There were the farm and poultry yards too with which kinds of place she was familiar especially with their animals and all their ways The very wild beasts in their dens in the solid basement of the kitchen tower a panther two leopards an ounce and a toothless old lion had already begun to know her a little for she never went near their cages without carrying them something to eat For all these visits there was plenty of room lady Margaret never requiring much of her time in the early part of the day and finding the reports she brought of what was going on always amusing And now the orchards and gardens would soon be inviting for the heart of the world was already sending up its blood to dye the apple blossoms But all the opportunities she yet had were less than was needful for the development of such a mind as Dorothy s which powerful in itself needed to be roused and was slow in its movements except when excited by a quick succession of objects or the contact of a kindred but busier nature It was lacking not only in generative but in self moving energy Of self sustaining force she had abundance There was a really fine library in the castle to which she had free access and whence now and then lady Margaret would make her bring a book from which to read aloud while she and her other ladies were at work but books were not enough to rouse Dorothy and when inclined to read she would return too exclusively to what she already knew making little effort to extend her gleaning ground From this fragment of analysis it will be seen that the new resource thus opened to her might prove of more consequence than great as were her expectations from it she was yet able to anticipate But infinitely greater good than any knowledge of his mechanical triumphs could bring her was on its way to Dorothy along the path of growing acquaintance with the noble minded inventor himself The next morning then she was up before the sun and sitting at her window awaited his arrival The moment he shone upon the gilded cock of the bell tower she rose and hastened out eager to taste of the sweets promised her stood a moment to gaze on the limpid stream ever flowing from the mouth of the white horse and wonder whence that and the whale spouts he so frequently sent aloft from his nostrils came then passing through the archway and over the bridge found herself at the magician s door For a moment she hesitated from within came such a tumult of hammering that plainly it was of no use to knock and she could not at once bring herself to enter unannounced and uninvited But confidence in lord Herbert soon aroused her courage and gently she opened the door and peeped in There he stood in a linen frock that reached from his neck to his knees already hard at work at a small anvil on a bench while Caspar was still harder at work at a huge anvil on the ground in front of a forge This with the mighty bellows attached to it occupied one of the six sides of the room and the great roaring hissing thing that had so frightened lady Margaret now silent and cold occupied another Neither of the men saw her So she entered closed the door and approached lord Herbert but he continued unaware of her presence until she spoke Then he ceased his hammering turned and greeted her with his usual smile of sincerity absolute Are you always as true to your appointments cousin he said and resumed his hammering It was hardly an appointment my lord and yet here I am said Dorothy And you mean to infer that An appointment is no slight matter my lord or one that admits of breaking Right returned his lordship still hammering at the thin plate of whitish metal growing thinner and thinner under his blows Dorothy glanced around her for a moment I would not be troublesome my lord she said but would you tell me in a few words what it is you make here Had I three tongues and thou three ears answered lord Herbert I could not But look round thee cousin and when thou spiest the thing that draws thine eye more than another ask me concerning that and I will tell thee Hardly had Dorothy in obedience cast her eyes about the place ere they lighted on the same huge wheel which had before chiefly attracted her notice What is that great wheel for with such a number of weights hung to it she asked For a memorial replied lord Herbert of the folly of the man who placeth his hopes in man That wonderful engine it is now nearly three years since I showed it to his blessed majesty in the Tower of London also with him to the dukes of Richmond and Hamilton and two extraordinary ambassadors besides but of them all no man hath ever sought to look upon it again It is a form of the Proteus like perpetuum mobile a most incredible thing if not seen He then proceeded to show her how as every spoke passed the highest point the weight attached to it immediately hung a foot farther from the centre of the wheel and as every spoke passed the lowest point its weight returned a foot nearer to the centre thus causing the leverage to be greater always on one and the same side of the wheel Few of my readers will regret so much as myself that I am unable to give them the constructive explanation his lordship gave Dorothy as to the shifting of the weights Whether she understood it or not I cannot tell either but that is of less consequence Before she left the workshop that morning she had learned that a thousand knowledges are needed to build up the pyramid on whose top alone will the bird of knowledge lay her new egg When he had finished his explanation lord Herbert returned to his work leaving Dorothy again to her own observations And now she would gladly have questioned him about the huge mass of brick and iron which now standing silent cold and motionless as death had that night seemed alive with the fierce energy of flame and yet sorely driven sighing and groaning and furiously hissing but as it was not now at work she thought it would be better to wait an opportunity when it should be in the agony of its wrestle with whatever unseen enemy it coped withal She did not know that the first of its race it was not quite equal to the task the magician had imposed upon it but that its descendants would at length become capable of doing a thousand times as much with the swinging joy of conscious might with the pant of the giant not the groan of the overtasked stripling urging his last effort She was standing by a chest examining the strangely elaborate and mysterious looking scutcheon of its lock when his lordship s hammering ceased and presently she found that he was by her side That escutcheon is the best thing of the kind I have yet made he said A humour I have never to be contented to produce any invention the second time without appearing refined The lock and key of this are in themselves a marvel for the little triangle screwed key weighs no more than a shilling and yet it bolts and unbolts an hundred bolts through fifty staples round about the chest and as many more from both sides and ends and at the self same time shall fasten it to a place beyond a man s natural strength to take it away But the best thing is the escutcheon for the owner of it though a woman may with her own delicate hand vary the ways of coming to open the lock ten millions of times beyond the knowledge of the smith that made it or of me who invented it If a stranger open it it setteth an alarm agoing which the stranger cannot stop from running out and besides though none should be within hearing yet it catcheth his hand as a trap doth a fox and though far from maiming him yet it leaveth such a mark behind it as will discover him if suspected the escutcheon or lock plainly showing what moneys he hath taken out of the box to a farthing and how many times opened since the owner hath been at it He then showed her how to set it left the chest open and gave her the key off his bunch that she might use it more easily Ere she returned it she had made herself mistress of the escutcheon as far as the mere working of it was concerned as she proved to the satisfaction of the inventor Her docility and quickness greatly pleased him He opened a cabinet and after a search in its drawers took from it a little thing in form and colour like a plum which he gave her telling her to eat it She saw from his smile that there was something at the back of the playful request and for a moment hesitated but reading in his countenance that he wished her at least to make the attempt she put it in her mouth She was gagged She could neither open nor shut her mouth a hair s breadth could neither laugh cry out nor make any noise beyond an ugly one she would not make twice The tears came into her eyes for her position was ludicrous and she imagined that his lordship was making game of her A girl less serious or more merry would have been moved only to laughter But lord Herbert hastened to relieve her On the application of a tiny key fixed with a joint in a finger ring the little steel bolts it had thrown out in every direction returned within the plum and he drew it from her mouth You little fool he said with indescribable sweetness for he saw the tears in her eyes did you think I would hurt you No my lord but I did fear you were going to make game of me I could not have borne Caspar to see me so Alas my poor child he rejoined you have come to the wrong house if you cannot put up with a little chafing There he added putting the plum in her hand it is an untoothsome thing but the moment may come when you will find it useful enough to repay you for the annoyance of a smile that had in it ten times more friendship than merriment I ask your pardon my lord said Dorothy by this time blushing deep with shame of her mistrust and over sensitiveness and on the point of crying downright But his lordship smiled so kindly that she took heart and smiled again He then showed her how to raise the key hid in the ring and how to unlock the plum Do not try it on yourself he said as he put the ring on her finger you might find that awkward Be sure I shall avoid it my lord returned Dorothy And do not let any one know you have such a thing he said or that there is a key in your ring I will try not my lord The breakfast bell rang If you will come again after supper he said as he pulled off his linen frock I will show you my fire engine at work and tell you all that is needful to the understanding thereof only you must not publish it to the world he added for I mean to make much gain by my invention Dorothy promised and they parted lord Herbert for the marquis s parlour Dorothy for the housekeeper s room and Caspar for the third table in the great hall After breakfast Dorothy practised with her plum until she could manage it with as much readiness as ease She found that it was made of steel and that the bolts it threw out upon the slightest pressure were so rounded and polished that they could not hurt while nothing but the key would reduce them again within their former sheath END OF VOL I End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of saint George and saint Michael Vol I by George MacDonald END OF
