none	none	Everything has been in such a hubbub and those two ridiculous children have been so afraid they wouldn t be together every minute possible that any really rational conversation with either of them was out of the question When Billy broke the engagement last spring none of us knew why she had done it as you know and I fancy we shall be almost as much in the dark as to why she has er mended it now as you might say As near as I can make out however she thought he didn t want her and he thought she didn t want him I believe matters were still further complicated by a girl Bertram was painting and a young fellow that used to sing with Billy a mister Arkwright Anyhow things came to a head last spring Billy broke the engagement and fled to parts unknown with Aunt Hannah leaving Bertram

none	none	in Boston to alternate between stony despair and reckless gayety according to William and it was while he was in the latter mood that he had that awful automobile accident and broke his arm and almost his neck He was wildly delirious and called continually for Billy Well it seems Billy didn t know all this but a week ago she came home and in some way found out about it I think through Pete William s old butler you know Just exactly what happened I can t say but I do know that she dragged poor old Aunt Hannah down to Bertram s at some unearthly hour and in the rain and Aunt Hannah couldn t do a thing with her All Billy would say was

none	none	And Aunt Hannah told me that if I could have seen Billy s face I d have known that she d have gone to Bertram then if he d been at the top of the Himalaya Mountains or at the bottom of the China Sea So perhaps it s just as well for Aunt Hannah s sake at least that he was in no worse place than on his own couch at home Anyhow she went and in half an hour they blandly informed Aunt Hannah that they were going to be married to day Aunt Hannah said she tried to stop that and get them to put it off till October the original date you know but Bertram was obdurate And when he declared he d marry her the next day if it wasn t for the new license law Aunt Hannah said she gave up for fear he d get a special dispensation or go to the Governor or the President or do some other dreadful thing What a funny old soul Aunt Hannah is Bertram told me that he should never feel safe till Billy was really his that she d read something or hear something or think something or get a letter from me as if anything I could say would do any good or harm and so break the engagement again Well she s his now so I suppose he s satisfied though for my part I haven t changed my mind at all I still say that they are not one bit suited to each other and that matrimony will simply ruin his career Bertram never has loved and never will love any girl long except to paint But if he simply would get married why couldn t he have taken a nice sensible domestic girl that would have kept him fed and mended Not but that I m very fond of Billy as you know dear but imagine Billy as a wife worse yet a mother Billy s a dear girl but she knows about as much of real life and its problems as as our little Kate A more impulsive irresponsible regardless of consequences young woman I never saw She can play divinely and write delightful songs I ll acknowledge but what is that when a man is hungry or has lost a button Billy has had her own way and had everything she wanted for years now a rather dangerous preparation for marriage especially marriage to a fellow like Bertram who has had his own way and everything he s wanted for years Pray what s going to happen when those ways conflict and neither one gets the thing wanted And think of her ignorance of cooking but there What s the use They re married now and it can t be helped Mercy what a letter I ve written But I had to talk to some one besides I d promised I to let you know how matters stood as soon as I could As you see though my trip East has been practically useless I saw the wedding to be sure but I didn t prevent it or even postpone it though I meant to do one or the other else I should never have made that tiresome journey half across the continent at two hours notice However we shall see what we shall see As for me I m dead tired Good night Affectionately yours KATE Quite naturally missus Kate Hartwell was not the only one who was thinking that evening of the wedding In the home of Bertram s brother Cyril Cyril himself was at the piano but where his thoughts were was plain to be seen or rather heard for from under his fingers there came the Lohengrin wedding march until all the room seemed filled with the scent of orange blossoms the mistiness of floating veils and the echoing peals of far away organs heralding the Fair Bride and Groom Over by the table in the glowing circle of the shaded lamp sat Marie Cyril s wife a dainty sewing basket by her side Her hands however lay idly across the stocking in her lap As the music ceased she drew a long sigh What a perfectly beautiful wedding that was she breathed Cyril whirled about on the piano stool It was a very sensible wedding he said with emphasis They looked so happy both of them went on Marie dreamily so so sort of above and beyond everything about them as if nothing ever ever could trouble them now Cyril lifted his eyebrows Humph Well as I said before it was a very sensible wedding he declared This time Marie noticed the emphasis She laughed though her eyes looked a little troubled I know dear of course what you mean I thought our wedding was beautiful but I would have made it simpler if I d realized in time how you you How I abhorred pink teas and purple pageants he finished for her with a frowning smile Oh well I stood it for the sake of what it brought me His face showed now only the smile the frown had vanished For a man known for years to his friends as a hater of women and all other confusion Cyril Henshaw was looking remarkably well pleased with himself His wife of less than a year colored as she met his gaze Hurriedly she picked up her needle The man laughed happily at her confusion What are you doing Is that my stocking he demanded A look half pain half reproach crossed her face Why Cyril of course not You you told me not to long ago You said my darns made bunches Ho I meant I didn t want to wear them retorted the man upon whom the tragic wretchedness of that half sobbed bunches had been quite lost I love to see you mending them he finished with an approving glance at the pretty little picture of domesticity before him A peculiar expression came to Marie s eyes Why Cyril you mean you like to have me mend them just for for the sake of seeing me do it when you know you won t ever wear them Sure nodded the man imperturbably Then with a sudden laugh he asked I wonder now does Billy love to mend socks Marie smiled but she sighed too and shook her head I m afraid not Cyril Nor cook Marie laughed outright this time The vaguely troubled look had fled from her eyes Oh Billy s helped me beat eggs and butter sometimes but I never knew her to cook a thing or want to cook a thing but once then she spent nearly two weeks trying to learn to make puddings for you For me Marie puckered her lips queerly Well I supposed they were for you at the time At all events she was trying to make them for some one of you boys probably it was really for Bertram though Humph grunted Cyril Then after a minute he observed I judge Kate thinks Billy ll never make them for anybody I m afraid Sister Kate isn t pleased Oh but missus Hartwell was was disappointed in the wedding apologized Marie quickly You know she wanted it put off anyway and she didn t like such a simple one Hm m as usual Sister Kate forgot it wasn t her funeral I mean her wedding retorted Cyril dryly Kate is never happy you know unless she s managing things Yes I know nodded Marie with a frowning smile of recollection at certain features of her own wedding She doesn t approve of Billy s taste in guests either remarked Cyril after a moment s silence I thought her guests were lovely spoke up Marie in quick defense Of course most of her social friends are away in July but Billy is never a society girl you know in spite of the way Society is always trying to lionize her and Bertram Oh of course Kate knows that but she says it seems as if Billy needn t have gone out and gathered in the lame and the halt and the blind Nonsense cried Marie with unusual sharpness for her I suppose she said that just because of missus Greggory s and Tommy Dunn s crutches Well they didn t make a real festive looking wedding party you must admit laughed Cyril what with the bridegroom s own arm in a sling too But who were they all anyway Why you knew missus Greggory and Alice of course and Pete smiled Marie And wasn t Pete happy Billy says she d have had Pete if she had no one else that there wouldn t have been any wedding anyway if it hadn t been for his telephoning Aunt Hannah that night Yes Will told me As for Tommy and the others most of them were those people that Billy had at her home last summer for a two weeks vacation people you know too poor to give themselves one and too proud to accept one from ordinary charity Billy s been following them up and doing little things for them ever since sugarplums and frosting on their cake she calls it and they adore her of course I think it was lovely of her to have them and they did have such a good time You should have seen Tommy when you played that wedding march for Billy to enter the room His poor little face was so transfigured with joy that I almost cried just to look at him Billy says he loves music poor little fellow Well I hope they ll be happy in spite of Kate s doleful prophecies Certainly they looked happy enough to day declared Cyril patting a yawn as he rose to his feet I fancy Will and Aunt Hannah are lonesome though about now he added Yes smiled Marie mistily as she gathered up her work I know what Aunt Hannah s doing She s helping Rosa put the house to rights and she s stopping to cry over every slipper and handkerchief of Billy s she finds And she ll do that until that funny clock of hers strikes twelve then she ll say Oh my grief and conscience midnight But the next minute she ll remember that it s only half past eleven after all and she ll send Rosa to bed and sit patting Billy s slipper in her lap till it really is midnight by all the other clocks Cyril laughed appreciatively Well I know what Will is doing he declared Will is in Bertram s den dozing before the fireplace with Spunkie curled up in his lap As it happened both these surmises were not far from right In the Strata the Henshaws old Beacon Street home William was sitting before the fireplace with the cat in his lap but he was not dozing He was talking Spunkie he was saying your master Bertram got married to day and to Miss Billy He ll be bringing her home one of these days your new mistress And such a mistress Never did cat or house have a better Just think for the first time in years this old place is to know the touch of a woman s hand and that s what it hasn t known for almost twenty years except for those few short months six years ago when a dark eyed girl and a little gray kitten that was Spunk your predecessor you know blew in and blew out again before we scarcely knew they were here That girl was Miss Billy and she was a dear then just as she is now only now she s coming here to stay She s coming home Spunkie and she ll make it a home for you for me and for all of us Up to now you know it hasn t really been a home for years just us men so It ll be very different Spunkie as you ll soon find out Now mind madam We must show that we appreciate all this no tempers no tantrums no showing of claws no leaving our coats either yours or mine on the drawing room chairs no tracking in of mud on clean rugs and floors For we re going to have a home Spunkie a home At Hillside Aunt Hannah was indeed helping Rosa to put the house to rights as Marie had said She was crying too over a glove she had found on Billy s piano but she was crying over something else also Not only had she lost Billy but she had lost her home To be sure nothing had been said during that nightmare of a week of hurry and confusion about Aunt Hannah s future but Aunt Hannah knew very well how it must be This dear little house on the side of Corey Hill was Billy s home and Billy would not need it any longer It would be sold of course and she Aunt Hannah would go back to a second story front and loneliness in some Back Bay boarding house and a second story front and loneliness would not be easy now after these years of home and Billy 
5139_61422_000014_000008	train-clean-360	No wonder indeed 
none	none	that Aunt Hannah sat crying and patting the little white glove in her hand No wonder too that being Aunt Hannah she reached for the shawl near by and put it on shiveringly Even July to night was cold to Aunt Hannah In yet another home that evening was the wedding of Billy Neilson and Bertram Henshaw uppermost in thought and speech In a certain little South End flat where in two rented rooms lived Alice Greggory and her crippled mother Alice was talking to mister M J Arkwright commonly known to his friends as Mary Jane owing to the mystery in which he had for so long shrouded his name Arkwright to night was plainly moody and ill at ease You re not listening You re not listening at all complained Alice Greggory at last reproachfully With a visible effort the man roused himself Indeed I am he maintained I thought you d be interested in the wedding You used to be friends you and Billy The girl s voice still vibrated with reproach There was a moment s silence then a little harshly the man said Perhaps because I wanted to be more than a friend is why you re not satisfied with my interest now A look that was almost terror came to Alice Greggory s eyes She flushed painfully then grew very white You mean Yes he nodded dully without looking up I cared too much for her I supposed Henshaw was just a friend till too late There was a breathless hush before a little unsteadily the girl stammered Oh I m so sorry so very sorry I I didn t know No of course you didn t I ve almost told you though lots of times you ve been so good to me all these weeks He raised his head now and looked at her frank comradeship in his eyes The girl stirred restlessly Her eyes swerved a little under his level gaze Oh but I ve done nothing n nothing she stammered Then at the light tap of crutches on a bare floor she turned in obvious relief Oh here s mother She s been in visiting with missus Delano our landlady Mother mister Arkwright is here Meanwhile speeding north as fast as steam could carry them were the bride and groom The wondrousness of the first hour of their journey side by side had become a joyous certitude that always it was to be like this now Bertram began the bride after a long minute of eloquent silence Yes love You know our wedding was very different from most weddings Of course it was Yes but really it was Now listen The bride s voice grew tenderly earnest I think our marriage is going to be different too Different Yes Billy s tone was emphatic There are so many common everyday marriages where where Why Bertram as if you could ever be to me like like mister Carleton is for instance Like mister Carleton is to you Bertram s voice was frankly puzzled No no As mister Carleton is to missus Carleton I mean Oh Bertram subsided in relief And the Grahams and Whartons and the Freddie Agnews and and a lot of others Why Bertram I ve seen the Grahams and the Whartons not even speak to each other a whole evening when they ve been at a dinner or something and I ve seen missus Carleton not even seem to know her husband came into the room I don t mean quarrel dear Of course we d never quarrel But I mean I m sure we shall never get used to to you being you and I being I Indeed we sha n t agreed Bertram rapturously Ours is going to be such a beautiful marriage Of course it will be And we ll be so happy I shall be and I shall try to make you so As if I could be anything else sighed Billy blissfully And now we can t have any misunderstandings you see Of course not Er what s that Why I mean that that we can t ever repeat hose miserable weeks of misunderstanding Everything is all explained up I know now that you don t love Miss Winthrop or just girls any girl to paint You love me Not the tilt of my chin nor the turn of my head but me I do just you Bertram s eyes gave the caress his lips would have given had it not been for the presence of the man in the seat across the aisle of the sleeping car And you you know now that I love you just you Not even Arkwright Not even Arkwright smiled Billy There was the briefest of hesitations then a little constrainedly Bertram asked And you said you you never had cared for Arkwright didn t you For the second time in her life Billy was thankful that Bertram s question had turned upon her love for Arkwright not Arkwright s love for her In Billy s opinion a man s unrequited love for a girl was his secret not hers and was certainly one that the girl had no right to tell Once before Bertram had asked her if she had ever cared for Arkwright and then she had answered emphatically as she did now Never dear I thought you said so murmured Bertram relaxing a little I did besides didn t I tell you she went on airily I think he ll marry Alice Greggory Alice wrote me all the time I was away and oh she didn t say anything definite I ll admit confessed Billy with an arch smile but she spoke of his being there lots and they used to know each other years ago you see There was almost a romance there I think before the Greggorys lost their money and moved away from all their friends Well he may have her She s a nice girl a mighty nice girl answered Bertram with the unmistakably satisfied air of the man who knows he himself possesses the nicest girl of them all Billy reading unerringly the triumph in his voice grew suddenly grave She regarded her husband with a thoughtful frown then she drew a profound sigh Whew laughed Bertram whimsically So soon as this Bertram Billy s voice was tragic Yes my love The bridegroom pulled his face into sobriety then Billy spoke with solemn impressiveness Bertram I don t know a thing about cooking except what I ve been learning in Rosa s cook book this last week Bertram laughed so loud that the man across the aisle glanced over the top of his paper surreptitiously Rosa s cook book Is that what you were doing all this week Yes that is I tried so hard to learn something stammered Billy But I m afraid I didn t much there were so many things for me to think of you know with only a week I believe I could make peach fritters though They were the last thing I studied Bertram laughed again uproariously but at Billy s unchangingly tragic face he grew suddenly very grave and tender Billy dear I didn t marry you to to get a cook he said gently Billy shook her head I know but Aunt Hannah said that even if I never expected to cook myself I ought to know how it was done so to properly oversee it She said that that no woman who didn t know how to cook and keep house properly had any business to be a wife And Bertram I did try honestly all this week I tried so hard to remember when you sponged bread and when you kneaded it I don t ever need yours cut in Bertram shamelessly but he got only a deservedly stern glance in return And I repeated over and over again how many cupfuls of flour and pinches of salt and spoonfuls of baking powder went into things but Bertram I simply could not keep my mind on it Everything everywhere was singing to me And how do you suppose I could remember how many pinches of flour and spoonfuls of salt and cupfuls of baking powder went into a loaf of cake when all the while the very teakettle on the stove was singing It s all right Bertram loves me I m going to marry Bertram You darling In spite of the man across the aisle Bertram did almost kiss her this time As if anybody cared how many cupfuls of baking powder went anywhere with that in your heart Aunt Hannah says you will when you re hungry And Kate said Bertram uttered a sharp word behind his teeth Billy for heaven s sake don t tell me what Kate said if you want me to stay sane and not attempt to fight somebody broken arm and all Kate thinks she s kind and I suppose she means well but well she s made trouble enough between us already I ve got you now sweetheart You re mine all mine his voice shook and dropped to a tender whisper till death us do part Yes till death us do part breathed Billy And then for a time they fell silent I Bertram take thee Billy sang the whirring wheels beneath them to one I Billy take thee Bertram sang the whirring wheels beneath them to the other While straight ahead before them both stretched fair and beautiful in their eyes the wondrous path of life which they were to tread together CHAPTER II FOR WILLIAM A HOME On the first Sunday after the wedding Pete came up stairs to tell his master William that missus Stetson wanted to see him in the drawing room William went down at once Well Aunt Hannah he began reaching out a cordial hand Why what s the matter he broke off concernedly as he caught a clearer view of the little old lady s drawn face and troubled eyes William it s silly of course cried Aunt Hannah tremulously but I simply had to go to some one I I feel so nervous and unsettled Did did Billy say anything to you what she was going to do What she was going to do About what What do you mean About the house selling it faltered Aunt Hannah sinking wearily back into her chair William frowned thoughtfully Why no he answered It was all so hurried at the last you know There was really very little chance to make plans for anything except the wedding he finished with a smile Yes I know sighed Aunt Hannah Everything was in such confusion Still I didn t know but she might have said something to you No she didn t But I imagine it won t be hard to guess what she ll do When they get back from their trip I fancy she won t lose much time in having what things she wants brought down here Then she ll sell the rest and put the house on the market Yes of of course stammered Aunt Hannah pulling herself hastily to a more erect position That s what I thought too Then don t you think we d better dismiss Rosa and close the house at once Why yes perhaps so Why not Then you d be all settled here when she comes home I m sure the sooner you come the better I ll be pleased he smiled Aunt Hannah turned sharply Here she ejaculated William Henshaw you didn t suppose I was coming here to live did you It was William s turn to look amazed Why of course you re coming here Where else should you go pray Where I was before before Billy came to you returned Aunt Hannah a little tremulously but with a certain dignity I shall take a room in some quiet boarding house of course Nonsense Aunt Hannah As if Billy would listen to that You came before why not come now Aunt Hannah lifted her chin the fraction of an inch You forget I was needed before Billy is a married woman now She needs no chaperon Nonsense scowled William again Billy will always need you Aunt Hannah shook her head mournfully I like to think she wants me William but I know in my heart it isn t best Why not There was a moment s pause then decisively came the answer Because I think young married folks should not have outsiders in the home William laughed relievedly Oh so that s it Well Aunt Hannah you re no outsider Come run right along home and pack your trunk Aunt Hannah was plainly almost crying but she held her ground William I can t she reiterated But Billy is such a child and For once in her circumspect life Aunt Hannah was guilty of an interruption Pardon me William she is not a child She is a woman now and she has a woman s problems to meet Well then why don t you help her meet them retorted William still with a whimsical smile But Aunt Hannah did not smile For a minute she did not speak then with her eyes studiously averted she said William the first four years of my married life were were spoiled by an outsider in our home I don t mean to spoil Billy s William relaxed visibly The smile fled from his face Why Aunt Hannah he exclaimed The little old lady turned with a weary sigh Yes I know You are shocked of course I shouldn t have told you Still it is all past long ago and I wanted to make you understand why I can t come He was my husband s eldest brother a bachelor He was good and kind and meant well I suppose but he interfered with everything I was young and probably headstrong At all events there was constant friction He went away once and stayed two whole months I shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves No William I can t come She rose abruptly and turned toward the door Her eyes were wistful and her face was still drawn with suffering but her whole frail little self quivered plainly with high resolve John has Peggy outside I must go But but Aunt Hannah began William helplessly She lifted a protesting hand No don t urge me please I can t come here But I believe I won t close the house till Billy gets home after all she declared The next moment she was gone and William dazedly from the doorway was watching John help her into Billy s automobile called by Billy and half her friends Peggy short for Pegasus Still dazedly William turned back into the house and dropped himself into the nearest chair What a curious call it had been Aunt Hannah had not acted like herself at all Not once had she said Oh my grief and conscience while the things she had said Someway he had never thought of Aunt Hannah as being young and a bride Still of course she must have been once And the reason she gave for not coming there to live the pitiful story of that outsider in her home But she was no outsider She was no interfering brother of Billy s William caught his breath suddenly and held it suspended Then he gave a low ejaculation and half sprang from his chair Spunkie disturbed from her doze by the fire uttered a purring me o ow and looked up inquiringly For a long minute William gazed dumbly into the cat s yellow sleepily contented eyes then he said with tragic distinctness Spunkie it s true Aunt Hannah isn t Billy s husband s brother but I am Do you hear I am Pur r me ow commented Spunkie and curled herself for another nap There was no peace for William after that In vain he told himself that he was no interfering brother and that this was his home and had been all his life in vain did he declare emphatically that he could not go he would not go that Billy would not wish him to go always before his eyes was the vision of that little bride of years long gone always in his ears was the echo of Aunt Hannah s I shall never forget the utter freedom and happiness of those months for us with the whole house to ourselves Nor turn which way he would could he find anything to comfort him Simply because he was so fearfully looking for it he found it the thing that had for its theme the wretchedness that might be expected from the presence of a third person in the new home Poor William Everywhere he met it the hint the word the story the song even and always it added its mite to the woeful whole Even the hoariest of mother in law jokes had its sting for him and to make his cup quite full he chanced to remember one day what Marie had said when he had suggested that she and Cyril come to the Strata to live No I think young folks should begin by themselves Unhappy indeed were these days for William Like a lost spirit he wandered from room to room touching this fingering that For long minutes he would stand before some picture or some treasured bit of old mahogany as if to stamp indelibly upon his mind a thing that was soon to be no more At other times like a man without a home he would go out into the Common or the Public Garden and sit for hours on some bench thinking All this could have but one ending of course Before the middle of August William summoned Pete to his rooms Oh Pete I m going to move next week he began nonchalantly His voice sounded as if moving were a pleasurable circumstance that occurred in his life regularly once a month I d like you to begin to pack up these things please to morrow The old servant s mouth fell open You re goin to to what sir he stammered Move move I said William spoke with unusual harshness Pete wet his lips You mean you ve sold the old place sir that we we ain t goin to live here no longer Sold Of course not I m going to move away not you If Pete could have known what caused the sharpness in his master s voice he would not have been so grieved or rather he would have been grieved for a different reason As it was he could only falter miserably You are goin to move away from here Yes yes man Why Pete what ails you One would think a body never moved before They didn t not you sir William turned abruptly so that his face could not be seen With stern deliberation he picked up an elaborately decorated teapot but the valuable bit of Lowestoft shook so in his hand that he set it down at once It clicked sharply against its neighbor betraying his nervous hand Pete stirred But mister William he stammered thickly how are you what ll you do without There doesn t nobody but me know so well about your tea and the two lumps in your coffee and there s your flannels that you never put on till I get em out and the woolen socks that you d wear all summer if I didn t hide em And and who s goin to take care of these he finished with a glance that encompassed the overflowing cabinets and shelves of curios all about him His master smiled sadly An affection that had its inception in his boyhood days shone in his eyes The hand in which the Lowestoft had shaken rested now heavily on an old man s bent shoulder a shoulder that straightened itself in unconscious loyalty under the touch Pete you have spoiled me and no mistake I don t expect to find another like you But maybe if I wear the woolen socks too late you ll come and hunt up the others for me Eh And with a smile that was meant to be quizzical William turned and began to shift the teapots about again But mister William why that is what will mister Bertram and Miss Billy do without you ventured the old man There was a sudden tinkling crash On the floor lay the fragments of a silver luster teapot The servant exclaimed aloud in dismay but his master did not even glance toward his once treasured possession on the floor Nonsense Pete he was saying in a particularly cheery voice Have you lived all these years and not found out that newly married folks don t need any one else around Come do you suppose we could begin to pack these teapots to night he added a little feverishly Aren t there some boxes down cellar I ll see sir said Pete respectfully but the expression on his face as he turned away showed that he was not thinking of teapots nor of boxes in which to pack them CHAPTER III BILLY SPEAKS HER MIND mister and missus Bertram Henshaw were expected home the first of September By the thirty first of August the old Beacon Street homestead facing the Public Garden was in spick and span order with Dong Ling in the basement hovering over a well stocked larder and Pete searching the rest of the house for a chair awry or a bit of dust undiscovered Twice before had the Strata as Bertram long ago dubbed the home of his boyhood been prepared for the coming of Billy William s namesake once when it had been decorated with guns and fishing rods to welcome the boy who turned out to be a girl and again when with pink roses and sewing baskets the three brothers got joyously ready for a feminine Billy who did not even come at all The house had been very different then It had been indeed a strata with its distinctive layers of fads and pursuits as represented by Bertram and his painting on one floor William and his curios on another and Cyril with his music on a third Cyril was gone now Only Pete and his humble belongings occupied the top floor The floor below too was silent now and almost empty save for a rug or two and a few pieces of heavy furniture that William had not cared to take with him to his new quarters on top of Beacon Hill Below this however came Billy s old rooms and on these Pete had lavished all his skill and devotion Freshly laundered curtains were at the windows dustless rugs were on the floor The old work basket had been brought down from the top floor storeroom and the long closed piano stood invitingly open In a conspicuous place also sat the little green god upon whose exquisitely carved shoulders was supposed to rest the heap plenty velly good luckee of Dong Ling s prophecy On the first floor Bertram s old rooms and the drawing room came in for their share of the general overhauling Even Spunkie did not escape but had to submit to the ignominy of a bath And then dawned fair and clear the first day of September bringing at five o clock the bride and groom Respectfully lined up in the hall to meet them were Pete and Dong Ling Pete with his wrinkled old face alight with joy and excitement Dong Ling grinning and kotowing and chanting in a high pitched treble Miss Billee Miss Billee plenty much welcome Miss Billee Yes welcome home missus Henshaw bowed Bertram turning at the door with an elaborate flourish that did not in the least hide his tender pride in his new wife Billy laughed and colored a pretty pink Thank you all of you she cried a little unsteadily And how good good everything does look to me Why where s Uncle William she broke off casting hurriedly anxious eyes about her Well I should say so echoed Bertram Where is he Pete He isn t sick is he A quick change crossed the old servant s face He shook his head dumbly Billy gave a gleeful laugh I know he s asleep she caroled skipping to the bottom of the stairway and looking up Ho Uncle William Better wake up sir The folks have come Pete cleared his throat mister William isn t here Miss ma am he corrected miserably Billy smiled but she frowned too Not here Well I like that she pouted and when I ve brought him the most beautiful pair of mirror knobs he ever saw and all the way in my bag too so I could give them to him the very first thing she added darting over to the small bag she had brought in with her I m glad I did too for our trunks didn t come she continued laughingly Still if he isn t here to receive them There Pete aren t they beautiful she cried carefully taking from their wrappings two exquisitely decorated porcelain discs mounted on two long spikes They re Batterseas the real article I know enough for that and they re finer than anything he s got Won t he be pleased Yes Miss ma am I mean stammered the old man These new titles come hard don t they Pete laughed Bertram Pete smiled faintly Never mind Pete soothed his new mistress You shall call me Miss Billy all your life if you want to Bertram she added turning to her husband I m going to just run up stairs and put these in Uncle William s rooms so they ll be there when he comes in We ll see how soon he discovers them Before Pete could stop her she was half way up the first flight of stairs Even then he tried to speak to his young master to explain that mister William was not living there but the words refused to come He could only stand dumbly waiting In a minute it came Billy s sharp startled cry Bertram Bertram Bertram sprang for the stairway but he had not reached the top when he met his wife coming down She was white faced and trembling Bertram those rooms there s not so much as a teapot there Uncle William s gone Gone Bertram wheeled sharply Pete what is the meaning of this Where is my brother To hear him one would think he suspected the old servant of having hidden his master Pete lifted a shaking hand and fumbled with his collar He s moved sir Moved Oh you mean to other rooms to Cyril s Bertram relaxed visibly He s upstairs maybe Pete shook his head 
5139_61422_000040_000003	train-clean-360	No sir 
none	none	He s moved away out of the house sir For a brief moment Bertram stared as if he could not believe what his ears had heard Then step by step he began to descend the stairs Do you mean to say that my brother has moved gone away left his home he demanded Yes sir Billy gave a low cry But why why she choked almost stumbling headlong down the stairway in her effort to reach the two men at the bottom Pete why did he go 
5717_61421_000014_000000	train-clean-360	There was no answer 
none	none	Pete Bertram s voice was very sharp what is the meaning of this Do you know why my brother left his home The old man wet his lips and swallowed chokingly but he did not speak I m waiting Pete Billy laid one hand on the old servant s arm in the other hand she still tightly clutched the mirror knobs Pete if you do know won t you tell us please she begged Pete looked down at the hand then up at the troubled young face with the beseeching eyes His own features worked convulsively With a visible effort he cleared his throat I know what he said he stammered his eyes averted What was it There was no answer Look here Pete you ll have to tell us you know cut in Bertram decisively so you might as well do it now as ever Once more Pete cleared his throat This time the words came in a burst of desperation Yes sir I understand sir It was only that he said he said as how young folks didn t need any one else around So he was goin Didn t need any one else exclaimed Bertram plainly not comprehending Yes sir You two bein married so now Pete s eyes were still averted Billy gave a low cry You mean because I came she demanded Why yes Miss no that is Pete stopped with an appealing glance at Bertram Then it was it was on account of me choked Billy Pete looked still more distressed No no he faltered It was only that he thought you wouldn t want him here now Want him here ejaculated Bertram Want him here echoed Billy with a sob Pete where is he As she asked the question she dropped the mirror knobs into her open bag and reached for her coat and gloves she had not removed her hat Pete gave the address It s just down the street a bit and up the hill he added excitedly divining her purpose It s a sort of a boarding house I reckon A boarding house for Uncle William scorned Billy her eyes ablaze Come Bertram we ll see about that Bertram reached out a detaining hand But dearest you re so tired he demurred Hadn t we better wait till after dinner or till to morrow After dinner To morrow Billy s eyes blazed anew Why Bertram Henshaw do you think I d leave that dear man even one minute longer if I could help it with a notion in his blessed old head that we didn t want him But you said a little while ago you had a headache dear still objected Bertram If you d just eat your dinner Dinner choked Billy I wonder if you think I could eat any dinner with Uncle William turned out of his home I m going to find Uncle William And she stumbled blindly toward the door Bertram reached for his hat He threw a despairing glance into Pete s eyes We ll be back when we can he said with a frown Yes sir answered Pete respectfully Then as if impelled by some hidden force he touched his master s arm It was that way she looked sir when she came to you that night last July with her eyes all shining he whispered A tender smile curved Bertram s lips The frown vanished from his face Bless you Pete and bless her too he whispered back The next moment he had hurried after his wife The house that bore the number Pete had given proved to have a pretentious doorway and a landlady who in response to the summons of the neat maid appeared with a most impressive rustle of black silk and jet bugles No mister William Henshaw was not in his rooms In fact he was very seldom there His business she believed called him to State Street through the day Outside of that she had been told he spent much time sitting on a bench in the Common Doubtless if they cared to search they could find him there now A bench in the Common indeed stormed Billy as she and Bertram hurried down the wide stone steps Uncle William on a bench But surely now dear ventured her husband you ll come home and get your dinner Billy turned indignantly And leave Uncle William on a bench in the Common Indeed no Why Bertram you wouldn t either she cried as she turned resolutely toward one of the entrances to the Common And Bertram with the eyes all shining still before him could only murmur No of course not dear and follow obediently where she led Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a delightful hour for a walk The sun had almost set and the shadows lay long across the grass The air was cool and unusually bracing for a day so early in September But all this was lost on Bertram Bertram did not wish to take a walk He was hungry He wanted his dinner and he wanted too his old home with his new wife flitting about the rooms as he had pictured this first evening together He wanted William of course Certainly he wanted William but if William would insist on running away and sitting on park benches in this ridiculous fashion he ought to take the consequences until to morrow Five ten fifteen minutes passed Up one path and down another trudged the anxious eyed Billy and her increasingly impatient husband Then when the fifteen weary minutes had become a still more weary half hour the bonds Bertram had set on his temper snapped Billy he remonstrated despairingly do please come home Don t you see how highly improbable it is that we should happen on William if we walked like this all night He might move change his seat go home even He probably has gone home And surely never before did a bride insist on spending the first evening after her return tramping up and down a public park for hour after hour like this looking for any man Won t you come home But Billy had not even heard With a glad little cry she had darted to the side of the humped up figure of a man alone on a park bench just ahead of them Uncle William Oh Uncle William how could you she cried dropping herself on to one end of the seat and catching the man s arm in both her hands Yes how could you demanded Bertram with just a touch of irritation dropping himself on to the other end of the seat and catching the man s other arm in his one usable hand The bent shoulders and bowed head straightened up with a jerk Well well bless my soul If it isn t our little bride cried Uncle William fondly And the happy bridegroom too When did you get home We haven t got home retorted Bertram promptly before his wife could speak Oh we looked in at the door an hour or so back but we didn t stay We ve been hunting for you ever since Nonsense children Uncle William spoke with gay cheeriness but he refused to meet either Billy s or Bertram s eyes Uncle William how could you do it reproached Billy again Do what Uncle William was plainly fencing for time Leave the house like that Ho I wanted a change As if we d believe that scoffed Billy All right let s call it you ve had the change then laughed Bertram and we ll send over for your things to morrow Come now let s go home to dinner William shook his head He essayed a gay smile Why I ve only just begun I m going to stay oh I don t know how long I m going to stay he finished blithely Billy lifted her chin a little Uncle William you aren t playing square Pete told us what you said when you left Eh What William looked up with startled eyes About about our not needing you So we know now why you left and we sha n t stand it Pete That Oh that that s nonsense I I ll settle with Pete Billy laughed softly Poor Pete Don t We simply dragged it out of him And now we re here to tell you that we do want you and that you must come back Again William shook his head A swift shadow crossed his face Thank you no children he said dully You re very kind but you don t need me I should be just an interfering elder brother I should spoil your young married life William s voice now sounded as if he were reciting a well learned lesson If I went away and stayed two months you d never forget the utter freedom and joy of those two whole months with the house all to yourselves Uncle William gasped Billy what are you talking about About about my not going back of course But you are coming back cut in Bertram almost angrily Oh come Will this is utter nonsense and you know it Come let s go home to dinner A stern look came to the corners of William s mouth a look that Bertram understood well All right I ll go to dinner of course but I sha n t stay said William firmly I ve thought it all out I know I m right Come we ll go to dinner now and say no more about it he finished with a cheery smile as he rose to his feet Then to the bride he added Did you have a nice trip little girl Billy too had risen now but she did not seem to have heard his question In the fast falling twilight her face looked a little white Uncle William she began very quietly do you think for a minute that just because I married your brother I am going to live in that house and turn you out of the home you ve lived in all your life Nonsense dear I m not turned out I just go corrected Uncle William gayly With superb disdain Billy brushed this aside Oh no you won t she declared but I shall Billy gasped Bertram My my dear expostulated William faintly Uncle William Bertram Listen panted Billy I never told you much before but I m going to now Long ago when I went away with Aunt Hannah your sister Kate showed me how dear the old home was to you how much you thought of it And she said she said that I had upset everything Bertram interjected a sharp word but Billy paid no attention That s why I went and I shall go again if you don t come home to morrow to stay Uncle William Come now let s go to dinner please Bertram s hungry she finished with a bright smile There was a tense moment of silence William glanced at Bertram Bertram returned the glance with interest Er ah yes well we might go to dinner stammered William after a minute Er yes agreed Bertram And the three fell into step together CHAPTER IV JUST LIKE BILLY Billy did not leave the Strata this time Before twenty four hours had passed the last cherished fragment of mister William Henshaw s possessions had been carefully carried down the imposing steps of the Beacon Hill boarding house under the disapproving eyes of its bugle adorned mistress who found herself now with a month s advance rent and two vacant parlors on her hands Before another twenty four hours had passed her quondam boarder with a tired sigh sank into his favorite morris chair in his old familiar rooms and looked about him with contented eyes Every treasure was in place from the traditional four small stones of his babyhood days to the Batterseas Billy had just brought him Pete as of yore was hovering near with a dust cloth Bertram s gay whistle sounded from the floor below William Henshaw was at home again This much accomplished Billy went to see Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah greeted her affectionately though with tearfully troubled eyes She was wearing a gray shawl to day topped with a black one sure sign of unrest either physical or mental as all her friends knew I d begun to think you d forgotten me she faltered with a poor attempt at gayety You ve been home three whole days I know dearie smiled Billy and twas a shame But I have been so busy My trunks came at last and I ve been helping Uncle William get settled too Aunt Hannah looked puzzled Uncle William get settled You mean he s changed his room Billy laughed oddly and threw a swift glance into Aunt Hannah s face Well yes he did change she murmured but he s moved back now into the old quarters Er you haven t heard from Uncle William then lately I take it No Aunt Hannah shook her head abstractedly I did see him once several weeks ago but I haven t since We had quite a talk then and Billy I ve been wanting to speak to you she hurried on a little feverishly I didn t like to leave of course till you did come home as long as you d said nothing about your plans but Leave interposed Billy dazedly Leave where What do you mean Why leave here of course dear I mean I didn t like to get my room while you were away but I shall now of course at once Nonsense Aunt Hannah As if I d let you do that laughed Billy Aunt Hannah stiffened perceptibly Her lips looked suddenly thin and determined Even the soft little curls above her ears seemed actually to bristle with resolution Billy she began firmly we might as well understand each other at once I know your good heart and I appreciate your kindness But I can not come to live with you I shall not It wouldn t be best I should be like an interfering elder brother in your home I should spoil your young married life and if I went away for two months you d never forget the utter joy and freedom of those two months with the whole house ali to yourselves At the beginning of this speech Billy s eyes had still carried their dancing smile but as the peroration progressed on to the end a dawning surprise which soon became a puzzled questioning drove the smile away Then Billy sat suddenly erect Why Aunt Hannah that s exactly what Uncle William Billy stopped and regarded Aunt Hannah with quick suspicion The next moment she burst into gleeful laughter Aunt Hannah looked grieved and not a little surprised but Billy did not seem to notice this Oh oh Aunt Hannah you too How perfectly funny she gurgled To think you two old blesseds should get your heads together like this Aunt Hannah stirred restively and pulled the black shawl more closely about her Indeed Billy I don t know what you mean by that she sighed with a visible effort at self control but I do know that I can not go to live with you Bless your heart dear I don t want you to soothed Billy with gay promptness Oh O h h stammered Aunt Hannah surprise mortification dismay and a grieved hurt bringing a flood of color to her face It is one thing to refuse a home and quite another to have a home refused you Oh O h h Aunt Hannah cried Billy turning very red in her turn Please please don t look like that I didn t mean it that way I do want you dear only I want you somewhere else more I want you here Here Aunt Hannah looked relieved but unconvinced Yes Don t you like it here Like it Why I love it dear You know I do But you don t need this house now Billy Oh yes I do retorted Billy airily I m going to keep it up and I want you here Fiddlededee Billy As if I d let you keep up this house just for me scorned Aunt Hannah Tisn t just for you It s for for lots of folks My grief and conscience Billy What are you talking about Billy laughed and settled herself more comfortably on the hassock at Aunt Hannah s feet Well I ll tell you Just now I want it for Tommy Dunn and the Greggorys if I can get them and maybe one or two others There ll always be somebody You see I had thought I d have them at the Strata Tommy Dunn at the Strata Billy laughed again ruefully O dear You sound just like Bertram she pouted He didn t want Tommy either nor any of the rest of them The rest of them Well I could have had a lot more you know the Strata is so big especially now that Cyril has gone and left all those empty rooms I got real enthusiastic but Bertram didn t He just laughed and said nonsense until he found I was really in earnest then he well he said nonsense then too only he didn t laugh finished Billy with a sigh Aunt Hannah regarded her with fond though slightly exasperated eyes Billy you are indeed a most extraordinary young woman at times Surely with you a body never knows what to expect except the unexpected Why Aunt Hannah and from you too reproached Billy mischievously but Aunt Hannah had yet more to say Of course Bertram thought it was nonsense The idea of you a bride filling up your house with with people like that Tommy Dunn indeed Oh Bertram said he liked Tommy all right sighed Billy but he said that that didn t mean he wanted him for three meals a day One would think poor Tommy was a breakfast food So that is when I thought of keeping up this house you see and that s why I want you here to take charge of it And you ll do that for me won t you Aunt Hannah fell back in her chair Why y yes Billy of course if if you want it But what an extraordinary idea child Billy shook her head A deeper color came to her cheeks and a softer glow to her eyes I don t think so Aunt Hannah It s only that I m so happy that some of it has just got to overflow somewhere and this is going to be the overflow house a sort of safety valve for me you see I m going to call it the Annex it will be an annex to our home And I want to keep it full always of people who who can make the best use of all that extra happiness that I can t possibly use myself she finished a little tremulously Don t you see Oh yes I see replied Aunt Hannah with a fond shake of the head But really listen it s sensible urged Billy First there s Tommy His mother died last month He s at a neighbor s now but they re going to send him to a Home for Crippled Children and he s grieving his heart out over it I m going to bring him here to a real home the kind that doesn t begin with a capital letter He adores music and he s got real talent I think Then there s the Greggorys Aunt Hannah looked dubious You can t get the Greggorys to to use any of that happiness Billy They re too proud Billy smiled radiantly I know I can t get them to use it Aunt Hannah but I believe I can get them to give it she declared triumphantly I shall ask Alice Greggory to teach Tommy music and I shall ask missus Greggory to teach him books and I shall tell them both that I positively need them to keep you company Oh but Billy bridled Aunt Hannah with prompt objection Tut tut I know you ll be willing to be thrown as a little bit of a sop to the Greggorys pride coaxed Billy You just wait till I get the Overflow Annex in running order Why Aunt Hannah 
5139_61422_000036_000001	train-clean-360	you don t know how 
none	none	busy you re going to be handing out all that extra happiness that I can t use You dear child Aunt Hannah smiled mistily The black shawl had fallen unheeded to the floor now As if anybody ever had any more happiness than one s self could use I have avowed Billy promptly and it s going to keep growing and growing I know Oh my grief and conscience Billy don t exclaimed Aunt Hannah lifting shocked hands of remonstrance Rap on wood do How can you boast like that Billy dimpled roguishly and sprang to her feet Why Aunt Hannah I m ashamed of you To be superstitious like that you a good Presbyterian Aunt Hannah subsided shamefacedly Yes I know Billy it is silly but I just can t help it Oh but it s worse than silly Aunt Hannah teased Billy with a remorseless chuckle It s really heathen Bertram told me once that it dates way back to the time of the Druids appealing to the god of trees or something like that when you rap on wood you know Ugh shuddered Aunt Hannah As if I would Billy How is Bertram by the by A swift shadow crossed Billy s bright face He s lovely only his arm His arm But I thought that was better Oh it is drooped Billy but it gets along so slowly and it frets him dreadfully You know he never can do anything with his left hand he says and he just hates to have things done for him though Pete and Dong Ling are quarreling with each other all the time to do things for him and I m quarreling with both of them to do them for him myself By the way Dong Ling is going to leave us next week Did you know it Dong Ling leave Yes Oh he told Bertram long ago he should go when we were married that he had plenty much money and was going back to China and not be Melican man any longer But I don t think Bertram thought he d do it William says Dong Ling went to Pete however after we left and told him he wanted to go that he liked the little Missee plenty well but that there d be too much hen talk when she got back and Why the impudent creature Billy laughed merrily Yes Pete was furious William says but Dong Ling didn t mean any disrespect I m sure He just wasn t used to having petticoats around and didn t want to take orders from them that s all But Billy what will you do Oh Pete s fixed all that lovely returned Billy nonchalantly You know his niece lives over in South Boston and it seems she s got a daughter who s a fine cook and will be glad to come Mercy Look at the time she broke off glancing at the clock I shall be late to dinner and Dong Ling loathes anybody who s late to his meals as I found out to my sorrow the night we got home Good by dear I ll be out soon again and fix it all up about the Annex you know And with a bright smile she was gone Dear me sighed Aunt Hannah stooping to pick up the black shawl dear me Of course everything will be all right there s a girl coming even if Dong Ling is going But but Oh my grief and conscience what an extraordinary child Billy is to be sure but what a dear one she added wiping a quick tear from her eye An Overflow Annex indeed for her extra happiness Now isn t that just like Billy CHAPTER V TIGER SKINS September passed and October came bringing with it cool days and clear crisp evenings royally ruled over by a gorgeous harvest moon According to Billy everything was just perfect except of course poor Bertram s arm and even the fact that that gained so slowly was not without its advantage again according to Billy for it gave Bertram more time to be with her You see dear as long as you can t paint she told him earnestly one day why I m not really hindering you by keeping you with me so much You certainly are not he retorted with a smile Then I may be just as happy as I like over it settled Billy comfortably As if you ever could hinder me he ridiculed Oh yes I could nodded Billy emphatically You forget sir That was what worried me so Everybody even the newspapers and magazines said I would do it too They said I d slay your Art stifle your Ambition destroy your Inspiration and be a nuisance generally And Kate said Yes Well never mind what Kate said interrupted the man savagely Billy laughed and gave his ear a playful tweak All right but I m not going to do it you know spoil your career sir You just wait she continued dramatically The minute your arm gets so you can paint I myself shall conduct you to your studio thrust the brushes into your hand fill your palette with all the colors of the rainbow and order you to paint my lord paint But until then I m going to have you all I like she finished with a complete change of manner nestling into the ready curve of his good left arm You witch laughed the man fondly Why Billy you couldn t hinder me You ll be my inspiration dear instead of slaying it You ll see This time Marguerite Winthrop s portrait is going to be a success Billy turned quickly Then you are that is you haven t I mean you re going to paint it I just am avowed the artist And this time it ll be a success too with you to help Billy drew in her breath tremulously I didn t know but you d already started it she faltered He shook his head No After the other one failed and mister Winthrop asked me to try again I couldn t then I was so troubled over you That s the time you did hinder me he smiled Then came your note breaking the engagement Of course I knew too much to attempt a thing like that portrait then But now now The pause and the emphasis were eloquent Of course now nodded Billy brightly but a little feverishly And when do you begin Not till January Miss Winthrop won t be back till then I saw J G last week and I told him I d accept his offer to try again What did he say He gave my left hand a big grip and said Good and you ll win out this time Of course you will nodded Billy again though still a little feverishly And this time I sha n t mind a bit if you do stay to luncheon and break engagements with me sir she went on tilting her chin archly for I shall know it s the portrait and not the sitter that s really keeping you Oh you ll see what a fine artist s wife I ll make The very best declared Bertram so ardently that Billy blushed and shook her head in reproof Nonsense I wasn t fishing I didn t mean it that way she protested Then as he tried to catch her she laughed and danced teasingly out of his reach Because Bertram could not paint therefore Billy had him quite to herself these October days nor did she hesitate to appropriate him Neither on his part was Bertram loath to be appropriated Like two lovers they read and walked and talked together and like two children sometimes they romped through the stately old rooms with Spunkie or with Tommy Dunn who was a frequent guest Spunkie be it known was renewing her kittenhood so potent was the influence of the dangling strings and rolling balls that she encountered everywhere and Tommy Dunn with Billy s help was learning that not even a pair of crutches need keep a lonely little lad from a frolic Even William roused from his after dinner doze by peals of laughter was sometimes inveigled into activities that left him breathless but curiously aglow While Pete polishing silver in the dining room down stairs smiled indulgently at the merry clatter above and forgot the teasing pain in his side But it was not all nonsense with Billy nor gay laughter More often it was a tender glow in the eyes a softness in the voice a radiant something like an aura of joy all about her that told how happy indeed were these days for her There was proof by word of mouth too long talks with Bertram in the dancing firelight when they laid dear plans for the future and when she tried so hard to make her husband understand what a good good wife she intended to be and how she meant never to let anything come between them It was so earnest and serious a Billy by this time that Bertram would turn startled dismayed eyes on his young wife whereupon with a very Billy like change of mood she would give him one of her rare caresses and perhaps sigh Goosey it s only because I m so happy happy happy Why Bertram if it weren t for that Overflow Annex I believe I I just couldn t live It was Bertram who sighed then and who prayed fervently in his heart that never might he see a real shadow cloud that dear face Thus far certainly the cares of matrimony had rested anything but heavily upon the shapely young shoulders of the new wife Domestic affairs at the Strata moved like a piece of well oiled machinery Dong Ling to be sure was not there but in his place reigned Pete s grandniece a fresh faced capable young woman who Bertram declared cooked like an angel and minded her own business like a man Pete as of yore had full charge of the house and a casual eye would see few changes Even the brothers themselves saw few for that matter True at the very first Billy had donned a ruffled apron and a bewitching dust cap and had traversed the house from cellar to garret with a prettily important air of managing things as she suggested changes right and left She had summoned Pete too for three mornings in succession and with great dignity had ordered the meals for the day But when Bertram was discovered one evening tugging back his favorite chair and when William had asked if Billy were through using his pipe tray the young wife had concluded to let things remain about as they were And when William ate no breakfast one morning and Bertram aggrievedly refused dessert that night at dinner Billy learning through an apologetic Pete that Master William always had to have eggs for breakfast no matter what else there was and that Master Bertram never ate boiled rice gave up planning the meals True for three more mornings she summoned Pete for orders but the orders were nothing more nor less than a blithe Well Pete what are we going to have for dinner to day By the end of a week even this ceremony was given up and before a month had passed Billy was little more than a guest in her own home so far as responsibility was concerned Billy was not idle however far from it First there were the delightful hours with Bertram Then there was her music Billy was writing a new song the best she had ever written Billy declared Why Bertram it can t help being that she said to her husband one day The words just sang themselves to me right out of my heart and the melody just dropped down from the sky And now everywhere I m hearing the most wonderful harmonies The whole universe is singing to me If only now I can put it on paper what I hear Then I can make the whole universe sing to some one else Even music however had to step one side for the wedding calls which were beginning to be received and which must be returned in spite of the occasional rebellion of the young husband There were the more intimate friends to be seen also and Cyril and Marie to be visited And always there was the Annex The Annex was in fine running order now and was a source of infinite satisfaction to its founder and great happiness to its beneficiaries Tommy Dunn was there learning wonderful things from books and still more wonderful things from the piano in the living room Alice Greggory and her mother were there too the result of much persuasion Indeed according to Bertram Billy had been able to fill the Annex only by telling each prospective resident that he or she was absolutely necessary to the welfare and happiness of every other resident Not that the house was full either There were still two unoccupied rooms But then I m glad there are Billy had declared for there s sure to be some one that I ll want to send there Some one did you say Bertram had retorted meaningly but his wife had disdained to answer this Billy herself was frequently at the Annex She told Aunt Hannah that she had to come often to bring the happiness it accumulated so fast Certainly she always found plenty to do there whenever she came There was Aunt Hannah to be read to missus Greggory to be sung to and Tommy Dunn to be listened to for Tommy Dunn was always quivering with eagerness to play her his latest piece Billy knew that some day at the Annex she would meet mister M J Arkwright and she told herself that she hoped she should Billy had not seen Arkwright except on the stage of the Boston Opera House since the day he had left her presence in white faced stony eyed misery after declaring his love for her and learning of her engagement to Bertram Since then she knew he had been much with his old friend Alice Greggory She did not believe should she see him now that he would be either white faced or stony eyed His heart she was sure had gone where it ought to have gone in the first place to Alice Such being in her opinion the case she longed to get the embarrassment of a first meeting between themselves over with for after that she was sure their old friendship could be renewed and she would be in a position to further this pretty love affair between him and Alice Very decidedly therefore Billy wished to meet Arkwright Very pleased consequently was she when one day coming into the living room at the Annex she found the man sitting by the fire Arkwright was on his feet at once Miss missus H Henshaw he stammered Oh mister Arkwright she cried with just a shade of nervousness in her voice as she advanced her hand outstretched I m glad to see you Thank you I wanted to see Miss Greggory he murmured Then as the unconscious rudeness of his reply dawned on him he made matters infinitely worse by an attempted apology That is I mean I didn t mean he began to stammer miserably Some girls might have tossed the floundering man a straw in the shape of a light laugh intended to turn aside all embarrassment but not Billy Billy held out a frankly helping hand that was meant to set the man squarely on his feet at her side mister Arkwright don t please she begged earnestly You and I don t need to beat about the bush I am glad to see you and I hope you re glad to see me We re going to be the best of friends from now on I m sure and some day soon you re going to bring Alice to see me and we ll have some music I left her up stairs She ll be down at once I dare say I met Rosa going up with your card Good by she finished with a bright smile as she turned and walked rapidly from the room Outside on the steps Billy drew a long breath There she whispered that s over and well over The next minute she frowned vexedly She had missed her glove Never mind I sha n t go back in there for it now anyway she decided In the living room five minutes later Alice Greggory found only a hastily scrawled note waiting for her If you ll forgive the unforgivable she read you ll forgive me for not being here when you come down Circumstances over which I have no control have called me away May we let it go at that M J ARKWRIGHT As Alice Greggory s amazed questioning eyes left the note they fell upon the long white glove on the floor by the door Half mechanically she crossed the room and picked it up but almost at once she dropped it with a low cry Billy He saw Billy Then a flood of understanding dyed her face scarlet as she turned and fled to the blessedly unseeing walls of her own room Not ten minutes later Rosa tapped at her door with a note It s from mister Arkwright Miss He s downstairs Rosa s eyes were puzzled and a bit startled mister Arkwright Yes Miss He s come again That is I didn t know he d went but he must have for he s come again now He wrote something in a little book then he tore it out and gave it to me He said he d wait please for an answer Oh very well Rosa Miss Greggory took the note and spoke with an elaborate air of indifference that was meant to express a calm ignoring of the puzzled questioning in the other s eyes The next moment she read this in Arkwright s peculiar scrawl If you ve already forgiven the unforgivable you ll do it again I know and come down stairs Won t you please I want to see you Miss Greggory lifted her head with a jerk Her face was a painful red Tell mister Arkwright I can t possibly She came to an abrupt pause Her eyes had encountered Rosa s and in Rosa s eyes the puzzled questioning was plainly fast becoming a shrewd suspicion There was the briefest of hesitations then lightly Miss Greggory tossed the note aside Tell mister Arkwright I ll be down at once please she directed carelessly as she turned back into the room But she was not down at once She was not down until she had taken time to bathe her red eyes powder her telltale nose smoothe her ruffled hair and whip herself into the calm steady eyed self controlled young woman that Arkwright finally rose to meet when she came into the room I thought it was only women who were privileged to change their mind she began brightly but Arkwright ignored her attempt to conventionalize the situation Thank you for coming down he said with a weariness that instantly drove the forced smile from the girl s lips I I wanted to to talk to you Yes She seated herself and motioned him to a chair near her He took the seat and then fell silent his eyes out the window I thought you said you you wanted to talk she reminded him nervously after a minute I did He turned with disconcerting abruptness Alice I m going to tell you a story I shall be glad to listen People always like stories don t they Do they The somber pain in Arkwright s eyes deepened Alice Greggory did not know it but he was thinking of another story he had once told in that same room Billy was his listener then while now A little precipitately he began to speak When I was a very small boy I went to visit my uncle who in his young days had been quite a hunter Before the fireplace in his library was a huge tiger skin with a particularly lifelike head The first time I saw it I screamed and ran and hid I refused then even to go into the room again My cousins urged scolded pleaded and laughed at me by turns but I was obdurate I would not go where I could see the fearsome thing again even though it was as they said nothing but a dead old rug Finally one day my uncle took a hand in the matter By sheer will power he forced me to go with him straight up to the dreaded creature and stand by its side He laid one of my shrinking hands on the beast s smooth head and thrust the other one quite into the open red mouth with its gleaming teeth You see he said there s absolutely nothing to fear He can t possibly hurt you Just as if you weren t bigger and finer and stronger in every way than that dead thing on the floor Then when he had got me to the point where of my own free will I would walk up and touch the thing he drew a lesson for me Now remember he charged me Never run and hide again Only cowards do that Walk straight up and face the thing Ten to one you ll find it s nothing but a dead skin masquerading as the real thing Even if it isn t if it s alive face it Find a weapon and fight it Know that you are going to conquer it and you ll conquer Never run Be a man Men don t run my boy Arkwright paused and drew a long breath He did not look at the girl in the opposite chair If he had looked he would have seen a face transfigured Well he resumed I never forgot that tiger skin nor what it stood for after that day when Uncle Ben thrust my hand into its hideous but harmless red mouth Even as a kid I began then to try not to run I ve tried ever since But to day I did run Arkwright s voice had been getting lower and lower The last three words would have been almost inaudible to ears less sensitively alert than were Alice Greggory s For a moment after the words were uttered only the clock s ticking broke the silence then with an obvious effort the man roused himself as if breaking away from some benumbing force that held him Alice I don t need to tell you after what I said the other night that I loved Billy Neilson That was bad enough for I found she was pledged to another man But to day I discovered something worse I discovered that I loved Billy Henshaw another man s wife And I ran But I ve come back I m going to face the thing Oh I m not deceiving myself This love of mine is no dead tiger skin It s a beast alive and alert God pity me to destroy my very soul But I m going to fight it and I want you to help me The girl gave a half smothered cry The man turned but he could not see her face distinctly Twilight had come and the room was full of shadows He hesitated then went on a little more quietly That s why I ve told you all this so you would help me And you will won t you There was no answer Once again he tried to see her face but it was turned now quite away from him You ve been a big help already little girl Your friendship your comradeship they ve been everything to me You re not going to make me do without them now No oh no The answer was low and a little breathless but he heard it Thank you I knew you wouldn t He paused then rose to his feet When he spoke again his voice carried a note of whimsical lightness that was a little forced But I must go else you will take them from me and with good reason And please don t let your kind heart grieve too much over me I m no deep dyed villain in a melodrama nor wicked lover in a ten penny novel you know I m just an everyday man in real life and we re going to fight this thing out in everyday living That s where your help is coming in We ll go together to see missus Bertram Henshaw She s asked us to and you ll do it I know We ll have music and everyday talk We ll see missus Bertram Henshaw in her own home with her husband where she belongs and I m not going to run again But I m counting on your help you know he smiled a little wistfully as he held out his hand in good by One minute later Alice Greggory alone was hurrying up stairs I can t I can t I know I can t she was whispering wildly Then in her own room she faced herself in the mirror

none	none	Alice Greggory she asserted with swift change of voice and manner This is your tiger skin and you re going to fight it Do you understand fight it And you re going to win too Do you want that man to know you care CHAPTER VI THE PAINTING LOOK It was toward the last of October that Billy began to notice her husband s growing restlessness Twice when she had been playing to him she turned to find him testing the suppleness of his injured arm Several times failing to receive an answer to her questions she had looked up to discover him gazing abstractedly at nothing in particular They read and walked and talked together to be sure and Bertram s devotion to her lightest wish was beyond question but more and more frequently these days Billy found him hovering over his sketches in his studio and once when he failed to respond to the dinner bell search revealed him buried in a profound treatise on The Art of Foreshortening Then came the day when Billy after an hour s vain effort to imprison within notes a tantalizing melody captured the truant and rain down to the studio to tell Bertram of her victory But Bertram did not seem even to hear her True he leaped to his feet and hurried to meet her his face radiantly aglow but she had not ceased to speak before he himself was talking Billy Billy I ve been sketching he cried My hand is almost steady See some of those lines are all right I just picked up a crayon and He stopped abruptly his eyes on Billy s face A vaguely troubled shadow crossed his own Did did you were you saying anything in in particular when you came in he stammered For a short half minute Billy looked at her husband without speaking Then a little queerly she laughed Oh no nothing at all in particular she retorted airily The next moment with one of her unexpected changes of manner she darted across the room picked up a palette and a handful of brushes from the long box near it Advancing toward her husband she held them out dramatically And now paint my lord paint she commanded him with stern insistence as she thrust them into his hands Bertram laughed shamefacedly Oh I say Billy he began but Billy had gone Out in the hall Billy was speeding up stairs talking fiercely to herself We ll Billy Neilson Henshaw it s come Now behave yourself That was the painting look You know what that means Remember he belongs to his Art before he does to you Kate and everybody says so And you you expected him to tend to you and your silly little songs Do you want to ruin his career As if now he could spend all his time and give all his thoughts to you But I I just hate that Art What did you say Billy asked William in mild surprise coming around the turn of the balustrade in the hall above Were you speaking to me my dear Billy looked up Her face cleared suddenly and she laughed though a little ruefully No Uncle William I wasn t talking to you she sighed I was just just administering first aid to the injured she finished as she whisked into her own room Well well bless the child What can she mean by that puzzled Uncle William turning to go down the stairway Bertram began to paint a very little the next day He painted still more the next and yet more again the day following He was like a bird let out of a cage so joyously alive was he The old sparkle came back to his eye the old gay smile to his lips Now that they had come back Billy realized what she had not been conscious of before that for several weeks past they had not been there and she wondered which hurt the more that they had not been there before or that they were there now Then she scolded herself roundly for asking the question at all They were not easy those days for Billy though always to Bertram she managed to show a cheerfully serene face To Uncle William also and to Aunt Hannah she showed a smiling countenance and because she could not talk to anybody else of her feelings she talked to herself This however was no new thing for Billy to do From earliest childhood she had fought things out in like manner But it s so absurd of you Billy Henshaw she berated herself one day when Bertram had become so absorbed in his work that he had forgotten to keep his appointment with her for a walk Just because you have had his constant attention almost every hour since you were married is no reason why you should have it every hour now when his arm is better Besides it s exactly what you said you wouldn t do object to his giving proper time to his work But I m not objecting stormed the other half of herself I m telling him to do it It s only that he s so so pleased to do it He doesn t seem to mind a bit being away from me He s actually happy Well don t you want him to be happy in his work Fie For shame A fine artist s wife you are It seems Kate was right then you are going to spoil his career Ho quoth Billy and tossed her head Forthwith she crossed the room to her piano and plumped herself down hard on to the stool Then from under her fingers there fell a rollicking melody that seemed to fill the room with little dancing feet Faster and faster sped Billy s fingers swifter and swifter twinkled the little dancing feet Then a door was jerked open and Bertram s voice called Billy The music stopped instantly Billy sprang from her seat her eyes eagerly seeking the direction from which had come the voice Perhaps perhaps Bertram wanted her Perhaps he was not going to paint any longer that morning after all Billy called the voice again Please do you mind stopping that playing just for a little while I m a brute I know dear but my brush will try to keep time with that crazy little tune of yours and you know my hand is none too steady anyhow and when it tries to keep up with that jiggety jig jig jiggety jig jig Do you mind darling just just sewing or doing something still for a while All the light fled from Billy s face but her voice when she spoke was the quintessence of cheery indifference Why no of course not dear Thank you I knew you wouldn t sighed Bertram Then the door shut For a long minute Billy stood motionless before she glanced at her watch and sped to the telephone Is Miss Greggory there Rosa she called when the operator s ring was answered Mis Greggory the lame one No Miss Greggory Miss Alice Oh Yes m Then won t you ask her to come to the telephone please There was a moment s wait during which Billy s small well shod foot beat a nervous tattoo on the floor Oh is that you Alice she called then Are you going to be home for an hour or two Why y yes yes indeed Then I m coming over We ll play duets sing anything I want some music Do And mister Arkwright is here He ll help mister Arkwright You say he s there Then I won t Yes I will too Billy spoke with renewed firmness I ll be there right away Good by And she hung up the receiver and went to tell Pete to order John and Peggy at once I suppose I ought to have left Alice and mister Arkwright alone together muttered the young wife feverishly as she hurriedly prepared for departure But I ll make it up to them later I m going to give them lots of chances But to day to day I just had to go somewhere At the Annex with Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy sang duets and trios and reveled in a sonorous wilderness of new music to her heart s content Then rested refreshed and at peace with all the world she hurried home to dinner and to Bertram There I feel better she sighed as she took off her hat in her own room and now I ll go find Bertram Bless his heart of course he didn t want me to play when he was so busy Billy went straight to the studio but Bertram was not there Neither was he in William s room nor anywhere in the house Down stairs in the dining room Pete was found looking rather white leaning back in a chair He struggled at once to his feet however as his mistress entered the room Billy hurried forward with a startled exclamation Why Pete what is it Are you sick she cried her glance encompassing the half set table No ma am oh no ma am The old man stumbled forward and began to arrange the knives and forks It s just a pesky pain beggin yer pardon in my side But I ain t sick No Miss ma am Billy frowned and shook her head Her eyes were on Pete s palpably trembling hands But Pete you are sick she protested Let Eliza do that Pete drew himself stiffly erect The color had begun to come back to his face There hain t no one set this table much but me for more n fifty years an I ve got a sort of notion that nobody can do it just ter suit me Besides I m better now It s gone that pain But Pete what is it How long have you had it I hain t had it any time steady It s the comin an goin kind It seems silly ter mind it at all only when it does come it sort o takes the backbone right out o my knees and they double up so s I have ter set down There ye see I m pert as a sparrer now And with stiff celerity Pete resumed his task His mistress still frowned That isn t right Pete she demurred with a slow shake of her head You should see a doctor The old man paled a little He had seen a doctor and he had not liked what the doctor had told him In fact he stubbornly refused to believe what the doctor had said He straightened himself now a little aggressively Humph Beggin yer pardon Miss ma am but I don t think much o them doctor chaps Billy shook her head again as she smiled and turned away Then as if casually she asked Oh did mister Bertram go out Pete Yes Miss about five o clock He said he d be back to dinner Oh All right From the hall the telephone jangled sharply I ll go said Pete s mistress as she turned and hurried up stairs It was Bertram s voice that answered her opening Hullo Oh Billy is that you dear Well you re just the one I wanted I wanted to say that is I wanted to ask you The speaker cleared his throat a little nervously and began all over again The fact is Billy I ve run across a couple of old classmates on from New York and they are very anxious I should stay down to dinner with them Would you mind very much if I did A cold hand seemed to clutch Billy s heart She caught her breath with a little gasp and tried to speak but she had to try twice before the words came Why no no of course not Billy s voice was very high pitched and a little shaky but it was surpassingly cheerful You sure you won t be lonesome Bertram s voice was vaguely troubled Of course not You ve only to say the word little girl came Bertram s anxious tones again and I won t stay Billy swallowed convulsively If only only he would stop and leave her to herself As if she were going to own up that she was lonesome for him if he was not lonesome for her Nonsense of course you ll stay called Billy still in that high pitched shaky treble Then before Bertram could answer she uttered a gay Good by and hung up the receiver Billy had ten whole minutes in which to cry before Pete s gong sounded for dinner but she had only one minute in which to try to efface the woefully visible effects of those ten minutes before William tapped at her door and called Gone to sleep my dear Dinner s ready Didn t you hear the gong Yes I m coming Uncle William Billy spoke with breezy gayety and threw open the door but she did not meet Uncle William s eyes Her head was turned away Her hands were fussing with the hang of her skirt Bertram s dining out Pete tells me observed William with cheerful nonchalance as they went down stairs together Billy bit her lip and looked up sharply She had been bracing herself to meet with disdainful indifference this man s pity the pity due a poor neglected wife whose husband preferred to dine with old classmates rather than with herself Now she found in William s face not pity but a calm even jovial acceptance of the situation as a matter of course She had known she was going to hate that pity but now curiously enough she was conscious only of anger that the pity was not there that she might hate it She tossed her head a little So even William Uncle William regarded this monstrous thing as an insignificant matter of everyday experience Maybe he expected it to occur frequently every night or so Doubtless he did expect it to occur every night or so Indeed Very well As if she were going to show now that she cared whether Bertram were there or not They should see So with head held high and eyes asparkle Billy marched into the dining room and took her accustomed place CHAPTER VII THE BIG BAD QUARREL It was a brilliant dinner because Billy made it so At first William met her sallies of wit with mild surprise but it was not long before he rose gallantly to the occasion and gave back full measure of retort Even Pete twice had to turn his back to hide a smile and once his hand shook so that the tea he was carrying almost spilled This threatened catastrophe however seemed to frighten him so much that his face was very grave throughout the rest of the dinner Still laughing and talking gayly Billy and Uncle William after the meal was over ascended to the drawing room There however the man in spite of the young woman s gay badinage fell to dozing in the big chair before the fire leaving Billy with only Spunkie for company Spunkie who disdaining every effort to entice her into a romp only winked and blinked stupid eyes and finally curled herself on the rug for a nap Billy left to her own devices glanced at her watch Half past seven Time almost for Bertram to be coming He had said dinner and of course after dinner was over he would be coming home to her Very well she would show him that she had at least got along without him as well as he had without her At all events he would not find her forlornly sitting with her nose pressed against the window pane And forthwith Billy established herself in a big chair with its back carefully turned toward the door by which Bertram would enter and opened a book Five ten fifteen minutes passed Billy fidgeted in her chair twisted her neck to look out into the hall and dropped her book with a bang Uncle William jerked himself awake and Spunkie opened sleepy eyes Then both settled themselves for another nap Billy sighed picked up her book and flounced back into her chair But she did not read Disconsolately she sat staring straight ahead until a quick step on the sidewalk outside stirred her into instant action Assuming a look of absorbed interest she twitched the book open and held it before her face But the step passed by the door and Billy saw then that her book was upside down Five ten fifteen more minutes passed Billy still sat apparently reading though she had not turned a page The book now however was right side up One by one other minutes passed till the great clock in the hall struck nine long strokes Well well bless my soul mumbled Uncle William resolutely forcing himself to wake up What time was that Nine o clock Billy spoke with tragic distinctness yet very cheerfully Eh Only nine blinked Uncle William I thought it must be ten Well anyhow I believe I ll go up stairs I seem to be unusually sleepy Billy said nothing Only nine indeed she was thinking wrathfully At the door Uncle William turned You re not going to sit up my dear of course he remarked For the second time that evening a cold hand seemed to clutch Billy s heart Sit up Had it come already to that Was she even now a wife who had need to sit up for her husband I really wouldn t my dear advised Uncle William again Good night Oh but I m not sleepy at all yet Billy managed to declare brightly Good night Then Uncle William went up stairs Billy turned to her book which happened to be one of William s on Fake Antiques To collect anything these days requires expert knowledge and the utmost care and discrimination read Billy s eyes So Uncle William expected Bertram was going to spend the whole evening as well as stay to dinner ran Billy s thoughts The enormous quantity of bijouterie Dresden and Battersea enamel ware that is now flooding the market is made on the Continent and made chiefly for the American trade continued the book Well who cares if it is snapped Billy springing to her feet and tossing the volume aside Spunkie come here You ve simply got to play with me Do you hear I want to be gay gay GAY He s gay He s down there with those men where he wants to be Where he d rather be than be with me Do you think I want him to come home and find me moping over a stupid old book Not much I m going to have him find me gay too Now come Spunkie hurry wake up He ll be here right away I m sure And Billy shook a pair of worsted reins hung with little soft balls full in Spunkie s face But Spunkie would not wake up and Spunkie would not play She pretended to She bit at the reins and sank her sharp claws into the dangling balls For a fleeting instant even something like mischief gleamed in her big yellow eyes Then the jaws relaxed the paws turned to velvet and Spunkie s sleek gray head settled slowly back into lazy comfort Spunkie was asleep Billy gazed at the cat with reproachful eyes And you too Spunkie she murmured Then she got to her feet and went back to her chair This time she picked up a magazine and began to turn the leaves very fast one after another Half past nine came then ten Pete appeared at the door to get Spunkie and to see that everything was all right for the night mister Bertram is not in yet he began doubtfully Billy shook her head with a bright smile No Pete Go to bed I expect him every minute Good night Thank you ma am Good night The old man picked up the sleepy cat and went down stairs A little later Billy heard his quiet steps coming back through the hall and ascending the stairs She listened until from away at the top of the house she heard his door close Then she drew a long breath Ten o clock after ten o clock and Bertram not there yet And was this what he called dinner Did one eat then till ten o clock when one dined with one s friends Billy was angry now very angry She was too angry to be reasonable This thing that her husband had done seemed monstrous to her smarting as she was under the sting of hurt pride and grieved loneliness the state of mind into which she had worked herself No longer now did she wish to be gay when her husband came No longer did she even pretend to assume indifference Bertram had done wrong He had been unkind cruel thoughtless inconsiderate of her comfort and happiness Furthermore he did not love her as well as she did him or he never never could have done it She would let him see when he came just how hurt and grieved she was and how disappointed too Billy was walking the floor now back and forth back and forth Half past ten came then eleven As the eleven long strokes reverberated through the silent house Billy drew in her breath and held it suspended A new look came to her eyes A growing terror crept into them and culminated in a frightened stare at the clock Billy ran then to the great outer door and pulled it open A cold wind stung her face and caused her to shut the door quickly Back and forth she began to pace the floor again but in five minutes she had run to the door once more This time she wore a heavy coat of Bertram s which she caught up as she passed the hall rack Out on to the broad top step Billy hurried and peered down the street As far as she could see not a person was in sight Across the street in the Public Garden the wind stirred the gray tree branches and set them to casting weird shadows on the bare frozen ground A warning something behind her sent Billy scurrying into the house just in time to prevent the heavy door s closing and shutting her out keyless in the cold Half past eleven came and again Billy ran to the door This time she put the floor mat against the casing so that the door could not close Once more she peered wildly up and down the street and across into the deserted wind swept Garden There was only terror now in Billy s face The anger was all gone In Billy s mind there was not a shadow of doubt something had happened to Bertram Bertram was ill hurt dead And he was so good so kind so noble such a dear dear husband If only she could see him once If only she could ask his forgiveness for those wicked unkind accusing thoughts If only she could tell him again that she did love him If only Far down the street a step rang sharply on the frosty air A masculine figure was hurrying toward the house Retreating well into the shadow of the doorway Billy watched it her heart pounding against her side in great suffocating throbs Nearer and nearer strode the approaching figure until Billy had almost sprung to meet it with a glad cry almost but not quite for the figure neither turned nor paused but marched straight on and Billy saw then under the arc light a brown bearded man who was not Bertram at all Three times during the next few minutes did the waiting little bride on the doorstep watch with palpitating yearning a shadowy form appear approach and pass by At the third heart breaking disappointment Billy wrung her hands helplessly I don t see how there can be so many utterly useless people in the world she choked Then thoroughly chilled and sick at heart she went into the house and closed the door Once again back and forth back and forth Billy took up her weary vigil She still wore the heavy coat She had forgotten to take it off Her face was pitifully white and drawn Her eyes were wild One of her hands was nervously caressing the rough sleeve of the coat as it hung from her shoulder One two three Billy gave a sharp cry and ran into the hall Yes it was twelve o clock And now always all the rest of the dreary useless hours that that clock would tick away through an endless existence she would have to live without Bertram If only she could see him once more But she could not He was dead He must be dead now Here it was twelve o clock and There came a quick step the click of a key in the lock then the door swung back and Bertram big strong and merry eyed stood before her Well well hullo he called jovially Why Billy what s the matter he broke off in quite a different tone of voice And then a curious thing happened Billy who a minute before had been seeing only a dear noble adorable lost Bertram saw now suddenly only the man that had stayed happily till midnight with two friends while she she Matter Matter exclaimed Billy sharply then Is this what you call staying to dinner Bertram Henshaw Bertram stared A slow red stole to his forehead It was his first experience of coming home to meet angry eyes that questioned his behavior and he did not like it He had been perhaps a little conscience smitten when he saw how late he had stayed and he had intended to say he was sorry of course But to be thus sharply called to account for a perfectly innocent good time with a couple of friends To come home and find Billy making a ridiculous scene like this He he would not stand for it He Bertram s lips snapped open The angry retort was almost spoken when something in the piteously quivering chin and white drawn face opposite stopped it just in time Why Billy darling he murmured instead It was Billy s turn to change All the anger melted away before the dismayed tenderness in those dear eyes and the grieved hurt in that dear voice Well you you I Billy began to cry It was all right then of course for the next minute she was crying on Bertram s big broad shoulder and in the midst of broken words kisses gentle pats and inarticulate croonings the Big Bad Quarrel that had been all ready to materialize faded quite away into nothingness I didn t have such an awfully good time anyhow avowed Bertram when speech became rational I d rather have been home with you Nonsense blinked Billy valiantly Of course you had a good time and it was perfectly right you should have it too And I I hope you ll have it again I sha n t emphasized Bertram promptly not and leave you Billy regarded him with adoring eyes I ll tell you we ll have em come here she proposed gayly Sure we will agreed Bertram Yes sure we will echoed Billy with a contented sigh Then a little breathlessly she added Anyhow I ll know where you are I won t think you re dead You blessed little goose scolded Bertram punctuating each word with a kiss Billy drew a long sigh If this is a quarrel I m going to have them often she announced placidly Billy The young husband was plainly aghast Well I am because I like the making up dimpled Billy with a mischievous twinkle as she broke from his clasp and skipped ahead up the stairway CHAPTER VIII BILLY CULTIVATES A COMFORTABLE INDIFFERENCE The next morning under the uncompromising challenge of a bright sun Billy began to be uneasily suspicious that she had been just a bit unreasonable and exacting the night before To make matters worse she chanced to run across a newspaper criticism of a new book bearing the ominous title When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives Such a title of course attracted her supersensitive attention at once and with a curiously faint feeling she picked up the paper and began to read As the most of the criticism was taken up with quotations from the book it was such sentences as these that met her startled eyes Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the realization that while her husband loves her very much he can still make plans with his old friends which do not include herself Then is when the foolish wife lets her husband see how hurt she is that he can want to be with any one but herself Then is when the husband used all his life to independence perhaps begins to chafe under these new bonds that hold him so fast No man likes to be held up at the end of a threatened scene and made to give an account of himself Before a woman has learned to cultivate a comfortable indifference to her husband s comings and goings she is apt to be tyrannical and exacting Comfortable indifference indeed stormed Billy to herself As if I ever could be comfortably indifferent to anything Bertram did She dropped the paper but there were still other quotations from the book there she knew and in a moment she was back at the table reading them No man however fondly he loves his wife likes to feel that she is everlastingly peering into the recesses of his mind and weighing his every act to find out if he does or does not love her to day as well as he did yesterday at this time Then when spontaneity is dead she is the chief mourner at its funeral A few couples never leave the Garden of Eden They grow old hand in hand They are the ones who bear and forbear who have learned to adjust themselves to the intimate relationship of living together A certain amount of liberty both of action and thought must be allowed on each side The family shut in upon itself grows so narrow that all interest in the outside world is lost No two people are ever fitted to fill each other s lives entirely They ought not to try to do it If they do try the process is belittling to each and the result if it is successful is nothing less than a tragedy for it could not mean the highest ideals nor the truest devotion Brushing up against other interests and other personalities is good for both husband and wife Then to each other they bring the best of what they have found and each to the other continues to be new and interesting The young wife however is apt to be jealous of everything that turns her husband s attention for one moment away from herself She is jealous of his thoughts his words his friends even his business But the wife who has learned to be the clinging vine when her husband wishes her to cling and to be the sturdy oak when clinging vines would be tiresome has solved a tremendous problem At this point Billy dropped the paper She flung it down indeed a bit angrily There were still a few more words in the criticism mostly the critic s own opinion of the book but Billy did not care for this She had read quite enough boo much in fact All that sort of talk might be very well even necessary perhaps she told herself for ordinary husbands and wives but for her and Bertram Then vividly before her rose those initial quoted words Perhaps the first test comes when the young wife awakes to the realization that while her husband loves her very much he can still make plans with his old friends which do not include herself Billy frowned and put her finger to her lips Was that then last night a test Had she been tyrannical and exacting Was she everlastingly peering into the recesses of Bertram s mind and weighing his every act Was Bertram already beginning to chafe under these new bonds that held him No no never that She could not believe that But what if he should sometime begin to chafe What if they two should in days to come degenerate into just the ordinary everyday married folk whom she saw about her everywhere and for whom just such horrid books as this must be written It was unbelievable unthinkable And yet that man had said With a despairing sigh Billy picked up the paper once more and read carefully every word again When she had finished she stood soberly thoughtful her eyes out of the window After all it was nothing but the same old story She was exacting She did want her husband s every thought She gloried in peering into every last recess of his mind if she had half a chance She was jealous of his work She had almost hated his painting at times She had held him up with a threatened scene only the night before and demanded that he should give an account of himself She had very likely been the clinging vine when she should have been the sturdy oak Very well then Billy lifted her head and threw back her shoulders He should have no further cause for complaint She would be an oak She would cultivate that comfortable indifference to his comings and goings She would brush up against other interests and personalities so as to be new and interesting to her husband She would not be tyrannical exacting or jealous She would not threaten scenes nor peer into recesses Whatever happened she would not let Bertram begin to chafe against those bonds Having arrived at this heroic and to her eminently satisfactory state of mind Billy turned from the window and fell to work on a piece of manuscript music Brush up against other interests she admonished herself sternly as she reached for her pen Theoretically it was beautiful but practically Billy began at once to be that oak Not an hour after she had first seen the fateful notice of When the Honeymoon Wanes Bertram s ring sounded at the door down stairs Bertram always let himself in with his latchkey but from the first of Billy s being there he had given a peculiar ring at the bell which would bring his wife flying to welcome him if she were anywhere in the house To day when the bell sounded Billy sprang as usual to her feet with a joyous There s Bertram But the next moment she fell back Tut tut Billy Neilson Henshaw Learn to cultivate a comfortable indifference to your husband s comings and goings she whispered fiercely Then she sat down and fell to work again A moment later she heard her husband s voice talking to some one Pete she surmised Here You say she s here Then she heard Bertram s quick step on the stairs The next minute very quietly he came to her door Ho he ejaculated gayly as she rose to receive his kiss I thought I d find you asleep when you didn t hear my ring Billy reddened a little Oh no I wasn t asleep But you didn t hear Bertram stopped abruptly an odd look in his eyes Maybe you did hear it though he corrected Billy colored more confusedly The fact that she looked so distressed did not tend to clear Bertram s face Why of course Billy I didn t mean to insist on your coming to meet me he began a little stiffly but Billy interrupted him Why Bertram I just love to go to meet you she maintained indignantly Then remembering just in time she amended That is I did love to meet you until With a sudden realization that she certainly had not helped matters any she came to an embarrassed pause A puzzled frown showed on Bertram s face You did love to meet me until he repeated after her then his face changed Billy you aren t you can t be laying up last night against me he reproached her a little irritably Last night Why of course not retorted Billy in a panic at the bare mention of the test which according to When the Honeymoon Wanes was at the root of all her misery Already she thought she detected in Bertram s voice signs that he was beginning to chafe against those bonds It is a matter of of the utmost indifference to me what time you come home at night my dear she finished airily as she sat down to her work again Bertram stared then he frowned turned on his heel and left the room Bertram who knew nothing of the Talk to Young Wives in the newspaper at Billy s feet was surprised puzzled and just a bit angry Billy left alone jabbed her pen with such force against her paper that the note she was making became an unsightly blot Well if this is what that man calls being comfortably indifferent I d hate to try the un comfortable kind she muttered with emphasis CHAPTER IX THE DINNER BILLY TRIED TO GET Notwithstanding what Billy was disposed to regard as the non success of her first attempt to profit by the Talk to Young Wives she still frantically tried to avert the waning of her honeymoon Assiduously she cultivated the prescribed indifference and with at least apparent enthusiasm she sought the much to be desired outside interests That is she did all this when she thought of it when something reminded her of the sword of destruction hanging over her happiness At other times when she was just being happy without question she was her old self impulsive affectionate and altogether adorable Naturally under these circumstances her conduct was somewhat erratic For three days perhaps she would fly to the door at her husband s ring and hang upon his every movement Then for the next three she would be a veritable will o the wisp for elusiveness caring apparently not one whit whether her husband came or went until poor Bertram at his wit s end scourged himself with a merciless catechism as to what he had done to vex her Then perhaps just when he had nerved himself almost to the point of asking her what was the trouble there would come another change bringing back to him the old Billy joyous winsome and devoted plainly caring nothing for anybody or anything but himself Scarcely however would he become sure that it was his Billy back again before she was off once more quite beyond his reach singing with Arkwright and Alice Greggory playing with Tommy Dunn plunging into some club or church work anything but being with him That all this was puzzling and disquieting to Bertram Billy not once suspected Billy so far as she was concerned was but cultivating a comfortable indifference brushing up against outside interests and being an oak December passed and January came bringing Miss Marguerite Winthrop to her Boston home Bertram s arm was as good as ever now according to its owner and the sittings for the new portrait began at once This left Billy even more to her own devices for Bertram entered into his new work with an enthusiasm born of a glad relief from forced idleness and a consuming eagerness to prove that even though he had failed the first time he could paint a portrait of Marguerite Winthrop that would be a credit to himself a conclusive retort to his critics and a source of pride to his once mortified friends With his whole heart therefore he threw himself into the work before him staying sometimes well into the afternoon on the days Miss Winthrop could find time between her social engagements to give him a sitting It was on such a day toward the middle of the month that Billy was called to the telephone at half past twelve o clock to speak to her husband Billy dear began Bertram at once if you don t mind I m staying to luncheon at Miss Winthrop s kind request We ve changed the pose neither of us was satisfied you know but we haven t quite settled on the new one Miss Winthrop has two whole hours this afternoon that she can give me if I ll stay and of course under the circumstances I want to do it Of course echoed Billy Billy s voice was indomitably cheerful Thank you dear I knew you d understand sighed Bertram contentedly You see really two whole hours so it s a chance I can t afford to lose Of course you can t echoed Billy again All right then Good by till to night called the man Good by answered Billy still cheerfully As she turned away however she tossed her head A new pose indeed she muttered with some asperity Just as if there could be a new pose after all those she tried last year Immediately after luncheon Pete and Eliza started for South Boston to pay a visit to Eliza s mother and it was soon after they left the house that Bertram called his wife up again Say dearie I forgot to tell you he began but I met an old friend in the subway this morning and I well I remembered what you said about bringing em home to dinner next time so I asked him for to night Do you mind It s Mind Of course not I m glad you did plunged in Billy with feverish eagerness Even now just the bare mention of anything connected with that awful test night was enough to set Billy s nerves to tingling I want you to always bring them home Bertram All right dear We ll be there at six o clock then It s it s Calderwell this time You remember Calderwell of course Not Hugh Calderwell Billy s question was a little faint Sure Bertram laughed oddly and lowered his voice I suspect once I wouldn t have brought him home to you I was too jealous But now well now maybe I want him to see what he s lost Bertram But Bertram only laughed mischievously and called a gay Good by till to night then Billy at her end of the wires hung up the receiver and backed against the wall a little palpitatingly Calderwell To dinner Calderwell Did she remember Calderwell Did she indeed As if one could easily forget the man that for a year or two had proposed marriage as regularly and almost as lightly as he had torn a monthly leaf from his calendar Besides was it not he too who had said that Bertram would never love any girl really that it would be only the tilt of her chin or the turn of her head that he loved to paint And now he was coming to dinner and with Bertram Very well he should see He should see that Bertram did love her her not the tilt of her chin nor the turn of her head He should see how happy they were what a good wife she made and how devoted and satisfied Bertram was in his home He should see And forthwith Billy picked up her skirts and tripped up stairs to select her very prettiest house gown to do honor to the occasion Up stairs however one thing and another delayed her so that it was four o clock when she turned her attention to her toilet and it was while she was hesitating whether to be stately and impressive in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine or cozy and tantalizingly homy in bronze gold crepe de Chine and swan s down that the telephone bell rang again Eliza and Pete had not yet returned so as before Billy answered it This time Eliza s shaking voice came to her Is that you ma am Why yes Eliza Yes m it s me ma am It s about Uncle Pete He s give us a turn that s most scared us out of our wits Pete You mean he s sick Yes ma am he was That is he is too only he s better now thank goodness panted Eliza But he ain t hisself yet He s that white and shaky Would you could you that is would you mind if we didn t come back till into the evenin maybe Why of course not cried Pete s mistress quickly Don t come a minute before he s able Eliza Don t come until to morrow Eliza gave a trembling little laugh Thank you ma am but there wouldn t be no keepin of Uncle Pete here till then If he could take five steps alone he d start now But he can t He says he ll be all right pretty quick though He s had em before these spells but never quite so bad as this I guess an he s worryin somethin turrible cause he can t start for home right away Nonsense cut in missus Bertram Henshaw Yes m I knew you d feel that way stammered Eliza gratefully You see I couldn t leave him to come alone and besides anyhow I d have to stay for mother ain t no more use than a wet dish rag at such times she s that scared herself And she ain t very well too So if if you could get along Of course we can And tell Pete not to worry one bit I m so sorry he s sick Thank you ma am Then we ll be there some time this evenin sighed Eliza From the telephone Billy turned away with a troubled face Pete is ill she was saying to herself I don t like the looks of it and he s so faithful he d come if With a little cry Billy stopped short Then tremblingly she sank into the nearest chair Calderwell and he s coming to dinner she moaned For two benumbed minutes Billy sat staring at nothing Then she ran to the telephone and called the Annex Aunt Hannah answered Aunt Hannah for heaven s sake if you love me pleaded Billy send Rosa down instanter Pete is sick over to South Boston and Eliza is with him and Bertram is bringing Hugh Calderwell home to dinner Can you spare Rosa Oh my grief and conscience Billy Of course I can I mean I could but Rosa isn t here dear child It s her day out you know O dear of course it is I might have known if I d thought but Pete and Eliza have spoiled me They never take days out at meal time both together I mean until to night But my dear child what will you do I don t know I ve got to think I must do something Of course you must I d come over myself if it wasn t for my cold As if I d let you There isn t anybody here only Tommy Even Alice is gone Oh Billy Billy this only goes to prove what I ve always said that no woman ought to be a wife until she s an efficient housekeeper and Yes yes Aunt Hannah I know moaned Billy frenziedly But I am a wife and I m not an efficient housekeeper and Hugh Calderwell won t wait for me to learn He s coming to night To night And I ve got to do something Never mind I ll fix it some way Good by But Billy Billy Oh my grief and conscience fluttered Aunt Hannah s voice across the wires as Billy snapped the receiver into place For the second time that day Billy backed palpitatingly against the wall Her eyes sought the clock fearfully Fifteen minutes past four She had an hour and three quarters She could of course telephone Bertram to dine Calderwell at a club or some hotel But to do this now the very first time when it had been her own suggestion that he bring them home no no she could not do that Anything but that Besides very likely she could not reach Bertram anyway Doubtless he had left the Winthrops by this time There was Marie She could telephone Marie But Marie could not very well come just now she knew and then too there was Cyril to be taken into consideration How Cyril would gibe at the wife who had to call in all the neighbors just because her husband was bringing home a friend to dinner How he would Well he shouldn t He should not have the chance So there With a jerk missus Bertram Henshaw pulled herself away from the wall and stood erect Her eyes snapped and the very poise of her chin spelled determination 
5139_61422_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Very well she would show them 
none	none	Was not Bertram bringing this man home because he was proud of her Mighty proud he would be if she had to call in half of Boston to get his dinner for him Nonsense She would get it herself Was not this the time if ever to be an oak A vine doubtless would lean and cling and telephone and whine I can t But not an oak An oak would hold up its head and say I can An oak would go ahead and get that dinner She would be an oak She would get that dinner What if she didn t know how to cook bread and cake and pies and things One did not have to cook bread and cake and pies just to get a dinner meat and potatoes and vegetables Besides she could make peach fritters She knew she could She would show them And with actually a bit of song on her lips Billy skipped up stairs for her ruffled apron and dust cap two necessary accompaniments to this dinner getting in her opinion Billy found the apron and dust cap with no difficulty but it took fully ten of her precious minutes to unearth from its obscure hiding place the blue and gold Bride s Helper cookbook one of Aunt Hannah s wedding gifts On the way to the kitchen Billy planned her dinner As was natural perhaps she chose the things she herself would like to eat I won t attempt anything very elaborate she said to herself It would be wiser to have something simple like chicken pie perhaps I love chicken pie And I ll have oyster stew first that is after the grapefruit Just oysters boiled in milk must be easier than soup to make I ll begin with grapefruit with a cherry in it like Pete fixes it Those don t have to be cooked anyhow I ll have fish Bertram loves the fish course Let me see halibut I guess with egg sauce I won t have any roast nothing but the chicken pie And I ll have squash and onions I can have a salad easy just lettuce and stuff That doesn t have to be cooked Oh and the peach fritters if I get time to make them For dessert well maybe I can find a new pie or pudding in the cookbook I want to use that cookbook for something after hunting all this time for it In the kitchen Billy found exquisite neatness and silence The first brought an approving light to her eyes but the second for some unapparent reason filled her heart with vague misgiving This feeling however Billy resolutely cast from her as she crossed the room dropped her book on to the table and turned toward the shining black stove There was an excellent fire Glowing points of light showed that only a good draft was needed to make the whole mass of coal red hot Billy however did not know this Her experience of fires was confined to burning wood in open grates and wood in open grates had to be poked to make it red and glowing With confident alacrity now therefore Billy caught up the poker thrust it into the mass of coals and gave them a fine stirring up Then she set back the lid of the stove and went to hunt up the ingredients for her dinner By the time Billy had searched five minutes and found no chicken no oysters and no halibut it occurred to her that her larder was not after all an open market and that one s provisions must be especially ordered to fit one s needs As to ordering them now Billy glanced at the clock and shook her head It s almost five already and they d never get here in time she sighed regretfully I ll have to have something else Billy looked now not for what she wanted but for what she could find And she found some cold roast lamb at which she turned up her nose an uncooked beefsteak which she appropriated doubtfully a raw turnip and a head of lettuce which she hailed with glee and some beets potatoes onions and grapefruit from all of which she took a generous supply Thus laden she went back to the kitchen Spread upon the table they made a brave show Oh well I ll have quite a dinner after all she triumphed cocking her head happily And now for the dessert she finished pouncing on the cookbook It was while she was turning the leaves to find the pies and puddings that she ran across the vegetables and found the word beets staring her in the face Mechanically she read the line below Winter beets will require three hours to cook Use hot water Billy s startled eyes sought the clock Three hours and it was five now Frenziedly then she ran her finger down the page Onions one and one half hours Use hot water Turnips require a long time but if cut thin they will cook in an hour and a quarter An hour and a quarter indeed she moaned Isn t there anything anywhere that doesn t take forever to cook Early peas green corn summer squash mumbled Billy s dry lips But what do folks eat in January January It was the apparently inoffensive sentence New potatoes will boil in thirty minutes that brought fresh terror to Billy s soul and set her to fluttering the cookbook leaves with renewed haste If it took new potatoes thirty minutes to cook how long did it take old ones In vain she searched for the answer There were plenty of potatoes They were mashed whipped scalloped creamed fried and broiled they were made into puffs croquettes potato border and potato snow For many of these they were boiled first until tender one rule said But that doesn t tell me how long it takes to get em tender fumed Billy despairingly I suppose they think anybody ought to know that but I don t Suddenly her eyes fell once more on the instructions for boiling turnips and her face cleared If it helps to cut turnips thin why not potatoes she cried I can do that anyhow and I will she finished with a sigh of relief as she caught up half a dozen potatoes and hurried into the pantry for a knife A few minutes later the potatoes peeled and cut almost to wafer thinness were dumped into a basin of cold water There now I guess you ll cook nodded Billy to the dish in her hand as she hurried to the stove Chilled by an ominous unresponsiveness Billy lifted the stove lid and peered inside Only a mass of black and graying coals greeted her The fire was out To think that even you had to go back on me like this upbraided Billy eyeing the dismal mass with reproachful gaze This disaster however as Billy knew was not so great as it seemed for there was still the gas stove In the old days under Dong Ling s rule there had been no gas stove Dong Ling disapproved of devil stoves that had no coalee no woodee but burned like hellee Eliza however did approve of them and not long after her arrival a fine one had been put in for her use So now Billy soon had her potatoes with a brisk blaze under them In frantic earnest then Billy went to work Brushing the discarded onions turnip and beets into a pail under the table she was still confronted with the beefsteak lettuce and grapefruit All but the beefsteak she pushed to one side with gentle pats You re all right she nodded to them I can use you You don t have to be cooked bless your hearts But you Billy scowled at the beefsteak and ran her finger down the index of the Bride s Helper Billy knew how to handle that book now No you don t not for me she muttered after a minute shaking her finger at the tenderloin on the table I haven t got any hot coals and I thought a gridiron was where they played football though it seems it s some sort of a dish to cook you in here but I shouldn t know it from a teaspoon probably if I should see it No sir It s back to the refrigerator for you and a nice cold sensible roast leg of lamb for me that doesn t have to be cooked Understand Cooked she finished as she carried the beefsteak away and took possession of the hitherto despised cold lamb Once more Billy made a mad search through cupboards and shelves This time she bore back in triumph a can of corn another of tomatoes and a glass jar of preserved peaches In the kitchen a cheery bubbling from the potatoes on the stove greeted her Billy s spirits rose with the steam There Spunkie she said gayly to the cat who had just uncurled from a nap behind the stove Tell me I can t get up a dinner And maybe we ll have the peach fritters too she chirped I ve got the peach part anyway But Billy did not have the peach fritters after all She got out the sugar and the flour to be sure and she made a great ado looking up the rule but a hurried glance at the clock sent her into the dining room to set the table and all thought of the peach fritters was given up CHAPTER X THE DINNER BILLY GOT At five minutes of six Bertram and Calderwell came Bertram gave his peculiar ring and let himself in with his latchkey but Billy did not meet him in the hall nor in the drawing room Excusing himself Bertram hurried up stairs Billy was not in her room nor anywhere on that floor She was not in William s room Coming down stairs to the hall again Bertram confronted William who had just come in Where s Billy demanded the young husband with just a touch of irritation as if he suspected William of having Billy in his pocket William stared slightly Why I don t know Isn t she here I ll ask Pete frowned Bertram In the dining room Bertram found no one though the table was prettily set and showed half a grapefruit at each place In the kitchen in the kitchen Bertram found a din of rattling tin an odor of burned food a confusion of scattered pots and pans a frightened cat who peered at him from under a littered stove and a flushed disheveled young woman in a blue dust cap and ruffled apron whom he finally recognized as his wife Why Billy he gasped Billy who was struggling with something at the sink turned sharply Bertram Henshaw she panted I used to think you were wonderful because you could paint a picture I even used to think I was a little wonderful because I could write a song Well I don t any more But I ll tell you who is wonderful It s Eliza and Rosa and all the rest of those women who can get a meal on to the table all at once so it s fit to eat Why Billy gasped Bertram again falling back to the door he had closed behind him What in the world does this mean Mean It means I m getting dinner choked Billy Can t you see But Pete Eliza They re sick I mean he s sick and I said I d do it I d be an oak But how did I know there wasn t anything in the house except stuff that took hours to cook only potatoes And how did I know that they cooked in no time and then got all smushy and wet staying in the water And how did I know that everything else would stick on and burn on till you d used every dish there was in the house to cook em in Why Billy gasped Bertram for the third time And then because he had been married only six months instead of six years he made the mistake of trying to argue with a woman whose nerves were already at the snapping point But dear it was so foolish of you to do all this Why didn t you telephone Why didn t you get somebody Like an irate little tigress Billy turned at bay Bertram Henshaw she flamed angrily if you don t go up stairs and tend to that man up there I shall scream Now go I ll be up when I can And Bertram went It was not so very long after all before Billy came in to greet her guest She was not stately and imposing in royally sumptuous blue velvet and ermine nor yet was she cozy and homy in bronze gold crepe de Chine and swan s down She was just herself in a pretty little morning house gown of blue gingham She was minus the dust cap and the ruffled apron but she had a dab of flour on the left cheek and a smutch of crock on her forehead She had too a cut finger on her right hand and a burned thumb on her left But she was Billy and being Billy she advanced with a bright smile and held out a cordial hand not even wincing when the cut finger came under Calderwell s hearty clasp I m glad to see you she welcomed him You ll excuse my not appearing sooner I m sure for didn t Bertram tell you I m playing Bridget to night But dinner is ready now and we ll go down please she smiled as she laid a light hand on her guest s arm Behind her Bertram remembering the scene in the kitchen stared in sheer amazement Bertram it might be mentioned again had been married six months not six years What Billy had intended to serve for a simple dinner that night was grapefruit with cherries oyster stew boiled halibut with egg sauce chicken pie squash onions and potatoes peach fritters a lettuce and stuff salad and some new pie or pudding What she did serve was grapefruit without the cherries cold roast lamb potatoes a mush of sogginess tomatoes canned and slightly burned corn canned and very much burned lettuce plain and for dessert preserved peaches and cake the latter rather dry and stale Such was Billy s dinner The grapefruit everybody ate The cold lamb too met with a hearty reception especially after the potatoes corn and tomatoes were served and tasted Outwardly through it all Billy was gayety itself Inwardly she was burning up with anger and mortification And because she was all this there was apparently no limit to her laughter and sparkling repartee as she talked with Calderwell her guest the guest who according to her original plans was to be shown how happy she and Bertram were what a good wife she made and how devoted and satisfied Bertram was in his home William picking at his dinner as only a hungry man can pick at a dinner that is uneatable watched Billy with a puzzled uneasy frown Bertram choking over the few mouthfuls he ate marked his wife s animated face and Calderwell s absorbed attention and settled into gloomy silence But it could not continue forever The preserved peaches were eaten at last and the stale cake left Billy had forgotten the coffee which was just as well perhaps Then the four trailed up stairs to the drawing room At nine o clock an anxious Eliza and a remorseful apologetic Pete came home and descended to the horror the once orderly kitchen and dining room had become At ten Calderwell with very evident reluctance tore himself away from Billy s gay badinage and said good night At two minutes past ten an exhausted nerve racked Billy was trying to cry on the shoulders of both Uncle William and Bertram at once There there child don t It went off all right patted Uncle William Billy darling pleaded Bertram please don t cry so As if I d ever let you step foot in that kitchen again At this Billy raised a tear wet face aflame with indignant determination As if I d ever let you keep me from it Bertram Henshaw after this she contested I m not going to do another thing in all my life but cook When I think of the stuff we had to eat after all the time I took to get it I m simply crazy Do you think I d run the risk of such a thing as this ever happening again CHAPTER XI CALDERWELL DOES SOME QUESTIONING On the day after his dinner with mister and missus Bertram Henshaw Hugh Calderwell left Boston and did not return until more than a month had passed One of his first acts when he did come was to look up mister M J Arkwright at the address which Billy had given him Calderwell had not seen Arkwright since they parted in Paris some two years before after a six months tramp through Europe together Calderwell liked Arkwright then greatly and he lost no time now in renewing the acquaintance The address as given by Billy proved to be an attractive but modest apartment hotel near the Conservatory of Music and Calderwell was delighted to find Arkwright at home in his comfortable little bachelor suite Arkwright greeted him most cordially Well well he cried if it isn t Calderwell And how s Mont Blanc Or is it the Killarney Lakes this time or maybe the Sphinx that I should inquire for eh Guess again laughed Calderwell throwing off his heavy coat and settling himself comfortably in the inviting looking morris chair his friend pulled forward Sha n t do it retorted Arkwright with a smile I never gamble on palpable uncertainties except for a chance throw or two as I gave a minute ago Your movements are altogether too erratic and too far reaching for ordinary mortals to keep track of Well maybe you re right grinned Calderwell appreciatively Anyhow you would have lost this time sure thing for I ve been working Seen the doctor yet queried Arkwright coolly pushing the cigars across the table Thanks for both sniffed Calderwell with a reproachful glance helping himself Your good judgment in some matters is still unimpaired I see he observed tapping the little gilded band which had told him the cigar was an old favorite As to other matters however you re wrong again my friend in your surmise I am not sick and I have been working So Well I m told they have very good specialists here Some one of them ought to hit your case Still how long has it been running Arkwright s face showed only grave concern Oh come let up Arkwright snapped Calderwell striking his match alight with a vigorous jerk I ll admit I haven t ever given any special indication of an absorbing passion for work But what can you expect of a fellow born with a whole dozen silver spoons in his mouth And that s what I was according to Bertram Henshaw According to him again it s a wonder I ever tried to feed myself and perhaps he s right with my mouth already so full I should say so laughed Arkwright Well be that as it may I m going to feed myself and I m going to earn my feed too I haven t climbed a mountain or paddled a canoe for a year I ve been in Chicago cultivating the acquaintance of John Doe and Richard Roe You mean law Sure I studied it here for a while before that bout of ours a couple of years ago Billy drove me away then Billy er missus Henshaw Yes I thought I told you She turned down my tenth dozen proposal so emphatically that I lost all interest in Boston and took to the tall timber again But I ve come back A friend of my father s wrote me to come on and consider a good opening there was in his law office I came on a month ago and considered Then I went back to pack up Now I ve come for good and here I am You have my history to date Now tell me of yourself You re looking as fit as a penny from the mint even though you have discarded that lovely brown beard Was that a concession to er Mary Jane Arkwright lifted a quick hand of protest Michael Jeremiah please There is no Mary Jane now he said a bit stiffly The other stared a little Then he gave a low chuckle Michael Jeremiah he repeated musingly eyeing the glowing tip of his cigar And to think how that mysterious M J used to tantalize me Do you mean he added turning slowly that no one calls you Mary Jane now Not if they know what is best for them Oh Calderwell noted the smouldering fire in the other s eyes a little curiously Very well I ll take the hint Michael Jeremiah Thanks Arkwright relaxed a little To tell the truth I ve had quite enough now of Mary Jane Very good So be it nodded the other still regarding his friend thoughtfully But tell me what of yourself Arkwright shrugged his shoulders There s nothing to tell You ve seen I m here Humph Very pretty scoffed Calderwell Then if you won t tell I will I saw Billy a month ago you see It seems you ve hit the trail for Grand Opera as you threatened to that night in Paris but you haven t brought up in vaudeville as you prophesied you would do though for that matter judging from the plums some of the stars are picking on the vaudeville stage nowadays that isn t to be sneezed at But Billy says you ve made two or three appearances already on the sacred boards themselves one of them a subscription performance and that you created no end of a sensation Nonsense I m merely a student at the Opera School here scowled Arkwright Oh yes Billy said you were that but she also said you wouldn t be long That you d already had one good offer I m not speaking of marriage and that you were going abroad next summer and that they were all insufferably proud of you Nonsense scowled Arkwright again coloring like a girl That is only some of of missus Henshaw s kind flattery Calderwell jerked the cigar from between his lips and sat suddenly forward in his chair Arkwright tell me about them How are they making it go Arkwright frowned Who Make what go he asked The Henshaws Is she happy Is he on the square Arkwright s face darkened Well really he began but Calderwell interrupted Oh come don t be squeamish You think I m butting into what doesn t concern me but I m not What concerns Billy does concern me And if he doesn t make her happy I ll I ll kill him In spite of himself Arkwright laughed The vehemence of the other s words and the fierceness with which he puffed at his cigar as he fell back in his chair were most expressive Well I don t think you need to load revolvers nor sharpen daggers just yet he observed grimly Calderwell laughed this time though without much mirth Oh I m not in love with Billy now he explained Please don t think I am I shouldn t see her if I was of course Arkwright changed his position suddenly bringing his face into the shadow Calderwell talked on without pausing No I m not in love with Billy But Billy s a trump You know that I do The words were low but steadily spoken Of course you do We all do And we want her happy But as for her marrying Bertram you could have bowled me over with a soap bubble when I heard she d done it Now understand Bertram is a good fellow and I like him I ve known him all his life and he s all right Oh six or eight years ago to be sure he got in with a set of fellows Bob Seaver and his clique that were no good Went in for Bohemianism and all that rot It wasn t good for Bertram He s got the confounded temperament that goes with his talent I suppose though why a man can t paint a picture or sing a song and keep his temper and a level head I don t see He can cut in Arkwright with curt emphasis Humph Well that s what I think But about this marriage business Bertram admires a pretty face wherever he sees it to paint and always has Not but that he s straight as a string with women I don t mean that but girls are always just so many pictures to be picked up on his brushes and transferred to his canvases And as for his settling down and marrying anybody for keeps right along Great Scott imagine Bertram Henshaw as a domestic man Arkwright stirred restlessly as he spoke up in quick defense Oh but he is I assure you I I ve seen them in their home together many times I think they are very happy Arkwright spoke with decision though still a little diffidently Calderwell was silent He had picked up the little gilt band he had torn from his cigar and was fingering it musingly Yes I ve seen them once he said after a minute I took dinner with them when I was on a month ago I heard you did At something in Arkwright s voice Calderwell turned quickly What do you mean Why do you say it like that Arkwright laughed The constraint fled from his manner Well I may as well tell you You ll hear of it It s no secret missus Henshaw herself tells of it everywhere It was her friend Alice Greggory who told me of it first however It seems the cook was gone and the mistress had to get the dinner herself Yes I know that But you should hear missus Henshaw tell the story now or Bertram It seems she knew nothing whatever about cooking and her trials and tribulations in getting that dinner on to the table were only one degree worse than the dinner itself according to her story Didn t you er notice anything Notice anything exploded Calderwell I noticed that Billy was so brilliant she fairly radiated sparks and I noticed that Bertram was so glum he he almost radiated thunderclaps Then I saw that Billy s high spirits were all assumed to cover a threatened burst of tears and I laid it all to him I thought he d said something to hurt her and I could have punched him Great Scott Was that what ailed them I reckon it was Alice says that since then missus Henshaw has fairly haunted the kitchen begging Eliza to teach her everything every single thing she knows Calderwell chuckled If that isn t just like Billy She never does anything by halves By George but she was game over that dinner I can see it all now Alice says she s really learning to cook in spite of old Pete s horror and Eliza s pleadings not to spoil her pretty hands Then Pete is back all right What a faithful old soul he is Arkwright frowned slightly Yes he s faithful but he isn t all right by any means I think he s a sick man myself What makes Billy let him work then Let him sniffed Arkwright I d like to see you try to stop him missus Henshaw begs and pleads with him to stop but he scouts the idea Pete is thoroughly and unalterably convinced that the family would starve to death if it weren t for him and missus Henshaw says that she ll admit he has some grounds for his opinion when one remembers the condition of the kitchen and dining room the night she presided over them

none	none	chuckled Calderwell I d have gone down into the kitchen myself if I d suspected what was going on Arkwright raised his eyebrows Perhaps it s well you didn t if Bertram s picture of what he found there when he went down is a true one missus Henshaw acknowledges that even the cat sought refuge under the stove As if the veriest worm that crawls ever needed to seek refuge from Billy scoffed Calderwell By the way what s this Annex I hear of Bertram mentioned it but I couldn t get either of them to tell what it was Billy wouldn t and Bertram said he couldn t not with Billy shaking her head at him like that So I had my suspicions One of Billy s pet charities She doesn t call it that Arkwright s face and voice softened It is Hillside She still keeps it open She calls it the Annex to her home She s filled it with a crippled woman a poor little music teacher a lame boy and Aunt Hannah But how extraordinary She doesn t think so She says it s just an overflow house for the extra happiness she can t use There was a moment s silence Calderwell laid down his cigar pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose furiously Then he got to his feet and walked to the fireplace After a minute he turned Well if she isn t the beat em he spluttered And I had the gall to ask you if Henshaw made her happy Overflow house indeed The best of it is the way she does it smiled Arkwright They re all the sort of people ordinary charity could never reach and the only way she got them there at all was to make each one think that he or she was absolutely necessary to the rest of them Even as it is they all pay a little something toward the running expenses of the house They insisted on that and missus Henshaw had to let them I believe her chief difficulty now is that she has not less than six people whom she wishes to put into the two extra rooms still unoccupied and she can t make up her mind which to take Her husband says he expects to hear any day of an Annexette to the Annex Humph grunted Calderwell as he turned and began to walk up and down the room Bertram is still painting I suppose Oh yes What s he doing now Several things He s up to his eyes in work As you probably have heard he met with a severe accident last summer and lost the use of his right arm for many months I believe they thought at one time he had lost it forever But it s all right now and he has several commissions for portraits Alice says he s doing ideal heads again too Same old Face of a Girl I suppose so though Alice didn t say Of course his special work just now is painting the portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop You may have heard that he tried it last year and and didn t make quite a success of it Yes My sister Belle told me She hears from Billy once in a while Will it be a go this time We ll hope so for everybody s sake I imagine no one has seen it yet it s not finished but Alice says Calderwell turned abruptly a quizzical smile on his face See here my son he interposed it strikes me that this Alice is saying a good deal to you Who is she Arkwright gave a light laugh Why I told you She is Miss Alice Greggory missus Henshaw s friend and mine I have known her for years Hm m what is she like Like Why she s like like herself of course You ll have to know Alice She s the salt of the earth Alice is smiled Arkwright rising to his feet with a remonstrative gesture as he saw Calderwell pick up his coat What s your hurry Hm m commented Calderwell again ignoring the question And when may I ask do you intend to appropriate this er salt to er ah season your own life with as I might say eh Arkwright laughed There was not the slightest trace of embarrassment in his face Never You re on the wrong track this time Alice and I are good friends always have been and always will be I hope Nothing more Nothing more I see her frequently She is musical and the Henshaws are good enough to ask us there often together You will meet her doubtless now yourself She is frequently at the Henshaw home Hm m Calderwell still eyed his host shrewdly Then you ll give me a clear field eh Certainly Arkwright s eyes met his friend s gaze without swerving All right However I suppose you ll tell me as I did you once that a right of way in such a case doesn t mean a thoroughfare for the party interested If my memory serves me I gave you right of way in Paris to win the affections of a certain elusive Miss Billy here in Boston if you could But I see you didn t seem to improve your opportunities he finished teasingly Arkwright stooped of a sudden to pick up a bit of paper from the floor No he said quietly I didn t seem to improve my opportunities This time he did not meet Calderwell s eyes The good byes had been said when Calderwell turned abruptly at the door Oh I say I suppose you re going to that devil s carnival at Jordan Hall to morrow night Devil s carnival You don t mean Cyril Henshaw s piano recital Sure I do grinned Calderwell unabashed And I ll warrant it ll be a devil s carnival too Isn t mister Cyril Henshaw going to play his own music Oh I know I m hopeless from your standpoint but I can t help it I like mine with some go in it and a tune that you can find without hunting for it And I don t like lost spirits gone mad that wail and shriek through ten perfectly good minutes and then die with a gasping moan whose home is the tombs However you re going I take it Of course I am laughed the other You couldn t hire Alice to miss one shriek of those spirits Besides I rather like them myself you know Yes I suppose you do You re brought up on it in your business But me for the Merry Widow and even the hoary Jingle Bells every time However I m going to be there out of respect to the poor fellow s family And by the way that s another thing that bowled me over Cyril s marriage Why Cyril hates women Not all women we ll hope smiled Arkwright Do you know his wife Not much I used to see her a little at Billy s Music teacher wasn t she Then she s the same sort I suppose But she isn t laughed Arkwright Oh she taught music but that was only because of necessity I take it She s domestic through and through with an overwhelming passion for making puddings and darning socks I hear Alice says she believes missus Cyril knows every dish and spoon by its Christian name and that there s never so much as a spool of thread out of order in the house But how does Cyril stand it the trials and tribulations of domestic life Bertram used to declare that the whole Strata was aquiver with fear when Cyril was composing and I remember him as a perfect bear if anybody so much as whispered when he was in one of his moods I never forgot the night Bertram and I were up in William s room trying to sing When Johnnie comes marching home to the accompaniment of a banjo in Bertram s hands and a guitar in mine Gorry it was Hugh that went marching home that night Oh well from reports I reckon missus Cyril doesn t play either a banjo or a guitar smiled Arkwright Alice says she wears rubber heels on her shoes and has put hushers on all the chair legs and felt mats between all the plates and saucers Anyhow Cyril is building a new house and he looks as if he were in a pretty healthy condition as you ll see to morrow night Humph I wish he d make his music healthy then grumbled Calderwell as he opened the door CHAPTER XII FOR BILLY SOME ADVICE February brought busy days The public opening of the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition was to take place the sixth of March with a private view for invited guests the night before and it was at this exhibition that Bertram planned to show his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop He also if possible wished to enter two or three other canvases upon which he was spending all the time he could get Bertram felt that he was doing very good work now The portrait of Marguerite Winthrop was coming on finely The spoiled idol of society had at last found a pose and a costume that suited her and she was graciously pleased to give the artist almost as many sittings as he wanted The elusive something in her face which had previously been so baffling was now already caught and held bewitchingly on his canvas He was confident that the portrait would be a success He was also much interested in another piece of work which he intended to show called The Rose The model for this was a beautiful young girl he had found selling flowers with her father in a street booth at the North End On the whole Bertram was very happy these days He could not to be sure spend quite so much time with Billy as he wished but she understood of course as did he that his work must come first He knew that she tried to show him that she understood it At the same time he could not help thinking occasionally that Billy did sometimes mind his necessary absorption in his painting To himself Bertram owned that Billy was in some ways a puzzle to him Her conduct was still erratic at times One day he would seem to be everything to her the next almost nothing judging by the ease with which she relinquished his society and substituted that of some one else Arkwright or Calderwell for instance And that was another thing Bertram was ashamed to hint even to himself that he was jealous of either of those men Surely after what had happened after Billy s emphatic assertion that she had never loved any one but himself it would seem not only absurd but disloyal that he should doubt for an instant Billy s entire devotion to him and yet there were times when he wished he could come home and not always find Alice Greggory Calderwell Arkwright or all three of them strumming the piano in the drawing room At such times always though if he did feel impatient he immediately demanded of himself Are you then the kind of husband that begrudges your wife young companions of her own age and tastes to help her while away the hours that you cannot possibly spend with her yourself This question and the answer that his better self always gave to it were usually sufficient to send him into some florists for a bunch of violets for Billy or into a candy shop on a like atoning errand As to Billy Billy too was busy these days chief of her concerns being perhaps attention to that honeymoon of hers to see that it did not wane At least the most of her thoughts and many of her actions centered about that object Billy had the book now the Talk to Young Wives For a time she had worked with only the newspaper criticism to guide her but coming at last to the conclusion that if a little was good more must be better she had shyly gone into a bookstore one day and with a pink blush had asked for the book Since bringing it home she had studied assiduously though never if Bertram was near keeping it well hidden when not in use in a remote corner of her desk There was a good deal in the book that Billy did not like and there were some statements that worried her but yet there was much that she tried earnestly to follow She was still striving to be the oak and she was still eagerly endeavoring to brush up against those necessary outside interests She was so thankful in this connection for Alice Greggory and for Arkwright and Hugh Calderwell It was such a help that she had them They were not only very pleasant and entertaining outside interests but one or another of them was almost always conveniently within reach Then too it pleased her to think that she was furthering the pretty love story between Alice and mister Arkwright And she was furthering it She was sure of that Already she could see how dependent the man was on Alice how he looked to her for approbation and appealed to her on all occasions exactly as if there was not a move that he wanted to make without her presence near him Billy was very sure now of Arkwright She only wished she were as much so of Alice But Alice troubled her Not but that Alice was kindness itself to the man either It was only a peculiar something almost like fear or constraint that Billy thought she saw in Alice s eyes sometimes when Arkwright made a particularly intimate appeal There was Calderwell too He also worried Billy She feared he was going to complicate matters still more by falling in love with Alice himself and this certainly Billy did not want at all As this phase of the matter presented itself indeed Billy determined to appropriate Calderwell a little more exclusively to herself when the four were together thus leaving Alice for Arkwright After all it was rather entertaining this playing at Cupid s assistant If she could not have Bertram all the time it was fortunate that these outside interests were so pleasurable Most of the mornings Billy spent in the kitchen despite the remonstrances of both Pete and Eliza Almost every meal now was graced with a palatable cake pudding or muffin that Billy would proudly claim as her handiwork Pete still served at table and made strenuous efforts to keep up all his old duties but he was obviously growing weaker and really serious blunders were beginning to be noticeable Bertram even hinted once or twice that perhaps it would be just as well to insist on his going but to this Billy would not give her consent Even when one night his poor old trembling hands spilled half the contents of a soup plate over a new and costly evening gown of Billy s own she still refused to have him dismissed Why Bertram I wouldn t do it she declared hotly and you wouldn t either He s been here more than fifty years It would break his heart He s really too ill to work and I wish he would go of his own accord of course but I sha n t ever tell him to go not if he spills soup on every dress I ve got I ll buy more and more if it s necessary Bless his dear old heart He thinks he s really serving us and he is too Oh yes you re right he is sighed Bertram with meaning emphasis as he abandoned the argument In addition to her Talk to Young Wives Billy found herself encountering advice and comment on the marriage question from still other quarters from her acquaintances mostly the feminine ones right and left Continually she was hearing such words as these Oh well what can you expect Billy You re an old married woman now Never mind you ll find he s like all the rest of the husbands You just wait and see Better begin with a high hand Billy Don t let him fool you Mercy If I had a husband whose business it was to look at women s beautiful eyes peachy cheeks and luxurious tresses I should go crazy It s hard enough to keep a man s eyes on yourself when his daily interests are supposed to be just lumps of coal and chunks of ice without flinging him into the very jaws of temptation like asking him to paint a pretty girl s picture In response to all this of course Billy could but laugh and blush and toss back some gay reply with a careless unconcern But in her heart she did not like it Sometimes she told herself that if there were not any advice or comment from anybody either book or woman if there were not anybody but just Bertram and herself life would be just one long honeymoon forever and forever Once or twice Billy was tempted to go to Marie with this honeymoon question but Marie was very busy these days and very preoccupied The new house that Cyril was building on Corey Hill not far from the Annex was almost finished and Marie was immersed in the subject of house furnishings and interior decoration She was too still more deeply engrossed in the fashioning of tiny garments of the softest linen lace and woolen and there was on her face such a look of beatific wonder and joy that Billy did not like to so much as hint that there was in the world such a book as When the Honeymoon Wanes A Talk to Young Wives Billy tried valiantly these days not to mind that Bertram s work was so absorbing She tried not to mind that his business dealt not with lumps of coal and chunks of ice but with beautiful women like Marguerite Winthrop who asked him to luncheon and lovely girls like his model for The Rose who came freely to his studio and spent hours in the beloved presence being studied for what Bertram declared was absolutely the most wonderful poise of head and shoulders that he had ever seen Billy tried also these days to so conduct herself that not by any chance could Calderwell suspect that sometimes she was jealous of Bertram s art Not for worlds would she have had Calderwell begin to get the notion into his head that his old time prophecy concerning Bertram s caring only for the turn of a girl s head or the tilt of her chin to paint was being fulfilled Hence particularly gay and cheerful was Billy when Calderwell was near Nor could it be said that Billy was really unhappy at any time It was only that on occasion the very depth of her happiness in Bertram s love frightened her lest it bring disaster to herself or Bertram Billy still went frequently to the Annex There were yet two unfilled rooms in the house Billy was hesitating which two of six new friends of hers to choose as occupants and it was one day early in March after she had been talking the matter over with Aunt Hannah that Aunt Hannah said Dear me Billy if you had your way I believe you d open another whole house Do you know that s just what I m thinking of retorted Billy gravely Then she laughed at Aunt Hannah s shocked gesture of protest Oh well I don t expect to she added I haven t lived very long but I ve lived long enough to know that you can t always do what you want to Just as if there were anything you wanted to do that you don t do my dear reproved Aunt Hannah mildly Yes I know Billy drew in her breath with a little catch I have so much that is lovely and that s why I need this house you know for the overflow she nodded brightly Then with a characteristic change of subject she added My but you should have tasted of the popovers I made for breakfast this morning I should like to smiled Aunt Hannah William says you re getting to be quite a cook Well maybe conceded Billy doubtfully Oh I can do some things all right but just wait till Pete and Eliza go away again and Bertram brings home a friend to dinner That ll tell the tale I think now I could have something besides potato mush and burned corn but maybe I wouldn t when the time came If only I could buy everything I needed to cook with I d be all right But I can t I find Can t buy what you need What do you mean Billy laughed ruefully Well every other question I ask Eliza she says Why I don t know you have to use your judgment Just as if I had any judgment about how much salt to use or what dish to take Dear me Aunt Hannah the man that will grow judgment and can it as you would a mess of peas has got his fortune made What an absurd child you are Billy laughed Aunt Hannah I used to tell Marie By the way how is Marie Have you seen her lately Oh yes I saw her yesterday twinkled Billy She had a book of wall paper samples spread over the back of a chair two bunches of samples of different colored damasks on the table before her a Young Mother s Guide propped open in another chair and a pair of baby s socks in her lap with a roll each of pink and white and blue ribbon She spent most of the time after I had helped her choose the ribbon in asking me if I thought she ought to let the baby cry and bother Cyril or stop its crying and hurt the baby because her Mother s Guide says a certain amount of crying is needed to develop a baby s lungs Aunt Hannah laughed but she frowned too The idea I guess Cyril can stand proper crying and laughing too from his own child she said then crisply Oh but Marie is afraid he can t smiled Billy And that s the trouble She says that s the only thing that worries her Cyril Nonsense ejaculated Aunt Hannah Oh but it isn t nonsense to Marie retorted Billy You should see the preparations she s made and the precautions she s taken Actually when I saw those baby s socks in her lap I didn t know but she was going to put rubber heels on them They ve built the new house with deadening felt in all the walls and Marie s planned the nursery and Cyril s den at opposite ends of the house and she says she shall keep the baby there all the time the nursery I mean not the den She says she s going to teach it to be a quiet baby and hate noise She says she thinks she can do it too Humph sniffed Aunt Hannah scornfully You should have seen Marie s disgust the other day went on Billy a bit mischievously Her Cousin Jane sent on a rattle she d made herself all soft worsted with bells inside It was a dear but Marie was horror stricken My baby have a rattle she cried Why what would Cyril say As if he could stand a rattle in the house And if she didn t give that rattle to the janitor s wife that very day while I was there Humph sniffed Aunt Hannah again as Billy rose to go Well I m thinking Marie has still some things to learn in this world and Cyril too for that matter I wouldn t wonder laughed Billy giving Aunt Hannah a good by kiss CHAPTER XIII PETE Bertram Henshaw had no disquieting forebodings this time concerning his portrait of Marguerite Winthrop when the doors of the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition were thrown open to members and invited guests Just how great a popular success it was destined to be he could not know of course though he might have suspected it when he began to receive the admiring and hearty congratulations of his friends and fellow artists on that first evening Nor was the Winthrop portrait the only jewel in his crown on that occasion His marvelously exquisite The Rose and his smaller ideal picture Expectation came in for scarcely less commendation There was no doubt now The originator of the famous Face of a Girl had come into his own again On all sides this was the verdict one long haired critic of international fame even claiming openly that Henshaw had not only equaled his former best work but had gone beyond it in both artistry and technique It was a brilliant gathering Society as usual in costly evening gowns and correct swallow tails rubbed elbows with names famous in the world of Art and Letters Everywhere were gay laughter and sparkling repartee Even the austere faced J G Winthrop unbent to the extent of grim smiles in response to the laudatory comments bestowed upon the pictured image of his idol his beautiful daughter As to the great financier s own opinion of the work no one heard him express it except perhaps the artist and all that he got was a grip of the hand and a Good I knew you d fetch it this time my boy But that was enough And indeed no one who knew the stern old man needed to more than look into his face that evening to know of his entire satisfaction in this portrait soon to be the most recent and the most cherished addition to his far famed art collection As to Bertram Bertram was pleased and happy and gratified of course as was natural but he was not one whit more so than was Bertram s wife Billy fairly radiated happiness and proud joy She told Bertram indeed that if he did anything to make her any prouder it would take an Annex the size of the Boston Opera House to hold her extra happiness Sh h Billy Some one will hear you protested Bertram tragically but in spite of his horrified voice he did not look displeased For the first time Billy met Marguerite Winthrop that evening At the outset there was just a bit of shyness and constraint in the young wife s manner Billy could not forget her old insane jealousy of this beautiful girl with the envied name of Marguerite But it was for only a moment and soon she was her natural charming self Miss Winthrop was fascinated and she made no pretense of hiding it She even turned to Bertram at last and cried Surely now mister Henshaw you need never go far for a model Why don t you paint your wife Billy colored Bertram smiled I have he said I have painted her many times In fact I have painted her so often that she once declared it was only the tilt of her chin and the turn of her head that I loved to paint he said merrily enjoying Billy s pretty confusion and not realizing that his words really distressed her I have a whole studio full of Billys at home Oh have you really questioned Miss Winthrop eagerly Then mayn t I see them Mayn t I please missus Henshaw I d so love to Why of course you may murmured both the artist and his wife Thank you Then I m coming right away May I I m going to Washington next week you see Will you let me come to morrow at at half past three then Will it be quite convenient for you missus Henshaw Quite convenient I shall be glad to see you smiled Billy And Bertram echoed his wife s cordial permission Thank you Then I ll be there at half past three nodded Miss Winthrop with a smile as she turned to give place to an admiring group who were waiting to pay their respects to the artist and his wife There was after all that evening one fly in Billy s ointment It fluttered in at the behest of an old acquaintance one of the advice women as Billy termed some of her too interested friends Well they re lovely perfectly lovely of course missus Henshaw said this lady coming up to say good night But all the same I m glad my husband is just a plain lawyer Look out my dear that while mister Henshaw is stealing all those pretty faces for his canvases just look out that the fair ladies don t turn around and steal his heart before you know it Dear me but you must be so proud of him I am smiled Billy serenely and only the jagged split that rent the glove on her hand at that moment told of the fierce anger behind that smile As if I couldn t trust Bertram raged Billy passionately to herself stealing a surreptitious glance at her ruined glove And as if there weren t ever any perfectly happy marriages even if you don t ever hear of them or read of them Bertram was not home to luncheon on the day following the opening night of the Bohemian Ten Club A matter of business called him away from the house early in the morning but he told his wife that he surely would be on hand for Miss Winthrop s call at half past three o clock that afternoon Yes do Billy had urged I think she s lovely but you know her so much better than I do that I want you here Besides you needn t think I m going to show her all those Billys of yours I may be vain but I m not quite vain enough for that sir Don t worry her husband had laughed I ll be here As it chanced however something occurred an hour before half past three o clock that drove every thought of Miss Winthrop s call from Billy s head For three days now Pete had been at the home of his niece in South Boston He had been forced finally to give up and go away News from him the day before had been anything but reassuring and to day Bertram being gone Billy had suggested that Eliza serve a simple luncheon and go immediately afterward to South Boston to see how her uncle was This suggestion Eliza had followed leaving the house at one o clock Shortly after two Calderwell had dropped in to bring Bertram as he expressed it a bunch of bouquets he had gathered at the picture show the night before He was still in the drawing room chatting with Billy when the telephone bell rang If that s Bertram tell him to come home he s got company laughed Calderwell as Billy passed into the hall A moment later he heard Billy give a startled cry followed by a few broken words at short intervals Then before he could surmise what had happened she was back in the drawing room again her eyes full of tears It s Pete she choked Eliza says he can t live but a few minutes He wants to see me once more What shall I do John s got Peggy out with Aunt Hannah and missus Greggory It was so nice to day I made them go But I must get there some way Pete is calling for me Uncle William is going and I told Eliza where she might reach Bertram but what shall I do How shall I go Calderwell was on his feet at once I ll get a taxi Don t worry we ll get there Poor old soul of course he wants to see you Get on your things I ll have it here in no time he finished hurrying to the telephone Oh Hugh I m so glad I ve got you here sobbed Billy stumbling blindly toward the stairway I ll be ready in two minutes And she was but neither then nor a little later when she and Calderwell drove hurriedly away from the house did Billy once remember that Miss Marguerite Winthrop was coming to call that afternoon to see missus Bertram Henshaw and a roomful of Billy pictures Pete was still alive when Calderwell left Billy at the door of the modest little home where Eliza s mother lived Yes you re in time ma am sobbed Eliza and oh I m so glad you ve come He s been askin and askin for ye From Eliza Billy learned then that mister William was there but not mister Bertram They had not been able to reach mister Bertram or mister Cyril Billy never forgot the look of reverent adoration that came into Pete s eyes as she entered the room where he lay Miss Billy my Miss Billy You were so good to come he whispered faintly Billy choked back a sob Of course I d come Pete she said gently taking one of the thin worn hands into both her soft ones It was more than a few minutes that Pete lived Four o clock came and five and he was still with them Often he opened his eyes and smiled Sometimes he spoke a low word to William or Billy or to one of the weeping women at the foot of the bed That the presence of his beloved master and mistress meant much to him was plain to be seen I m so sorry he faltered once about that pretty dress I spoiled Miss Billy But you know my hands I know I know soothed Billy but don t worry It wasn t spoiled Pete It s all fixed now Oh I m so glad sighed the sick man After another long interval of silence he turned to William Them socks the medium thin ones you d oughter be puttin em on soon sir now They re in the right hand corner of the bottom drawer you know Yes Pete I ll attend to it William managed to stammer after he had cleared his throat Eliza s turn came next Remember about the coffee Pete said to her the way mister William likes it And always eggs you know for for His voice trailed into an indistinct murmur and his eyelids drooped wearily One by one the minutes passed The doctor came and went there was nothing he could do At half past five the thin old face became again alight with consciousness There was a good by message for Bertram and one for Cyril Aunt Hannah was remembered and even little Tommy Dunn Then gradually a gray shadow crept over the wasted features The words came more brokenly The mind plainly was wandering for old Pete was young again and around him were the lads he loved William Cyril and Bertram And then very quietly soon after the clock struck six Pete fell into the beginning of his long sleep CHAPTER XIV WHEN BERTRAM CAME HOME It was a little after half past three o clock that afternoon when Bertram Henshaw hurried up Beacon Street toward his home He had been delayed and he feared that Miss Winthrop would already have reached the house Mindful of what Billy had said that morning he knew how his wife would fret if he were not there when the guest arrived The sight of what he surmised to be Miss Winthrop s limousine before his door hastened his steps still more But as he reached the house he was surprised to find Miss Winthrop herself turning away from the door Why Miss Winthrop he cried you re not going now You can t have been here any yet Well no I I haven t retorted the lady with heightened color and a somewhat peculiar emphasis My ring wasn t answered Wasn t answered Bertram reddened angrily Why what can that mean Where s the maid Where s my wife missus Henshaw must be here She was expecting you Bertram in his annoyed amazement spoke loudly vehemently Hence he was quite plainly heard by the group of small boys and girls who had been improving the mild weather for a frolic on the sidewalk and who had been attracted to his door a moment before by the shining magnet of the Winthrop limousine with its resplendently liveried chauffeur As Bertram spoke one of the small girls Bessie Bailey stepped forward and piped up a shrill reply She ain t mister Henshaw She ain t here I saw her go away just a little while ago Bertram turned sharply You saw her go away What do you mean Small Bessie swelled with importance Bessie was thirteen in spite of her diminutive height Bessie s mother was dead and Bessie s caretakers were gossiping nurses and servants who frequently left in her way books that were much too old for Bessie to read but she read them I mean she ain t here your wife mister Henshaw She went away I saw her I guess likely she s eloped sir Eloped Bessie swelled still more importantly To her experienced eyes the situation contained all the necessary elements for the customary flight of the heroine in her story books as here now was the irate deserted husband Sure And twas just before you came quite a while before A big shiny black automobile like this drove up only it wasn t quite such a nice one an missus Henshaw an a man came out of your house an got in an drove right away quick They just ran to get into it too didn t they She appealed to her young mates grouped about her A chorus of shrill exclamations brought mister Bertram Henshaw suddenly to his senses By a desperate effort he hid his angry annoyance as he turned to the manifestly embarrassed young woman who was already descending the steps My dear Miss Winthrop he apologized contritely I m sure you ll forgive this seeming great rudeness on the part of my wife Notwithstanding the lurid tales of our young friends here I suspect nothing more serious has happened than that my wife has been hastily summoned to Aunt Hannah perhaps Or of course she may not have understood that you were coming to day at half past three though I thought she did But I m so sorry when you were so kind as to come Miss Winthrop interrupted with a quick gesture Say no more I beg of you she entreated missus Henshaw is quite excusable I m sure Please don t give it another thought she finished as with a hurried direction to the man who was holding open the door of her car she stepped inside and bowed her good byes Bertram with stern self control forced himself to walk nonchalantly up his steps leisurely take out his key and open his door under the interested eyes of Bessie Bailey and her friends but once beyond their hateful stare his demeanor underwent a complete change Throwing aside his hat and coat he strode to the telephone Oh is that you Aunt Hannah he called crisply a moment later Well if Billy s there will you tell her I want to speak to her please Billy answered Aunt Hannah s slow gentle tones Why my dear boy Billy isn t here She isn t Well when did she leave She s been there hasn t she Why I don t think so but I ll see if you like missus Greggory and I have just this minute come in from an automobile ride We would have stayed longer but it began to get chilly and I forgot to take one of the shawls that I d laid out Yes well if you will see please if Billy has been there and when she left said Bertram with grim self control All right I ll see murmured Aunt Hannah In a few moments her voice again sounded across the wires Why no Bertram Rosa says she hasn t been here since yesterday Isn t she there somewhere about the house Didn t you know where she was going Well no I didn t else I shouldn t have been asking you snapped the irate Bertram and hung up the receiver with most rude haste thereby cutting off an astounded Oh my grief and conscience in the middle of it The next ten minutes Bertram spent in going through the whole house from garret to basement Needless to say he found nothing to enlighten him or to soothe his temper Four o clock came then half past and five At five Bertram began to look for Eliza but in vain At half past five he watched for William but William too did not come Bertram was pacing the floor now nervously He was a little frightened but more mortified and angry That Billy should have allowed Miss Winthrop to call by appointment only to find no hostess no message no maid even to answer her ring it was inexcusable Impulsiveness unconventionality and girlish irresponsibility were all very delightful of course at times but not now certainly Billy was not a girl any longer She was a married woman Something was due to him her husband A pretty picture he must have made on those steps trying to apologize for a truant wife and to laugh off that absurd Bessie Bailey s preposterous assertion at the same time What would Miss Winthrop think What could she think Bertram fairly ground his teeth with chagrin at the situation in which he found himself Nor were matters helped any by the fact that Bertram was hungry Bertram s luncheon had been meager and unsatisfying That the kitchen down stairs still remained in silent spotless order instead of being astir with the sounds and smells of a good dinner as it should have been did not improve his temper Where Billy was he could not imagine He thought once or twice of calling up some of her friends but something held him back from that though he did try to get Marie knowing very well that she was probably over to the new house and would not answer He was not surprised therefore when he received no reply to his ring That there was the slightest truth in Bessie Bailey s absurd elopement idea Bertram did not of course for an instant believe The only thing that rankled about that was the fact that she had suggested such a thing and that Miss Winthrop and those silly children had heard her He recognized half of Bessie s friends as neighborhood youngsters and he knew very well that there would be many a quiet laugh at his expense around various Beacon Street dinner tables that night At the thought of those dinner tables he scowled again He had no dinner table at least he had no dinner on it Who the man might be Bertram thought he could easily guess It was either Arkwright or Calderwell of course and probably that tiresome Alice Greggory was mixed up in it somehow He did wish Billy Six o clock came then half past Bertram was indeed frightened now but he was more angry and still more hungry He had in fact reached that state of blind unreasonableness said to be peculiar to hungry males from time immemorial At ten minutes of seven a key clicked in the lock of the outer door and William and Billy entered the hall It was almost dark Bertram could not see their faces He had not lighted the hall at all Well he began sharply is this the way you receive your callers Billy I came home and found Miss Winthrop just leaving no one here to receive her Where ve you been Where s Eliza Where s my dinner Of course I don t mean to scold Billy but there is a limit to even my patience and it s reached now I can t help suggesting that if you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less that Where is Eliza anyway he finished irritably switching on the lights with a snap There was a moment of dead silence At Bertram s first words Billy and William had stopped short Neither had moved since Now William turned and began to speak but Billy interrupted She met her husband s gaze steadily I will be down at once to get your dinner she said quietly Eliza will not come to night Pete is dead Bertram started forward with a quick cry Dead Oh Billy Then you were there Billy But his wife did not apparently hear him She passed him without turning her head and went on up the stairs leaving him to meet the sorrowful accusing eyes of William

none	none	AFTER THE STORM 
5717_61421_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The young husband s apologies were profuse and abject 
none	none	Bertram was heartily ashamed of himself and was man enough to acknowledge it Almost on his knees he begged Billy to forgive him and in a frenzy of self denunciation he followed her down into the kitchen that night piteously beseeching her to speak to him to just look at him even so that he might know he was not utterly despised though he did indeed deserve to be more than despised he moaned 
5717_61421_000005_000000	train-clean-360	At first Billy did not speak or even vouchsafe a glance in his direction 
none	none	Very quietly she went about her preparations for a simple meal paying apparently no more attention to Bertram than as if he were not there 
5717_61421_000005_000002	train-clean-360	But that her ears were only seemingly and not really deaf was shown very clearly a little later when at a particularly abject wail on the part of the babbling shadow at her heels Billy choked into a little gasp half laughter half sob 
5717_61421_000005_000003	train-clean-360	It was all over then 
5717_61421_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Bertram had her in his arms in a twinkling while to the floor clattered and rolled a knife and a half peeled baked potato 
5717_61421_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Naturally after that there could be no more dignified silences on the part of the injured wife 
none	none	There were instead half smiles tears sobs a tremulous telling of Pete s going and his messages followed by a tearful listening to Bertram s story of the torture he had endured at the hands of Miss Winthrop Bessie Bailey and an empty dinnerless house And thus in one corner of the kitchen some time later a hungry desperate William found them the half peeled cold baked potato still at their feet 
5717_61421_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Torn between his craving for food and his desire not to interfere with any possible peace making William was obviously hesitating what to do when Billy glanced up and saw him 
5717_61421_000007_000001	train-clean-360	She saw too at the same time the empty blazing gas stove burner and the pile of half prepared potatoes to warm which the burner had long since been lighted 
5717_61421_000007_000002	train-clean-360	With a little cry she broke away from her husband s arms 
none	none	Mercy and here s poor Uncle William bless his heart with not a thing to eat yet 
5717_61421_000009_000000	train-clean-360	They all got dinner then together with many a sigh and quick coming tear as everywhere they met some sad reminder of the gentle old hands that would never again minister to their comfort 
5717_61421_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It was a silent meal and little after all was eaten though brave attempts at cheerfulness and naturalness were made by all three Bertram especially talked and tried to make sure that the shadow on Billy s face was at least not the one his own conduct had brought there 
5717_61421_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 For you do you surely do forgive me don t you he begged as he followed her into the kitchen after the sorry meal was over 
5717_61421_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Why yes dear yes sighed Billy trying to smile 
5717_61421_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 And you ll forget 
none	none	There was no answer Billy 
5717_61421_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And you ll forget Bertram s voice was insistent reproachful 
5717_61421_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Billy changed color and bit her lip 
5717_61421_000016_000001	train-clean-360	She looked plainly distressed 
5717_61421_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Billy cried the man still more reproachfully 
5717_61421_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But Bertram I can t forget quite yet faltered Billy 
5717_61421_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram frowned 
5139_61422_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram frowned 
none	none	For a minute he looked as if he were about to take up the matter seriously and argue it with her but the next moment he smiled and tossed his head with jaunty playfulness Bertram to tell the truth had now had quite enough of what he privately termed scenes and heroics and manlike he was very ardently longing for the old easy going friendliness with all unpleasantness banished to oblivion Oh but you ll have to forget he claimed with cheery insistence for you ve promised to forgive me and one can t forgive without forgetting 
5717_61421_000020_000001	train-clean-360	So there he finished with a smilingly determined now everything is just as it was before air 
5717_61421_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Billy made no response 
5717_61421_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She turned hurriedly and began to busy herself with the dishes at the sink 
5717_61421_000021_000002	train-clean-360	In her heart she was wondering could she ever forget what Bertram had said 
none	none	Would anything ever blot out those awful words If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less 
5717_61421_000021_000004	train-clean-360	It seemed now that always for evermore they would ring in her ears always for evermore they would burn deeper and deeper into her soul 
5717_61421_000021_000005	train-clean-360	And not once in all Bertram s apologies had he referred to them those words he had uttered 
5717_61421_000021_000006	train-clean-360	He had not said he did not mean them 
5717_61421_000021_000007	train-clean-360	He had not said he was sorry he spoke them 
5717_61421_000021_000008	train-clean-360	He had ignored them and he expected that now she too would ignore them 
none	none	As if she could If you would tend to your husband and your home a little more and go gallivanting off with Calderwell and Arkwright and Alice Greggory a little less Oh if only she could indeed forget When Billy went up stairs that night she ran across her Talk to Young Wives in her desk With a half stifled cry she thrust it far back out of sight I hate you I hate you with all your old talk about brushing up against outside interests she whispered fiercely Well I ve brushed and now see what I ve got for it 
5717_61421_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Later however after Bertram was asleep Billy crept out of bed and got the book 
5717_61421_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Under the carefully shaded lamp in the adjoining room she turned the pages softly till she came to the sentence Perhaps it would be hard to find a more utterly unreasonable irritable irresponsible creature than a hungry man With a long sigh she began to read and not until some minutes later did she close the book turn off the light and steal back to bed 
5717_61421_000025_000000	train-clean-360	During the next three days until after the funeral at the shabby little South Boston house Eliza spent only about half of each day at the Strata 
5717_61421_000025_000001	train-clean-360	This much to her distress left many of the household tasks for her young mistress to perform 
5717_61421_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Billy however attacked each new duty with a feverish eagerness that seemed to make the performance of it very like some glad penance done for past misdeeds 
5717_61421_000025_000003	train-clean-360	And when on the day after they had laid the old servant in his last resting place a despairing message came from Eliza to the effect that now her mother was very ill and would need her care Billy promptly told Eliza to stay as long as was necessary that they could get along all right without her 
none	none	But Billy what are we going to do Bertram demanded when he heard the news
5717_61421_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 We must have somebody 
none	none	I m going to do it Nonsense 
5717_61421_000028_000001	train-clean-360	As if you could scoffed Bertram 
none	none	Billy lifted her chin
5717_61421_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Couldn t I indeed she retorted 
none	none	Do you realize young man how much I ve done the last three days 
5717_61421_000030_000002	train-clean-360	How about those muffins you had this morning for breakfast and that cake last night 
5717_61421_000030_000003	train-clean-360	And didn t you yourself say that you never ate a better pudding than that date puff yesterday noon 
5717_61421_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders 
none	none	My dear love I m not questioning your ability to do it he soothed quickly Still he added with a whimsical smile I must remind you that Eliza has been here half the time and that muffins and date puffs however delicious aren t all there is to running a big house like this Besides just be sensible Billy he went on more seriously as he noted the rebellious gleam coming into his young wife s eyes you d know you couldn t do it if you d just stop to think 
5717_61421_000032_000002	train-clean-360	There s the Carletons coming to dinner Monday and my studio Tea to morrow to say nothing of the Symphony and the opera and the concerts you d lose because you were too dead tired to go to them 
none	none	You know how it was with that concert yesterday afternoon which Alice Greggory wanted you to go to with her
5717_61421_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t want to go choked Billy under her breath 
none	none	And there s your music 
5717_61421_000034_000001	train-clean-360	You haven t done a thing with that for days yet only last week you told me the publishers were hurrying you for that last song to complete the group 
none	none	I haven t felt like writing stammered Billy still half under her breath
5717_61421_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course you haven t triumphed Bertram 
5717_61421_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 You ve been too dead tired And that s just what I say 
none	none	Billy you can t do it all yourself
5717_61421_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 But I want to 
5717_61421_000037_000001	train-clean-360	I want to to tend to things faltered Billy with a half fearful glance into her husband s face 
none	none	Billy was hearing very loudly now that accusing If you d tend to your husband and your home a little more Bertram however was not hearing it evidently 
5717_61421_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Indeed he seemed never to have heard it much less to have spoken it 
5717_61421_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Tend to things he laughed lightly 
none	none	Well you ll have enough to do to tend to the maid I fancy 
5717_61421_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Anyhow we re going to have one 
5717_61421_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I ll just step into one of those what do you call em intelligence offices on my way down and send one up he finished as he gave his wife a good by kiss 
5717_61421_000040_000000	train-clean-360	An hour later Billy struggling with the broom and the drawing room carpet was called to the telephone 
none	none	It was her husband s voice that came to her
5717_61421_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Billy for heaven s sake take pity on me 
none	none	Won t you put on your duds and come and engage your maid yourself
5717_61421_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Bertram what s the matter 
none	none	Matter 
5717_61421_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Holy smoke 
5717_61421_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Well I ve been to three of those intelligence offices though why they call them that I can t imagine 
5717_61421_000043_000003	train-clean-360	If ever there was a place utterly devoid of intelligence but never mind 
none	none	I ve interviewed four fat ladies two thin ones and one medium with a wart I ve cheerfully divulged all our family secrets promised every other half hour out and taken oath that our household numbers three adult members and no more but I simply can t remember how many handkerchiefs we have in the wash each week 
5717_61421_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Billy will you come 
none	none	Maybe you can do something with them 
5717_61421_000043_000007	train-clean-360	I m sure you can 
5717_61421_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Why of course I ll come chirped Billy 
5717_61421_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 Where shall I meet you 
5717_61421_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram gave the street and number 
none	none	Good 
5717_61421_000046_000001	train-clean-360	I ll be there promised Billy as she hung up the receiver 
5717_61421_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Quite forgetting the broom in the middle of the drawing room floor Billy tripped up stairs to change her dress 
5717_61421_000047_000001	train-clean-360	On her lips was a gay little song 
5717_61421_000047_000002	train-clean-360	In her heart was joy 
none	none	I rather guess now I m tending to my husband and my home she was crowing to herself 
5717_61421_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Just as Billy was about to leave the house the telephone bell jangled again 
5717_61421_000050_000000	train-clean-360	It was Alice Greggory 
5717_61421_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Billy dear she called can t you come out 
none	none	mister Arkwright and mister Calderwell are here and they ve brought some new music 
5717_61421_000051_000002	train-clean-360	We want you Will you come 
5717_61421_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t dear 
none	none	Bertram wants me He s sent for me I ve got some housewifely duties to perform to day returned Billy in a voice so curiously triumphant that Alice at her end of the wires frowned in puzzled wonder as she turned away from the telephone 
5139_61422_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVI 
none	none	INTO TRAINING FOR MARY ELLEN 
5139_61422_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram told a friend afterwards that he never knew the meaning of the word chaos until he had seen the Strata during the weeks immediately following the laying away of his old servant 
5139_61422_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Every stratum was aquiver with apprehension he declared and there was never any telling when the next grand upheaval would rock the whole structure to its foundations 
5139_61422_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Nor was Bertram so far from being right 
5139_61422_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It was indeed a chaos as none knew better than did Bertram s wife 
none	none	Poor Billy 
5139_61422_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Sorry indeed were these days for Billy and as if to make her cup of woe full to overflowing there were Sister Kate s epistolary I told you so and Aunt Hannah s ever recurring lament If only Billy you were a practical housekeeper yourself they wouldn t impose on you so 
5139_61422_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Aunt Hannah to be sure offered Rosa and Kate by letter offered advice plenty of it 
5139_61422_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But Billy stung beyond all endurance and fairly radiating hurt pride and dogged determination disdained all assistance and with head held high declared she was getting along very well very well indeed 
5139_61422_000009_000000	train-clean-360	And this was the way she got along 
5139_61422_000010_000000	train-clean-360	First came Nora 
5139_61422_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Nora was a blue eyed black haired Irish girl the sixth that the despairing Billy had interviewed on that fateful morning when Bertram had summoned her to his aid 
5139_61422_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Nora stayed two days 
5139_61422_000010_000003	train-clean-360	During her reign the entire Strata echoed to banged doors dropped china and slammed furniture 
none	none	At her departure the Henshaws possessions were less by four cups two saucers one plate one salad bowl two cut glass tumblers and a teapot the latter William s choicest bit of Lowestoft 
5139_61422_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Olga came next 
5139_61422_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Olga was a Treasure 
5139_61422_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She was low voiced gentle eyed and a good cook 
5139_61422_000011_000003	train-clean-360	She stayed a week 
5139_61422_000011_000004	train-clean-360	By that time the growing frequency of the disappearance of sundry small articles of value and convenience led to Billy s making a reluctant search of Olga s room and to Olga s departure for the room was indeed a treasure house the Treasure having gathered unto itself other treasures 
5139_61422_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Following Olga came a period of what Bertram called one night stands so frequently were the dramatis personae below stairs changed Gretchen drank 
5139_61422_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Christine knew only four words of English salt good by no and yes and Billy found need occasionally of using other words 
5139_61422_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Mary was impertinent and lazy 
5139_61422_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Jennie could not even boil a potato properly much less cook a dinner 
5139_61422_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Sarah colored was willing and pleasant but insufferably untidy 
5139_61422_000012_000005	train-clean-360	Bridget was neatness itself but she had no conception of the value of time 
5139_61422_000012_000006	train-clean-360	Her meals were always from thirty to sixty minutes late and half cooked at that 
5139_61422_000012_000007	train-clean-360	Vera sang when she wasn t whistling and as she was generally off the key and always off the tune her almost frantic mistress dismissed her before twenty four hours had passed 
5139_61422_000012_000008	train-clean-360	Then came Mary Ellen 
5139_61422_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Mary Ellen began well 
5139_61422_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She was neat capable and obliging but it did not take her long to discover just how much and how little her mistress really knew of practical housekeeping 
5139_61422_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Matters and things were very different then 
5139_61422_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Mary Ellen became argumentative impertinent and domineering 
none	none	She openly shirked her work when it pleased her so to do and demanded perquisites and privileges so insolently that even William asked Billy one day whether Mary Ellen or Billy herself were the mistress of the Strata and Bertram with mock humility inquired how soon Mary Ellen would be wanting the house 
5139_61422_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Billy in weary despair submitted to this bullying for almost a week then in a sudden accession of outraged dignity that left Mary Ellen gasping with surprise she told the girl to go 
none	none	And thus the days passed 
5139_61422_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The maids came and the maids went and to Billy each one seemed a little worse than the one before 
5139_61422_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Nowhere was there comfort rest or peacefulness 
none	none	The nights were a torture of apprehension and the days an even greater torture of fulfilment 
5139_61422_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Noise confusion meals poorly cooked and worse served dust disorder and uncertainty 
none	none	And this was home Billy told herself bitterly 
5139_61422_000014_000006	train-clean-360	No wonder that Bertram telephoned more and more frequently that he had met a friend and was dining in town 
5139_61422_000014_000007	train-clean-360	No wonder that William pushed back his plate almost every meal with his food scarcely touched and then wandered about the house with that hungry homesick homeless look that nearly broke her heart 
none	none	No wonder indeed 
5139_61422_000015_000000	train-clean-360	And so it had come 
5139_61422_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It was true 
5139_61422_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Aunt Hannah and Kate and the Talk to Young Wives were right 
5139_61422_000015_000003	train-clean-360	She had not been fit to marry Bertram 
5139_61422_000015_000004	train-clean-360	She had not been fit to marry anybody 
5139_61422_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Her honeymoon was not only waning but going into a total eclipse 
5139_61422_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Had not Bertram already declared that if she would tend to her husband and her home a little more 
5139_61422_000017_000001	train-clean-360	she would tend to her husband and her home 
none	none	a little more 
5139_61422_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Billy clenched her small hands and set her round chin squarely 
none	none	Very well she would show them She would tend to her husband and her home She fancied she could learn to run that house and run it well And forthwith she descended to the kitchen and told the then reigning tormentor that her wages would be paid until the end of the week but that her services would be immediately dispensed with 
5139_61422_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Billy was well aware now that housekeeping was a matter of more than muffins and date puffs 
none	none	She could gauge in a measure the magnitude of the task to which she had set herself 
5139_61422_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But she did not falter and very systematically she set about making her plans 
5139_61422_000019_000000	train-clean-360	With a good stout woman to come in twice a week for the heavier work she believed she could manage by herself very well until Eliza could come back 
none	none	At least she could serve more palatable meals than the most of those that had appeared lately and at least she could try to make a home that would not drive Bertram to club dinners and Uncle William to hungry wanderings from room to room 
5139_61422_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Meanwhile all the time she could be learning and in due course she would reach that shining goal of Housekeeping Efficiency short of which according to Aunt Hannah and the Talk to Young Wives no woman need hope for a waneless honeymoon 
5139_61422_000020_000000	train-clean-360	So chaotic and erratic had been the household service and so quietly did Billy slip into her new role that it was not until the second meal after the maid s departure that the master of the house discovered what had happened 
5139_61422_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Then as his wife rose to get some forgotten article he questioned with uplifted eyebrows 
5139_61422_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Too good to wait upon us is my lady now eh 
5139_61422_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 My lady is waiting on you smiled Billy 
none	none	Yes I see this lady is retorted Bertram grimly but I mean our real lady in the kitchen 
5139_61422_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Great Scott Billy how long are you going to stand this 
5139_61422_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Billy tossed her head airily though she shook in her shoes 
5139_61422_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Billy had been dreading this moment 
5139_61422_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not standing it 
5139_61422_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She s gone responded Billy cheerfully resuming her seat 
5139_61422_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 Uncle William sha n t I give you some more pudding 
5139_61422_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Gone so soon groaned Bertram as William passed his plate with a smiling nod 
5139_61422_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh well went on Bertram resignedly she stayed longer than the last one 
5139_61422_000026_000002	train-clean-360	When is the next one coming 
5139_61422_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 She s already here 
none	none	Bertram frowned Here 
5139_61422_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But you served the dessert and At something in Billy s face a quick suspicion came into his own 
none	none	Billy you don t mean that you you
5139_61422_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she nodded brightly that s just what I mean 
5139_61422_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I m the next one 
5139_61422_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense exploded Bertram wrathfully 
5139_61422_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh come Billy we ve been all over this before 
5139_61422_000031_000002	train-clean-360	You know I can t have it 
none	none	Yes you can 
5139_61422_000032_000001	train-clean-360	You ve got to have it retorted Billy still with that disarming airy cheerfulness 
5139_61422_000032_000002	train-clean-360	 Besides twon t be half so bad as you think 
5139_61422_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Wasn t that a good pudding to night 
5139_61422_000032_000004	train-clean-360	Didn t you both come back for more 
5139_61422_000032_000005	train-clean-360	Well I made it 
5139_61422_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Puddings ejaculated Bertram with an impatient gesture 
5139_61422_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Billy as I ve said before it takes something besides puddings to run this house 
5139_61422_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know it does dimpled Billy and I ve got missus Durgin for that part 
5139_61422_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She s coming twice a week and more if I need her 
5139_61422_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Why dearie you don t know anything about how comfortable you re going to be 
none	none	I ll leave it to Uncle William if 
5139_61422_000035_000000	train-clean-360	But Uncle William had gone 
5139_61422_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Silently he had slipped from his chair and disappeared 
5139_61422_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Uncle William it might be mentioned in passing had never quite forgotten Aunt Hannah s fateful call with its dire revelations concerning a certain unwanted superfluous third party husband s brother 
5139_61422_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Remembering this there were times when he thought absence was both safest and best 
5139_61422_000035_000004	train-clean-360	This was one of the times 
5139_61422_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 But Billy dear still argued Bertram irritably how can you 
none	none	You don t know how 
5139_61422_000036_000002	train-clean-360	You ve had no experience 
5139_61422_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Billy threw back her shoulders 
5139_61422_000037_000001	train-clean-360	An ominous light came to her eyes 
5139_61422_000037_000002	train-clean-360	She was no longer airily playful 
5139_61422_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 That s exactly it Bertram 
5139_61422_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I don t know how but I m going to learn 
5139_61422_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I haven t had experience but I m going to get it 
none	none	I can t make a worse mess of it than we ve had ever since Eliza went anyway
5139_61422_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But if you d get a maid a good maid persisted Bertram feebly 
none	none	I had one Mary Ellen 
5139_61422_000040_000001	train-clean-360	She was a good maid until she found out how little her mistress knew then well you know what it was then 
5139_61422_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Do you think I d let that thing happen to me again 
none	none	No sir I m going into training for my next Mary Ellen And with a very majestic air Billy rose from the table and began to clear away the dishes CHAPTER XVII THE EFFICIENCY STAR AND BILLY Billy was not a young woman that did things by halves Long ago in the days of her childhood her Aunt Ella had once said of her If only Billy didn t go into things all over so but whether it s measles or mud pies I always know that she ll be the measliest or the muddiest of any child in town It could not be expected therefore that Billy would begin to play her new role now with any lack of enthusiasm But even had she needed any incentive there was still ever ringing in her ears Bertram s accusing If you d tend to your husband and your home a little more Billy still declared very emphatically that she had forgiven Bertram but she knew in her heart that she had not forgotten Certainly as the days passed it could not be said that Billy was not tending to her husband and her home From morning till night now she tended to nothing else She seldom touched her piano save to dust it and she never touched her half finished song manuscript long since banished to the oblivion of the music cabinet She made no calls except occasional flying visits to the Annex or to the pretty new home where Marie and Cyril were now delightfully settled The opera and the Symphony were over for the season but even had they not been Billy could not have attended them She had no time Surely she was not doing any gallivanting now she told herself sometimes a little aggrievedly There was indeed no time From morning until night Billy was busy flying from one task to another Her ambition to have everything just right was equalled only by her dogged determination to just show them that she could do this thing At first of course hampered as she was by ignorance and inexperience each task consumed about twice as much time as was necessary Yet afterwards when accustomedness had brought its reward of speed there was still for Billy no time for increased knowledge had only opened the way to other paths untrodden and alluring Study of cookbooks had led to the study of food values Billy discovered suddenly that potatoes beef onions oranges and puddings were something besides vegetables meat fruit and dessert They possessed attributes known as proteids fats and carbohydrates Faint memories of long forgotten school days hinted that these terms had been heard before but never Billy was sure had she fully realized what they meant It was at this juncture that Billy ran across a book entitled Correct Eating for Efficiency She bought it at once and carried it home in triumph It proved to be a marvelous book Billy had not read two chapters before she began to wonder how the family had managed to live thus far with any sort of success in the face of their dense ignorance and her own criminal carelessness concerning their daily bill of fare At dinner that night Billy told Bertram and William of her discovery and with growing excitement dilated on the wonderful good that it was to bring to them Why you don t know you can t imagine what a treasure it is she exclaimed It gives a complete table for the exact balancing of food For what demanded Bertram glancing up The exact balancing of food and this book says that s the biggest problem that modern scientists have to solve Humph shrugged Bertram Well you just balance my food to my hunger and I ll agree not to complain Oh but Bertram it s serious really urged Billy looking genuinely distressed Why it says that what you eat goes to make up what you are It makes your vital energies Your brain power and your body power come from what you eat Don t you see If you re going to paint a picture you need something different from what you would if you were going to to saw wood and what this book tells is is what I ought to give you to make you do each one I should think from what I ve read so far Now don t you see how important it is What if I should give you the saw wood kind of a breakfast when you were just going up stairs to paint all day And what if I should give Uncle William a a soldier s breakfast when all he is going to do is to go down on State Street and sit still all day But but my dear began Uncle William looking slightly worried there s my eggs that I always have you know For heaven s sake Billy what have you got hold of now demanded Bertram with just a touch of irritation Billy laughed merrily Well I suppose I didn t sound very logical she admitted But the book you just wait It s in the kitchen I m going to get it And with laughing eagerness she ran from the room In a moment she had returned book in hand Now listen This is the real thing not my garbled inaccuracies The food which we eat serves three purposes it builds the body substance bone muscle et cetera it produces heat in the body and it generates vital energy Nitrogen in different chemical combinations contributes largely to the manufacture of body substances the fats produce heat and the starches and sugars go to make the vital energy The nitrogenous food elements we call proteins the fats and oils fats and the starches and sugars because of the predominance of carbon we call carbohydrates Now in selecting the diet for the day you should take care to choose those foods which give the proteins fats and carbohydrates in just the right proportion Oh Billy groaned Bertram But it s so Bertram maintained Billy anxiously And it s every bit here I don t have to guess at it at all They even give the quantities of calories of energy required for different sized men I m going to measure you both to morrow and you must be weighed too she continued ignoring the sniffs of remonstrance from her two listeners Then I ll know just how many calories to give each of you They say a man of average size and weight and sedentary occupation should have at least two thousand calories and some authorities say three thousand in this proportion proteins three hundred calories fats three hundred fifty calories carbohydrates thirteen fifty calories But you both are taller than five feet five inches and I should think you weighed more than one hundred forty five pounds so I can t tell just yet how many calories you will need How many we will need indeed ejaculated Bertram But my dear you know I have to have my eggs began Uncle William again in a worried voice Of course you do dear and you shall have them soothed Billy brightly It s only that I ll have to be careful and balance up the other things for the day accordingly Don t you see Now listen We ll see what eggs are She turned the leaves rapidly Here s the food table It s lovely It tells everything I never saw anything so wonderful A b c d e here we are Eggs scrambled or boiled fats and proteins one egg one hundred If it s poached it s only fifty but you like yours boiled so we ll have to reckon on the one hundred And you always have two so that means two hundred calories in fats and proteins Now don t you see If you can t have but three hundred proteins and three hundred fifty fats all day and you ve already eaten two hundred in your two eggs that ll leave just er four hundred fifty for all the rest of the day of fats and proteins you understand And you ve no idea how fast that ll count up Why just one serving of butter is one hundred of fats and eight almonds is another while a serving of lentils is one hundred of proteins So you see how it ll go Yes I see murmured Uncle William casting a mournful glance about the generously laden table much as if he were bidding farewell to a departing friend But if I should want more to eat He stopped helplessly and Bertram s aggrieved voice filled the pause Look here Billy if you think I m going to be measured for an egg and weighed for an almond you re much mistaken because I m not I want to eat what I like and as much as I like whether it s six calories or six thousand Billy chuckled but she raised her hands in pretended shocked protest Six thousand Mercy Bertram I don t know what would happen if you ate that quantity but I m sure you couldn t paint You d just have to saw wood and dig ditches to use up all that vital energy Humph scoffed Bertram Besides this is for efficiency went on Billy with an earnest air This man owns up that some may think a two thousand calory ration is altogether too small and he advises such to begin with three thousand or even three thousand five hundred graded of course according to a man s size weight and occupation But he says one famous man does splendid work on only eighteen hundred calories and another on even sixteen hundred But that is just a matter of chewing Why Bertram you have no idea what perfectly wonderful things chewing does Yes I ve heard of that grunted Bertram ten chews to a cherry and sixty to a spoonful of soup There s an old metronome up stairs that Cyril left You might bring it down and set it going on the table so many ticks to a mouthful I suppose I reckon with an incentive like that to eat just about two calories would do me Eh William Bertram Now you re only making fun chided Billy and when it s really serious too Now listen she admonished picking up the book again If a man consumes a large amount of meat and very few vegetables his diet will be too rich in protein and too lacking in carbohydrates On the other hand if he consumes great quantities of pastry bread butter and tea his meals will furnish too much energy and not enough building material There Bertram don t you see Oh yes I see teased Bertram William better eat what you can to night I foresee it s the last meal of just food we ll get for some time Hereafter we ll have proteins fats and carbohydrates made into calory croquettes and Bertram scolded Billy But Bertram would not be silenced Here just let me take that book he insisted dragging the volume from Billy s reluctant fingers Now William listen Here s your breakfast to morrow morning strawberries one hundred calories whole wheat bread seventy five calories butter one hundred calories no second helping mind you or you d ruin the balance and something would topple boiled eggs two hundred calories cocoa one hundred calories which all comes to five hundred seventy calories Sounds like an English bill of fare with a new kind of foreign money but tisn t really you know Now for luncheon you can have tomato soup fifty calories potato salad that s cheap only thirty calories and But Billy pulled the book away then and in righteous indignation carried it to the kitchen You don t deserve anything to eat she declared with dignity as she returned to the dining room No queried Bertram his eyebrows uplifted Well as near as I can make out we aren t going to get much But Billy did not deign to answer this In spite of Bertram s tormenting gibes Billy did for some days arrange her meals in accordance with the wonderful table of food given in Correct Eating for Efficiency To be sure Bertram whatever he found before him during those days anxiously asked whether he were eating fats proteins or carbohydrates and he worried openly as to the possibility of his meal s producing one calory too much or too little thus endangering his balance Billy alternately laughed and scolded to the unvarying good nature of her husband As it happened however even this was not for long for Billy ran across a magazine article on food adulteration and this so filled her with terror lest in the food served she were killing her family by slow poison that she forgot all about the proteins fats and carbohydrates Her talk these days was of formaldehyde benzoate of soda and salicylic acid Very soon too Billy discovered an exclusive Back Bay school for instruction in household economics and domestic hygiene Billy investigated it at once and was immediately aflame with enthusiasm She told Bertram that it taught everything everything she wanted to know and forthwith she enrolled herself as one of its most devoted pupils in spite of her husband s protests that she knew enough more than enough already This school attendance to her consternation Billy discovered took added time but in some way she contrived to find it to take And so the days passed Eliza s mother though better was still too ill for her daughter to leave her Billy as the warm weather approached began to look pale and thin Billy to tell the truth was working altogether too hard but she would not admit it even to herself At first the novelty of the work and her determination to conquer at all costs had given a fictitious strength to her endurance Now that the novelty had become accustomedness and the conquering a surety Billy discovered that she had a back that could ache and limbs that at times could almost refuse to move from weariness There was still however one spur that never failed to urge her to fresh endeavor and to make her at least temporarily forget both ache and weariness and that was the comforting thought that now certainly even Bertram himself must admit that she was tending to her home and her husband As to Bertram Bertram it is true had at first uttered frequent and vehement protests against his wife s absorption of both mind and body in that plaguy housework as he termed it But as the days passed and blessed order superseded chaos peace followed discord and delicious well served meals took the place of the horrors that had been called meals in the past he gradually accepted the change with tranquil satisfaction and forgot to question how it was brought about though he did still sometimes rebel because Billy was always too tired or too busy to go out with him Of late however he had not done even this so frequently for a new Face of a Girl had possessed his soul and all his thoughts and most of his time had gone to putting on canvas the vision of loveliness that his mind s eye saw By June fifteenth the picture was finished Bertram awoke then to his surroundings He found summer was upon him with no plans made for its enjoyment He found William had started West for a two weeks business trip But what he did not find one day at least at first was his wife when he came home unexpectedly at four o clock And Bertram especially wanted to find his wife that day for he had met three people whose words had disquieted him not a little First Aunt Hannah She had said Bertram where is Billy She hasn t been out to the Annex for a week and the last time she was there she looked sick I was real worried about her Cyril had been next Where s Billy he had asked abruptly Marie says she hasn t seen her for two weeks Marie s afraid she s sick She says Billy didn t look well a bit when she did see her Calderwell had capped the climax He had said Great Scott Henshaw where have you been keeping yourself And where s your wife Not one of us has caught more than a glimpse of her for weeks She hasn t sung with us nor played for us nor let us take her anywhere for a month of Sundays Even Miss Greggory says she hasn t seen much of her and that Billy always says she s too busy to go anywhere But Miss Greggory says she looks pale and thin and that she thinks she s worrying too much over running the house I hope she isn t sick Why no Billy isn t sick Billy s all right Bertram had answered He had spoken lightly nonchalantly with an elaborate air of carelessness but after he had left Calderwell he had turned his steps abruptly and a little hastily toward home And he had not found Billy at least not at once He had gone first down into the kitchen and dining room He remembered then uneasily that he had always looked for Billy in the kitchen and dining room of late To day however she was not there On the kitchen table Bertram did see a book wide open and mechanically he picked it up It was a much thumbed cookbook and it was open where two once blank pages bore his wife s handwriting On the first page under the printed heading Things to Remember he read these sentences That rice swells till every dish in the house is full and that spinach shrinks till you can t find it That beets boil dry if you look out the window That biscuits which look as if they d been mixed up with a rusty stove poker haven t really been so but have only got too much undissolved soda in them There were other sentences but Bertram s eyes chanced to fall on the opposite page where the Things to Remember had been changed to Things to Forget and here Billy had written just four words Burns cuts and yesterday s failures Bertram dropped the book then with a spasmodic clearing of his throat and hurriedly resumed his search When he did find his wife at last he gave a cry of dismay she was on her own bed huddled in a little heap and shaking with sobs Billy Why Billy he gasped striding to the bedside Billy sat up at once and hastily wiped her eyes Oh is it you B Bertram I didn t hear you come in You you s said you weren t coming till six o clock she choked Billy what is the meaning of this N nothing I I guess I m just tired What have you been doing Bertram spoke sternly almost sharply He was wondering why he had not noticed before the little hollows in his wife s cheeks Billy what have you been doing Why n nothing extra only some sweeping and cleaning out the refrigerator Sweeping Cleaning You I thought missus Durgin did that She does I mean she did But she couldn t come She broke her leg fell off the stepladder where she was three days ago So I had to do it And to day someway everything went wrong I burned me and I cut me and I used two sodas with not any cream of tartar and I should think I didn t know anything not anything And down went Billy s head into the pillows again in another burst of sobs With gentle yet uncompromising determination Bertram gathered his wife into his arms and carried her to the big chair There for a few minutes he soothed and petted her as if she were a tired child which indeed she was Billy this thing has got to stop he said then There was a very inexorable ring of decision in his voice What thing This housework business Billy sat up with a jerk But Bertram it isn t fair You can t you mustn t just because of to day I can do it I have done it I ve done it days and days and it s gone beautifully even if they did say I couldn t Couldn t what Be an e efficient housekeeper Who said you couldn t Aunt Hannah and K Kate Bertram said a savage word under his breath Holy smoke Billy I didn t marry you for a cook or a scrub lady If you had to do it that would be another matter of course and if we did have to do it we wouldn t have a big house like this for you to do it in But I didn t marry for a cook and I knew I wasn t getting one when I married you Billy bridled into instant wrath Well I like that Bertram Henshaw Can t I cook Haven t I proved that I can cook Bertram laughed and kissed the indignant lips till they quivered into an unwilling smile Bless your spunky little heart of course you have But that doesn t mean that I want you to do it You see it so happens that you can do other things too and I d rather you did those Billy you haven t played to me for a week nor sung to me for a month You re too tired every night to talk or read together or go anywhere with me I married for companionship not cooking and sweeping Billy shook her head stubbornly Her mouth settled into determined lines That s all very well to say You aren t hungry now Bertram But it s different when you are and they said twould be Humph They are Aunt Hannah and Kate I suppose Yes and the Talk to Young Wives The w what Billy choked a little She had forgotten that Bertram did not know about the Talk to Young Wives She wished that she had not mentioned the book but now that she had she would make the best of it She drew herself up with dignity It s a book a very nice book It says lots of things that have come true Where is that book Let me see it please With visible reluctance Billy got down from her perch on Bertram s knee went to her desk and brought back the book Bertram regarded it frowningly so frowningly that Billy hastened to its defense And it s true what it says in there and what Aunt Hannah and Kate said It is different when they re hungry You said yourself if I d tend to my husband and my home a little more and Bertram looked up with unfeigned amazement I said what he demanded In a voice shaken with emotion Billy repeated the fateful words I never when did I say that The night Uncle William and I came home from Pete s For a moment Bertram stared dumbly then a shamed red swept to his forehead Billy did I say that I ought to be shot if I did But Billy you said you d forgiven me I did dear truly I did but don t you see it was true I hadn t tended to things So I ve been doing it since A sudden comprehension illuminated Bertram s face Heavens Billy And is that why you haven t been anywhere or done anything Is that why Calderwell said to day that you hadn t been with them anywhere and that Great Scott Billy Did you think I was such a selfish brute as that Oh but when I was going with them I was following the book I thought quavered Billy and hurriedly she turned the leaves to a carefully marked passage It s there about the outside interests See I was trying to brush up against them so that I wouldn t interfere with your Art Then when you accused me of gallivanting off with But Bertram swept her back into his arms and not for some minutes could Billy make a coherent speech again Then Bertram spoke See here Billy he exploded a little shakily if I could get you off somewhere on a desert island where there weren t any Aunt Hannahs or Kates or Talks to Young Wives I think there d be a chance to make you happy but Oh but there was truth in it interrupted Billy sitting erect again I didn t know how to run a house and it was perfectly awful while we were having all those dreadful maids one after the other and no woman should be a wife who doesn t know All right all right dear interrupted Bertram in his turn We ll concede that point if you like But you do know now You ve got the efficient housewife racket down pat even to the last calory your husband should be fed and I ll warrant there isn t a Mary Ellen in Christendom who can find a spot of ignorance on you as big as a pinhead So we ll call that settled What you need now is a good rest and you re going to have it too I m going to have six Mary Ellens here to morrow morning Six Do you hear And all you ve got to do is to get your gladdest rags together for a trip to Europe with me next month Because we re going I shall get the tickets to morrow after I send the six Mary Ellens packing up here Now come put on your bonnet We re going down town to dinner CHAPTER XVIII BILLY TRIES HER HAND AT MANAGING Bertram did not engage six Mary Ellens the next morning nor even one as it happened for that evening Eliza who had not been unaware of conditions at the Strata telephoned to say that her mother was so much better now she believed she could be spared to come to the Strata for several hours each day if missus Henshaw would like to have her begin in that way Billy agreed promptly and declared herself as more than willing to put up with such an arrangement Bertram it is true when he heard of the plan rebelled and asserted that what Billy needed was a rest an entire rest from care and labor In fact what he wanted her to do he said was to gallivant to gallivant all day long Nonsense Billy had laughed coloring to the tips of her ears Besides as for the work Bertram with just you and me here and with all my vast experience now and Eliza here for several hours every day it ll be nothing but play for this little time before we go away You ll see All right I ll see then Bertram had nodded meaningly But just make sure that it is play for you I will laughed Billy and there the matter had ended Eliza began work the next day and Billy did indeed soon find herself playing under Bertram s watchful insistence She resumed her music and brought out of exile the unfinished song With Bertram she took drives and walks and every two or three days she went to see Aunt Hannah and Marie She was pleasantly busy too with plans for her coming trip and it was not long before even the remorseful Bertram had to admit that Billy was looking and appearing quite like her old self At the Annex Billy found Calderwell and Arkwright one day They greeted her as if she had just returned from a far country Well if you aren t the stranger lady began Calderwell looking frankly pleased to see her We d thought of advertising in the daily press somewhat after this fashion Lost strayed or stolen one Billy comrade good friend and kind cheerer up of lonely hearts Any information thankfully received by her bereft sorrowing friends Billy joined in the laugh that greeted this sally but Arkwright noticed that she tried to change the subject from her own affairs to a discussion of the new song on Alice Greggory s piano Calderwell however was not to be silenced The last I heard of this elusive Billy he resumed with teasing cheerfulness she was running down a certain lost calory that had slipped away from her husband s breakfast and Billy wheeled sharply Where did you get hold of that she demanded Oh I didn t returned the man defensively I never got hold of it at all I never even saw the calory though for that matter I don t think I should know one if I did see it What we feared was that in hunting the lost calory you had lost yourself and But Billy would hear no more With her disdainful nose in the air she walked to the piano Come mister Arkwright she said with dignity Let s try this song Arkwright rose at once and accompanied her to the piano They had sung the song through twice when Billy became uneasily aware that on the other side of the room Calderwell and Alice Greggory were softly chuckling over something they had found in a magazine Billy frowned and twitched the corners of a pile of music with restless fingers I wonder if Alice hasn t got some quartets here somewhere she murmured her disapproving eyes still bent on the absorbed couple across the room Arkwright was silent Billy throwing a hurried glance into his face thought she detected a somber shadow in his eyes She thought too she knew why it was there So possessed had Billy been during the early winter of the idea that her special mission in life was to inaugurate and foster a love affair between disappointed mister Arkwright and lonely Alice Greggory that now she forgot for a moment that Arkwright himself was quite unaware of her efforts She thought only that the present shadow on his face must be caused by the same thing that brought worry to her own heart the manifest devotion of Calderwell to Alice Greggory just now across the room Instinctively therefore as to a coworker in a common cause she turned a disturbed face to the man at her side It is indeed high time that I looked after something besides lost calories she said significantly Then at the evident uncomprehension in Arkwright s face she added Has it been going on like this very long Arkwright still apparently did not understand Has what been going on he questioned That over there answered Billy impatiently scarcely knowing whether to be more irritated at the threatened miscarriage of her cherished plans or at Arkwright s to her wilfully blind insistence on her making her meaning more plain Has it been going on long such utter devotion As she asked the question Billy turned and looked squarely into Arkwright s face She saw therefore the great change that came to it as her meaning became clear to him Her first feeling was one of shocked realization that Arkwright had indeed been really blind Her second she turned away her eyes hurriedly from what she thought she saw in the man s countenance With an assumedly gay little cry she sprang to her feet Come come what are you two children chuckling over she demanded crossing the room abruptly Didn t you hear me say I wanted you to come and sing a quartet Billy blamed herself very much for what she called her stupidity in so baldly summoning Arkwright s attention to Calderwell s devotion to Alice Greggory She declared that she ought to have known better and she asked herself if this were the way she was furthering matters between Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy was really seriously disturbed She had never quite forgiven herself for being so blind to Arkwright s feeling for herself during those days when he had not known of her engagement to Bertram She had never forgotten either the painful scene when he had hopefully told of his love only to be met with her own shocked repudiation For long weeks after that his face had haunted her She had wished oh so ardently that she could do something in some way to bring him happiness When therefore it had come to her knowledge afterward that he was frequently with his old friend Alice Greggory she had been so glad It was very easy then to fan hope into conviction that here in this old friend he had found sweet balm for his wounded heart and she determined at once to do all that she could do to help So very glowing indeed was her eagerness in the matter that it looked suspiciously as if she thought could she but bring this thing about that old scores against herself would be erased Billy told herself virtuously however that not only for Arkwright did she desire this marriage to take place but for Alice Greggory In the very nature of things Alice would one day be left alone She was poor and not very strong She sorely needed the shielding love and care of a good husband What more natural than that her old time friend and almost sweetheart M J Arkwright should be that good husband That really it was more Arkwright and less Alice that was being considered however was proved when the devotion of Calderwell began to be first suspected then known for a fact Billy s distress at this turn of affairs indicated very plainly that it was not just a husband but a certain one particular husband that she desired for Alice Greggory All the more disturbed was she therefore when to day seeing her three friends together again for the first time for some weeks she discovered increased evidence that her worst fears were to be realized It was to be Alice and Calderwell not Alice and Arkwright Arkwright was again to be disappointed in his dearest hopes Telling herself indignantly that it could not be it should not be Billy determined to remain after the men had gone and speak to Alice Just what she would say she did not know Even what she could say she was not sure But certainly there must be something some little thing that she could say which would open Alice s eyes to what she was doing and what she ought to do It was in this frame of mind therefore that Billy after Arkwright and Calderwell had gone spoke to Alice She began warily with assumed nonchalance I believe mister Arkwright sings better every time I hear him There was no answer Alice was sorting music at the piano Don t you think so Billy raised her voice a little Alice turned almost with a start What s that Oh yes Well I don t know maybe I do You would if you didn t hear him any oftener than I do laughed Billy But then of course you do hear him oftener I Oh no indeed Not so very much oftener Alice had turned back to her music There was a slight embarrassment in her manner I wonder where that new song is she murmured Billy who knew very well where the song lay was not to be diverted Nonsense As if mister Arkwright wasn t always telling how Alice liked this song and didn t like that one and thought the other the best yet I don t believe he sings a thing that he doesn t first sing to you For that matter I fancy he asks your opinion of everything anyway Why Billy he doesn t exclaimed Alice a deep red flaming into her cheeks You know he doesn t Billy laughed gleefully She had not been slow to note the color in her friend s face or to ascribe to it the one meaning she wished to ascribe to it So sure indeed was she now that her fears had been groundless that she flung caution to the winds Ho My dear Alice you can t expect us all to be blind she teased Besides we all think it s such a lovely arrangement that we re just glad to see it He s such a fine fellow and we like him so much We couldn t ask for a better husband for you than mister Arkwright and From sheer amazement at the sudden white horror in Alice Greggory s face Billy stopped short Why Alice she faltered then With a visible effort Alice forced her trembling lips to speak My husband Mr Arkwright Why Billy you couldn t have seen you haven t seen there s nothing you could see He isn t he wasn t he can t be We we re nothing but friends Billy just good friends Billy though dismayed was still not quite convinced Friends Nonsense When But Alice interrupted feverishly Alice in an agony of fear lest the true state of affairs should be suspected was hiding behind a bulwark of pride Now Billy please Say no more You re quite wrong entirely You ll never never hear of my marrying mister Arkwright As I said before we re friends the best of friends that is all We couldn t be anything else possibly Billy plainly discomfited fell back but she threw a sharp glance into her friend s flushed countenance You mean because of Hugh Calderwell she demanded Then for the second time that afternoon throwing discretion to the winds she went on plaintively You won t listen of course Girls in love never do Hugh is all right and I like him but there s more real solid worth in mister Arkwright s little finger than there is in Hugh s whole self And But a merry peal of laughter from Alice Greggory interrupted And pray do you think I m in love with Hugh Calderwell she demanded There was a curious note of something very like relief in her voice Well I didn t know began Billy uncertainly Then I ll tell you now smiled Alice I m not Furthermore perhaps it s just as well that you should know right now that I don t intend to marry ever Oh Alice No There was determination and there was still that curious note of relief in the girl s voice It was as if somewhere a great danger had been avoided I have my music That is enough I m not intending to marry Oh but Alice while I will own up I m glad it isn t Hugh Calderwell there is mister Arkwright and I did hope But Alice shook her head and turned resolutely away At that moment too Aunt Hannah came in from the street so Billy could say no more Aunt Hannah dropped herself a little wearily into a chair I ve just come from Marie s she said How is she asked Billy Aunt Hannah smiled and raised her eyebrows Well just now she s quite exercised over another rattle from her cousin out West this time There were four little silver bells on it and she hasn t got any janitor s wife now to give it to Billy laughed softly but Aunt Hannah had more to say You know she isn t going to allow any toys but Teddy bears and woolly lambs of which I believe she has already bought quite an assortment She says they don t rattle or squeak I declare when I see the woolen pads and rubber hushers that that child has put everywhere all over the house I don t know whether to laugh or cry And she s so worried It seems Cyril must needs take just this time to start composing a new opera or symphony or something and never before has she allowed him to be interrupted by anything on such an occasion But what he ll do when the baby comes she says she doesn t know for she says she can t she just can t keep it from bothering him some she s afraid As if any opera or symphony that ever lived was of more consequence than a man s own child finished Aunt Hannah with an indignant sniff as she reached for her shawl CHAPTER XIX A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK FOR CYRIL It was early in the forenoon of the first day of July that Eliza told her mistress that missus Stetson was asking for her at the telephone Eliza s face was not a little troubled I m afraid maybe it isn t good news she stammered as her mistress hurriedly arose She s at mister Cyril Henshaw s missus Stetson is and she seemed so terribly upset about something that there was no making real sense out of what she said But she asked for you and said to have you come quick Billy her own face paling was already at the telephone Yes Aunt Hannah What is it Oh my grief and conscience Billy if you can come up here please You must come Can t you come Why yes of course But but Marie The the baby A faint groan came across the wires Oh my grief and conscience Billy It isn t the baby It s babies It s twins boys Cyril has them now the nurse hasn t got here yet Twins Cyril has them broke in Billy hysterically Yes and they re crying something terrible We ve sent for a second nurse to come too of course but she hasn t got here yet either And those babies if you could hear them That s what we want you for to But Billy was almost laughing now All right I ll come out and hear them she called a bit wildly as she hung up the receiver Some little time later a palpably nervous maid admitted Billy to the home of mister and missus Cyril Henshaw Even as the door was opened Billy heard faintly but unmistakably the moaning wails of two infants missus Stetson says if you will please to help mister Henshaw with the babies stammered the maid after the preliminary questions and answers I ve been in when I could and they re all right only they re crying They re in his den We had to put them as far away as possible their crying worried missus Henshaw so Yes I see murmured Billy I ll go to them at once No don t trouble to come I know the way Just tell missus Stetson I m here please she finished as she tossed her hat and gloves on to the hall table and turned to go upstairs Billy s feet made no sound on the soft rugs The crying however grew louder and louder as she approached the den Softly she turned the knob and pushed open the door She stopped short then at what she saw Cyril had not heard her nor seen her His back was partly toward the door His coat was off and his hair stood fiercely on end as if a nervous hand had ruffled it His usually pale face was very red and his forehead showed great drops of perspiration He was on his feet hovering over the couch at each end of which lay a rumpled roll of linen lace and flannel from which emerged a prodigiously puckered little face two uncertainly waving rose leaf fists and a wail of protesting rage that was not uncertain in the least In one hand Cyril held a Teddy bear in the other his watch dangling from its fob chain Both of these he shook feebly one after the other above the tiny faces Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he begged agitatedly In the doorway Billy clapped her hands to her lips and stifled a laugh Billy knew of course that what she should do was to go forward at once and help this poor distracted man but Billy just then was not doing what she knew she ought to do With a muttered ejaculation which Billy to her sorrow could not catch Cyril laid down the watch and flung the Teddy bear aside Then in very evident despair he gingerly picked up one of the rumpled rolls of flannel lace and linen and held it straight out before him After a moment s indecision he began awkwardly to jounce it teeter it rock it back and forth and to pat it jerkily Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he begged again frantically Perhaps it was the change of position perhaps it was the novelty of the motion perhaps it was only utter weariness or lack of breath Whatever the cause the wailing sobs from the bundle in his arms dwindled suddenly to a gentle whisper then ceased altogether With a ray of hope illuminating his drawn countenance Cyril carefully laid the baby down and picked up the other Almost confidently now he began the jouncing and teetering and rocking as before There there Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush he chanted again This time he was not so successful Perhaps he had lost his skill Perhaps it was merely the world old difference in babies At all events this infant did not care for jerks and jounces and showed it plainly by emitting loud and yet louder wails of rage wails in which his brother on the couch speedily joined Oh come come pretty baby good baby hush hush confound it HUSH I say exploded the frightened weary baffled distracted man picking up the other baby and trying to hold both his sons at once Billy hurried forward then tearfully remorsefully her face all sympathy her arms all tenderness Here Cyril let me help you she cried Cyril turned abruptly Thank God some one s come he groaned holding out both the babies with an exuberance of generosity Billy you ve saved my life Billy laughed tremulously Yes I ve come Cyril and I ll help every bit I can but I don t know a thing not a single thing about them myself Dear me aren t they cunning But Cyril do they always cry so The father of an hour drew himself stiffly erect Cry What do you mean Why shouldn t they cry he demanded indignantly I want you to understand that Doctor Brown said those were A number I fine boys Anyhow I guess there s no doubt they ve got lungs all right he added with a grim smile as he pulled out his handkerchief and drew it across his perspiring brow Billy did not have an opportunity to show Cyril how much or how little she knew about babies for in another minute the maid had appeared with the extra nurse and that young woman with trained celerity and easy confidence assumed instant command and speedily had peace and order restored Cyril freed from responsibility cast longing eyes for a moment upon his work but the next minute with a despairing glance about him he turned and fled precipitately Billy following the direction of his eyes suppressed a smile On the top of Cyril s manuscript music on the table lay a hot water bottle Draped over the back of his favorite chair was a pink bordered baby blanket On the piano stool rested a beribboned and beruffled baby s toilet basket From behind the sofa pillow leered ridiculously the Teddy bear just as it had left Cyril s desperate hand No wonder indeed that Billy smiled Billy was thinking of what Marie had said not a week before I shall keep the baby of course in the nursery I ve been in homes where they ve had baby things strewn from one end of the house to the other but it won t be that way here In the first place I don t believe in it but even if I did I d have to be careful on account of Cyril Imagine Cyril s trying to write his music with a baby in the room No I shall keep the baby in the nursery if possible but wherever it is it won t be anywhere near Cyril s den anyway Billy suppressed many a smile during the days that immediately followed the coming of the twins Some of the smiles however refused to be suppressed They became indeed shamelessly audible chuckles Billy was to sail the tenth and naturally during those early July days her time was pretty much occupied with her preparations for departure but nothing could keep her from frequent though short visits to the home of her brother in law The twins were proving themselves to be fine healthy boys Two trained maids and two trained nurses ruled the household with a rod of iron As to Cyril Billy declared that Cyril was learning something every day of his life now Oh yes he s learning things she said to Aunt Hannah one morning lots of things For instance he has his breakfast now not when he wants it but when the maid wants to give it to him which is precisely at eight o clock every morning So he s learning punctuality And for the first time in his life he has discovered the astounding fact that there are several things more important in the world than is the special piece of music he happens to be composing chiefly the twins bath the twins nap the twins airing and the twins colic Aunt Hannah laughed though she frowned too But surely Billy with two nurses and the maids Cyril doesn t have to to She came to a helpless pause Oh no laughed Billy Cyril doesn t have to really attend to any of those things though I have seen each of the nurses at different times unhesitatingly thrust a twin into his arms and bid him hold the child till she comes back But it s this way You see Marie must be kept quiet and the nursery is very near her room It worries her terribly when either of the children cries Besides the little rascals have apparently fixed up some sort of labor union compact with each other so that if one cries for something or nothing the other promptly joins in and helps So the nurses have got into the habit of picking up the first disturber of the peace and hurrying him to quarters remote and Cyril s den being the most remote of all they usually fetch up there You mean they take those babies into Cyril s den now Even Aunt Hannah was plainly aghast Yes twinkled Billy I fancy their Hygienic Immaculacies approved of Cyril s bare floors undraped windows and generally knick knackless condition Anyhow they ve made his den a sort of of annex to the nursery But but Cyril What does he say stammered the dumfounded Aunt Hannah Think of Cyril s standing a thing like that Doesn t he do anything or say anything Billy smiled and lifted her brows quizzically My dear Aunt Hannah did you ever know many people to have the courage to say things to one of those becapped beaproned bespotless creatures of loftily superb superiority known as trained nurses Besides you wouldn t recognize Cyril now Nobody would He s as meek as Moses and has been ever since his two young sons were laid in his reluctant trembling arms He breaks into a cold sweat at nothing and moves about his own home as if he were a stranger and an interloper endured merely on sufferance in this abode of strange women and strange babies Nonsense scoffed Aunt Hannah But it s so maintained Billy merrily Now for instance You know Cyril always has been in the habit of venting his moods on the piano just as I do only more so by playing exactly as he feels Well as near as I can gather he was at his usual trick the next day after the twins arrived and you can imagine about what sort of music it would be after what he had been through the preceding forty eight hours Of course I don t know exactly what happened but Julia Marie s second maid you know tells the story She s been with them long enough to know something of the way the whole household always turns on the pivot of the master s whims so she fully appreciated the situation She says she heard him begin to play and that she never heard such queer creepy shivery music in her life but that he hadn t been playing five minutes before one of the nurses came into the living room where Julia was dusting and told her to tell whoever was playing to stop that dreadful noise as they wanted to take the twins in there for their nap But I didn t do it ma am Julia says I wa n t lookin for losin my place an I let the young woman do the job herself An she done it pert as you please An jest as I was seekin a hidin place for the explosion if mister Henshaw didn t come out lookin a little wild but as meek as a lamb an when he sees me he asked wouldn t I please get him a cup of coffee good an strong An I got it So you see finished Billy Cyril is learning things lots of things Oh my grief and conscience I should say he was half shivered Aunt Hannah Cyril looking meek as a lamb indeed Billy laughed merrily Well it must be a new experience for Cyril For a man whose daily existence for years has been rubber heeled and woolen padded and whose family from boyhood has stood at attention and saluted if he so much as looked at them it must be quite a change as things are now However it ll be different of course when Marie is on her feet again Does she know at all how things are going Not very much as yet though I believe she has begun to worry some She confided to me one day that she was glad of course that she had two darling babies instead of one but that she was afraid it might be hard just at first to teach them both at once to be quiet for she was afraid that while she was teaching one the other would be sure to cry or do something noisy Do something noisy indeed ejaculated Aunt Hannah As for the real state of affairs Marie doesn t dream that Cyril s sacred den is given over to Teddy bears and baby blankets All is I hope she ll be measurably strong before she does find it out laughed Billy as she rose to go CHAPTER XX ARKWRIGHT S EYES ARE OPENED William came back from his business trip the eighth of July and on the ninth Billy and Bertram went to New York Eliza s mother was so well now that Eliza had taken up her old quarters in the Strata and the household affairs were once more running like clockwork Later in the season William would go away for a month s fishing trip and the house would be closed mister and missus Bertram Henshaw were not expected to return until the first of October but with Eliza to look after the comfort of William the mistress of the house did no worrying Ever since Pete s going Eliza had said that she preferred to be the only maid with a charwoman to come in for the heavier work and to this arrangement her mistress had willingly consented for the present Marie and the babies were doing finely and Aunt Hannah s health and affairs at the Annex were all that could be desired As Billy indeed saw it there was only one flaw to mar her perfect content on this holiday trip with Bertram and that was her disappointment over the very evident disaster that had come to her cherished matrimonial plans for Arkwright and Alice Greggory She could not forget Arkwright s face that day at the Annex when she had so foolishly called his attention to Calderwell s devotion and she could not forget either Alice Greggory s very obvious perturbation a little later and her suspiciously emphatic assertion that she had no intention of marrying any one certainly not Arkwright As Billy thought of all this now she could not but admit that it did look dark for Arkwright poor Arkwright whom she more than any one else in the world perhaps had a special reason for wishing to see happily married There was then this one cloud on Billy s horizon as the big boat that was to bear her across the water steamed down the harbor that beautiful July day As it chanced naturally perhaps not only was Billy thinking of Arkwright that morning but Arkwright was thinking of Billy Arkwright had thought frequently of Billy during the last few days particularly since that afternoon meeting at the Annex when the four had renewed their old good times together Up to that day Arkwright had been trying not to think of Billy He had been fighting his tiger skin Sternly he had been forcing himself to meet her to see her to talk with her to sing with her or to pass her by all with the indifference properly expected to be shown in association with missus Bertram Henshaw another man s wife He had known of course that deep down in his heart he loved her always had loved her and always would love her Hopelessly and drearily he accepted this as a fact even while with all his might fighting that tiger skin So sure was he indeed of this so implicitly had he accepted it as an unalterable certainty that in time even his efforts to fight it became almost mechanical and unconscious in their stern round of forced indifference Then came that day at the Annex and the discovery the discovery which he had made when Billy called his attention to Calderwell and Alice Greggory across the room in the corner the discovery which had come with so blinding a force and which even now he was tempted to question as to its reality the discovery that not Billy Neilson nor missus Bertram Henshaw nor even the tender ghost of a lost love held the center of his heart but Alice Greggory The first intimation of all this had come with his curious feeling of unreasoning hatred and blind indignation toward Calderwell as through Billy s eyes he had seen the two together Then had come the overwhelming longing to pick up Alice Greggory and run off with her somewhere anywhere so that Calderwell could not follow At once however he had pulled himself up short with the mental cry of Absurd What was it to him if Calderwell did care for Alice Greggory Surely he himself was not in love with the girl He was in love with Billy that is It was all confusion then in his mind and he was glad indeed when he could leave the house He wanted to be alone He wanted to think He must in some way thrash out this astounding thing that had come to him Arkwright did not visit the Annex again for some days Until he was more nearly sure of himself and of his feelings he did not wish to see Alice Greggory It was then that he began to think of Billy deliberately purposefully for it must be of course that he had made a mistake he told himself It must be that he did really still care for Billy though of course he ought not to Arkwright made another discovery then He learned that however deliberately he started in to think of Billy he ended every time in thinking of Alice He thought of how good she had been to him and of how faithful she had been in helping him to fight his love for Billy Just here he decided for a moment that probably after all his feeling of anger against Calderwell was merely the fear of losing this helpful comradeship that he so needed Even with himself however Arkwright could not keep up this farce long and very soon he admitted miserably that it was not the comradeship of Alice Greggory that he wanted or needed but the love He knew it now No longer was there any use in beating about the bush He did love Alice Greggory but so curiously and unbelievably stupid had he been that he had not found it out until now And now it was too late Had not even Billy called his attention to the fact of Calderwell s devotion Besides had not he himself at the very first told Calderwell that he might have a clear field Fool that he had been to let another thus lightly step in and win from under his very nose what might have been his if he had but known his own mind before it was too late But was it after all quite too late He and Alice were old friends Away back in their young days in their native town they had been indeed almost sweethearts in a boy and girl fashion It would not have taken much in those days he believed to have made the relationship more interesting But changes had come Alice had left town and for years they had drifted apart Then had come Billy and Billy had found Alice thus bringing about the odd circumstance of their renewing of acquaintanceship Perhaps at that time if he had not already thought he cared for Billy there would have been something more than acquaintanceship But he had thought he cared for Billy all these years and now at this late day to wake up and find that he cared for Alice A pretty mess he had made of things Was he so inconstant then so fickle Did he not know his own mind five minutes at a time What would Alice Greggory think even if he found the courage to tell her What could she think What could anybody think Arkwright fairly ground his teeth in impotent wrath and he did not know whether he were the most angry that he did not love Billy or that he had loved Billy or that he loved somebody else now It was while he was in this unenviable frame of mind that he went to see Alice Not that he had planned definitely to speak to her of his discovery nor yet that he had planned not to He had indeed planned nothing For a man usually so decided as to purpose and energetic as to action he was in a most unhappy state of uncertainty and changeableness One thing only was unmistakably clear to him and that was that he must see Alice For months now he had taken to Alice all his hopes and griefs perplexities and problems and never had he failed to find comfort in the shape of sympathetic understanding and wise counsel To Alice therefore now he turned as a matter of course telling himself vaguely that perhaps after he had seen Alice he would feel better Just how intimately this particular problem of his concerned Alice herself he did not stop to realize He did not indeed think of it at all from Alice s standpoint until he came face to face with the girl in the living room at the Annex Then suddenly he did His manner became at once consequently full of embarrassment and quite devoid of its usual frank friendliness As it happened this was perhaps the most unfortunate thing that could have occurred so far as it concerned the attitude of Alice Greggory for thereby innumerable tiny sparks of suspicion that had been tormenting the girl for days were instantly fanned into consuming flames of conviction Alice had not been slow to note Arkwright s prolonged absence from the Annex Coming as it did so soon after her most disconcerting talk with Billy in regard to her own relations with him it had filled her with frightened questionings If Billy had seen things to make her think of linking their names together perhaps Arkwright himself had heard some such idea put forth somewhere and that was why he was staying away to show the world that there was no foundation for such rumors Perhaps he was even doing it to show her that Even in her thoughts Alice could scarcely bring herself to finish the sentence That Arkwright should ever suspect for a moment that she cared for him was intolerable Painfully conscious as she was that she did care for him it was easy to fear that others must be conscious of it too Had she not already proof that Billy suspected it Why then might not it be quite possible even probable that Arkwright suspected it also and because he did suspect it had decided that it would be just as well perhaps if he did not call so often In spite of Alice s angry insistence to herself that after all this could not be the case that the man knew she understood he still loved Billy she could not help fearing in the face of Arkwright s unusual absence that it might yet be true When therefore he finally did appear only to become at once obviously embarrassed in her presence her fears instantly became convictions It was true then The man did believe she cared for him and he had been trying to teach her to save her To teach her To save her indeed Very well he should see And forthwith from that moment Alice Greggory s chief reason for living became to prove to mister M J Arkwright that he needed not to teach her to save her nor yet to sympathize with her How do you do she greeted him with a particularly bright smile I m sure I hope you are well such a beautiful day as this Oh yes I m well I suppose Still I have felt better in my life smiled Arkwright with some constraint Oh I m sorry murmured the girl striving so hard to speak with impersonal unconcern that she did not notice the inaptness of her reply Eh Sorry I ve felt better are you retorted Arkwright with nervous humor Then because he was embarrassed he said the one thing he had meant not to say Don t you think I m quite a stranger It s been some time since I ve been here Alice smarting under the sting of what she judged to be the only possible cause for his embarrassment leaped to this new opportunity to show her lack of interest Oh has it she murmured carelessly Well I don t know but it has now that I come to think of it Arkwright frowned gloomily A week ago he would have tossed back a laughingly aggrieved remark as to her unflattering indifference to his presence Now he was in no mood for such joking It was too serious a matter with him You ve been busy no doubt with other matters he presumed forlornly thinking of Calderwell Yes I have been busy assented the girl One is always happier I think to be busy Not that I meant that I needed the work to be happy she added hastily in a panic lest he think she had a consuming sorrow to kill No of course not he murmured abstractedly rising to his feet and crossing the room to the piano Then with an elaborate air of trying to appear very natural he asked jovially Anything new to play to me Alice arose at once Yes I have a little nocturne that I was playing to mister Calderwell last night Oh to Calderwell Arkwright had stiffened perceptibly Yes He didn t like it I ll play it to you and see what you say she smiled seating herself at the piano Well if he had liked it it s safe to say I shouldn t shrugged Arkwright Nonsense laughed the girl beginning to appear more like her natural self I should think you were mister Cyril Henshaw mister Calderwell is partial to ragtime I ll admit But there are some good things he likes There are indeed some good things he likes returned Arkwright with grim emphasis his somber eyes fixed on what he believed to be the one especial object of Calderwell s affections at the moment Alice unaware both of the melancholy gaze bent upon herself and of the cause thereof laughed again merrily Poor mister Calderwell she cried as she let her fingers slide into soft introductory chords He isn t to blame for not liking what he calls our lost spirits that wail It s just the way he s made Arkwright vouchsafed no reply With an abrupt gesture he turned and began to pace the room moodily At the piano Alice slipped from the chords into the nocturne She played it straight through then with a charm and skill that brought Arkwright s feet to a pause before it was half finished By George that s great he breathed when the last tone had quivered into silence Yes isn t it beautiful she murmured The room was very quiet and in semi darkness The last rays of a late June sunset had been filling the room with golden light but it was gone now Even at the piano by the window Alice had barely been able to see clearly enough to read the notes of her nocturne To Arkwright the air still trembled with the exquisite melody that had but just left her fingers A quick fire came to his eyes He forgot everything but that it was Alice there in the half light by the window Alice whom he loved With a low cry he took a swift step toward her Alice Instantly the girl was on her feet But it was not toward him that she turned It was away resolutely and with a haste that was strangely like terror Alice too had forgotten for just a moment She had let herself drift into a dream world where there was nothing but the music she was playing and the man she loved Then the music had stopped and the man had spoken her name Alice remembered then She remembered Billy whom this man loved She remembered the long days just passed when this man had stayed away presumably to teach her to save her And now at the sound of his voice speaking her name she had almost bared her heart to him No wonder that Alice with a haste that looked like terror crossed the floor and flooded the room with light Dear me she shivered carefully avoiding Arkwright s eyes If mister Calderwell were here now he d have some excuse to talk about our lost spirits that wail That is a creepy piece of music when you play it in the dark And for fear that he should suspect how her heart was aching she gave a particularly brilliant and joyous smile Once again at the mention of Calderwell s name Arkwright stiffened perceptibly The fire left his eyes For a moment he did not speak then gravely he said Calderwell Yes perhaps he would and you ought to be a judge I should think You see him quite frequently don t you Why yes of course He often comes out here you know Yes I had heard that he did since you came His meaning was unmistakable Alice looked up quickly A prompt denial of his implication was on her lips when the thought came to her that perhaps just here lay a sure way to prove to this man before her that there was indeed no need for him to teach her to save her or yet to sympathize with her She could not affirm of course but she need not deny yet Nonsense she laughed lightly pleased that she could feel what she hoped would pass for a telltale color burning her cheeks Come let us try some duets she proposed leading the way to the piano And Arkwright interpreting the apparently embarrassed change of subject exactly as she had hoped that he would interpret it followed her sick at heart O wert thou in the cauld blast sang Arkwright s lips a few moments later I can t tell her now when I know she cares for Calderwell gloomily ran his thoughts the while It would do no possible good and would only make her unhappy to grieve me O wert thou in the cauld blast chimed in Alice s alto low and sweet I reckon now he won t be staying away from here any more just to save me ran Alice s thoughts palpitatingly triumphant CHAPTER XXI BILLY TAKES HER TURN AT QUESTIONING Arkwright did not call to see Alice Greggory for some days He did not want to see Alice now He told himself wearily that she could not help him fight this tiger skin that lay across his path The very fact of her presence by his side would indeed incapacitate himself for fighting So he deliberately stayed away from the Annex until the day before he sailed for Germany Then he went out to say good by Chagrined as he was at what he termed his imbecile stupidity in not knowing his own heart all these past months and convinced as he also was that Alice and Calderwell cared for each other he could see no way for him but to play the part of a man of kindliness and honor leaving a clear field for his preferred rival and bringing no shadow of regret to mar the happiness of the girl he loved As for being his old easy frank self on this last call however that was impossible so Alice found plenty of fuel for her still burning fires of suspicion fires which had indeed blazed up anew at this second long period of absence on the part of Arkwright Naturally therefore the call was anything but a joy and comfort to either one Arkwright was nervous gloomy and abnormally gay by turns Alice was nervous and abnormally gay all the time Then they said good by and Arkwright went away He sailed the next day and Alice settled down to the summer of study and hard work she had laid out for herself On the tenth of September Billy came home She was brown plump cheeked and smiling She declared that she had had a perfectly beautiful time and that there couldn t be anything in the world nicer than the trip she and Bertram had taken just they two together In answer to Aunt Hannah s solicitous inquiries she asserted that she was all well and rested now But there was a vaguely troubled questioning in her eyes that Aunt Hannah did not quite like Aunt Hannah however said nothing even to Billy herself about this One of the first friends Billy saw after her return was Hugh Calderwell As it happened Bertram was out when he came so Billy had the first half hour of the call to herself She was not sorry for this as it gave her a chance to question Calderwell a little concerning Alice Greggory something she had long ago determined to do at the first opportunity Now tell me everything everything about everybody she began diplomatically settling herself comfortably for a good visit Thank you I m well and have had a passably agreeable summer barring the heat sundry persistent mosquitoes several grievous disappointments and a felon on my thumb he began with shameless imperturbability I have been to Revere once to the circus once to Nantasket three times and to Keith s and the movies ten times perhaps to be accurate I have also But perhaps there was some one else you desired to inquire for he broke off turning upon his hostess a bland but unsmiling countenance Oh no how could there be twinkled Billy Really Hugh I always knew you had a pretty good opinion of yourself but I didn t credit you with thinking you were everybody Go on I m so interested Hugh chuckled softly but there was a plaintive tone in his voice as he answered Thanks no I ve rather lost my interest now Lack of appreciation always did discourage me We ll talk of something else please You enjoyed your trip Very much It just couldn t have been nicer You were lucky The heat here has been something fierce What made you stay Reasons too numerous and one too heart breaking to mention Besides you forget with dignity There is my profession I have joined the workers of the world now you know Oh fudge Hugh laughed Billy You know very well you re as likely as not to start for the ends of the earth to morrow morning Hugh drew himself up I don t seem to succeed in making people understand that I m serious he began aggrievedly I With an expressive flourish of his hands he relaxed suddenly and fell back in his chair A slow smile came to his lips Well Billy I ll give up You ve hit it he confessed I have thought seriously of starting to morrow morning for half way to the ends of the earth Panama Hugh Well I have Even this call was to be a good by if I went Oh Hugh But I really thought in spite of my teasing that you had settled down this time Yes so did I sighed the man a little soberly But I guess it s no use Billy Oh I m coming back of course and link arms again with their worthy Highnesses John Doe and Richard Roe but just now I ve got a restless fit on me I want to see the wheels go round Of course if I had my bread and butter and cigars to earn twould be different But I haven t and I know I haven t and I suspect that s where the trouble lies If it wasn t for those natal silver spoons of mine that Bertram is always talking about things might be different But the spoons are there and always have been and I know they re all ready to dish out mountains to climb and lakes to paddle in any time I ve a mind to say the word So I just say the word That s all And you ve said it now Yes I think so for a while And those reasons that have kept you here all summer ventured Billy they aren t in er commission any longer No Billy hesitated regarding her companion meditatively Then with the feeling that she had followed a blind alley to its termination she retreated and made a fresh start Well you haven t yet told me everything about everybody you know she hinted smilingly You might begin that I mean the less important everybodies of course now that I ve heard about you Meaning Oh Aunt Hannah and the Greggorys and Cyril and Marie and the twins and mister Arkwright and all the rest But you ve had letters surely Yes I ve had letters from some of them and I ve seen most of them since I came back It s just that I wanted to know your viewpoint of what s happened through the summer Very well Aunt Hannah is as dear as ever wears just as many shawls and still keeps her clock striking twelve when it s half past eleven missus Greggory is just as sweet as ever and a little more frail I fear bless her heart mister Arkwright is still abroad as I presume you know I hear he is doing great stunts over there and will sing in Berlin and Paris this winter I m thinking of going across from Panama later If I do I shall look him up mister and missus Cyril are as well as could be expected when you realize that they haven t yet settled on a pair of names for the twins I know it and the poor little things three months old too I think it s a shame You ve heard the reason I suppose Cyril declares that naming babies is one of the most serious and delicate operations in the world and that for his part he thinks people ought to select their own names when they ve arrived at years of discretion He wants to wait till the twins are eighteen and then make each of them a birthday present of the name of their own choosing Well if that isn t the limit laughed Calderwell I d heard some such thing before but I hadn t supposed it was really so Well it is He says he knows more tomboys and enormous fat women named Grace and Lily and sweet little mouse like ladies staggering along under a sonorous Jerusha Theodosia or Zenobia Jane and that if he should name the boys Franz and Felix after Schubert and Mendelssohn as Marie wants to they d as likely as not turn out to be men who hated the sound of music and doted on stocks and dry goods Humph grunted Calderwell I saw Cyril last week and he said he hadn t named the twins yet but he didn t tell me why I offered him two perfectly good names myself but he didn t seem interested What were they Eldad and Bildad Hugh protested Billy Well why not bridled the man I m sure those are new and unique and really musical too way ahead of your Franz and Felix But those aren t really names Indeed they are Where did you get them Off our family tree though they re Bible names Belle says Perhaps you didn t know but Sister Belle has been making the dirt fly quite lively of late around that family tree of ours and she wrote me some of her discoveries It seems two of the roots or branches say are ancestors roots or branches were called Eldad and Bildad Now I thought those names were good enough to pass along but as I said before Cyril wasn t interested I should say not laughed Billy But honestly Hugh it s really serious Marie wants them named something but she doesn t say much to Cyril Marie wouldn t really breathe you know if she thought Cyril disapproved of breathing And in this case Cyril does not hesitate to declare that the boys shall name themselves What a situation laughed Calderwell Isn t it But do you know I can sympathize with it in a way for I ve always mourned so over my name Billy was always such a trial to me Poor Uncle William wasn t the only one that prepared guns and fishing rods to entertain the expected boy I don t know though I m afraid if I d been allowed to select my name I should have been a Helen Clarabella all my days for that was the name I gave all my dolls with first second third and so on added to them for distinction Evidently I thought that Helen Clarabella was the most feminine appellation possible and the most foreign to the despised Billy So you see I can sympathize with Cyril to a certain extent But they must call the little chaps something now argued Hugh Billy gave a sudden merry laugh They do she gurgled and that s the funniest part of it Oh Cyril doesn t He always calls them impersonally they or it He doesn t see much of them anyway now I understand Marie was horrified when she realized how the nurses had been using his den as a nursery annex and she changed all that instanter when she took charge of things again The twins stay in the nursery now I m told But about the names the nurses it seems have got into the way of calling them Dot and Dimple One has a dimple in his cheek and the other is a little smaller of the two Marie is no end distressed particularly as she finds that she herself calls them that and she says the idea of boys being Dot and Dimple I should say so laughed Calderwell Not I regard that as worse than my Eldad and Bildad I know it and Alice says By the way you haven t mentioned Alice but I suppose you see her occasionally Billy paused in evident expectation of a reply Billy was in fact quite pluming herself on the adroit casualness with which she had introduced the subject nearest her heart Calderwell raised his eyebrows Oh yes I see her But you hadn t mentioned her There was the briefest of pauses then with a half quizzical dejection there came the remark You seem to forget I told you that I stayed here this summer for reasons too numerous and one too heart breaking to mention She was the one You mean Yes The usual thing She turned me down Oh I haven t asked her yet as many times as I did you but Hugh Hugh tossed her a grim smile and went on imperturbably I m older now of course and know more perhaps Besides the finality of her remarks was not to be mistaken Billy in spite of her sympathy for Calderwell was conscious of a throb of relief that at least one stumbling block was removed from Arkwright s possible pathway to Alice s heart Did she give any special reason hazarded Billy a shade too anxiously Oh yes She said she wasn t going to marry anybody only her music Nonsense ejaculated Billy falling back in her chair a little Yes I said that too gloomed the man but it didn t do any good You see I had known another girl who d said the same thing once He did not look up but a vivid red flamed suddenly into Billy s cheeks And she when the right one came forgot all about the music and married the man So I naturally suspected that Alice would do the same thing In fact I said so to her I was bold enough to even call the man by name I hadn t been jealous of Arkwright for nothing you see but she denied it and flew into such an indignant allegation that there wasn t a word of truth in it that I had to sue for pardon before I got anything like peace Oh h said Billy in a disappointed voice falling quite back in her chair this time And so that s why I m wanting especially just now to see the wheels go round smiled Calderwell a little wistfully Oh I shall get over it I suppose It isn t the first time I ll own but some day I take it there will be a last time Enough of this however You haven t told me a thing about yourself How about it When I come back are you going to give me a dinner cooked by your own fair hands Going to still play Bridget Billy laughed and shook her head No far from it Eliza has come back and her cousin from Vermont is coming as second girl to help her But I could cook a dinner for you if I had to now sir and it wouldn t be potato mush and cold lamb she bragged shamelessly as there sounded Bertram s peculiar ring and the click of his key in the lock It was the next afternoon that Billy called on Marie From Marie s Billy went to the Annex which was very near Cyril s new house and there in Aunt Hannah s room she had what she told Bertram afterwards was a perfectly lovely visit Aunt Hannah too enjoyed the visit very much though yet there was one thing that disturbed her the vaguely troubled look in Billy s eyes which to day was more apparent than ever Not until just before Billy went home did something occur to give Aunt Hannah a possible clue as to what was the meaning of it That something was a question from Billy Aunt Hannah why don t I feel like Marie did why don t I feel like everybody does in books and stories Marie went around with such a detached heavenly absorbed look in her eyes before the twins came to her home But I don t I don t find anything like that in my face when I look in the glass And I don t feel detached and absorbed and heavenly I m happy of course but I can t help thinking of the dear dear times Bertram and I have together just we two and I can t seem to imagine it at all with a third person around Billy Third person indeed There I knew twould shock you mourned Billy It shocks me I want to feel detached and heavenly and absorbed But Billy dear think of it calling your own baby a third person Billy sighed despairingly Yes I know And I suppose I might as well own up to the rest of it too I I m actually afraid of babies Aunt Hannah Well I am she reiterated in answer to Aunt Hannah s gasp of disapproval I m not used to them at all I never had any little brothers and sisters and I don t know how to treat babies I I m always afraid they ll break or something I m just as afraid of the twins as I can be How Marie can handle them and toss them about as she does I don t see Toss them about indeed Well it looks that way to me sighed Billy Anyhow I know I can never get to handle them like that and that s no way to feel And I m ashamed of myself because I can t be detached and heavenly and absorbed she added rising to go Everybody always is it seems but just me Fiddlededee my dear scoffed Aunt Hannah patting Billy s downcast face Wait till a year from now and we ll see about that third person bugaboo you re worrying about I m not worrying now so you d better not CHAPTER XXII A DOT AND A DIMPLE On the day Cyril Henshaw s twins were six months old a momentous occurrence marked the date with a flaming red letter of remembrance and it all began with a baby s smile Cyril in quest of his wife at about ten o clock that morning and not finding her pursued his search even to the nursery a room he very seldom entered Cyril did not like to go into the nursery He felt ill at ease and as if he were away from home and Cyril was known to abhor being away from home since he was married Now that Marie had taken over the reins of government again he had been obliged to see very little of those strange women and babies Not but that he liked the babies of course They were his sons and he was proud of them They should have every advantage that college special training and travel could give them He quite anticipated what they would be to him when they really knew anything But of course now when they could do nothing but cry and wave their absurd little fists and wobble their heads in so fearsome a manner as if they simply did not know the meaning of the word backbone and for that matter of course they didn t why he could not be expected to be anything but relieved when he had his den to himself again with a reasonable chance of finding his manuscript as he had left it and not cut up into a ridiculous string of paper dolls holding hands as he had once found it after a visit from a woman with a small girl Since Marie had been at the helm however he had not been troubled in such a way He had indeed known almost his old customary peace and freedom from interruption with only an occasional flitting across his path of the strange women and babies though he had realized of course that they were in the house especially in the nursery For that reason therefore he always avoided the nursery when possible But to day he wanted his wife and his wife was not to be found anywhere else in the house So reluctantly he turned his steps toward the nursery and with a frown knocked and pushed open the door Is missus Henshaw here he demanded not over gently Absolute silence greeted his question The man saw then that there was no one in the room save a baby sitting on a mat in the middle of the floor barricaded on all sides with pillows With a deeper frown the man turned to go when a gleeful Ah goo halted his steps midway He wheeled sharply Er eh he queried uncertainly eyeing his small son on the floor Ah goo observed the infant who had been very lonesome with greater emphasis and this time he sent into his father s eyes the most bewitching of smiles Well by George murmured the man weakly a dawning amazement driving the frown from his face Spgggh oo wah gurgled the boy holding out two tiny fists A slow smile came to the man s face Well I ll be darned he muttered half shamefacedly wholly delightedly If the rascal doesn t act as if he knew me Ah goo spggghh grinned the infant toothlessly but entrancingly With almost a stealthy touch Cyril closed the door back of him and advanced a little dubiously toward his son His countenance carried a mixture of guilt curiosity and dogged determination so ludicrous that it was a pity none but baby eyes could see it As if to meet more nearly on a level this baffling new acquaintance Cyril got to his knees somewhat stiffly it must be confessed and faced his son Goo eee ooo yah crowed the baby now thrashing legs and arms about in a transport of joy at the acquisition of this new playmate Well well young man you you don t say so stammered the growingly proud father thrusting a plainly timid and unaccustomed finger toward his offspring So you do know me eh Well who am I Da da gurgled the boy triumphantly clutching the outstretched finger and holding on with a tenacity that brought a gleeful chuckle to the lips of the man Jove but aren t you the strong little beggar though Needn t tell me you don t know a good thing when you see it So I m da da am I he went on unhesitatingly accepting as the pure gold of knowledge the shameless imitation vocabulary his son was foisting upon him Well I expect I am and Oh Cyril The door had opened and Marie was in the room If she gave a start of surprise at her husband s unaccustomed attitude she quickly controlled herself Julia said you wanted me I must have been going down the back stairs when you came up the front and Please missus Henshaw is it Dot you have in here or Dimple asked a new voice as the second nurse entered by another door Before missus Henshaw could answer Cyril who had got to his feet turned sharply Is it who he demanded Oh Oh mister Henshaw stammered the girl I beg your pardon I didn t know you were here It was only that I wanted to know which baby it was We thought we had Dot with us until Dot Dimple exploded the man Do you mean to say you have given my sons the ridiculous names of Dot and Dimple Why no yes well that is we had to call them something faltered the nurse as with a despairing glance at her mistress she plunged through the doorway Cyril turned to his wife Marie what is the meaning of this he demanded Why Cyril dear don t don t get so wrought up she begged It s only as Mary said we had to call them something and Wrought up indeed interrupted Cyril savagely Who wouldn t be Dot and Dimple Great Scott One would think those boys were a couple of kittens or puppies that they didn t know anything didn t have any brains But they have if the other is anything like this one at least he declared pointing to his son on the floor who at this opportune moment joined in the conversation to the extent of an appropriate Ah goo da da There hear that will you triumphed the father What did I tell you That s the way he s been going on ever since I came into the room The little rascal knows me so soon Marie clapped her fingers to her lips and turned her back suddenly with a spasmodic little cough but her husband if he noticed the interruption paid no heed Dot and Dimple indeed he went on wrathfully That settles it We ll name those boys to day Marie to day Not once again will I let the sun go down on a Dot and a Dimple under my roof Marie turned with a quick little cry of happiness Oh Cyril I m so glad I ve so wanted to have them named you know And shall we call them Franz and Felix as we d talked Franz Felix John James Paul Charles anything so it s sane and sensible I d even adopt Calderwell s absurd Bildad and er Tomdad or whatever it was rather than have those poor little chaps insulted a day longer with a Dot and a Dimple Great Scott And entirely forgetting what he had come to the nursery for Cyril strode from the room Ah goo spggggh commented baby from the middle of the floor It was on a very windy March day that Bertram Henshaw s son Bertram junior arrived at the Strata Billy went so far into the Valley of the Shadow of Death for her baby that it was some days before she realized in all its importance the presence of the new member of her family Even when the days had become weeks and Bertram junior was a month and a half old the extreme lassitude and weariness of his young mother was a source of ever growing anxiety to her family and friends Billy was so unlike herself they all said If something could only rouse her suggested the Henshaw s old family physician one day A certain sort of mental shock if not too severe would do the deed I think and with no injury only benefit Her physical condition is in just the state that needs a stimulus to stir it into new life and vigor As it happened this was said on a certain Monday Two days later Bertram s sister Kate on her way with her husband to mister Hartwell s old home in Vermont stopped over in Boston for a two days visit She made her headquarters at Cyril s home but very naturally she went without much delay to pay her respects to Bertram junior mister Hartwell s brother isn t well she explained to Billy after the greetings were over You know he s the only one left there since Mother and Father Hartwell came West We shall go right on up to Vermont in a couple of days but we just had to stay over long enough to see the baby and we hadn t ever seen the twins either you know By the way how perfectly ridiculous Cyril is over those boys Is he smiled Billy faintly Yes One would think there were never any babies born before to hear him talk He thinks they re the most wonderful things in the world and they are cunning little fellows I ll admit But Cyril thinks they know so much went on Kate laughingly He s always bragging of something one or the other of them has done Think of it Cyril Marie says it all started from the time last January when he discovered the nurses had been calling them Dot and Dimple Yes I know smiled Billy again faintly lifting a thin white very un Billy like hand to her head Kate frowned and regarded her sister in law thoughtfully Mercy how you look Billy she exclaimed with cheerful tactlessness They said you did but I declare you look worse than I thought Billy s pale face reddened perceptibly Nonsense It s just that I m so so tired she insisted I shall be all right soon How did you leave the children Well and happy specially little Kate because mother was going away Kate is mistress you know when I m gone and she takes herself very seriously Mistress A little thing like her Why she can t be more than ten or eleven murmured Billy She isn t She was ten last month But you d think she was forty the airs she gives herself sometimes Oh of course there s Nora and the cook and Miss Winton the governess there to really manage things and Mother Hartwell is just around the corner but little Kate thinks she s managing so she s happy Billy suppressed a smile Billy was thinking that little Kate came naturally by at least one of her traits Really that child is impossible sometimes resumed missus Hartwell with a sigh You know the absurd things she was always saying two or three years ago when we came on to Cyril s wedding Yes I remember Well I thought she would get over it But she doesn t She s worse if anything and sometimes her insight or intuition or whatever you may call it is positively uncanny I never know what she s going to remark next when I take her anywhere but it s safe to say whatever it is it ll be unexpected and usually embarrassing to somebody And is that the baby broke off missus Hartwell as a cooing laugh and a woman s voice came from the next room Yes The nurse has just brought him in I think said Billy Then I ll go right now and see him rejoined Kate rising to her feet and hurrying into the next room Left alone Billy lay back wearily in her reclining chair She wondered why Kate always tired her so She wished she had had on her blue kimono then perhaps Kate would not have thought she looked so badly Blue was always more becoming to her than Billy turned her head suddenly From the next room had come Kate s clear cut decisive voice Oh no I don t think he looks a bit like his father That little snubby nose was never the Henshaw nose Billy drew in her breath sharply and pulled herself half erect in her chair From the next room came Kate s voice again after a low murmur from the nurse Oh but he isn t I tell you He isn t one bit of a Henshaw baby The Henshaw babies are always pretty ones They have more hair and they look well different Billy gave a low cry and struggled to her feet Oh no spoke up Kate in answer to another indistinct something from the nurse I don t think he s near as pretty as the twins Of course the twins are a good deal older but they have such a bright look and they did have from the very first I saw it in their tiniest baby pictures But this baby This baby is mine please cut in a tremulous but resolute voice and missus Hartwell turned to confront Bertram junior s mother manifestly weak and trembling but no less manifestly blazing eyed and determined Why Billy expostulated missus Hartwell as Billy stumbled forward and snatched the child into her arms Perhaps he doesn t look like the Henshaw babies Perhaps he isn t as pretty as the twins Perhaps he hasn t much hair and does have a snub nose He s my baby just the same and I shall not stay calmly by and see him abused Besides I think he s prettier than the twins ever thought of being and he s got all the hair I want him to have and his nose is just exactly what a baby s nose ought to be And with a superb gesture Billy turned and bore the baby away CHAPTER XXIII BILLY AND THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY When the doctor heard from the nurse of missus Hartwell s visit and what had come of it he only gave a discreet smile as befitted himself and the occasion but to his wife privately that night the doctor said when he had finished telling the story And I couldn t have prescribed a better pill if I d tried Pill missus Hartwell Oh Harold reproved the doctor s wife mildly But the doctor only chuckled the more and said You wait and see If Billy s friends were worried before because of her lassitude and lack of ambition they were almost as worried now over her amazing alertness and insistent activity Day by day almost hour by hour she seemed to gain in strength and every bit she acquired she promptly tested almost to the breaking point so plainly eager was she to be well and strong And always from morning until night and again from night until morning the pivot of her existence around which swung all thoughts words actions and plans was the sturdy little plump cheeked firm fleshed atom of humanity known as Bertram junior Even Aunt Hannah remonstrated with her at last But Billy dear she exclaimed one would almost get the idea that you thought there wasn t a thing in the world but that baby Billy laughed Well do you know sometimes I most think there isn t she retorted unblushingly Billy protested Aunt Hannah then a little severely she demanded And who was it that just last September was calling this same only object in the world a third person in your home Third person indeed Aunt Hannah did I Did I really say such a dreadful thing as that But I didn t know then of course I couldn t know how perfectly wonderful a baby is especially such a baby as Bertram junior is Why Aunt Hannah that little thing knows a whole lot already He s known me for weeks I know he has And ages and ages ago he began to give me little smiles when he saw me They were smiles real smiles Oh yes I know nurse said they weren t smiles at the first admitted Billy in answer to Aunt Hannah s doubting expression I know nurse said it was only wind on his stomach Think of it wind on his stomach Just as if I didn t know the difference between my own baby s smile and wind on his stomach And you don t know how soon he began to follow my moving finger with his eyes Yes I tried that one day I remember observed Aunt Hannah demurely I moved my finger He looked at the ceiling fixedly Well probably he wanted to look at the ceiling then defended the young mother promptly I m sure I wouldn t give a snap for a baby if he didn t sometimes have a mind of his own and exercise it Oh Billy Billy laughed Aunt Hannah with a shake of her head as Billy turned away chin uptilted By the time Bertram junior was three months old Billy was unmistakably her old happy merry self strong and well Affairs at the Strata once more were moving as by clockwork only this time it was a baby s hand that set the clock and that wound it too Billy told her husband very earnestly that now they had entered upon a period of Enormous Responsibility The Life Character and Destiny of a Human Soul was intrusted to their care and they must be Wise Faithful and Efficient They must be at once Proud and Humble at this their Great Opportunity They must Observe Learn and Practice First and foremost in their eyes must always be this wonderful Important Trust Bertram laughed at first very heartily at Billy s instructions which he declared were so bristling with capitals that he could fairly see them drop from her lips Then when he found how really very much in earnest she was and how hurt she was at his levity he managed to pull his face into something like sobriety while she talked to him though he did persist in dropping kisses on her cheeks her chin her finger tips her hair and the little pink lobes of her ears just by way of punctuation to her sentences he said And he told her that he wasn t really slighting her lips only that they moved so fast he could not catch them Whereat Billy pouted and told him severely that he was a bad naughty boy and that he did not deserve to be the father of the dearest most wonderful baby in the world No I know I don t beamed Bertram with cheerful unrepentance but I am just the same he finished triumphantly And this time he contrived to find his wife s lips Oh Bertram sighed Billy despairingly You re an old dear of course and one just can t be cross with you but you don t you just don t realize your Immense Responsibility Oh yes I do maintained Bertram so seriously that even Billy herself almost believed him In spite of his assertions however it must be confessed that Bertram was much more inclined to regard the new member of his family as just his son rather than as an Important Trust and there is little doubt that he liked to toss him in the air and hear his gleeful crows of delight without any bother of Observing him at all As to the Life and Character and Destiny intrusted to his care it is to be feared that Bertram just plain gloried in his son poked him in the ribs and chuckled him under the chin whenever he pleased and gave never so much as a thought to Character and Destiny It is to be feared too that he was Proud without being Humble and that the only Opportunity he really appreciated was the chance to show off his wife and baby to some less fortunate fellow man But not so Billy Billy joined a Mothers Club and entered a class in Child Training with an elaborate system of Charts Rules and Tests She subscribed to each new Mothers Helper and the like that she came across devouring each and every one with an eagerness that was tempered only by a vague uneasiness at finding so many differences of opinion among Those Who Knew Undeniably Billy if not Bertram was indeed realizing the Enormous Responsibility and was keeping ever before her the Important Trust In June Bertram took a cottage at the South Shore and by the time the really hot weather arrived the family were well settled It was only an hour away from Boston and easy of access but William said he guessed he would not go he would stay in Boston sleeping at the house and getting his meals at the club until the middle of July when he was going down in Maine for his usual fishing trip which he had planned to take a little earlier than usual this year But you ll be so lonesome Uncle William Billy demurred in this great house all alone Oh no I sha n t rejoined Uncle William I shall only be sleeping here you know he finished with a slightly peculiar smile It was well perhaps that Billy did not exactly realize the significance of that smile nor the unconscious emphasis on the word sleeping for it would have troubled her not a little William to tell the truth was quite anticipating that sleeping William s nights had not been exactly restful since the baby came His evenings too had not been the peaceful things they were wont to be Some of Billy s Rules and Tests were strenuously objected to on the part of her small son and the young man did not hesitate to show it Billy said that it was good for the baby to cry that it developed his lungs but William was very sure that it was not good for him Certainly when the baby did cry William never could help hovering near the center of disturbance and he always had to remind Billy that it might be a pin you know or some cruel thing that was hurting As if he William a great strong man could sit calmly by and smoke a pipe or lie in his comfortable bed and sleep while that blessed little baby was crying his heart out like that Of course if one did not know he was crying Hence William s anticipation of those quiet restful nights when he could not know it Very soon after Billy s arrival at the cottage Aunt Hannah and Alice Greggory came down for a day s visit Aunt Hannah had been away from Boston for several weeks so it was some time since she had seen the baby My but hasn t he grown she exclaimed picking the baby up and stooping to give him a snuggling kiss The next instant she almost dropped the little fellow so startling had been Billy s cry No no wait Aunt Hannah please Billy was entreating hurrying to the little corner cupboard In a moment she was back with a small bottle and a bit of antiseptic cotton We always sterilize our lips now before we kiss him it s so much safer you know Aunt Hannah sat down limply the baby still in her arms Fiddlededee Billy What an absurd idea What have you got in that bottle Why Aunt Hannah it s just a little simple listerine bridled Billy and it isn t absurd at all It s very sensible My Hygienic Guide for Mothers says Well I suppose I may kiss his hand interposed Aunt Hannah just a little curtly without subjecting myself to a City Hospital treatment Billy laughed shamefacedly but she still held her ground No you can t nor even his foot He might get them in his mouth Aunt Hannah why does a baby think that everything from his own toes to his father s watch fob and the plush balls on a caller s wrist bag is made to eat As if I could sterilize everything and keep him from getting hold of germs somewhere You ll have to have a germ proof room for him laughed Alice Greggory playfully snapping her fingers at the baby in Aunt Hannah s lap Billy turned eagerly Oh did you read about that too she cried I thought it was so interesting and I wondered if I could do it Alice stared frankly You don t mean to say they actually have such things she challenged Well I read about them in a magazine asserted Billy how you could have a germ proof room They said it was very simple too Just pasteurize the air you know by heating it to one hundred and ten and one half degrees Fahrenheit for seventeen and one half minutes I remember just the figures Simple indeed It sounds so scoffed Aunt Hannah with uplifted eyebrows Oh well I couldn t do it of course admitted Billy regretfully Bertram never d stand for that in the world He s always rushing in to show the baby off to every Tom Dick and Harry and his wife that comes and of course if you opened the nursery door that would let in those germ things and you couldn t very well pasteurize your callers by heating them to one hundred and ten and one half degrees for seventeen and one half minutes I don t see how you could manage such a room anyway unless you had a system of of rooms like locks same as they do for water in canals Oh my grief and conscience locks indeed almost groaned Aunt Hannah Here Alice will you please take this child that is if you have a germ proof certificate about you to show to his mother I want to take off my bonnet and gloves Take him Of course I ll take him laughed Alice and right under his mother s nose too she added with a playful grimace at Billy And we ll make pat a cakes and send the little pigs to market and have such a beautiful time that we ll forget there ever was such a thing in the world as an old germ Eh babykins Babykins cooed his unqualified approval of this plan but his mother looked troubled That s all right Alice You may play with him she frowned doubtfully but you mustn t do it long you know not over five minutes Five minutes Well I like that when I ve come all the way from Boston purposely to see him pouted Alice What s the matter now Time for his nap Oh no not for thirteen minutes replied Billy consulting the watch at her belt But we never play with Baby more than five minutes at a time My Scientific Care of Infants says it isn t wise that with some babies it s positively dangerous until after they re six months old It makes them nervous and forces their mind you know she explained anxiously So of course we d want to be careful Bertram junior isn t quite four yet Why yes of course murmured Alice politely stopping a pat a cake before it was half baked The infant as if suspecting that he was being deprived of his lawful baby rights began to fret and whimper Poor itty sing crooned Aunt Hannah who having divested herself of bonnet and gloves came hurriedly forward with outstretched hands Do they just buse em Come here to your old auntie sweetems and we ll go walkee I saw a bow wow such a tunnin ickey wickey bow wow on the steps when I came in Come we go see ickey wickey bow wow Aunt Hannah please protested Billy both hands upraised in horror Won t you say dog and leave out that dreadful ickey wickey Of course he can t understand things now really but we never know when he ll begin to and we aren t ever going to let him hear baby talk at all if we can help it And truly when you come to think of it it is absurd to expect a child to talk sensibly and rationally on the mental diet of moo moos and choo choos served out to them Our Professor of Metaphysics and Ideology in our Child Study Course says that nothing is so receptive and plastic as the Mind of a Little Child and that it is perfectly appalling how we fill it with trivial absurdities that haven t even the virtue of being accurate So that s why we re trying to be so careful with Baby You didn t mind my speaking I know Aunt Hannah Oh no of course not Billy retorted Aunt Hannah a little tartly and with a touch of sarcasm most unlike her gentle self I m sure I shouldn t wish to fill this infant s plastic mind with anything so appalling as trivial inaccuracies May I be pardoned for suggesting however she went on as the baby s whimper threatened to become a lusty wail that this young gentleman cries as if he were sleepy and hungry Yes he is admitted Billy Well doesn t your system of scientific training allow him to be given such trivial absurdities as food and naps inquired the lady mildly Of course it does Aunt Hannah retorted Billy laughing in spite of herself And it s almost time now There are only a few more minutes to wait Few more minutes to wait indeed scorned Aunt Hannah I suppose the poor little fellow might cry and cry and you wouldn t set that clock ahead by a teeny weeny minute Certainly not said the young mother decisively My Daily Guide for Mothers says that a time for everything and everything in its time is the very A B C and whole alphabet of Right Training He does everything by the clock and to the minute declared Billy proudly Aunt Hannah sniffed obviously skeptical and rebellious Alice Greggory laughed Aunt Hannah looks as if she d like to bring down her clock that strikes half an hour ahead she said mischievously but Aunt Hannah did not deign to answer this How long do you rock him she demanded of Billy I suppose I may do that mayn t I Mercy I don t rock him at all Aunt Hannah exclaimed Billy Nor sing to him Certainly not But you did before I went away I remember that you did Yes I know I did admitted Billy and I had an awful time too Some evenings every single one of us even to Uncle William had to try before we could get him off to sleep But that was before I got my Efficiency of Mother and Child or my Scientific Training and oh lots of others You see I didn t know a thing then and I loved to rock him so I did it though the nurse said it wasn t good for him but I didn t believe her I ve had an awful time changing but I ve done it I just put him in his little crib or his carriage and after a while he goes to sleep Sometimes now he doesn t cry hardly any I m afraid to day though he will she worried Yes I m afraid he will almost screamed Aunt Hannah in order to make herself heard above Bertram junior who by this time was voicing his opinion of matters and things in no uncertain manner It was not after all so very long before peace and order reigned and in due course Bertram junior in his carriage lay fast asleep Then while Aunt Hannah went to Billy s room for a short rest Billy and Alice went out on to the wide veranda which faced the wonderful expanse of sky and sea Now tell me of yourself commanded Billy almost at once It s been ages since I ve heard or seen a thing of you There s nothing to tell Nonsense But there must be insisted Billy You know it s months since I ve seen anything of you hardly I know We feel quite neglected at the Annex said Alice But I don t go anywhere defended Billy I can t There isn t time Even to bring us the extra happiness smiled Alice A quick change came to Billy s face Her eyes glowed deeply No though I ve had so much that ought to have gone such loads and loads of extra happiness which I couldn t possibly use myself Sometimes I m so happy Alice that that I m just frightened It doesn t seem as if anybody ought to be so happy Oh Billy dear demurred Alice her eyes filling suddenly with tears Well I ve got the Annex I m glad I ve got that for the overflow anyway resumed Billy trying to steady her voice I ve sent a whole lot of happiness up there mentally if I haven t actually carried it so I m sure you must have got it Now tell me of yourself There s nothing to tell insisted Alice as before You re working as hard as ever Yes harder New pupils Yes and some concert engagements good ones for next season Accompaniments you know Billy nodded Yes I ve heard of you already twice lately in that line and very flatteringly too Have you Well that s good Hm m There was a moment s silence then abruptly Billy changed the subject I had a letter from Belle Calderwell yesterday She paused expectantly but there was no comment You don t seem interested she frowned after a minute Alice laughed Pardon me but I don t know the Lady you see Was it a good letter You know her brother Very true Alice s cheeks showed a deeper color Did she say anything of him Yes She said he was coming back to Boston next winter Indeed Yes She says that this time he declares he really is going to settle down to work murmured Billy demurely with a sidelong glance at her companion She says he s engaged to be married one of her friends over there There was no reply Alice appeared to be absorbed in watching a tiny white sail far out at sea Again Billy was silent Then with studied carelessness she said Yes and you know mister Arkwright too She told of him Yes Well what of him Alice s voice was studiedly indifferent Oh there was quite a lot of him Belle had just been to hear him sing and then her brother had introduced him to her She thinks he s perfectly wonderful in every way I should judge In fact she simply raved over him It seems that while we ve been hearing nothing from him all winter he s been winning no end of laurels for himself in Paris and Berlin He s been studying too of course as well as singing and now he s got a chance to sing somewhere create a role or something Belle said she wasn t quite clear on the matter herself but it was a perfectly splendid chance and one that was a fine feather in his cap Then he won t be coming home that is to Boston at all this winter probably said Alice with a cheerfulness that sounded just a little forced Not until February But he is coming then He s been engaged for six performances with the Boston Opera Company as a star tenor mind you Isn t that splendid Indeed it is murmured Alice Belle writes that Hugh says he s improved wonderfully and that even he can see that his singing is marvelous He says Paris is wild over him but for my part I wish he d come home and stay here where he belongs finished Billy a bit petulantly Why why Billy murmured her friend a curiously startled look coming into her eyes Well I do maintained Billy then recklessly she added I had such beautiful plans for him once Alice Oh if you only could have cared for him you d have made such a splendid couple A vivid scarlet flew to Alice s face Nonsense she cried getting quickly to her feet and bending over one of the flower boxes along the veranda railing mister Arkwright never thought of marrying me and I m not going to marry anybody but my music Billy sighed despairingly I know that s what you say now but if She stopped abruptly Around the turn of the veranda had appeared Aunt Hannah wheeling Bertram junior still asleep in his carriage I came out the other door she explained softly And it was so lovely I just had to go in and get the baby I thought it would be so nice for him to finish his nap out here Billy arose with a troubled frown But Aunt Hannah he mustn t he can t stay out here I m sorry but we ll have to take him back Aunt Hannah s eyes grew mutinous But I thought the outdoor air was just the thing for him I m sure your scientific hygienic nonsense says that They do they did that is some of them do acknowledged Billy worriedly but they differ so And the one I m going by now says that Baby should always sleep in an even temperature seventy degrees if possible and that s exactly what the room in there was when I left him It s not the same out here I m sure In fact I looked at the thermometer to see just before I came out myself So Aunt Hannah I m afraid I ll have to take him back But you used to have him sleep out of doors all the time on that little balcony out of your room argued Aunt Hannah still plainly unconvinced Yes I know I did I was following the other man s rules then As I said if only they wouldn t differ so Of course I want the best but it s so hard to always know the best and At this very inopportune moment Master Bertram took occasion to wake up which brought even a deeper wrinkle of worry to his fond mother s forehead for she said that according to the clock he should have been sleeping exactly ten and one half more minutes and that of course he couldn t commence the next thing until those ten and one half minutes were up or else his entire schedule for the day would be shattered So what she should do with him for those should have been sleeping ten minutes and a half she did not know All of which drew from Aunt Hannah the astounding exclamation of Oh my grief and conscience Billy if you aren t the the limit Which indeed she must have been to have brought circumspect Aunt Hannah to the point of actually using slang CHAPTER XXIV A NIGHT OFF The Henshaw family did not return to the Strata until late in September Billy said that the sea air seemed to agree so well with the baby it would be a pity to change until the weather became really too cool at the shore to be comfortable William came back from his fishing trip in August and resumed his old habit of sleeping at the house and taking his meals at the club To be sure for a week he went back and forth between the city and the beach house but it happened to be a time when Bertram junior was cutting a tooth and this so wore upon William s sympathy William still could not help insisting it might be a pin that he concluded peace lay only in flight So he went back to the Strata Bertram had stayed at the cottage all summer painting industriously Heretofore he had taken more of a vacation through the summer months but this year there seemed to be nothing for him to do but to paint He did not like to go away on a trip and leave Billy and she declared she could not take the baby nor leave him and that she did not need any trip anyway All right then we ll just stay at the beach and have a fine vacation together he had answered her As Bertram saw it however he could detect very little vacation to it Billy had no time for anything but the baby When she was not actually engaged in caring for it she was studying how to care for it Never had she been sweeter or dearer and never had Bertram loved her half so well He was proud too of her devotion and of her triumphant success as a mother but he did wish that sometimes just once in a while she would remember she was a wife and pay a little attention to him her husband Bertram was ashamed to own it even to himself but he was feeling just a little abused that summer and he knew that in his heart he was actually getting jealous of his own son in spite of his adoration of the little fellow He told himself defensively that it was not to be expected that he should not want the love of his wife the attentions of his wife and the companionship of his wife a part of the time It was nothing more than natural that occasionally he should like to see her show some interest in subjects not mentioned in Mothers Guides and Scientific Trainings of Infants and he did not believe he could be blamed for wanting his residence to be a home for himself as well as a nursery for his offspring Even while he thus discontentedly argued with himself however Bertram called himself a selfish brute just to think such things when he had so dear and loving a wife as Billy and so fine and splendid a baby as Bertram junior He told himself too that very likely when they were back in their own house again and when motherhood was not so new to her Billy would not be so absorbed in the baby She would return to her old interest in her husband her music her friends and her own personal appearance Meanwhile there was always of course for him his painting So he would paint accepting gladly what crumbs of attention fell from the baby s table and trust to the future to make Billy none the less a mother perhaps but a little more the wife Just how confidently he was counting on this coming change Bertram hardly realized himself but certainly the family was scarcely settled at the Strata before the husband gayly proposed one evening that he and Billy should go to the theater to see Romeo and Juliet Billy was clearly both surprised and shocked Why Bertram I can t you know I can t she exclaimed reprovingly Bertram s heart sank but he kept a brave front Why not What a question As if I d leave Baby But Billy dear you d be gone less than three hours and you say Delia s the most careful of nurses Billy s forehead puckered into an anxious frown I can t help it Something might happen to him Bertram I couldn t be happy a minute But dearest aren t you ever going to leave him demanded the young husband forlornly Why yes of course when it s reasonable and necessary I went out to the Annex yesterday afternoon I was gone almost two whole hours Well did anything happen N no but then I telephoned you see several times so I knew everything was all right Oh well if that s all you want I could telephone you know between every act suggested Bertram with a sarcasm that was quite lost on the earnest young mother Y yes you could do that couldn t you conceded Billy and of course I haven t been anywhere much lately Indeed I could agreed Bertram with a promptness that carefully hid his surprise at her literal acceptance of what he had proposed as a huge joke Come is it a go Shall I telephone to see if I can get seats You think Baby ll surely be all right I certainly do And you ll telephone home between every act I will Bertram s voice sounded almost as if he were repeating the marriage service And we ll come straight home afterwards as fast as John and Peggy can bring us Certainly Then I think I ll go breathed Billy tremulously plainly showing what a momentous concession she thought she was making I do love Romeo and Juliet and I haven t seen it for ages Good Then I ll find out about the tickets cried Bertram so elated at the prospect of having an old time evening out with his wife that even the half hourly telephones did not seem too great a price to pay When the time came they were a little late in starting Baby was fretful and though Billy usually laid him in his crib and unhesitatingly left the room insisting that he should go to sleep by himself in accordance with the most approved rules in her Scientific Training yet to night she could not bring herself to the point of leaving the house until he was quiet Hurried as they were when they did start Billy was conscious of Bertram s frowning disapproval of her frock You don t like it of course dear and I don t blame you she smiled remorsefully Oh I like it that is I did when it was new rejoined her husband with apologetic frankness But dear didn t you have anything else This looks almost well mussy you know No well yes maybe there were others admitted Billy but this was the quickest and easiest to get into and it all came just as I was getting Baby ready for bed you know I am a fright though I ll acknowledge so far as clothes go I haven t had time to get a thing since Baby came I must get something right away I suppose Yes indeed declared Bertram with emphasis hurrying his wife into the waiting automobile Billy had to apologize again at the theater for the curtain had already risen on the ancient quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague and Billy knew her husband s special abhorrence of tardy arrivals Later though when well established in their seats Billy s mind was plainly not with the players on the stage Do you suppose Baby is all right she whispered after a time Sh h Of course he is dear There was a brief silence during which Billy peered at her program in the semi darkness Then she nudged her husband s arm ecstatically Bertram I couldn t have chosen a better play if I d tried There are five acts I d forgotten there were so many That means you can telephone four times Yes dear Bertram s voice was sternly cheerful You must be sure they tell you exactly how Baby is All right dear Sh h Here s Romeo Billy subsided She even clapped a little in spasmodic enthusiasm Presently she peered at her program again There wouldn t be time I suppose to telephone between the scenes she hazarded wistfully There are sixteen of those Well hardly Billy you aren t paying one bit of attention to the play Why of course I am whispered Billy indignantly I think it s perfectly lovely and I m perfectly contented too since I found out about those five acts and as long as I can t have the sixteen scenes she added settling back in her seat As if to prove that she was interested in the play her next whisper some time later had to do with one of the characters on the stage Who s that the nurse Mercy We wouldn t want her for Baby would we In spite of himself Bertram chuckled this time Billy too laughed at herself Then resolutely she settled into her seat again The curtain was not fairly down on the first act before Billy had laid an urgent hand on her husband s arm Now remember ask if he s waked up or anything she directed And be sure to say I ll come right home if they need me Now hurry Yes dear Bertram rose with alacrity I ll be back right away Oh but I don t want you to hurry too much she called after him softly I want you to take plenty of time to ask questions All right nodded Bertram with a quizzical smile as he turned away Obediently Bertram asked all the question she could think of then came back to his wife There was nothing in his report that even Billy could disapprove of or worry about and with almost a contented look on her face she turned toward the stage as the curtain went up on the second act I love this balcony scene she sighed happily Romeo however had not half finished his impassioned love making when Billy clutched her husband s arm almost fiercely Bertram she fairly hissed in a tragic whisper I ve just happened to think Won t it be awful when Baby falls in love I know I shall just hate that girl for taking him away from me Sh h Billy expostulated her husband choking with half stifled laughter That woman in front heard you I know she did Well I shall sighed Billy mournfully turning back to the stage Good night good night parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow sighed Juliet passionately to her Romeo Mercy I hope not whispered Billy flippantly in Bertram s ear I m sure I don t want to stay here till to morrow I want to go home and see Baby Billy pleaded Bertram so despairingly that Billy really conscience smitten sat back in her seat and remained for the rest of the act very quiet indeed Deceived by her apparent tranquillity Bertram turned as the curtain went down Now Billy surely you don t think it ll be necessary to telephone so soon as this again he ventured Billy s countenance fell But Bertram you said you would Of course if you aren t willing to but I ve been counting on hearing all through this horrid long act and Goodness me Billy I ll telephone every minute for you of course if you want me to cried Bertram springing to his feet and trying not to show his impatience He was back more promptly this time Everything O K he smiled reassuringly into Billy s anxious eyes Delia said she d just been up and the little chap was sound asleep To the man s unbounded surprise his wife grew actually white Up Up she exclaimed Do you mean that Delia went down stairs to stay and left my baby up there alone But Billy she said he was all right murmured Bertram softly casting uneasy sidelong glances at his too interested neighbors All right Perhaps he was then but he may not be later Delia should stay in the next room all the time where she could hear the least thing Yes dear she will I m sure if you tell her to soothed Bertram quickly It ll be all right next time Billy shook her head She was obviously near to crying But Bertram I can t stand it to sit here enjoying myself all safe and comfortable and know that Baby is alone up there in that great big room Please please won t you go and telephone Delia to go up now and stay there Bertram weary sorely tried and increasingly aware of those annoyingly interested neighbors was on the point of saying a very decided no but a glance into Billy s pleading eyes settled it Without a word he went back to the telephone The curtain was up when he slipped into his seat very red of face In answer to Billy s hurried whisper he shook his head but in the short pause between the first and second scenes he said in a low voice I m sorry Billy but I couldn t get the house at all Couldn t get them But you d just been talking with them That s exactly it probably I had just telephoned so they weren t watching for the bell Anyhow I couldn t get them Then you didn t get Delia at all Of course not And Baby is still all alone But he s all right dear Delia s keeping watch of him For a moment there was silence then with clear decisiveness came Billy s voice Bertram I am going home Billy I am Billy for heaven s sake don t be a silly goose The play s half over already We ll soon be going anyway Billy s lips came together in a thin little determined line Bertram I am going home now please she said You needn t come with me I can go alone Bertram said two words under his breath which it was just as well perhaps that Billy and the neighbors did not hear then he gathered up their wraps and with Billy stalked out of the theater At home everything was found to be absolutely as it should be Bertram junior was peacefully sleeping and Delia who had come up from downstairs was sewing in the next room There you see observed Bertram a little sourly Billy drew a long contented sigh Yes I see everything is all right But that s exactly what I wanted to do Bertram you know to see for myself she finished happily And Bertram looking at her rapt face as she hovered over the baby s crib called himself a brute and a beast to mind anything that could make Billy look like that CHAPTER XXV SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT Bertram did not ask Billy very soon again to go to the theater For some days indeed he did not ask her to do anything Then one evening he did beg for some music Billy you haven t played to me or sung to me since I could remember he complained I want some music Billy gave a merry laugh and wriggled her fingers experimentally Mercy Bertram I don t believe I could play a note You know I m all out of practice But why don t you practice Why Bertram I can t In the first place I don t seem to have any time except when Baby s asleep and I can t play then I d wake him up Bertram sighed irritably rose to his feet and began to walk up and down the room He came to a pause at last his eyes bent a trifle disapprovingly on his wife Billy dear don t you wear anything but those wrapper things nowadays he asked plaintively Again Billy laughed But this time a troubled frown followed the laugh I know Bertram I suppose they do look dowdy sometimes she confessed but you see I hate to wear a really good dress Baby rumples them up so and I m usually in a hurry to get to him mornings and these are so easy to slip into and so much more comfortable for me to handle him in Yes of course of course I see mumbled Bertram listlessly taking up his walk again Billy after a moment s silence began to talk animatedly Baby had done a wonderfully cunning thing that morning and Billy had not had a chance yet to tell Bertram Baby was growing more and more cunning anyway these days and there were several things she believed she had not told him so she told them now Bertram listened politely interestedly He told himself that he was interested too Of course he was interested in the doings of his own child But he still walked up and down the room a little restlessly coming to a halt at last by the window across which the shade had not been drawn Billy he cried suddenly with his old boyish eagerness there s a glorious moon Come on Let s take a little walk a real fellow and his best girl walk Will you Mercy dear I couldn t cried Billy springing to her feet I d love to though if I could she added hastily as she saw disappointment cloud her husband s face But I told Delia she might go out It isn t her regular evening of course but I told her I didn t mind staying with Baby a bit So I ll have to go right up now She ll be going soon But dear you go and take your walk It ll do you good Then you can come back and tell me all about it only you must come in quietly so not to wake the baby she finished giving her husband an affectionate kiss as she left the room After a disconsolate five minutes of solitude Bertram got his hat and coat and went out for his walk but he told himself he did not expect to enjoy it Bertram Henshaw knew that the old rebellious jealousy of the summer had him fast in its grip He was heartily ashamed of himself but he could not help it He wanted Billy and he wanted her then He wanted to talk to her He wanted to tell her about a new portrait commission he had just obtained and he wanted to ask her what she thought of the idea of a brand new Face of a Girl for the Bohemian Ten Exhibition next March He wanted but then what would be the use She would listen of course but he would know by the very looks of her face that she would not be really thinking of what he was saying and he would be willing to wager his best canvas that in the very first pause she would tell about the baby s newest tooth or latest toy Not but that he liked to hear about the little fellow of course and not but that he was proud as Punch of him too but that he would like sometimes to hear Billy talk of something else The sweetest melody in the world if dinned into one s ears day and night became something to be fled from And Billy ought to talk of something else too Bertram junior wonderful as he was really was not the only thing in the world or even the only baby and other people outsiders their friends had a right to expect that sometimes other matters might be considered their own for instance But Billy seemed to have forgotten this No matter whether the subject of conversation had to do with the latest novel or a trip to Europe under Billy s guidance it invariably led straight to Baby s Jack and Jill book or to a perambulator journey in the Public Garden If it had not been so serious it would have been really funny the way all roads led straight to one goal He himself when alone with Billy had started the most unusual and foreign subjects sometimes just to see if there were not somewhere a little bypath that did not bring up in his own nursery He never however found one But it was not funny it was serious Was this glorious gift on parenthood to which he had looked forward as the crowning joy of his existence to be nothing but a tragedy that would finally wreck his domestic happiness It could not be It must not be He must be patient and wait Billy loved him He was sure she did By and by this obsession of motherhood which had her so fast in its grasp would relax She would remember that her husband had rights as well as her child Once again she would give him the companionship love and sympathetic interest so dear to him Meanwhile there was his work He must bury himself in that And fortunate indeed he was he told himself that he had something so absorbing It was at this point in his meditations that Bertram rounded a corner and came face to face with a man who stopped him short with a jovial Isn t it by George it is Bertie Henshaw Well what do you think of that for luck and me only two days home from Gay Paree Oh Seaver How are you You are a stranger Bertram s voice and handshake were a bit more cordial than they would have been had he not at the moment been feeling so abused and forlorn In the old days he had liked this Bob Seaver well Seaver was an artist like himself and was good company always But Seaver and his crowd were a little too Bohemian for William s taste and after Billy came she too had objected to what she called that horrid Seaver man In his heart Bertram knew that there was good foundation for their objections so he had avoided Seaver for a time and for some years now the man had been abroad somewhat to Bertram s relief To night however Seaver s genial smile and hearty friendliness were like a sudden burst of sunshine on a rainy day and Bertram detested rainy days He was feeling now too as if he had just had a whole week of them Yes I am something of a stranger here nodded Seaver But I tell you what little old Boston looks mighty good to me all the same Come on You re just the fellow we want I m on my way now to the old stamping ground Come right about face old chap and come with me Bertram shook his head Sorry but I guess I can t to night he sighed Both gesture and words were unhesitating but the voice carried the discontent of a small boy who while the sun is still shining has been told to come into the house Oh rats Yes you can too Come on Lots of the old crowd will be there Griggs Beebe Jack Jenkins and Tully We need you to complete the show Jack Jenkins Is he here A new eagerness had come into Bertram s voice Sure He came on from New York last night Great boy Jenkins Just back from Paris fairly covered with medals you know Yes so I hear I haven t seen him for four years Better come to night then No o began Bertram with obvious reluctance It s already nine o clock and Nine o clock cut in Seaver with a broad grin Since when has your limit been nine o clock I ve seen the time when you didn t mind nine o clock in the morning Bertie What s got Oh I remember I met another friend of yours in Berlin chap named Arkwright and say he s some singer you bet You re going to hear of him one of these days Well he told me all about how you d settled down now son and heir fireside bliss pretty wife and all the fixings But I say Bertie doesn t she let you out any Nonsense Seaver flared Bertram in annoyed wrath Well then why don t you come to night If you want to see Jenkins you ll have to he s going back to New York to morrow For only a brief minute longer did Bertram hesitate then he turned squarely about with an air of finality Is he Well then perhaps I will he said I d hate to miss Jenkins entirely Good exclaimed his companion as they fell into step Have a cigar Thanks Don t mind if I do If Bertram s chin was a little higher and his step a little more decided than usual it was all merely by way of accompaniment to his thoughts Certainly it was right that he should go and it was sensible Indeed it was really almost imperative due to Billy as it were after that disagreeable taunt of Seaver s As if she did not want him to go when and where he pleased As if she would consent for a moment to figure in the eyes of his friends as a tyrannical wife who objected to her husband s passing a social evening with his friends To be sure in this particular case she might not favor Seaver s presence but even she would not mind this once and anyhow it was Jenkins that was the attraction not Seaver Besides he himself was no undeveloped boy now He was a man presumedly able to take care of himself Besides again had not Billy herself told him to go out and enjoy the evening without her as she had to stay with the baby He would telephone her of course that he had met some old friends and that he might be late then she would not worry And forthwith having settled the matter in his mind and to his complete satisfaction Bertram gave his undivided attention to Seaver who had already plunged into an account of a recent Art Exhibition he had attended in Paris CHAPTER XXVI GHOSTS THAT WALKED FOR BERTRAM October proved to be unusually mild and about the middle of the month Bertram after much unselfish urging on the part of Billy went to a friend s camp in the Adirondacks for a week s stay He came back with an angry lugubrious face and a broken arm Oh Bertram And your right one too the same one you broke before mourned Billy tearfully Of course retorted Bertram trying in vain to give an air of jauntiness to his reply Didn t want to be too changeable you know But how did you do it dear Fell into a silly little hole covered with underbrush But oh Billy what s the use I did it and I can t undo it more s the pity Of course you can t you poor boy sympathized Billy and you sha n t be tormented with questions We ll just be thankful twas no worse You can t paint for a while of course but we won t mind that It ll just give Baby and me a chance to have you all to ourselves for a time and we ll love that Yes of course sighed Bertram so abstractedly that Billy bridled with pretty resentment Well I like your enthusiasm sir she frowned I m afraid you don t appreciate the blessings you do have young man Did you realize what I said I remarked that you could be with Baby and me she emphasized Bertram laughed and gave his wife an affectionate kiss Indeed I do appreciate my blessings dear when those blessings are such treasures as you and Baby but Only his doleful eyes fixed on his injured arm finished his sentence I know dear of course and I understand murmured Billy all tenderness at once They were not easy for Bertram those following days Once again he was obliged to accept the little intimate personal services that he so disliked Once again he could do nothing but read or wander disconsolately into his studio and gaze at his half finished Face of a Girl Occasionally it is true driven nearly to desperation by the haunting vision in his mind s eye he picked up a brush and attempted to make his left hand serve his will but a bare half dozen irritating ineffectual strokes were usually enough to make him throw down his brush in disgust He never could do anything with his left hand he told himself dejectedly Many of his hours of course he spent with Billy and his son and they were happy hours too but they always came to be restless ones before the day was half over Billy was always devotion itself to him when she was not attending to the baby he had no fault to find with Billy And the baby was delightful he could find no fault with the baby But the baby was fretful he was teething Billy said and he needed a great deal of attention so naturally Bertram drifted out of the nursery after a time and went down into his studio where were his dear empty palette his orderly brushes and his tantalizing Face of a Girl From the studio generally Bertram went out on to the street Sometimes he dropped into a fellow artist s studio Sometimes he strolled into a club or cafe where he knew he would be likely to find some friend who would help him while away a tiresome hour Bertram s friends quite vied with each other in rendering this sort of aid so much so indeed that naturally perhaps Bertram came to call on their services more and more frequently Particularly was this the case when after the splints were removed Bertram found as the days passed that his arm was not improving as it should improve This not only disappointed and annoyed him but worried him He remembered sundry disquieting warnings given by the physician at the time of the former break warnings concerning the probable seriousness of a repetition of the injury To Billy of course Bertram said nothing of all this but just before Christmas he went to see a noted specialist An hour later almost in front of the learned surgeon s door Bertram met Bob Seaver Great Scott Bertie what s up ejaculated Seaver You look as if you d seen a ghost I have answered Bertram with grim bitterness I ve seen the ghost of of every Face of a Girl I ever painted Gorry So bad as that No wonder you look as if you d been disporting in graveyards chuckled Seaver laughing at his own joke What s the matter arm on a rampage to day He paused for reply but as Bertram did not answer at once he resumed with gay insistence Come on You need cheering up Suppose we go down to Trentini s and see who s there All right agreed Bertram dully Suit yourself Bertram was not thinking of Seaver Trentini s or whom he might find there Bertram was thinking of certain words he had heard less than half an hour ago He was wondering too if ever again he could think of anything but those words The truth the great surgeon had said Well the truth is I m sorry to tell you the truth mister Henshaw but if you will have it you ve painted the last picture you ll ever paint with your right hand I fear It s a bad case This break coming as it did on top of the serious injury of two or three years ago was bad enough but to make matters worse the bone was imperfectly set and wrongly treated which could not be helped of course as you were miles away from skilled surgeons at the time of the injury We ll do the best we can of course but well you asked for the truth you remember so I had to give it to you CHAPTER XXVII THE MOTHER THE WIFE Bertram made up his mind at once that for the present at least he would tell no one what the surgeon had said to him He had placed himself under the man s care and there was nothing to do but to take the prescribed treatment and await results as patiently as he could Meanwhile there was no need to worry Billy or William or anybody else with the matter Billy was so busy with her holiday plans that she was only vaguely aware of what seemed to be an increase of restlessness on the part of her husband during those days just before Christmas Poor dear is the arm feeling horrid to day she asked one morning when the gloom on her husband s face was deeper than usual Bertram frowned and did not answer directly Lots of good I am these days he exclaimed his moody eyes on the armful of many shaped many sized packages she carried What are those for the tree Yes and it s going to be so pretty Bertram exulted Billy And do you know Baby positively acts as if he suspected things little as he is she went on eagerly He s as nervous as a witch I can t keep him still a minute How about his mother hinted Bertram with a faint smile Billy laughed Well I m afraid she isn t exactly calm herself she confessed as she hurried out of the room with her parcels Bertram looked after her longingly despondently I wonder what she d say if she knew he muttered But she sha n t know till she just has to he vowed suddenly under his breath striding into the hall for his hat and coat Never had the Strata known such a Christmas as this was planned to be Cyril Marie and the twins were to be there also Kate her husband and three children Paul Egbert and little Kate from the West On Christmas Day there was to be a big family dinner with Aunt Hannah down from the Annex Then in concession to the extreme youth of the young host and his twin cousins there was to be an afternoon tree The shades were to be drawn and the candles lighted however so that there might be no loss of effect In the evening the tree was to be once more loaded with fascinating packages and candy bags and this time the Greggorys Tommy Dunn and all the rest from the Annex were to have the fun all over again From garret to basement the Strata was aflame with holly and aglitter with tinsel Nowhere did there seem to be a spot that did not have its bit of tissue paper or its trail of red ribbon And everything holly ribbon tissue and tinsel led to the mysteriously closed doors of the great front drawing room past which none but Billy and her accredited messengers might venture No wonder indeed that even Baby scented excitement and that Baby s mother was not exactly calm No wonder too that Bertram with his helpless right arm and his heavy heart felt peculiarly forlorn and out of it No wonder also that he took himself literally out of it with growing frequency mister and missus Hartwell and little Kate were to stay at the Strata The boys Paul and Egbert were to go to Cyril s Promptly at the appointed time two days before Christmas they arrived And from that hour until two days after Christmas when the last bit of holly ribbon tissue and tinsel disappeared from the floor Billy moved in a whirl of anxious responsibility that was yet filled with fun frolic and laughter It was a great success the whole affair Everybody seemed pleased and happy that is everybody but Bertram and he very plainly tried to seem pleased and happy Even Cyril unbent to the extent of not appearing to mind the noise one bit and Sister Kate Bertram said found only the extraordinarily small number of four details to change in the arrangements Baby obligingly let his teeth getting go for the occasion and he and the twins Franz and Felix were the admiration and delight of all Little Kate to be sure was a trifle disconcerting once or twice but everybody was too absorbed to pay much attention to her Billy did however remember her opening remarks Well little Kate do you remember me Billy had greeted her pleasantly Oh yes little Kate had answered with a winning smile You re my Aunt Billy what married my Uncle Bertram instead of Uncle William as you said you would first Everybody laughed and Billy colored of course but little Kate went on eagerly And I ve been wanting just awfully to see you she announced Have you I m glad I m sure I feel highly flattered smiled Billy Well I have You see I wanted to ask you something Have you ever wished that you had married Uncle William instead of Uncle Bertram or that you d tried for Uncle Cyril before Aunty Marie got him Kate gasped her horrified mother I told you You see she broke off turning to Billy despairingly She s been pestering me with questions like that ever since she knew she was coming She never has forgotten the way you changed from one uncle to the other You may remember it made a great impression on her at the time Yes I I remember stammered Billy trying to laugh off her embarrassment But you haven t told me yet whether you did wish you d married Uncle William or Uncle Cyril interposed little Kate persistently No no of course not exclaimed Billy with a vivid blush casting her eyes about for a door of escape and rejoicing greatly when she spied Delia with the baby coming toward them There look my dear here s your new cousin little Bertram she exclaimed Don t you want to see him Little Kate turned dutifully Yes m Aunt Billy but I d rather see the twins Mother says they re real pretty and cunning Er y yes they are murmured Billy on whom the emphasis of the they re had not been lost Naturally as may be supposed therefore Billy had not forgotten little Kate s opening remarks Immediately after Christmas mister Hartwell and the boys went back to their Western home leaving missus Hartwell and her daughter to make a round of visits to friends in the East For almost a week after Christmas they remained at the Strata and it was on the last day of their stay that little Kate asked the question that proved so momentous in results Billy almost unconsciously had avoided tete a tetes with her small guest But to day they were alone together Aunt Billy began the little girl after a meditative gaze into the other s face you are married to Uncle Bertram aren t you I certainly am my dear smiled Billy trying to speak unconcernedly Well then what makes you forget it What makes me forget Why child what a question What do you mean I don t forget it exclaimed Billy indignantly Then what did mother mean I heard her tell Uncle William myself she didn t know I heard though that she did wish you d remember you were Uncle Bertram s wife as well as Cousin Bertram s mother Billy flushed scarlet then grew very white At that moment missus Hartwell came into the room Little Kate turned triumphantly There she hasn t forgotten and I knew she hadn t mother I asked her just now and she said she hadn t Hadn t what questioned missus Hartwell looking a little apprehensively at her sister in law s white face and angry eyes Hadn t forgotten that she was Uncle Bertram s wife Kate interposed Billy steadily meeting her sister in law s gaze will you be good enough to tell me what this child is talking about missus Hartwell sighed and gave an impatient gesture Kate I ve a mind to take you home on the next train she said to her daughter Run away now down stairs Your Aunt Billy and I want to talk Come come hurry I mean what I say she added warningly as she saw unmistakable signs of rebellion on the small young face I wish pouted little Kate rising reluctantly and moving toward the door that you didn t always send me away just when I wanted most to stay Well Kate prompted Billy as the door closed behind the little girl Yes I suppose I ll have to say it now as long as that child has put her finger in the pie But I hadn t intended to speak no matter what I saw I promised myself I wouldn t before I came I know of course how Bertram and Cyril and William too say that I m always interfering in affairs that don t concern me though for that matter if my own brother s affairs don t concern me I don t know whose should But as I said I wasn t going to speak this time no matter what I saw And I haven t except to William and Cyril and Aunt Hannah but I suppose somewhere little Kate got hold of it It s simply this Billy It seems to me it s high time you began to realize that you re Bertram s wife as well as the baby s mother That I am I don t think I quite understand said Billy unsteadily No I suppose you don t sighed Kate though where your eyes are I don t see or rather I do see they re on the baby always It s all very well and lovely Billy to be a devoted mother and you certainly are that I ll say that much for you and I ll admit I never thought you would be But can t you see what you re doing to Bertram Doing to Bertram by being a devoted mother to his son Yes doing to Bertram Can t you see what a change there is in the boy He doesn t act like himself at all He s restless and gloomy and entirely out of sorts Yes I know but that s his arm pleaded Billy Poor boy he s so tired of it Kate shook her head decisively It s more than his arm Billy You d see it yourself if you weren t blinded by your absorption in that baby Where is Bertram every evening Where is he daytimes Do you realize that he s been at home scarcely one evening since I came And as for the days he s almost never here But Kate he can t paint now you know so of course he doesn t need to stay so closely at home defended Billy He goes out to find distraction from himself Yes distraction indeed sniffed Kate And where do you suppose he finds it Do you know where he finds it I tell you Billy Bertram Henshaw is not the sort of man that should find too much distraction outside his home His tastes and his temperament are altogether too Bohemian and Billy interrupted with a peremptorily upraised hand Please remember Kate you are speaking of my husband to his wife and his wife has perfect confidence in him and is just a little particular as to what you say Yes well I m speaking of my brother too whom I know very well shrugged Kate All is you may remember sometime that I warned you that s all This trusting business is all very pretty but I think twould be a lot prettier and a vast deal more sensible if you d give him a little attention as well as trust and see if you can t keep him at home a bit more At least you ll know whom he s with then Cyril says he saw him last week with Bob Seaver With Bob Seaver faltered Billy changing color Yes I see you remember him smiled Kate not quite agreeably Perhaps now you ll take some stock in what I ve said and remember it I ll remember it certainly returned Billy a little proudly You ve said a good many things to me in the past missus Hartwell and I ve remembered them all every one It was Kate s turn to flush and she did it Yes I know And I presume very likely sometimes there hasn t been much foundation for what I ve said I think this time however you ll find there is she finished with an air of hurt dignity Billy made no reply perhaps because Delia at that moment brought in the baby missus Hartwell and little Kate left the Strata the next morning Until then Billy contrived to keep before them a countenance serene and a manner free from unrest Even when after dinner that evening Bertram put on his hat and coat and went out Billy refused to meet her sister in law s meaning gaze But in the morning after they had left the house Billy did not attempt to deceive herself Determinedly then she set herself to going over in her mind the past months since the baby came and she was appalled at what she found Ever in her ears too was that feared name Bob Seaver and ever before her eyes was that night years ago when as an eighteen year old girl she had followed Bertram and Bob Seaver into a glittering cafe at eleven o clock at night because Bertram had been drinking and was not himself She remembered Bertram s face when he had seen her and what he had said when she begged him to come home She remembered too what the family had said afterward But she remembered also that years later Bertram had told her what that escapade of hers had really done for him and that he believed he had actually loved her from that moment After that night at all events he had had little to do with Bob Seaver And now Seaver was back again it seemed and with Bertram They had been seen together But if they had what could she do Surely she could hardly now follow them into a public cafe and demand that Seaver let her husband come home But she could keep him at home perhaps Billy quite brightened at this thought Kate had said that she was so absorbed in Baby that her husband received no attention at all Billy did not believe this was true but if it were true she could at least rectify that mistake If it were attention that he wanted he should want no more Poor Bertram No wonder that he had sought distraction outside When one had a horrid broken arm that would not let one do anything what else could one do Just here Billy suddenly remembered the book A Talk to Young Wives If she recollected rightly there was a chapter that covered the very claim Kate had been making Billy had not thought of the book for months but she went at once to get it now There might be after all something in it that would help her The Coming of the First Baby Billy found the chapter without difficulty and settled herself to read her countenance alight with interest In a surprisingly short time however a new expression came to her face and at last a little gasp of dismay fell from her lips She looked up then with a startled gaze Had her walls possessed eyes and ears all these past months only to give instructions to an unseen hand that it might write what the eyes and ears had learned For it was such sentences as these that the conscience smitten Billy read Maternity is apt to work a miracle in a woman s life but sometimes it spells disaster so far as domestic bliss is concerned The young mother wrapped up in the delights and duties of motherhood utterly forgets that she has a husband She lives and moves and has her being in the nursery She thinks baby talks baby knows only baby She refuses to dress up because it is easier to take care of baby in a frowzy wrapper She will not go out with her husband for fear something might happen to the baby She gives up her music because baby won t let her practice In vain her husband tries to interest her in his own affairs She has neither eyes nor ears for him only for baby Now no man enjoys having his nose put out of joint even by his own child He loves his child devotedly and is proud of him of course but that does not keep him from wanting the society of his wife occasionally nor from longing for her old time love and sympathetic interest It is an admirable thing certainly for a woman to be a devoted mother but maternal affection can be carried too far Husbands have some rights as well as offspring and the wife who neglects her husband for her babies does so at her peril Home with the wife eternally in the nursery is apt to be a dull and lonely thing to the average husband so he starts out to find amusement for himself and he finds it Then is the time when the new little life that is so precious and that should have bound the two more closely together becomes the wedge that drives them apart Billy did not read any more With a little sobbing cry she flung the book back into her desk and began to pull off her wrapper Her fingers shook Already she saw herself a Monster a Wicked Destroyer of Domestic Bliss with her thoughtless absorption in Baby until he had become that Awful Thing a Wedge And Bertram poor Bertram with his broken arm She had not played to him nor sung to him nor gone out with him And when had they had one of their good long talks about Bertram s work and plans But it should all be changed now She would play and sing and go out with him She would dress up too He should see no more wrappers She would ask about his work and seem interested She was interested She remembered now that just before he was hurt he had told her of a new portrait and of a new Face of a Girl that he had planned to do Lately he had said nothing about these He had seemed discouraged and no wonder with his broken arm But she would change all that He should see And forthwith Billy hurried to her closet to pick out her prettiest house frock Long before dinner Billy was ready waiting in the drawing room She had on a pretty little blue silk gown that she knew Bertram liked and she watched very anxiously for Bertram to come up the steps She remembered now with a pang that he had long since given up his peculiar ring but she meant to meet him at the door just the same Bertram however did not come At a quarter before six he telephoned that he had met some friends and would dine at the club My my how pretty we are exclaimed Uncle William when they went down to dinner together New frock Why no Uncle William laughed Billy a little tremulously You ve seen it dozens of times Have I murmured the man I don t seem to remember it Too bad Bertram isn t here to see you Somehow you look unusually pretty to night And Billy s heart ached anew Billy spent the evening practicing softly to be sure so as not to wake Baby but practicing As the days passed Billy discovered that it was much easier to say she would change things than it was really to change them She changed herself it is true her clothes her habits her words and her thoughts but it was more difficult to change Bertram In the first place he was there so little She was dismayed when she saw how very little indeed he was at home and she did not like to ask him outright to stay That was not in accordance with her plans Besides the Talk to Young Wives said that indirect influence was much to be preferred always to direct persuasion which last indeed usually failed to produce results So Billy dressed up and practiced and talked of anything but the baby and even hinted shamelessly once or twice that she would like to go to the theater but all to little avail True Bertram brightened up for a minute when he came home and found her in a new or a favorite dress and he told her how pretty she looked He appeared to like to have her play to him too even declaring once or twice that it was quite like old times yes it was But he never noticed her hints about the theater and he did not seem to like to talk about his work even a little bit Billy laid this last fact to his injured arm She decided that he had become blue and discouraged and that he needed cheering up especially about his work so she determinedly and systematically set herself to doing it She talked of the fine work he had done and of the still finer work he would yet do when his arm was well She told him how proud she was of him and she let him see how dear his Art was to her and how badly she would feel if she thought he had really lost all his interest in his work and would never paint again She questioned him about the new portrait he was to begin as soon as his arm would let him and she tried to arouse his enthusiasm in the picture he had planned to show in the March Exhibition of the Bohemian Ten telling him that she was sure his arm would allow him to complete at least one canvas to hang In none of this however did Bertram appear in the least interested The one thing indeed which he seemed not to want to talk about was his work and he responded to her overtures on the subject with only moody silence or else with almost irritable monosyllables all of which not only grieved but surprised Billy very much For according to the Talk to Young Wives she was doing exactly what the ideal sympathetic interested in her husband s work wife should do When February came bringing with it no change for the better Billy was thoroughly frightened Bertram s arm plainly was not improving He was more gloomy and restless than ever He seemed not to want to stay at home at all and Billy knew now for a certainty that he was spending more and more time with Bob Seaver and the boys Poor Billy Nowhere could she look these days and see happiness Even the adored baby seemed at times almost to give an added pang Had he not become according to the Talk to Young Wives that awful thing a Wedge The Annex too carried its sting for where was the need of an overflow house for happiness now when there was no happiness to overflow Even the little jade idol on Billy s mantel Billy could not bear to see these days for its once bland smile had become a hideous grin demanding Where now is your heap plenty velly good luckee But before Bertram Billy still carried a bravely smiling face and to him still she talked earnestly and enthusiastically of his work which last as it happened was the worst course she could have pursued for the one thing poor Bertram wished to forget just now was his work CHAPTER XXVIII CONSPIRATORS Early in February came Arkwright s appearance at the Boston Opera House the first since he had sung there as a student a few years before He was an immediate and an unquestioned success His portrait adorned the front page of almost every Boston newspaper the next morning and captious critics vied with each other to do him honor His full history from boyhood up was featured with special emphasis on his recent triumphs in New York and foreign capitals He was interviewed as to his opinion on everything from vegetarianism to woman s suffrage and his preferences as to pies and pastimes were given headline prominence There was no doubt of it mister M J Arkwright was a star All Arkwright s old friends including Billy Bertram Cyril Marie Calderwell Alice Greggory Aunt Hannah and Tommy Dunn went to hear him sing and after the performance he held a miniature reception with enough adulation to turn his head completely around he declared deprecatingly Not until the next evening however did he have an opportunity for what he called a real talk with any of his friends then in Calderwell s room he settled back in his chair with a sigh of content For a time his own and Calderwell s affairs occupied their attention then after a short pause the tenor asked abruptly Is there anything wrong with the Henshaws Calderwell Calderwell came suddenly erect in his chair Thank you I hoped you d introduce that subject though for that matter if you hadn t I should Yes there is and I m looking to you old man to get them out of it I Arkwright sat erect now Yes What do you mean In a way the expected has happened though I know now that I didn t really expect it to happen in spite of my prophecies You may remember I was always skeptical on the subject of Bertram s settling down to a domestic hearthstone I insisted twould be the turn of a girl s head and the curve of her cheek that he wanted to paint Arkwright looked up with a quick frown You don t mean that Henshaw has been cad enough to find another Calderwell threw up his hand No no not that We haven t that to deal with yet thank goodness There s no woman in it And really when you come right down to it if ever a fellow had an excuse to seek diversion Bertram Henshaw has poor chap It s just this Bertram broke his arm again last October Yes so I hear and I thought he was looking badly He is It s a bad business Twas improperly set in the first place and it s not doing well now In fact I m told on pretty good authority that the doctor says he probably will never use it again Oh by George Calderwell Yes Tough isn t it Specially when you think of his work and know as I happen to that he s particularly dependent on his right hand for everything He doesn t tell this generally and I understand Billy and the family know nothing of it how hopeless the case is I mean Well naturally the poor fellow has been pretty thoroughly discouraged and to get away from himself he s gone back to his old Bohemian habits spending much of his time with some of his old cronies that are none too good for him Seaver for instance Bob Seaver Yes I know him Arkwright s lips snapped together crisply Yes He said he knew you That s why I m counting on your help What do you mean I mean I want you to get Henshaw away from him and keep him away Arkwright s face darkened with an angry flush Great Scott Calderwell What are you talking about Henshaw is no kid to be toted home and I m no nursery governess to do the toting Calderwell laughed quietly No I don t think any one would take you for a nursery governess Arkwright in spite of the fact that you are still known to some of your friends as Mary Jane But you can sing a song man which will promptly give you a through ticket to their innermost sacred circle In fact to my certain knowledge Seaver is already planning a jamboree with you at the right hand of the toastmaster There s your chance Once in stay in long enough to get Henshaw out But good heavens Calderwell it s impossible What can I do demanded Arkwright savagely I can t walk up to the man take him by the ear and say Here you sir march home Neither can I come the I am holier than thou act and hold up to him the mirror of his transgressions No but you can get him out of it some way You can find a way for Billy s sake There was no answer and after a moment Calderwell went on more quietly I haven t seen Billy but two or three times since I came back to Boston but I don t need to to know that she s breaking her heart over something And of course that something is Bertram There was still no answer Arkwright got up suddenly and walked to the window You see I m helpless resumed Calderwell I don t paint pictures nor sing songs nor write stories nor dance jigs for a living and you have to do one or another to be in with that set And it s got to be a Johnny on the spot with Bertram All is something will have to be done to get him out of the state of mind and body he s in now or Arkwright wheeled sharply When did you say this jamboree was going to be he demanded Next week some time The date is not settled They were going to consult you Hm m commented Arkwright And though his next remark was a complete change of subject Calderwell gave a contented sigh If when the proposition was first made to him Arkwright was doubtful of his ability to be a successful Johnny on the spot he was even more doubtful of it as the days passed and he was attempting to carry out the suggestion He had known that he was undertaking a most difficult and delicate task and he soon began to fear that it was an impossible one as well With a dogged persistence however he adhered to his purpose ever on the alert to be more watchful more tactful more efficient in emergencies Disagreeable as was the task in a way in another way it was a great pleasure to him He was glad of the opportunity to do anything for Billy and then too he was glad of something absorbing enough to take his mind off his own affairs He told himself sometimes that this helping another man to fight his tiger skin was assisting himself to fight his own Arkwright was trying very hard not to think of Alice Greggory these days He had come back hoping that he was in a measure cured of his folly as he termed it but the first look into Alice Greggory s blue gray eyes had taught him the fallacy of that idea In that very first meeting with Alice he feared that he had revealed his secret for she was plainly so nervously distant and ill at ease with him that he could but construe her embarrassment and chilly dignity as pity for him and a desire to show him that she had nothing but friendship for him Since then he had seen but little of her partly because he did not wish to see her and partly because his time was so fully occupied Then too in a round about way he had heard a rumor that Calderwell was engaged to be married and though no feminine name had been mentioned in connection with the story Arkwright had not hesitated to supply in his own mind that of Alice Greggory Beginning with the jamboree which came off quite in accordance with Calderwell s prophecies Arkwright spent the most of such time as was not given to his professional duties in deliberately cultivating the society of Bertram and his friends To this extent he met with no difficulty for he found that M J Arkwright the new star in the operatic firmament was obviously a welcome comrade Beyond this it was not so easy Arkwright wondered indeed sometimes if he were making any progress at all But still he persevered He walked with Bertram he talked with Bertram unobtrusively he contrived to be near Bertram almost always when they were together with the boys Gradually he won from him the story of what the surgeon had said to him and of how black the future looked in consequence This established a new bond between them so potent that Arkwright ventured to test it one day by telling Bertram the story of the tiger skin the first tiger skin in his uncle s library years ago and of how since then any difficulty he had encountered he had tried to treat as a tiger skin In telling the story he was careful to draw no moral for his listener and to preach no sermon He told the tale too with all possible whimsical lightness of touch and immediately at its conclusion he changed the subject But that he had not failed utterly in his design was evidenced a few days later when Bertram grimly declared that he guessed his tiger skin was a lively beast all right The first time Arkwright went home with Bertram his presence was almost a necessity Bertram was not quite himself that night Billy admitted them She had plainly been watching and waiting Arkwright never forgot the look on her face as her eyes met his There was a curious mixture of terror hurt pride relief and shame overtopped by a fierce loyalty which almost seemed to say aloud the words Don t you dare to blame him Arkwright s heart ached with sympathy and admiration at the proudly courageous way in which Billy carried off the next few painful minutes Even when he bade her good night a little later only her eyes said thank you Her lips were dumb Arkwright often went home with Bertram after that Not that it was always necessary far from it Some time indeed elapsed before he had quite the same excuse again for his presence But he had found that occasionally he could get Bertram home earlier by adroit suggestions of one kind or another and more and more frequently he was succeeding in getting him home for a game of chess Bertram liked chess and was a fine player Since breaking his arm he had turned to games with the feverish eagerness of one who looks for something absorbing to fill an unrestful mind It was Seaver s skill in chess that had at first attracted Bertram to the man long ago but Bertram could beat him easily too easily for much pleasure in it now So they did not play chess often these days Bertram had found that in spite of his injury he could still take part in other games and some of them if not so intricate as chess were at least more apt to take his mind off himself especially if there were a bit of money up to add zest and interest As it happened however Bertram learned one day that Arkwright could play chess and play well too as he discovered after their first game together This fact contributed not a little to such success as Arkwright was having in his efforts to wean Bertram from his undesirable companions for Bertram soon found out that Arkwright was more than a match for himself and the occasional games he did succeed in winning only whetted his appetite for more Many an evening now therefore was spent by the two men in Bertram s den with Billy anxiously hovering near her eyes longingly watching either her husband s absorbed face or the pretty little red and white ivory figures which seemed to possess so wonderful a power to hold his attention In spite of her joy at the chessmen s efficacy in keeping Bertram at home however she was almost jealous of them mister Arkwright couldn t you show me how to play sometime she said wistfully one evening when the momentary absence of Bertram had left the two alone together I used to watch Bertram and Marie play years ago but I never knew how to play myself Not that I can see where the fun is in just sitting staring at a chessboard for half an hour at a time though But Bertram likes it and so I I want to learn to stare with him Will you teach me I should be glad to smiled Arkwright Then will you come maybe sometimes when Bertram is at the doctor s He goes every Tuesday and Friday at three o clock for treatment I d rather you came then for two reasons first because I don t want Bertram to know I m learning till I can play some and secondly because because I don t want to take you away from him The last words were spoken very low and were accompanied by a painful blush It was the first time Billy had ever hinted to Arkwright in words that she understood what he was trying to do I ll come next Tuesday promised Arkwright with a cheerfully unobservant air Then Bertram came in bringing the book of Chess Problems for which he had gone up stairs CHAPTER XXIX CHESS Promptly at three o clock Tuesday afternoon Arkwright appeared at the Strata and for the next hour Billy did her best to learn the names and the moves of the pretty little ivory men But at the end of the hour she was almost ready to give up in despair If there weren t so many kinds and if they didn t all insist on doing something different it wouldn t be so bad she sighed But how can you be expected to remember which goes diagonal and which crisscross and which can t go but one square and which can skip way across the board specially when that little pawn thing can go straight ahead two squares sometimes and the next minute only one except when it takes things and then it goes crooked one square and when that tiresome little horse tries to go all ways at once and can jump round and hurdle over anybody s head even the king s how can you expect folks to remember But then Bertram remembers she added resolutely so I guess I can Whenever possible after that Arkwright came on Tuesdays and Fridays and in spite of her doubts Billy did very soon begin to remember Spurred by her great desire to play with Bertram and surprise him Billy spared no pains to learn well her lessons Even among the baby s books and playthings these days might be found a Manual of Chess for Billy pursued her study at all hours and some nights even her dreams were of ruined castles where kings and queens and bishops disported themselves with pawns for servants and where a weird knight on horseback used the castle s highest tower for a hurdle landing always a hundred yards to one side of where he would be expected to come down It was not long of course before Billy could play a game of chess after a fashion but she knew just enough to realize that she actually knew nothing and she knew too that until she could play a really good game her moves would not hold Bertram s attention for one minute Not at present therefore was she willing Bertram should know what she was attempting to do Billy had not yet learned what the great surgeon had said to Bertram She knew only that his arm was no better and that he never voluntarily spoke of his painting Over her now seemed to be hanging a vague horror Something was the matter She knew that But what it was she could not fathom She realized that Arkwright was trying to help and her gratitude though silent knew no bounds Not even to Aunt Hannah or Uncle William could she speak of this thing that was troubling her That they too understood in a measure she realized But still she said no word Billy was wearing a proud little air of aloofness these days that was heart breaking to those who saw it and read it aright for what it was loyalty to Bertram no matter what happened And so Billy pored over her chessboard feverishly tirelessly having ever before her longing eyes the dear time when Bertram across the table from her should sit happily staring for half an hour at a move she had made Whatever Billy s chess playing was to signify however in her own life it was destined to play a part in the lives of two friends of hers that was most unexpected During Billy s very first lesson as it chanced Alice Greggory called and found Billy and Arkwright so absorbed in their game that they did not at first hear Eliza speak her name The quick color that flew to Arkwright s face at sight of herself was construed at once by Alice as embarrassment on his part at being found tete a tete with Bertram Henshaw s wife And she did not like it She was not pleased that he was there She was less pleased that he blushed for being there It so happened that Alice found him there again several times Alice gave a piano lesson at two o clock every Tuesday and Friday afternoon to a little Beacon Street neighbor of Billy s and she had fallen into the habit of stepping in to see Billy for a few minutes afterward which brought her there at a little past three just after the chess lesson was well started If the first time that Alice Greggory found Arkwright opposite Billy at the chess table she was surprised and displeased the second and third times she was much more so When it finally came to her one day with sickening illumination that always the tete a tetes were during Bertram s hour at the doctor s she was appalled What could it mean Had Arkwright given up his fight Was he playing false to himself and to Bertram by trying thus on the sly to win the love of his friend s wife Was this man whom she had so admired for his brave stand and to whom all unasked she had given her heart s best love more the pity of it was this idol of hers to show feet of clay after all She could not believe it And yet Sick at heart but imbued with the determination of a righteous cause Alice Greggory resolved for Billy s sake to watch and wait If necessary she should speak to some one though to whom she did not know Billy s happiness should not be put in jeopardy if she could help it Indeed no As the weeks passed Alice came to be more and more uneasy distressed and grieved Of Billy she could believe no evil but of Arkwright she was beginning to think she could believe everything that was dishonorable and despicable And to believe that of the man she still loved no wonder that Alice did not look nor act like herself these days Incensed at herself because she did love him angry at him because he seemed to be proving himself so unworthy of that love and genuinely frightened at what she thought was the fast approaching wreck of all happiness for her dear friend Billy Alice did not know which way to turn At the first she had told herself confidently that she would speak to somebody But as time passed she saw the impracticability of that idea Speak to somebody indeed To whom When Where What should she say Where was her right to say anything She was not dealing with a parcel of naughty children who had pilfered the cake jar She was dealing with grown men and women who presumedly knew their own affairs and who certainly would resent any interference from her On the other hand could she stand calmly by and see Bertram lose his wife Arkwright his honor Billy her happiness and herself her faith in human nature all because to do otherwise would be to meddle in other people s business Apparently she could and should At least that seemed to be the role which she was expected to play It was when Alice had reached this unhappy frame of mind that Arkwright himself unexpectedly opened the door for her The two were alone together in Bertram Henshaw s den It was Tuesday afternoon Alice had called to find Billy and Arkwright deep in their usual game of chess Then a matter of domestic affairs had taken Billy from the room I m afraid I ll have to be gone ten minutes or more she had said as she rose from the table reluctantly But you might be showing Alice the moves mister Arkwright she had added with a laugh as she disappeared Shall I teach you the moves he had smiled when they were alone together Alice s reply had been so indignantly short and sharp that Arkwright after a moment s pause had said with a whimsical smile that yet carried a touch of sadness I am forced to surmise from your answer that you think it is you who should be teaching me moves At all events I seem to have been making some moves lately that have not suited you judging by your actions Have I offended you in any way Alice The girl turned with a quick lifting of her head Alice knew that if ever she were to speak it must be now Never again could she hope for such an opportunity as this Suddenly throwing circumspect caution quite aside she determined that she would speak Springing to her feet she crossed the room and seated herself in Billy s chair at the chess table Me Offend me she exclaimed in a low voice As if I were the one you were offending Why Alice murmured the man in obvious stupefaction Alice raised her hand palm outward Now don t please don t pretend you don t know she begged almost piteously Please don t add that to all the rest Oh I understand of course it s none of my affairs and I wasn t going to speak she choked but to day when you gave me this chance I had to At first I couldn t believe it she plunged on plainly hurrying against Billy s return After all you d told me of how you meant to fight it your tiger skin And I thought it merely happened that you were here alone with her those days I came Then when I found out they were always the days mister Henshaw was away at the doctor s I had to believe She stopped for breath Arkwright who up to this moment had shown that he was completely mystified as to what she was talking about suddenly flushed a painful red He was obviously about to speak but she prevented him with a quick gesture There s a little more I ve got to say please As if it weren t bad enough to do what you re doing at all but you must needs take it at such a time as this when when her husband isn t doing just what he ought to do and we all know it it s so unfair to take her now and try to to win And you aren t even fair with him she protested tremulously You pretend to be his friend You go with him everywhere It s just as if you were helping to to pull him down You re one with the whole bunch The blood suddenly receded from Arkwright s face leaving it very white but if Alice saw it she paid no heed Everybody says you are Then to come here like this on the sly when you know he can t be here I Oh can t you see what you re doing There was a moment s pause then Arkwright spoke A deep pain looked from his eyes He was still very pale and his mouth had settled into sad lines I think perhaps it may be just as well if I tell you what I am doing or rather trying to do he said quietly Then he told her And so you see he added when he had finished the tale I haven t really accomplished much after all and it seems the little I have accomplished has only led to my being misjudged by you my best friend Alice gave a sobbing cry Her face was scarlet Horror shame and relief struggled for mastery in her countenance Oh but I didn t know I didn t know she moaned twisting her hands nervously And now when you ve been so brave so true for me to accuse you of Oh can you ever forgive me But you see knowing that you did care for her it did look She choked into silence and turned away her head He glanced at her tenderly mournfully Yes he said after a minute in a low voice I can see how it did look and so I m going to tell you now something I had meant never to tell you There really couldn t have been anything in that you see for I found out long ago that it was gone whatever love there had been for Billy But your tiger skin Oh yes I thought it was alive smiled Arkwright sadly when I asked you to help me fight it But one day very suddenly I discovered that it was nothing but a dead skin of dreams and memories But I made another discovery too I found that just beyond lay another one and that was very much alive Another one Alice turned to him in wonder But you never asked me to help you fight that one He shook his head No I couldn t you see You couldn t have helped me You d only have hindered me Hindered you Yes You see it was my love for you that I was fighting then Alice gave a low cry and flushed vividly but Arkwright hurried on his eyes turned away Oh I understand I know I m not asking for anything I heard some time ago of your engagement to Calderwell I ve tried many times to say the proper expected pretty speeches but I couldn t I will now though I do You have all my tenderest best wishes for your happiness dear If long ago I hadn t been such a blind fool as not to know my own heart But but there s some mistake interposed Alice palpitatingly with hanging head I I m not engaged to mister Calderwell Arkwright turned and sent a keen glance into her face You re not No But I heard that Calderwell He stopped helplessly You heard that mister Calderwell was engaged very likely But it so happens he isn t engaged to me murmured Alice faintly But long ago you said Arkwright paused his eyes still keenly searching her face Never mind what I said long ago laughed Alice trying unsuccessfully to meet his gaze One says lots of things at times you know Into Arkwright s eyes came a new light a light that plainly needed but a breath to fan it into quick fire Alice he said softly do you mean that maybe now I needn t try to fight that other tiger skin There was no answer Arkwright reached out a pleading hand Alice dear I ve loved you so long he begged unsteadily Don t you think that sometime if I was very very patient you could just begin to care a little for me Still there was no answer Then slowly Alice shook her head Her face was turned quite away which was a pity for if Arkwright could have seen the sudden tender mischief in her eyes his own would not have become so somber Not even a little bit I couldn t ever begin answered a half smothered voice Alice cried the man heart brokenly Alice turned now and for a fleeting instant let him see her eyes glowing with the love so long kept in relentless exile I couldn t because you see I began long ago she whispered Alice It was the same single word but spoken with a world of difference for into it now was crowded all the glory and the wonder of a great love Alice breathed the man again and this time the word was oh so tenderly whispered into the little pink and white ear of the girl in his arms I got delayed began Billy in the doorway Oh h she broke off beating a hushed but precipitate retreat Fully thirty minutes later Billy came to the door again This time her approach was heralded by a snatch of song I hope you ll excuse my being gone so long she smiled as she entered the room where her two guests sat decorously face to face at the chess table Well you know you said you d be gone ten minutes Arkwright reminded her politely Yes I know I did And Billy to her credit did not even smile at the man who did not know ten minutes from fifty CHAPTER XXX BY A BABY S HAND After all it was the baby s hand that did it as was proper and perhaps to be expected for surely was it not Bertram junior s place to show his parents that he was indeed no Wedge but a dear and precious Tie binding two loving loyal hearts more and more closely together It would seem indeed that Bertram junior thought so perhaps and very bravely he set about it though to carry out his purpose he had to turn his steps into an unfamiliar way a way of pain and weariness and danger It was Arkwright who told Bertram that the baby was very sick and that Billy wanted him Bertram went home at once to find a distracted white faced Billy and a twisted pain racked little creature who it was almost impossible to believe was the happy laughing baby boy he had left that morning For the next two weeks nothing was thought of in the silent old Beacon Street house but the tiny little life hovering so near Death s door that twice it appeared to have slipped quite across the threshold All through those terrible weeks it seemed as if Billy neither ate nor slept and always at her side comforting cheering and helping wherever possible was Bertram tender loving and marvelously thoughtful Then came the turning point when the universe itself appeared to hang upon a baby s breath Gradually almost imperceptibly came the fluttering back of the tiny spirit into the longing arms stretched so far far out to meet and hold it And the father and the mother looking into each other s sleepless dark ringed eyes knew that their son was once more theirs to love and cherish When two have gone together with a dear one down into the Valley of the Shadow of Death and have come back either mourning or rejoicing they find a different world from the one they had left Things that were great before seem small and some things that were small seem great At least Bertram and Billy found their world thus changed when together they came back bringing their son with them In the long weeks of convalescence when the healthy rosiness stole bit by bit into the baby s waxen face and the light of recognition and understanding crept day by day into the baby s eyes there was many a quiet hour for heart to heart talks between the two who so anxiously and joyously hailed every rosy tint and fleeting sparkle And there was so much to tell so much to hear so much to talk about And always running through everything was that golden thread of joy beside which all else paled that they had Baby and each other As if anything else mattered To be sure there was Bertram s arm Very early in their talks Billy found out about that But Billy with Baby getting well was not to be daunted even by this Nonsense darling not paint again indeed Why Bertram of course you will she cried confidently But Billy the doctor said began Bertram but Billy would not even listen Very well what if he did dear she interrupted What if he did say you couldn t use your right arm much again Billy s voice broke a little then quickly steadied into something very much like triumph You ve got your left one Bertram shook his head I can t paint with that Yes you can insisted Billy firmly Why Bertram what do you suppose you were given two arms for if not to fight with both of them And I m going to be ever so much prouder of what you paint now because I ll know how splendidly you worked to do it Besides there s Baby As if you weren t ever going to paint for Baby Why Bertram I m going to have you paint Baby one of these days Think how pleased he ll be to see it when he grows up He s nicer anyhow than any old Face of a Girl you ever did Paint Why Bertram darling of course you re going to paint and better than you ever did before Bertram shook his head again but this time he smiled and patted Billy s cheek with the tip of his forefinger As if I could he disclaimed But that afternoon he went into his long deserted studio and hunted up his last unfinished picture For some time he stood motionless before it then with a quick gesture of determination he got out his palette paints and brushes This time not until he had painted ten a dozen a score of strokes did he drop his brush with a sigh and carefully erase the fresh paint on the canvas The next day he worked longer and this time he allowed a little a very little of what he had done to remain The third day Billy herself found him at his easel I wonder do you suppose I could he asked fearfully Why dearest of course you can Haven t you noticed Can t you see how much more you can do with your left hand now You ve had to use it you see I ve seen you do a lot of things with it lately that you never used to do at all And of course the more you do with it the more you can I know but that doesn t mean that I can paint with it sighed Bertram ruefully eyeing the tiny bit of fresh color his canvas showed for his long afternoon s work You wait and see nodded Billy with so overwhelming a cheery confidence that Bertram looking into her glowing face was conscious of a curious throb of exultation almost as if already the victory were his But it was not always of Bertram s broken arm nor even of his work that they talked Bertram hanging over the baby s crib to assure himself that the rosiness and the sparkle were really growing more apparent every day used to wonder sometimes how ever in the world he could have been jealous of his son He said as much one day to Billy To Billy it was a most astounding idea You mean you were actually jealous of your own baby she gasped Why Bertram how could And was that why you you sought distraction and Oh but Bertram that was all my f fault she quavered remorsefully I wouldn t play nor sing nor go to walk nor anything and I wore horrid frowzy wrappers all the time and Oh come come Billy expostulated the man I m not going to have you talk like that about my wife But I did the book said I did wailed Billy The book Good heavens Are there any books in this too demanded Bertram Yes the same one the the Talks to Young Wives nodded Billy And then because some things had grown small to them and some others great they both laughed happily But even this was not quite all for one evening very shyly Billy brought out the chessboard Of course I can t play well she faltered and maybe you don t want to play with me at all But Bertram when he found out why she had learned was very sure he did want very much to play with her Billy did not beat of course But she did several times experience for a few blissful minutes the pleasure of seeing Bertram sit motionless studying the board because of a move she had made And though in the end her king was ignominiously trapped with not an unguarded square upon which to set his poor distracted foot the memory of those blissful minutes when she had made Bertram stare more than paid for the final checkmate By the middle of June the baby was well enough to be taken to the beach and Bertram was so fortunate as to secure the same house they had occupied before Once again William went down in Maine for his fishing trip and the Strata was closed In the beach house Bertram was painting industriously with his left hand Almost he was beginning to feel Billy s enthusiasm Almost he was believing that he was doing good work It was not the Face of a Girl now It was the face of a baby smiling laughing even crying sometimes at other times just gazing straight into your eyes with adorable soberness Bertram still went into Boston twice a week for treatment though the treatment itself had changed The great surgeon had sent him to still another specialist There s a chance though perhaps a small one he had said I d like you to try it anyway As the summer advanced Bertram thought sometimes that he could see a slight improvement in his injured arm but he tried not to think too much about this He had thought the same thing before only to be disappointed in the end Besides he was undeniably interested just now in seeing if he could paint with his left hand Billy was so sure and she had said that she would be prouder than ever of him if he could and he would like to make Billy proud Then too there was the baby he had no idea a baby could be so interesting to paint He was not sure but that he was going to like to paint babies even better than he had liked to paint his Face of a Girl that had brought him his first fame In September the family returned to the Strata The move was made a little earlier this year on account of Alice Greggory s wedding Alice was to be married in the pretty living room at the Annex just where Billy herself had been married a few short years before and Billy had great plans for the wedding not all of which she was able to carry out for Alice like Marie before her had very strong objections to being placed under too great obligations And you see really anyway she told Billy I owe the whole thing to you to begin with even my husband Nonsense Of course you don t disputed Billy But I do If it hadn t been for you I should never have found him again and of course I shouldn t have had this dear little home to be married in And I never could have left mother if she hadn t had Aunt Hannah and the Annex which means you And if I hadn t found mister Arkwright I might never have known how how I could go back to my old home as I am going on my honeymoon trip and just know that every one of my old friends who shakes hands with me isn t pitying me now because I m my father s daughter And that means you for you see I never would have known that my father s name was cleared if it hadn t been for you And Oh Alice please please begged Billy laughingly raising two protesting hands Why don t you say that it s to me you owe just breathing and be done with it Well I will then avowed Alice doggedly And it s true too for honestly my dear I don t believe I would have been breathing to day nor mother either if you hadn t found us that morning and taken us out of those awful rooms I Never You wouldn t let me take you out laughed Billy You proud little thing Maybe you ve forgotten how you turned poor Uncle William and me out into the cold cold world that morning just because we dared to aspire to your Lowestoft teapot but I haven t Oh Billy please don t begged Alice the painful color staining her face If you knew how I ve hated myself since for the way I acted that day and really you did take us away from there you know No I didn t I merely found two good tenants for mister and missus Delano corrected Billy with a sober face Oh yes I know all about that smiled Alice affectionately and you got mother and me here to keep Aunt Hannah company and teach Tommy Dunn and you got Aunt Hannah here to keep us company and take care of Tommy Dunn and you got Tommy Dunn here so Aunt Hannah and we could have somebody to teach and take care of and as for the others But Billy put her hands to her ears and fled The wedding was to be on the fifteenth From the West Kate wrote that of course it was none of her affairs particularly as neither of the interested parties was a relation but still she should think that for a man in mister Arkwright s position nothing but a church wedding would do at all as of course he did in a way belong to the public Alice however declared that perhaps he did belong to the public when he was Don Somebody or other in doublet and hose but when he was just plain Michael Jeremiah Arkwright in a frock coat he was hers and she did not propose to make a Grand Opera show of her wedding And as Arkwright too very much disapproved of the church wedding idea the two were married in the Annex living room at noon on the fifteenth as originally planned in spite of missus Kate Hartwell s letter It was soon after the wedding that Bertram told Billy he wished she would sit for him with Bertram junior I want to try my hand at you both together he coaxed Why of course if you like dear agreed Billy promptly though I think Baby is just as nice and even nicer alone Once again all over Bertram s studio began to appear sketches of Billy this time a glorified tender Billy with the wonderful mother love in her eyes Then after several sketches of trial poses Bertram began his picture of Billy and the baby together Even now Bertram was not sure of his work He knew that he could not yet paint with his old freedom and ease he knew that his stroke was not so sure so untrammeled But he knew too that he had gained wonderfully during the summer and that he was gaining now every day To Billy he said nothing of all this Even to himself he scarcely put his hope into words but in his heart he knew that what he was really painting his Mother and Child picture for was the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition in March if he could but put upon canvas the vision that was spurring him on And so Bertram worked all through those short winter days not always upon the one picture of course but upon some picture or sketch that would help to give his still uncertain left hand the skill that had belonged to its mate And always cheering encouraging insisting on victory was Billy so that even had Bertram been tempted sometimes to give up he could not have done so and faced Billy s grieved disappointed eyes And when at last his work was completed and the pictured mother and child in all their marvelous life and beauty seemed ready to step from the canvas Billy drew a long ecstatic breath Oh Bertram it is it is the best work you have ever done Billy was looking at the baby Always she had ignored herself as part of the picture And won t it be fine for the Exhibition Bertram s hand tightened on the chair back in front of him For a moment he could not speak Then a bit huskily he asked Would you dare risk it Risk it Why Bertram Henshaw I ve meant that picture for the Exhibition from the very first only I never dreamed you could get it so perfectly lovely Now what do you say about Baby being nicer than any old Face of a Girl that you ever did she triumphed And Bertram who even to himself had not dared whisper the word exhibition gave a tremulous laugh that was almost a sob so overwhelming was his sudden realization of what faith and confidence had meant to Billy his wife If there was still a lingering doubt in Bertram s mind it must have been dispelled in less than an hour after the Bohemian Ten Club Exhibition flung open its doors on its opening night Once again Bertram found his picture the cynosure of all admiring eyes and himself the center of an enthusiastic group of friends and fellow artists who vied with each other in hearty words of congratulation And when later the feared critics whose names and opinions counted for so much in his world had their say in the daily press and weekly reviews Bertram knew how surely indeed he had won And when he read that Henshaw s work shows now a peculiar strength a sort of reserve power as it were which beautiful as was his former work it never showed before he smiled grimly and said to Billy I suppose now that was the fighting I did with my good left hand eh dear But there was yet one more drop that was to make Bertram s cup of joy brim to overflowing It came just one month after the Exhibition in the shape of a terse dozen words from the doctor Bertram fairly flew home that day He had no consciousness of any means of locomotion He thought he was going to tell his wife at once his great good news but when he saw her speech suddenly fled and all that he could do was to draw her closely to him with his left arm and hide his face Why Bertram dearest what what is it stammered the thoroughly frightened Billy Has anything happened No no yes yes everything has happened I mean it s going to happen choked the man Billy that old chap says that I m going to have my arm again Think of it my good right arm that I ve lost so long Oh Bertram breathed Billy And she too fell to sobbing Later when speech was more coherent she faltered Well anyway it doesn t make any difference how many beautiful pictures you p paint after this Bertram I can t be prouder of any than I am of the one your l left hand did Oh but I have you to thank for all that dear No you haven t disputed Billy blinking teary eyes but she paused then went on spiritedly but anyhow I I don t believe any one not even Kate can say now that that I ve been a hindrance to you in your c career Hindrance scoffed Bertram in a tone that left no room for doubt and with a kiss that left even less if possible Billy for still another minute was silent then with a wistfulness that was half playful half serious she sighed Bertram I believe being married is something like clocks you know specially at the first Clocks dear Yes I was out to Aunt Hannah s to day She was fussing with her clock the one that strikes half an hour ahead and I saw all those quantities of wheels little and big that have to go just so with all the little cogs fitting into all the other little cogs just exactly right Well that s like marriage See There s such a lot of little cogs in everyday life that have to be fitted so they ll run smoothly that have to be adjusted specially at the first Oh Billy what an idea But it s so really Bertram Anyhow I know my cogs were always getting out of place at the first laughed Billy And I was like Aunt Hannah s clock too always going off half an hour ahead of time And maybe I shall be so again sometimes But Bertram her voice shook a little if you ll just look at my face you ll see that I tell the right time there just as Aunt Hannah s clock does I m sure always I ll tell the right time there even if I do go off half an hour ahead As if I didn t know that answered Bertram very low and tenderly
