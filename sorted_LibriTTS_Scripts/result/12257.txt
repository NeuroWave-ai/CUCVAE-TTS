4379-190740-0000	train-other-500	mister Alden P Ricks known in Pacific Coast wholesale lumber and shipping circles as Cappy Ricks had more troubles than a hen with ducklings
none	none	 He remarked as much to mister Skinner president and general manager of the Ricks Logging Lumbering Company the corporate entity which represented Cappy s vast lumber interests and he fairly 
4379-190740-0002	train-other-500	barked the information at Captain Matt Peasley his son in law and also president and manager of the Blue Star Navigation Company another corporate entity which represented the Ricks interest
none	none	 in the American mercantile marine mister Skinner received this information in silence He was not related to Cappy Ricks But Matt Peasley sat down crossed his legs and matched glares with his mercurial father in law You have troubles he jeered with emphasis on the pronoun Have you got a misery in your back or is Herbert Hoover the wrong man for Secretary of Commerce Stow your sarcasm young feller Cappy shrilled You know dad blamed well it isn t a question of health or politics It s the fact that in my old age I find myself totally surrounded by the choicest aggregation of mental duds since Ajax defied the lightning Meaning whom You and Skinner Why what have we done 
4379-190740-0003	train-other-500	You argued me into taking on the management of twenty five of those infernal Shipping Board freighters and no sooner do we have them allocated to us than a near panic hits the country
4379-190740-0004	train-other-500	freight rates go to glory marine engineers go on strike and every infernal young whelp we send out to take charge of one of our offices in the Orient promptly gets the swelled head and thinks
4379-190740-0005	train-other-500	he s divinely ordained to drink up all the synthetic Scotch whiskey manufactured in Japan for the benefit of thirsty Americans In my old age you two have forced
none	none	 us into the position of having to fire folks by cable 
4379-190740-0006	train-other-500	Why Because we re breaking into a game that can t be played on the home grounds A lot of our business is so far away we can t control it Matt Peasley leveled an accusing finger at Cappy Ricks
none	none	 We never argued you into taking over the management of those Shipping Board boats We argued me into it I m the goat You have nothing to do with it You retired ten years ago 
4379-190740-0007	train-other-500	All the troubles in the marine end of this shop belong on my capable shoulders old settler Theoretically yes Actually no
none	none	 I hope you do not expect me to abandon mental as well as physical effort Great Wampus Cats Am I to be denied a sentimental interest in matters where I have a controlling financial interest I admit you two boys are running my affairs and ordinarily you run them rather well but but ahem Harumph h h What s the matter with you Matt 
4379-190740-0008	train-other-500	And you also Skinner If Matt makes a mistake it s your job to remind him of it before the results manifest themselves is it not And vice versa Have you two boobs lost your ability to judge men or did you ever have such ability
none	none	 You re referring to Henderson of the Shanghai office I dare say mister Skinner cut in I am Skinner And I m here to remind you that if we d stuck to our own game 
4379-190740-0009	train-other-500	which is coast wise shipping and had left the trans Pacific field with its general cargoes to others we wouldn t have any Shanghai office at this moment
none	none	 and we would not be pestered by the Hendersons of this world He s the best lumber salesman we ve ever had mister Skinner defended I had every hope that he would send us orders for many a cargo for Asiatic delivery 
4379-190740-0010	train-other-500	And he had gone through every job in this office from office boy to sales manager in the lumber department and from freight clerk to passenger agent in the navigation company Matt Peasley supplemented I admit all of that
none	none	 But did you consult me when you decided to send him out to China on his own Of course not I m boss of the Blue Star Navigation Company am I not The man was in charge of the Shanghai office before you ever opened your mouth to discharge your cargo of free advice I told you then that Henderson wouldn t make good didn t I You did And now I have an opportunity to tell you the little tale you didn t give me an opportunity to tell you before you sent him out 
4379-190740-0011	train-other-500	Henderson was a good man a crackerjack man when he had a better man over him But I ve been twenty years reducing a tendency on the part of that fellow s head to bust his hat band
4379-190740-0012	train-other-500	And now he s gone south with a hundred and thirty thousand taels of our Shanghai bank account Permit me to remind you mister Ricks
none	none	 mister Skinner cut in coldly that he was bonded to the extent of a quarter of a million dollars Not a peep out of you Skinner Not a peep Permit me to remind you that I m the little genius who placed that insurance unknown to you and Matt And I recall now that I was reminded by you Matthew my son that I had retired ten years ago and please would I quit interfering in the internal administration of your office 
4379-190740-0013	train-other-500	Well I must admit your far sightedness in that instance will keep the Shanghai office out of the red ink this year Matt Peasley replied However we face this situation Cappy
none	none	 Henderson has drunk and gambled and signed chits in excess of his salary 
4379-190740-0014	train-other-500	He hasn t attended to business and he s capped his inefficiency by absconding with our bank account We couldn t foresee that When we send a man out to the Orient to be our manager there we have to trust him
4379-190740-0015	train-other-500	all the way or not at all So there is no use weeping over spilled milk Cappy Our job is to select a successor to Henderson and send him out to Shanghai on the next boat Oh very well Matt Cappy replied
4379-190740-0016	train-other-500	magnanimously I ll not rub it into you I suppose I m far from generous bawling you out like this Perhaps
none	none	 when you re my age and have a lot of mental and moral cripples nip you 
4379-190740-0017	train-other-500	and draw blood as often as they ve drawn it on me you ll be a better judge than I of men worthy of the weight of responsibility Skinner have you got a candidate for this job I regret to say sir I have not
4379-190740-0018	train-other-500	All of the men in my department are quite young too young for the responsibility What do you mean young Cappy
none	none	 blazed 
4379-190740-0019	train-other-500	Well the only man I would consider for the job is Andrews and he is too young about thirty I should say About thirty eh
none	none	 Strikes me you were about twenty eight when I threw ten thousand a year at you in actual cash and a couple of million dollars worth of responsibility 
4379-190740-0020	train-other-500	Yes sir but then Andrews has never been tested Skinner
none	none	 Cappy interrupted in his most awful 
4379-190740-0021	train-other-500	voice it s a constant source of amazement to me why I refrain from firing you You say Andrews has never been tested Why hasn t he been tested
none	none	 Why are we maintaining untested material in this shop anyhow Eh Answer me that Tut tut tut 
4379-190740-0022	train-other-500	Not a peep out of you sir If you had done your Christian duty you would have taken a year s vacation when lumber was selling itself in nineteen nineteen and nineteen twenty and you would have left Andrews
none	none	 sitting in at your desk to see the sort of stuff he s made of It s a mighty lucky thing I didn t go away for a year Skinner protested respectfully 
4379-190740-0023	train-other-500	because the market broke like that and if you don t think
none	none	 we have to hustle to sell sufficient lumber to keep our own ships busy freighting it Skinner how dare you contradict me How old was Matt Peasley when I turned over the Blue Star Navigation Company to him lock stock and barrel Why he wasn t twenty six years old Skinner you re a dodo The killjoys like you who have straddled the neck of 
4379-190740-0024	train-other-500	industry and throttled it with absurd theories that a man s back must be bent like an ox bow and his locks snowy white before he can be entrusted with responsibility and a living wage have caused all of our wars and strikes
4379-190740-0025	train-other-500	This is a young man s world Skinner and don t you ever forget it The go getters of this world are under thirty years of age Matt he concluded turning to his son in law what do you think of Andrews for that Shanghai job I think he ll do Why do you think he ll do
none	none	 Because he ought to do He s been with us long enough to have acquired sufficient experience to enable him Has he acquired the courage to tackle the job Matt Cappy interrupted That s more important than this doggoned experience you and Skinner prate so much about I know nothing of his courage I assume that he has force and initiative 
4379-190740-0026	train-other-500	I know he has a pleasing personality
none	none	 Well before we send him out we ought to know whether or no he has force and initiative Then quoth Matt Peasley 
4379-190740-0027	train-other-500	rising I wash my hands of the job of selecting Henderson s successor You ve butted in so I suggest you name the lucky man Yes indeed Skinner agreed I m sure it s quite beyond my poor abilities to uncover
none	none	 Andrews force and initiative on such notice He does possess sufficient force and initiative for his present job but But will he possess force and initiative when he has to make a quick decision six thousand miles from expert advice and stand or fall by that decision That s what we want to know Skinner 
4379-190740-0028	train-other-500	I suggest sir mister Skinner replied with chill politeness that you conduct the examination I accept the nomination Skinner By the Holy Pink toed Prophet
none	none	 The next man we send out to that Shanghai office is going to be a go getter We ve had three managers go rotten on us and that s three too many And without further ado Cappy swung his aged legs up on to his desk and slid down in his swivel chair until he rested on his spine His head sank on his breast and he closed his eyes He s framing the examination for Andrews Matt Peasley whispered as he and Skinner made their exits II The President emeritus of the Ricks interests was not destined to uninterrupted cogitation however Within ten minutes his private exchange operator called him to the telephone What is it Cappy yelled into the transmitter There is a young man in the general office His name is mister William E Peck and he desires to see you personally Cappy sighed Very well he replied Have him shown in Almost immediately the office boy ushered mister Peck into Cappy s presence The moment he was fairly inside the door the visitor halted came easily and naturally to attention and bowed respectfully while the cool glance of his keen blue eyes held steadily the autocrat of the Blue Star Navigation Company mister Ricks Peck is my name sir William E Peck Thank you sir for acceding to my request for an interview Ahem Hum m m Cappy looked belligerent Sit down mister Peck mister Peck sat down but as he crossed to the chair beside Cappy s desk the old gentleman noticed that his visitor walked with a slight limp and that his left forearm had been amputated half way to the elbow To the observant Cappy the American Legion button in mister Peck s lapel told the story Well mister Peck he queried gently what can I do for you I ve called for my job the veteran replied briefly By the Holy Pink toed Prophet Cappy ejaculated you say that like a man who doesn t expect to be refused Quite right sir I do not anticipate a refusal Why mister William E Peck s engaging but somewhat plain features rippled into the most compelling smile Cappy Ricks had ever seen I am a salesman mister Ricks he replied I know that statement to be true because I have demonstrated over a period of five years that I can sell my share of anything that has a hockable value I have always found however that before proceeding to sell goods I had to sell the manufacturer of those goods something to wit myself I am about to sell myself to you Son said Cappy smilingly you win You ve sold me already When did they sell you a membership in the military forces of the United States of America On the morning of April seventh nineteen seventeen sir That clinches our sale I soldiered with the Knights of Columbus at Camp Kearny myself but when they refused to let me go abroad with my division my heart was broken so I went over the hill That little touch of the language of the line appeared to warm mister Peck s heart considerably establishing at once a free masonry between them I was with the Portland Lumber Company selling lumber in the Middle West before the war he explained Uncle Sam gave me my sheepskin at Letter man General Hospital last week with half disability on my ten thousand dollars worth of government insurance Whittling my wing was a mere trifle but my broken leg was a long time mending and now it s shorter than it really ought to be And I developed pneumonia with influenza and they found some T B indications after that I ve been at the government tuberculosis hospital at Fort Bayard New Mexico for a year However what s left of me is certified to be sound I ve got five inches chest expansion and I feel fine Not at all blue or discouraged Cappy hazarded Oh I got off easy mister Ricks I have my head left and my right arm I can think and I can write and even if one of my wheels is flat I can hike longer and faster after an order than most Got a job for me mister Ricks No I haven t mister Peck I m out of it you know Retired ten years ago This office is merely a headquarters for social frivolity a place to get my mail and mill over the gossip of the street Our mister Skinner is the chap you should see I have seen mister Skinner sir the erstwhile warrior replied but he wasn t very sympathetic I think he jumped to the conclusion that I was attempting to trade him my empty sleeve He informed me that there wasn t sufficient business to keep his present staff of salesmen busy so then I told him I d take anything from stenographer up I m the champion one handed typist of the United States Army I can tally lumber and bill it I can keep books and answer the telephone No encouragement eh No sir Well now son Cappy informed his cheerful visitor confidentially you take my tip and see my son in law Captain Peasley He s high low and jack in the game in the shipping end of our business I have also interviewed Captain Peasley He was very kind He said he felt that he owed me a job but business is so bad he couldn t make a place for me He told me he is now carrying a dozen ex service men merely because he hasn t the heart to let them go I believe him Well my dear boy my dear young friend Why do you come to me Because mister Peck replied smilingly I want you to go over their heads and give me a job I don t care a hoot what it is provided I can do it If I can do it I ll do it better than it was ever done before and if I can t do that I ll quit to save you the embarrassment of firing me I m not an object of charity but I m scarcely the man I used to be and I m four years behind the procession and have to catch up I have the best of references I see you have Cappy cut in blandly and pressed the push button on his desk mister Skinner entered He glanced disapprovingly at William E Peck and then turned inquiring eyes toward Cappy Ricks Skinner dear boy Cappy purred amiably I ve been thinking over the proposition to send Andrews out to the Shanghai office and I ve come to this conclusion We ll have to take a chance At the present time that office is in charge of a stenographer and we ve got to get a manager on the job without further loss of time So I ll tell you what we ll do We ll send Andrews out on the next boat but inform him that his position is temporary Then if he doesn t make good out there we can take him back into this office where he is a most valuable man Meanwhile ahem hum m m Harumph meanwhile you d oblige me greatly Skinner my dear boy if you would consent to take this young man into your office and give him a good work out to see the stuff he s made of As a favor to me Skinner my dear boy as a favor to me mister Skinner in the language of the sporting world was down for the count and knew it Young mister Peck knew it too and smiled graciously upon the general manager for young mister Peck had been in the army where one of the first great lessons to be assimilated is this that the commanding general s request is always tantamount to an order Very well sir mister Skinner replied coldly Have you arranged the compensation to be given mister Peck Cappy threw up a deprecating hand That detail is entirely up to you Skinner Far be it from me to interfere in the internal administration of your department Naturally you will pay mister Peck what he is worth and not a cent more He turned to the triumphant Peck Now you listen to me young feller If you think you re slipping gracefully into a good thing disabuse your mind of that impression right now You ll step right up to the plate my son and you ll hit the ball fairly on the nose and you ll do it early and often The first time you tip a foul you ll be warned The second time you do it you ll get a month s lay off to think it over and the third time you ll be out for keeps Do I make myself clear You do sir mister Peck declared happily All I ask is fighting room and I ll hack my way into mister Skinner s heart Thank you mister Skinner for consenting to take me on I appreciate your action very very much and shall endeavor to be worthy of your confidence Young scoundrel In fer nal young scoundrel Cappy murmured to himself He has a sense of humor thank God Ah poor old narrow gauge Skinner If that fellow ever gets a new or unconventional thought in his stodgy head it ll kill him overnight He s hopping mad right now because he can t say a word in his own defense but if he doesn t make hell look like a summer holiday for mister Bill Peck I m due to be mercifully chloroformed Good Lord how empty life would be if I couldn t butt in and raise a little riot every once in so often Young mister Peck had risen and was standing at attention When do I report for duty sir he queried of mister Skinner Whenever you re ready Skinner retorted with a wintry smile mister Peck glanced at a cheap wrist watch It s twelve o clock now he soliloquized aloud I ll pop out wrap myself around some rations and report on the job at one P M I might just as well knock out half a day s pay He glanced at Cappy Ricks and quoted Count that day lost whose low descending sun Finds prices shot to glory and business done for fun Unable to maintain his composure in the face of such levity during office hours mister Skinner withdrew still wrapped in his sub Antarctic dignity As the door closed behind him mister Peck s eyebrows went up in a manner indicative of apprehension I m off to a bad start mister Ricks he opined You only asked for a start Cappy piped back at him I didn t guarantee you a good start and I wouldn t because I can t I can only drive Skinner and Matt Peasley so far and no farther There s always a point at which I quit er ah William More familiarly known as Bill Peck sir Very well Bill Cappy slid out to the edge of his chair and peered at Bill Peck balefully over the top of his spectacles I ll have my eye on you young feller he shrilled I freely acknowledge our indebtedness to you but the day you get the notion in your head that this office is an old soldiers home He paused thoughtfully I wonder what Skinner will pay you he mused Oh well he continued whatever it is take it and say nothing and when the moment is propitious and provided you ve earned it I ll intercede with the danged old relic and get you a raise Thank you very much sir You are most kind Good day sir And Bill Peck picked up his hat and limped out of The Presence Scarcely had the door closed behind him than mister Skinner re entered Cappy Ricks lair He opened his mouth to speak but Cappy silenced him with an imperious finger Not a peep out of you Skinner my dear boy he chirped amiably I know exactly what you re going to say and I admit your right to say it but as ahem Harumph h h now Skinner listen to reason How the devil could you have the heart to reject that crippled ex soldier There he stood on one sound leg with his sleeve tucked into his coat pocket and on his homely face the grin of an unwhipped unbeatable man But you blast your cold unfeeling soul Skinner looked him in the eye and turned him down like a drunkard turns down near beer Skinner how could you do it Undaunted by Cappy s admonitory finger mister Skinner struck a distinctly defiant attitude There is no sentiment in business he replied angrily A week ago last Thursday the local posts of the American Legion commenced their organized drive for jobs for their crippled and unemployed comrades and within three days you ve sawed off two hundred and nine such jobs on the various corporations that you control The gang you shipped up to the mill in Washington has already applied for a charter for a new post to be known as Cappy Ricks Post No five hundred thirty four And you had experienced men discharged to make room for these ex soldiers You bet I did Cappy yelled triumphantly It s always Old Home Week in every logging camp and saw mill in the Northwest for I W W s and revolutionary communists I m sick of their unauthorized strikes and sabotage and by the Holy Pink Toed Prophet Cappy Ricks Post No five hundred thirty four American Legion is the only sort of back fire I can think of to put the Wobblies on the run Every office and ship and retail yard could be run by a first sergeant Skinner complained I m thinking of having reveille and retreat and bugle calls and Saturday morning inspections I tell you sir the Ricks interests have absorbed all the old soldiers possible and at the present moment those interests are overflowing with glory What we want are workers not talkers These ex soldiers spend too much time fighting their battles over again Well Comrade Peck is the last one I ll ask you to absorb Skinner Cappy promised contritely Ever read Kipling s Barrack Room Ballads Skinner I have no time to read mister Skinner protested Go up town this minute and buy a copy and read one ballad entitled Tommy Cappy barked For the good of your immortal soul he added Well Comrade Peck doesn t make a hit with me mister Ricks He applied to me for a job and I gave him his answer Then he went to Captain Matt and was refused so just to demonstrate his bad taste he went over our heads and induced you to pitchfork him into a job He ll curse the day he was inspired to do that Skinner Skinner Look me in the eye Do you know why I asked you to take on Bill Peck I do Because you re too tender hearted for your own good You unimaginative dunderhead You jibbering jackdaw How could I reject a boy who simply would not be rejected Why I ll bet a ripe peach that Bill Peck was one of the doggondest finest soldiers you ever saw He carries his objective He sized you up just like that Skinner He declined to permit you to block him Skinner that Peck person has been opposed by experts Yes sir experts What kind of a job are you going to give him Skinner my dear boy Andrews job of course Oh yes I forgot Skinner dear boy haven t we got about half a million feet of skunk spruce to saw off on somebody mister Skinner nodded and Cappy continued with all the naive eagerness of one who has just made a marvelous discovery which he is confident will revolutionize science Give him that stinking stuff to peddle Skinner and if you can dig up a couple of dozen carloads of red fir or bull pine in transit or some short or odd length stock or some larch ceiling or flooring or some hemlock random stock in fact anything the trade doesn t want as a gift you get me don t you Skinner mister Skinner smiled his swordfish smile And if he fails to make good au revoir eh Yes I suppose so although I hate to think about it On the other hand if he makes good he s to have Andrews salary We must be fair Skinner Whatever our faults we must always be fair He rose and patted the general manager s lean shoulder There there Skinner my boy Forgive me if I ve been a trifle ah ahem precipitate and er harumph h h Skinner if you put a prohibitive price on that skunk fir by the Holy Pink toed Prophet I ll fire you Be fair boy be fair No dirty work Skinner Remember Comrade Peck has half of his left forearm buried in France III At twelve thirty as Cappy was hurrying up California Street to luncheon at the Commercial Club he met Bill Peck limping down the sidewalk The ex soldier stopped him and handed him a card What do you think of that sir he queried Isn t it a neat business card Cappy read RICKS LUMBER LOGGING COMPANY Lumber and its products two hundred forty eight California saint San Francisco Represented by William E Peck If you can drive nails in it we have it Cappy Ricks ran a speculative thumb over Comrade Peck s business card It was engraved And copper plates or steel dies are not made in half an hour By the Twelve Ragged Apostles This was Cappy s most terrible oath and he never employed it unless rocked to his very foundations Bill as one bandit to another come clean When did you first make up your mind to go to work for us A week ago Comrade Peck replied blandly And what was your grade when Kaiser Bill went A W O L I was a buck I don t believe you Didn t anybody ever offer you something better Frequently However if I had accepted I would have had to resign the nicest job I ever had There wasn t much money in it but it was filled with excitement and interesting experiments I used to disguise myself as a Christmas tree or a box car and pick off German sharp shooters I was known as Peck s Bad Boy I was often tempted to quit but whenever I d reflect on the number of American lives I was saving daily a commission was just a scrap of paper to me If you d ever started in any other branch of the service you d have run John J Pershing down to lance corporal Bill listen Have you ever had any experience selling skunk spruce Comrade Peck was plainly puzzled He shook his head What sort of stock is it he asked Humboldt County California spruce and it s coarse and stringy and wet and heavy and smells just like a skunk directly after using I m afraid Skinner s going to start you at the bottom and skunk spruce is it Can you drive nails in it mister Ricks Oh yes Does anybody ever buy skunk spruce sir Oh occasionally one of our bright young men digs up a half wit who s willing to try anything once Otherwise of course we would not continue to manufacture it Fortunately Bill we have very little of it but whenever our woods boss runs across a good tree he hasn t the heart to leave it standing and as a result we always have enough skunk spruce on hand to keep our salesmen humble I can sell anything at a price Comrade Peck replied unconcernedly and continued on his way back to the office IV For two months Cappy Ricks saw nothing of Bill Peck That enterprising veteran had been sent out into the Utah Arizona New Mexico and Texas territory the moment he had familiarized himself with the numerous details regarding freight rates weights and the mills he represented all things which a salesman should be familiar with before he starts out on the road From Salt Lake City he wired an order for two carloads of larch rustic and in Ogden he managed to inveigle a retail yard with which mister Skinner had been trying to do business for years into sampling a carload of skunk spruce boards random lengths and grades at a dollar above the price given him by Skinner In Arizona he worked up some new business in mining timbers but it was not until he got into the heart of Texas that Comrade Peck really commenced to demonstrate his selling ability Standard oil derricks were his specialty and he shot the orders in so fast that mister Skinner was forced to wire him for mercy and instruct him to devote his talent to the disposal of cedar shingles and siding Douglas fir and redwood Eventually he completed his circle and worked his way home via Los Angeles pausing however in the San Joaquin Valley to sell two more carloads of skunk spruce When this order was wired in mister Skinner came to Cappy Ricks with the telegram Well I must admit Comrade Peck can sell lumber he announced grudgingly He has secured five new accounts and here is an order for two more carloads of skunk spruce I ll have to raise his salary about the first of the year My dear Skinner why the devil wait until the first of the year Your pernicious habit of deferring the inevitable parting with money has cost us the services of more than one good man You know you have to raise Comrade Peck s salary sooner or later so why not do it now and smile like a dentifrice advertisement while you re doing it Comrade Peck will feel a whole lot better as a result and who knows He may conclude you re a human being after all and learn to love you Very well sir I ll give him the same salary Andrews was getting before Peck took over his territory Skinner you make it impossible for me to refrain from showing you who s boss around here He s better than Andrews isn t he I think he is sir Well then for the love of a square deal pay him more and pay it to him from the first day he went to work Get out You make me nervous By the way how is Andrews getting along in his Shanghai job He s helping the cable company pay its income tax Cables about three times a week on matters he should decide for himself Matt Peasley is disgusted with him Ah Well I m not disappointed And I suppose Matt will be in here before long to remind me that I was the bright boy who picked Andrews for the job Well I did but I call upon you to remember Skinner when I m assailed that Andrews appointment was temporary Yes sir it was Well I suppose I ll have to cast about for his successor and beat Matt out of his cheap I told you so triumph I think Comrade Peck has some of the earmarks of a good manager for our Shanghai office but I ll have to test him a little further He looked up humorously at mister Skinner Skinner my dear boy he continued I m going to have him deliver a blue vase mister Skinner s cold features actually glowed Well tip the chief of police and the proprietor of the store off this time and save yourself some money he warned Cappy He walked to the window and looked down into California Street He continued to smile Yes Cappy continued dreamily I think I shall give him the thirty third degree You ll agree with me Skinner that if he delivers the blue vase he ll be worth ten thousand dollars a year as our Oriental manager I ll say he will mister Skinner replied slangily Very well then Arrange matters Skinner so that he will be available for me at one o clock a week from Sunday I ll attend to the other details mister Skinner nodded He was still chuckling when he departed for his own office V A week from the succeeding Saturday mister Skinner did not come down to the office but a telephone message from his home informed the chief clerk that mister Skinner was at home and somewhat indisposed The chief clerk was to advise mister Peck that he mister Skinner had contemplated having a conference with the latter that day but that his indisposition would prevent this mister Skinner hoped to be feeling much better tomorrow and since he was very desirous of a conference with mister Peck before the latter should depart on his next selling pilgrimage on Monday would mister Peck be good enough to call at mister Skinner s house at one o clock Sunday afternoon mister Peck sent back word that he would be there at the appointed time and was rewarded with mister Skinner s thanks via the chief clerk Promptly at one o clock the following day Bill Peck reported at the general manager s house He found mister Skinner in bed reading the paper and looking surprisingly well He trusted mister Skinner felt better than he looked mister Skinner did and at once entered into a discussion of the new customers other prospects he particularly desired mister Peck to approach new business to be investigated and further details without end And in the midst of this conference Cappy Riggs telephoned A portable telephone stood on a commode beside mister Skinner s bed so the latter answered immediately Comrade Peck watched Skinner listen attentively for fully two minutes then heard him say mister Ricks I m terribly sorry I d love to do this errand for you but really I m under the weather In fact I m in bed as I speak to you now But mister Peck is here with me and I m sure he ll be very happy to attend to the matter for you By all means Bill Peck hastened to assure the general manager Who does mister Ricks want killed and where will he have the body delivered Hah hah Hah Hah mister Skinner had a singularly annoying mirthless laugh as if he begrudged himself such an unheard of indulgence mister Peck says he informed Cappy that he ll be delighted to attend to the matter for you He wants to know whom you want killed and where you wish the body delivered Hah hah Hah Peck mister Ricks will speak to you Bill Peck took the telephone Good afternoon mister Ricks Hello old soldier What are you doing this afternoon Nothing after I conclude my conference with mister Skinner By the way he has just given me a most handsome boost in salary for which I am most appreciative I feel however despite mister Skinner s graciousness that you have put in a kind word for me with him and I want to thank you Tut tut Not a peep out of you sir Not a peep You get nothing for nothing from Skinner or me However in view of the fact that you re feeling kindly toward me this afternoon I wish you d do a little errand for me I can t send a boy and I hate to make a messenger out of you er ah ahem That is har umph h h I have no false pride mister Ricks Thank you Bill Glad you feel that way about it Bill I was prowling around town this forenoon after church and down in a store on Sutter Street between Stockton and Powell Street on the right hand side as you face Market Street I saw a blue vase in a window I have a weakness for vases Bill I m a sharp on them too Now this vase I saw isn t very expensive as vases go in fact I wouldn t buy it for my collection but one of the finest and sweetest ladies of my acquaintance has the mate to that blue vase I saw in the window and I know she d be prouder than Punch if she had two of them one for each side of her drawing room mantel understand Now I m leaving from the Southern Pacific depot at eight o clock tonight bound for Santa Barbara to attend her wedding anniversary tomorrow night I forget what anniversary it is Bill but I have been informed by my daughter that I ll be very much de trop if I send her any present other than something in porcelain or China or Cloisonne well Bill this crazy little blue vase just fills the order Understand Yes sir You feel that it would be most graceful on your part if you could bring this little blue vase down to Santa Barbara with you tonight You have to have it tonight because if you wait until the store opens on Monday the vase will reach your hostess twenty four hours after her anniversary party Exactly Bill Now I ve simply got to have that vase If I had discovered it yesterday I wouldn t be asking you to get it for me today Bill Please do not make any explanations or apologies mister Ricks You have described the vase no you haven t What sort of blue is it how tall is it and what is approximately its greatest diameter Does it set on a base or does it not Is it a solid blue or is it figured It s a Cloisonne vase Bill sort of old Dutch blue or Delft with some Oriental funny business on it I couldn t describe it exactly but it has some birds and flowers on it It s about a foot tall and four inches in diameter and sets on a teak wood base Very well sir You shall have it And you ll deliver it to me in stateroom A car seven aboard the train at Third and Townsend Streets at seven fifty five tonight Yes sir Thank you Bill The expense will be trifling Collect it from the cashier in the morning and tell him to charge it to my account And Cappy hung up At once mister Skinner took up the thread of the interrupted conference and it was not until three o clock that Bill Peck left his house and proceeded downtown to locate Cappy Rick s blue vase He proceeded to the block in Sutter Street between Stockton and Powell Streets and although he walked patiently up one side of the street and down the other not a single vase of any description showed in any shop window nor could he find a single shop where such a vase as Cappy had described might perchance be displayed for sale I think the old boy has erred in the company ordinates of the target Bill Peck concluded or else I misunderstood him I ll telephone his house and ask him to repeat them He did but nobody was at home except a Swedish maid and all she knew was that mister Ricks was out and the hour of his return was unknown So mister Peck went back to Sutter Street and scoured once more every shop window in the block Then he scouted two blocks above Powell and two blocks below Stockton Still the blue vase remained invisible So he transferred his search to a corresponding area on Bush Street and when that failed he went painstakingly over four blocks of Post Street He was still without results when he moved one block further west and one further south and discovered the blue vase in a huge plate glass window of a shop on Geary Street near Grant Avenue He surveyed it critically and was convinced that it was the object he sought He tried the door but it was locked as he had anticipated it would be So he kicked the door and raised an infernal racket hoping against hope that the noise might bring a watchman from the rear of the building In vain He backed out to the edge of the sidewalk and read the sign over the door B Cohen s Art Shop This was a start so mister Peck limped over to the Palace Hotel and procured a telephone directory By actual count there were nineteen B Cohens scattered throughout the city so before commencing to call the nineteen Bill Peck borrowed the city directory from the hotel clerk and scanned it for the particular B Cohen who owned the art shop His search availed him nothing B Cohen was listed as an art dealer at the address where the blue vase reposed in the show window That was all I suppose he s a commuter mister Peck concluded and at once proceeded to procure directories of the adjacent cities of Berkeley Oakland and Alameda They were not available so in despair he changed a dollar into five cent pieces sought a telephone booth and commenced calling up all the B Cohens in San Francisco Of the nineteen four did not answer three were temporarily disconnected six replied in Yiddish five were not the B Cohen he sought and one swore he was Irish and that his name was spelled Cohan and pronounced with an accent on both syllables The B Cohens resident in Berkeley Oakland Alameda San Rafael Sausalito Mill Valley San Mateo Redwood City and Palo Alto were next telephoned to and when this long and expensive task was done Ex Private Bill Peck emerged from the telephone booth wringing wet with perspiration and as irritable as a clucking hen Once outside the hotel he raised his haggard face to heaven and dumbly queried of the Almighty what He meant by saving him from quick death on the field of honor only to condemn him to be talked to death by B Cohens in civil life It was now six o clock Suddenly Peck had an inspiration Was the name spelled Cohen Cohan Cohn Kohn or Coen If I have to take a Jewish census again tonight I ll die he told himself desperately and went back to the art shop The sign read B COHN S ART SHOP I wish I knew a bootlegger s joint poor Peck complained I m pretty far gone and a little wood alcohol couldn t hurt me much now Why I could have sworn that name was spelled with an E It seems to me I noted that particularly He went back to the hotel telephone booth and commenced calling up all the B Cohns in town There were eight of them and six of them were out one was maudlin with liquor and the other was very deaf and shouted unintelligibly Peace hath its barbarities no less than war mister Peck sighed He changed a twenty dollar bill into nickles dimes and quarters returned to the hot ill smelling telephone booth and proceeded to lay down a barrage of telephone calls to the B Cohns of all towns of any importance contiguous to San Francisco Bay And he was lucky On the sixth call he located the particular B Cohn in San Rafael only to be informed by mister Cohn s cook that mister Cohn was dining at the home of a mister Simons in Mill Valley There were three mister Simons in Mill Valley and Peck called them all before connecting with the right one Yes mister B Cohn was there Who wished to speak to him mister Heck Oh mister Lake A silence Then mister Cohn says he doesn t know any mister Lake and wants to know the nature of your business He is dining and doesn t like to be disturbed unless the matter is of grave importance Tell him mister Peck wishes to speak to him on a matter of very great importance wailed the ex private mister Metz mister Ben Metz No no no Peck p e c k D e c k No P C P Oh yes E E what C K Oh yes mister Eckstein Call Cohn to the phone or I ll go over there on the next boat and kill you you damned idiot shrieked Peck Tell him his store is on fire That message was evidently delivered for almost instantly mister B Cohn was puffing and spluttering into the phone Iss dot der fire marshal he managed to articulate Listen mister Cohn Your store is not on fire but I had to say so in order to get you to the telephone I am mister Peck a total stranger to you You have a blue vase in your shop window on Geary Street in San Francisco I want to buy it and I want to buy it before seven forty five tonight I want you to come across the bay and open the store and sell me that vase Such a business Vot you think I am Crazy No mister Cohn I do not I m the only crazy man talking I m crazy for that vase and I ve got to have it right away You know vot dot vase costs mister B Cohn s voice dripped syrup No and I don t give a hoot what it costs I want what I want when I want it Do I get it Ve ell lemme see Vot time iss it A silence while B Cohn evidently looked at his watch It iss now a quarter of seven mister Eckstein und der nexd drain from Mill Valley don t leaf until eight o clock Dot vill get me to San Francisco at eight fifty und I am dining mit friends und haf just finished my soup To hell with your soup I want that blue vase Vell I tell you mister Eckstein if you got to have it call up my head salesman Herman Joost in der Chilton Apardments Prospect three two four nine und tell him I said he should come down right avay qvick und sell you dot blue vase Goodbye mister Eckstein And B Cohn hung up Instantly Peck called Prospect three thousand two hundred forty nine and asked for Herman Joost mister Joost s mother answered She was desolated because Herman was not at home but vouchsafed the information that he was dining at the country club Which country club She did not know So Peck procured from the hotel clerk a list of the country clubs in and around San Francisco and started calling them up At eight o clock he was still being informed that mister Juice was not a member that mister Luce wasn t in that mister Coos had been dead three months and that mister Boos had played but eight holes when he received a telegram calling him back to New York At the other clubs mister Joust was unknown Licked murmured Bill Peck but never let it be said that I didn t go down fighting I m going to heave a brick through that show window grab the vase and run with it He engaged a taxicab and instructed the driver to wait for him at the corner of Geary and Stockton Streets Also he borrowed from the chauffeur a ball peen hammer When he reached the art shop of B Cohn however a policeman was standing in the doorway violating the general orders of a policeman on duty by surreptitiously smoking a cigar He ll nab me if I crack that window the desperate Peck decided and continued on down the street crossed to the other side and came back It was now dark and over the art shop B Cohn s name burned in small red white and blue electric lights And lo it was spelled B Cohen Ex private William E Peck sat down on a fire hydrant and cursed with rage His weak leg hurt him too and for some damnable reason the stump of his left arm developed the feeling that his missing hand was itchy The world is filled with idiots he raved furiously I m tired and I m hungry I skipped luncheon and I ve been too busy to think of dinner He walked back to his taxicab and returned to the hotel where hope springing eternal in his breast he called Prospect three thousand two hundred forty nine again and discovered that the missing Herman Joost had returned to the bosom of his family To him the frantic Peck delivered the message of B Cohn whereupon the cautious Herman Joost replied that he would confirm the authenticity of the message by telephoning to mister Cohn at mister Simon s home in Mill Valley If mister B Cohn or Cohen confirmed mister Kek s story he the said Herman Joost would be at the store sometime before nine o clock and if mister Kek cared to he might await him there mister Kek said he would be delighted to wait for him there At nine fifteen Herman Joost appeared on the scene On his way down the street he had taken the precaution to pick up a policeman and bring him along with him The lights were switched on in the store and mister Joost lovingly abstracted the blue vase from the window What s the cursed thing worth Peck demanded Two thousand dollars mister Joost replied without so much as the quiver of an eyelash Cash he added apparently as an afterthought The exhausted Peck leaned against the sturdy guardian of the law and sighed This was the final straw He had about ten dollars in his possession You refuse absolutely to accept my check he quavered I don t know you mister Peck Herman Joost replied simply Where s your telephone mister Joost led Peck to the telephone and the latter called up mister Skinner mister Skinner he announced this is all that is mortal of Bill Peck speaking I ve got the store open and for two thousand dollars cash I can buy the blue vase mister Ricks has set his heart upon Oh Peck dear fellow mister Skinner purred sympathetically Have you been all this time on that errand I have And I m going to stick on the job until I deliver the goods For God s sake let me have two thousand dollars and bring it down to me at B Cohen s Art Shop on Geary Street near Grant Avenue I m too utterly exhausted to go up after it My dear mister Peck I haven t two thousand dollars in my house That is too great a sum of money to keep on hand Well then come downtown open up the office safe and get the money for me Time lock on the office safe Peck Impossible Well then come downtown and identify me at hotels and cafes and restaurants so I can cash my own check Is your check good mister Peck The flood of invective which had been accumulating in mister Peck s system all the afternoon now broke its bounds He screamed at mister Skinner a blasphemous invitation to betake himself to the lower regions Tomorrow morning he promised hoarsely I ll beat you to death with the stump of my left arm you miserable cold blooded lazy shiftless slacker He called up Cappy Ricks residence next and asked for Captain Matt Peasley who he knew made his home with his father in law Matt Peasley came to the telephone and listened sympathetically to Peck s tale of woe Peck that s the worst outrage I ever heard of he declared The idea of setting you such a task You take my advice and forget the blue vase I can t Peck panted mister Ricks will feel mighty chagrined if I fail to get the vase to him I wouldn t disappoint him for my right arm He s been a dead game sport with me Captain Peasley But it s too late to get the vase to him Peck He left the city at eight o clock and it is now almost half past nine I know but if I can secure legal possession of the vase I ll get it to him before he leaves the train at Santa Barbara at six o clock tomorrow morning How There s a flying school out at the Marina and one of the pilots there is a friend of mine He ll fly to Santa Barbara with me and the vase You re crazy I know it Please lend me two thousand dollars What for To pay for the vase Now I know you re crazy or drunk Why if Cappy Ricks ever forgot himself to the extent of paying two hundred dollars for a vase he d bleed to death in an hour Won t you let me have two thousand dollars Captain Peasley I will not Peck old son Go home and to bed and forget it Please You can cash your checks You re known so much better than I and it s Sunday night And it s a fine way to keep holy the Sabbath day Matt Peasley retorted and hung up Well Herman Joost queried do we stay here all night Bill Peck bowed his head Look here he demanded suddenly do you know a good diamond when you see it I do Herman Joost replied Will you wait here until I go to my hotel and get one Sure Bill Peck limped painfully away Forty minutes later he returned with a platinum ring set with diamonds and sapphires What are they worth he demanded Herman Joost looked the ring over lovingly and appraised it conservatively at twenty five hundred dollars Take it as security for the payment of my check Peck pleaded Give me a receipt for it and after my check has gone through clearing I ll come back and get the ring Fifteen minutes later with the blue vase packed in excelsior and reposing in a stout cardboard box Bill Peck entered a restaurant and ordered dinner When he had dined he engaged a taxi and was driven to the flying field at the Marina From the night watchman he ascertained the address of his pilot friend and at midnight with his friend at the wheel Bill Peck and his blue vase soared up into the moonlight and headed south An hour and a half later they landed in a stubble field in the Salinas Valley and bidding his friend good bye Bill Peck trudged across to the railroad track and sat down When the train bearing Cappy Ricks came roaring down the valley Peck twisted a Sunday paper with which he had provided himself into an improvised torch which he lighted Standing between the rails he swung the flaming paper frantically The train slid to a halt a brakeman opened a vestibule door and Bill Peck stepped wearily aboard What do you mean by flagging this train the brakeman demanded angrily as he signaled the engineer to proceed Got a ticket No but I ve got the money to pay my way And I flagged this train because I wanted to change my method of travel I m looking for a man in stateroom A of car seven and if you try to block me there ll be murder done That s right Take advantage of your half portion arm and abuse me the brakeman retorted bitterly Are you looking for that little old man with the Henry Clay collar and the white mutton chop whiskers I certainly am Well he was looking for you just before we left San Francisco He asked me if I had seen a one armed man with a box under his good arm I ll lead you to him A prolonged ringing at Cappy s stateroom door brought the old gentleman to the entrance in his nightshirt Very sorry to have to disturb you mister Ricks said Bill Peck but the fact is there were so many Cohens and Cohns and Cohans and it was such a job to dig up two thousand dollars that I failed to connect with you at seven forty five last night as per orders It was absolutely impossible for me to accomplish the task within the time limit set but I was resolved that you should not be disappointed Here is the vase The shop wasn t within four blocks of where you thought it was sir but I m sure I found the right vase It ought to be It cost enough and was hard enough to get so it should be precious enough to form a gift for any friend of yours Cappy Ricks stared at Bill Peck as if the latter were a wraith By the Twelve Ragged Apostles he murmured By the Holy Pink toed Prophet We changed the sign on you and we stacked the Cohens on you and we set a policeman to guard the shop to keep you from breaking the window and we made you dig up two thousand dollars on Sunday night in a town where you are practically unknown and while you missed the train at eight o clock you overtake it at two o clock in the morning and deliver the blue vase Come in and rest your poor old game leg Bill Brake man I m much obliged to you Bill Peck entered and slumped wearily down on the settee So it was a plant he cracked and his voice trembled with rage Well sir you re an old man and you ve been good to me so I do not begrudge you your little joke but mister Ricks I can t stand things like I used to My leg hurts and my stump hurts and my heart hurts He paused choking and the tears of impotent rage filled his eyes You shouldn t treat me that way sir he complained presently I ve been trained not to question orders even when they seem utterly foolish to me I ve been trained to obey them on time if possible but if impossible to obey them anyhow I ve been taught loyalty to my chief and I m sorry my chief found it necessary to make a buffoon of me I haven t had a very good time the past three years and and you can pa pa pass your skunk spruce and larch rustic and short odd length stock to some slacker like Skinner and you d better arrange to replace Skinner because he s young enough to take a beating and I m going to give it to him and it ll be a hospital job sir Cappy Ricks ruffled Bill Peck s aching head with a paternal hand Bill old boy it was cruel damnably cruel but I had a big job for you and I had to find out a lot of things about you before I entrusted you with that job So I arranged to give you the Degree of the Blue Vase which is the supreme test of a go getter You thought you carried into this stateroom a two thousand dollar vase but between ourselves what you really carried in was a ten thousand dollar job as our Shanghai manager Wha what Every time I have to pick out a permanent holder of a job worth ten thousand dollars or more I give the candidate the Degree of the Blue Vase Cappy explained I ve had two men out of a field of fifteen deliver the vase Bill Bill Peck had forgotten his rage but the tears of his recent fury still glistened in his bold blue eyes Thank you sir I forgive you and I ll make good in Shanghai I know you will Bill Now tell me son weren t you tempted to quit when you discovered the almost insuperable obstacles I d placed in your way Yes sir I was I wanted to commit suicide before I d finished telephoning all the C o h e n s in the world And when I started on the C o h n s well it s this way sir I just couldn t quit because that would have been disloyal to a man I once knew Who was he Cappy demanded and there was awe in his voice He was my brigadier and he had a brigade motto It shall be done When the divisional commander called him up and told him to move forward with his brigade and occupy certain territory our brigadier would say Very well sir It shall be done If any officer in his brigade showed signs of flunking his job because it appeared impossible the brigadier would just look at him once and then that officer would remember the motto and go and do his job or die trying In the army sir the esprit de corps doesn t bubble up from the bottom It filters down from the top An organization is what its commanding officer is neither better nor worse In my company when the top sergeant handed out a week of kitchen police to a buck that buck was out of luck if he couldn t muster a grin and say All right sergeant It shall be done The brigadier sent for me once and ordered me to go out and get a certain German sniper I d been pretty lucky some days I got enough for a mess and he d heard of me He opened a map and said to me Here s about where he holes up Go get him Private Peck Well mister Ricks I snapped into it and gave him a rifle salute and said Sir it shall be done and I ll never forget the look that man gave me He came down to the field hospital to see me after I d walked into one of those Austrian eighty eight s I knew my left wing was a total loss and I suspected my left leg was about to leave me and I was downhearted and wanted to die He came and bucked me up He said Why Private Peck you aren t half dead In civil life you re going to be worth half a dozen live ones aren t you But I was pretty far gone and I told him I didn t believe it so he gave me a hard look and said Private Peck will do his utmost to recover and as a starter he will smile Of course putting it in the form of an order I had to give him the usual reply so I grinned and said Sir it shall be done He was quite a man sir and his brigade had a soul his soul I see Bill And his soul goes marching on eh Who was he Bill Bill Peck named his idol By the Twelve Ragged Apostles There was awe in Cappy Ricks voice there was reverence in his faded old eyes Son he continued gently twenty five years ago your brigadier was a candidate for an important job in my employ and I gave him the Degree of the Blue Vase He couldn t get the vase legitimately so he threw a cobble stone through the window grabbed the vase and ran a mile and a half before the police captured him Cost me a lot of money to square the case and keep it quiet But he was too good Bill and I couldn t stand in his way I let him go forward to his destiny But tell me Bill How did you get the two thousand dollars to pay for this vase Once said ex Private Peck thoughtfully the brigadier and I were first at a dug out entrance It was a headquarters dug out and they wouldn t surrender so I bombed them and then we went down I found a finger with a ring on it and the brigadier said if I didn t take the ring somebody else would I left that ring as security for my check But how could you have the courage to let me in for a two thousand dollar vase Didn t you realize that the price was absurd and that I might repudiate the transaction Certainly not You are responsible for the acts of your servant You are a true blue sport and would never repudiate my action You told me what to do but you did not insult my intelligence by telling me how to do it When my late brigadier sent me after the German sniper he didn t take into consideration the probability that the sniper might get me He told me to get the sniper It was my business to see to it that I accomplished my mission and carried my objective which of course I could not have done if I had permitted the German to get me I see Bill Well give that blue vase to the porter in the morning I paid fifteen cents for it in a five ten and fifteen cent store Meanwhile hop into that upper berth and help yourself to a well earned rest But aren t you going to a wedding anniversary at Santa Barbara mister Ricks I am not Bill I discovered a long time ago that it s a good idea for me to get out of town and play golf as often as I can Besides which prudence dictates that I remain away from the office for a week after the seeker of blue vases fails to deliver the goods and by the way Bill what sort of a game do you play Oh forgive me Bill I forgot about your left arm Say look here sir Bill Peck retorted I m big enough and ugly enough to play one handed golf But have you ever tried it No sir Bill Peck replied seriously but it

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The path to the
