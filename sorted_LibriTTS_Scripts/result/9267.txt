Denver thundered up CHAPTER I The Old Man s Sister The weekly mail had just arrived at the Flying U ranch Shorty who had made the trip to Dry Lake on horseback that afternoon tossed the bundle to the Old Man and was halfway to the stable when he was called back peremptorily Shorty O h h Shorty Hi Shorty kicked his steaming horse in the ribs and swung round in the path bringing up before the porch with a jerk Where s this letter been demanded the Old Man with some excitement James G Whitmore cattleman would have been greatly surprised had he known that his cowboys were in the habit of calling him the Old Man behind his back James G Whitmore did not consider himself old though he was constrained to admit after several hours in the saddle that rheumatism had searched him out because of his fourteen years of roughing it he said Also there was a place on the crown of his head where the hair was thin and growing thinner every day of his life though he did not realize it The thin spot showed now as he stood in the path waving a square envelope aloft before Shorty who regarded it with supreme indifference Not so Shorty s horse He rolled his eyes till the whites showed snorted and backed away from the fluttering white object Doggone it where s this been reiterated James G accusingly How the devil do I know retorted Shorty forcing his horse nearer In the office most likely I got it with the rest to day It s two weeks old stormed the Old Man I never knew it to fail if a letter says anybody s coming or you re to hurry up and go somewhere to meet somebody that letter s the one that monkeys around and comes when the last dog s hung A letter asking yuh if yuh don t want to get rich in ten days sellin books or something ll hike along out here in no time Doggone it You got a hurry up order to go somewhere queried Shorty mildly sympathetic Worse than that groaned James G My sister s coming out to spend the summer t morrow And no cook but Patsy and she can t eat in the mess house and the house like a junk shop It looks like you was up against it all right grinned Shorty Shorty was a sort of foreman and was allowed much freedom of speech Somebody s got to meet her you have Chip catch up the creams so he can go And send some of the boys up here to help me hoe out a little Dell ain t used to roughing it she s just out of a medical school got her diploma she was telling me in the last letter before this She ll be finding microbes by the million in this old shack You tell Patsy I ll be late to supper and tell him to brace up and cook something ladies like cake and stuff Patsy ll know I d give a dollar to get that little runt in the office But Shorty having heard all that it was important to know was clattering down the long slope again to the stable It was supper time and Shorty was hungry Also there was news to tell and he was curious to see how the boys would take it He was just turning loose the horse when supper was called He hurried back up the hill to the mess house performed hasty ablutions in the tin wash basin on the bench beside the door scrubbed his face dry on the roller towel and took his place at the long table within Any mail for me Jack Bates looked up from emptying the third spoon of sugar into his coffee Naw she didn t write this time Jack Shorty reached a long arm for the Mulligan stew How s the dance coming on asked Cal Emmett I guess it s a go all right They ve got them coons engaged to play The hotel s fixing for a big crowd if the weather holds like this Chip Old Man wants you to catch up the creams after supper you ve got to meet the train to morrow Which train demanded Chip looking up Is old Dunk coming The noon train No he didn t say nothing about Dunk He wants a bunch of you fellows to go up and hoe out the White House and slick it up for comp ny got to be done t night And Patsy Old Man says for you t git a move on and cook something fit to eat something that ain t plum full uh microbes Shorty became suddenly engaged in cooling his coffee enjoying the varied emotions depicted on the faces of the boys Who s coming What s up Shorty took two leisurely gulps before he answered Old Man s sister s coming out to stay all summer and then some maybe Be here to morrow he said Gee whiz Is she pretty This from Cal Emmett Hope she ain t over fifty This from Jack Bates Hope she ain t one of them four eyed school ma ams added Happy Jack so called to distinguish him from Jack Bates and also because of his dolorous visage Why can t some one else haul her out began Chip Cal would like that job and he s sure welcome to it Cal s too dangerous He d have the old girl dead in love before he got her over the first ridge with them blue eyes and that pretty smile of his n It s up to you Splinter Old Man said so She ll be dead safe with Chip HE won t make love to her retorted Cal Wonder how old she is repeated Jack Bates half emptying the syrup pitcher into his plate Patsy had hot biscuits for supper and Jack s especial weakness was hot biscuits and maple syrup As to her age remarked Shorty it s a cinch she ain t no spring chicken seeing she s the Old Man s sister Is she a schoolma am Happy Jack s distaste for schoolma ams dated from his tempestuous introduction to the A B C s with their daily accompaniment of a long thin ruler No she ain t a schoolma am She s a darn sight worse She s a doctor Aw come off Cal Emmett was plainly incredulous That s right Old Man said she s just finished taking a course uh medicine what d yuh call that Consumption maybe or snakes Weary smiled blandly across the table She got a diploma though Now where do you get off at Yeah that sure means she s a doctor groaned Cal By golly she needn t try t pour any dope down ME cried a short fat man who took life seriously a man they called Slim in fine irony Gosh I d like to give her a real warm reception said Jack Bates who had a reputation for mischief I know them Eastern folks down t the ground They think cow punchers wear horns

none	none	they do They think we re holy terrors that eat with our six guns beside our plates and the like of that They make me plum tired I d like to wish we knew her brand I can tell you that said Chip cynically There s just two bunches to choose from There s the Sweet Young Things that faint away at sight of a six shooter and squawk and catch at your arm if they see a garter snake and blush if you happen to catch their eye suddenly and cry if you don t take off your hat every time you see them a mile off Chip held out his cup for Patsy to refill Yeah I ve run up against that brand and they re sure all right They suit ME remarked Cal That don t seem to line up with the doctor s diploma commented Weary Well she s the other kind then and if she is the Lord have mercy on the Flying U She ll buy her some spurs and try to rope and cut out and help brand Maybe she ll wear double barreled skirts and ride a man s saddle and smoke cigarettes She ll try to go the men one better in everything and wind up by making a darn fool of herself Either kind s bad enough I ll bet she don t run in either bunch began Weary I ll bet she s a skinny old maid with a peaked nose and glasses that ll round us up every Sunday and read tracts at our heads and come down on us with both feet about tobacco hearts and whisky livers and the evils and devils wrapped up in a cigarette paper I seen a woman doctor once she was stopping at the T Down when I was line riding for them and say she was a holy fright She had us fellows going South before a week I stampeded clean off the range soon as my month was up Say interrupted Cal don t yuh remember that picture the Old Man got last fall of his sister She was the image of the Old Man and mighty near as old Chip thinking of the morrow s drive groaned in real anguish of spirit You won t dast t roll a cigarette comin home Chip predicted Happy Jack mournfully Yuh want t smoke double goin in I don t THINK I ll smoke double going in returned Chip dryly If the old girl don t like my style why the walking isn t all taken up Say Chip suggested Jack Bates you size her up at the depot and if she don t look promising just slack the lines on Antelope Hill The creams ll do the rest If they don t we ll finish the job here Shorty tactfully pushed back his chair and rose You fellows don t want to git too gay he warned The Old Man s just beginning to forget about the calf shed deal Then he went out and shut the door after him The boys liked Shorty he believed in the old adage about wisdom being bliss at certain times and the boys were all the better for his living up to his belief He knew the Happy Family would stop inside the limit at least they always had so far What s the game demanded Cal when the door closed behind their indulgent foreman Why it s this Pass the syrup Happy T morrow s Sunday so we ll have time t burn We ll dig up all the guns we can find and catch up the orneriest cayuses in our strings and have a real old lynching bee sabe Who yuh goin t hang asked Slim apprehensively Yuh needn t think I LL stand for it Aw don t get nervous There ain t power enough on the ranch t pull yuh clear of the ground We ain t going to build no derrick said Jack witheringly We ll have a dummy rigged up in the bunk house When Chip and the doctor heave in sight on top of the grade we ll break loose down here with our bronks and our guns and smoke up the ranch in style We ll drag out mister Strawman and lynch him to the big gate before they get along We ll be riddling him with bullets when they arrive and by that time she ll be so rattled she won t know whether it s a man or a mule we ve got strung up You ll have to cut down your victim before I get there grinned Chip I never could get the creams through the gate with a man hung to the frame they d spill us into the washout by the old shed sure as fate That d be all right The old maid would sure know she was out West we need something to add to the excitement anyway If the Old Man s new buggy is piled in a heap you ll wish you had cut out some of the excitement retorted Chip All right Splinter We won t hang him there at all That old cottonwood down by the creek would do fine It ll curdle her blood like Dutch cheese to see us marching him down there and she can t see the hay sticking out of his sleeves that far off What if she wants to hold an autopsy bantered Chip By golly we ll stake her to a hay knife and tell her to go after him cried Slim suddenly waking up to the situation The noon train slid away from the little red depot at Dry Lake and curled out of sight around a hill The only arrival looked expectantly into the cheerless waiting room gazed after the train which seemed the last link between her and civilization and walked to the edge of the platform with a distinct frown upon the bit of forehead visible under her felt hat A fat young man threw the mail sack into a weather beaten buggy and drove leisurely down the track to the post office The girl watched him out of sight and sighed disconsolately All about her stretched the rolling grass land faintly green in the hollows brownly barren on the hilltops Save the water tank and depot not a house was to be seen and the

none	none	and loneliness oppressed her The agent was dragging some boxes off the platform She turned and walked determinedly up to him and the agent became embarrassed under her level look Isn t there anyone here to meet me she demanded quite needlessly I am Miss Whitmore and my brother owns a ranch somewhere near here I wrote him two weeks ago that I was coming and I certainly expected him to meet me She tucked a wind blown lock of brown hair under her hat crown and looked at the agent reproachfully as if he were to blame and the agent feeling suddenly that somehow the fault was his blushed guiltily and kicked at a box of oranges Whitmore s rig is in town he said hastily I saw his man at dinner The train was reported late but she made up time Grasping desperately at his dignity he swallowed an abject apology and retreated into the office Miss Whitmore followed him a few steps thought better of it and paced the platform self pityingly for ten minutes at the end of which the Flying U rig whirled up in a cloud of dust and the agent hurried out to help with the two trunks and the mandolin and guitar in their canvas cases The creams circled fearsomely up to the platform and stood quivering with eagerness to be off their great eyes rolling nervously Miss Whitmore took her place beside Chip with some inward trepidation mingled with her relief When they were quite ready and the reins loosened suggestively Pet stood upon her hind feet with delight and Polly lunged forward precipitately The girl caught her breath and Chip eyed her sharply from the corner of his eye He hoped she was not going to scream he detested screaming women She looked young to be a doctor he decided after that lightning survey He hoped to goodness she wasn t of the Sweet Young Thing order he had no patience with that sort of woman Truth to tell he had no patience with ANY sort of woman He spoke to the horses authoritatively and they obeyed and settled to a long swinging trot that knew no weariness and the girl s heart returned to its normal action Two miles were covered in swift silence then Miss Whitmore brought herself to think of the present and realized that the young man beside her had not opened his lips except to speak once to his team She turned her head and regarded him curiously and Chip feeling the scrutiny grew inwardly defiant Miss Whitmore decided after a close inspection that she rather liked his looks though he did not strike her as a very amiable young man Perhaps she was a bit tired of amiable young men His face was thin and refined and strong the strength of level brows straight nose and square chin with a pair of paradoxical lips which were curved and womanish in their sensitiveness the refinement was an intangible expression which belonged to no particular feature but pervaded the whole face As to his eyes she was left to speculate upon their color since she had not seen them but she reflected that many a girl would give a good deal to own his lashes Of a sudden he turned his eyes from the trail and met her look squarely If he meant to confuse her he failed for she only smiled and said to herself They re hazel Don t you think we ought to introduce ourselves she asked composedly when she was quite sure the eyes were not brown Maybe Chip s tone was neutrally polite Miss Whitmore had suspected that he was painfully bashful after the manner of country young men She now decided that he was not he was passively antagonistic Of course you know that I m Della Whitmore she said Chip carefully brushed a fly off Polly s flank with the whip I took it for granted I was sent to meet a Miss Whitmore at the train and I took the only lady in sight You took the right one but I m not I haven t the faintest idea who you are My name is Claude Bennett and I m happy to make your acquaintance I don t believe it you don t look happy said Miss Whitmore inwardly amused That s the proper thing to say when you ve been introduced to a lady remarked Chip noncommittally though his lips twitched at the corners Miss Whitmore finding no ready reply to this truthful statement remarked after a pause that it was windy Chip agreed that it was and conversation languished Miss Whitmore sighed and took to studying the landscape which had become a succession of sharp ridges and narrow coulees water worn and bleak with a purplish line of mountains off to the left After several miles she spoke What is that animal over there Do dogs wander over this wilderness alone Chip s eyes followed her pointing finger That s a coyote I wish I could get a shot at him they re an awful pest out here you know He looked longingly at the rifle under his feet If I thought you could hold the horses a minute Oh I can t I I m not accustomed to horses but I can shoot a little Chip gave her a quick measuring glance The coyote had halted and was squatting upon his haunches his sharp nose pointed inquisitively toward them Chip slowed the creams to a walk raised the gun and laid it across his knees threw a shell into position and adjusted the sight Here you can try if you like he said Whenever you re ready I ll stop You had better stand up I ll watch that you don t fall Ready Whoa Pet Miss Whitmore did not much like the skepticism in his tone but she stood up took quick careful aim and fired Pet jumped her full length and reared but Chip was watching for some such performance and had them well under control even though he was compelled to catch Miss Whitmore from lurching backward upon her baggage behind the seat which would have been bad for the guitar and mandolin if not for the young woman The coyote had sprung high in air whirled dizzily and darted over the hill You hit him cried Chip forgetting his prejudice for a moment He turned the creams from the road filled with the spirit of the chase Miss Whitmore will long remember that mad dash over the hilltops and into the hollows in which she could only cling to the rifle and to the seat as best she might and hope that the driver knew what he was about which he certainly did There he goes sneaking down that coulee He ll get into one of those washouts and hide if we don t head him off I ll drive around so you can get another shot at him cried Chip He headed up the hill again until the coyote crouching low was fully revealed That s a fine shot Throw another shell in quick You better kneel on the seat this time the horses know what s coming Steady Polly my girl Miss Whitmore glanced down the hill and then apprehensively at the creams who were clanking their bits wild eyed and quivering Only their master s familiar voice and firm grip on the reins held them there at all Chip saw and interpreted the glance somewhat contemptuously Oh of course if you re AFRAID Miss Whitmore set her teeth savagely knelt and fired cutting the sentence short in his teeth and forcing his undivided attention to the horses which showed a strong inclination to bolt I think I got him that time said she nonchalantly setting her hat straight though Chip with one of his quick glances observed that she was rather white around the mouth He brought the horses dexterously into the road and quieted them Aren t you going to get my coyote she ventured to ask Certainly The road swings back down that same coulee and we ll pass right by it Then I ll get out and pick him up while you hold the horses You ll hold those horses yourself returned Miss Whitmore with considerable spirit I d much rather pick up the coyote thank you Chip said nothing to this whatever he may have thought He drove up to the coyote with much coaxing of Pet and Polly who eyed the gray object askance Miss Whitmore sprang out and seized the animal by its coarse bushy tail Gracious he s heavy she exclaimed after one tug He s been fattening up on Flying U calves remarked Chip his foot upon the brake Miss Whitmore knelt and examined the cattle thief curiously Look she said here s where I hit him the first time the bullet took a diagonal course from the shoulder back to the other side It must have gone within an inch of his heart and would have finished him in a short time without that other shot that penetrated his brain you see death was instantaneous Chip had taken advantage of the halt to roll a cigarette holding the reins tightly between his knees while he did so He passed the loose edge of the paper across the tip of his tongue eying the young woman curiously the while You seem to be pretty well onto your job he remarked dryly I ought to be she said laughing a little I ve been learning the trade ever since I was sixteen Yes You began early My Uncle John is a doctor I helped him in the office till he got me into the medical school I was brought up in an atmosphere of antiseptics and learned all the bones in Uncle John s Boneparte the skeleton you know before I knew all my letters She dragged the coyote close to the wheel Let me get hold of the tail Chip carefully pinched out the blaze of his match and threw it away before he leaned over to help With a quick lift he landed the animal limp and bloody squarely upon the top of Miss Whitmore s largest trunk The pointed nose hung down the side the white fangs exposed in a sinister grin The girl gazed upon him proudly at first then in dismay Oh he s dripping blood all over my mandolin case and I just know it won t come out She tugged frantically at the instrument Out damned spot quoted Chip in a sepulchral tone before he turned to assist her Miss Whitmore let go the mandolin and stared blankly up at him and Chip offended at her frank surprise that he should quote Shakespeare shut his lips tightly and relapsed into silence CHAPTER II Over the Hog s Back That s Flying U ranch volunteered Chip as they turned sharply to the right and began to descend a long grade built into the side of a steep rocky bluff Below them lay the ranch in a long narrow coulee Nearest them sprawled the house low white and roomy with broad porches and wide windows further down the coulee at the base of a gentle slope were the sheds the high round corrals and the haystacks Great board gates were distributed in seemingly useless profusion while barbed wire fences stretched away in all directions A small creek bordered with cottonwoods and scraggly willows wound aimlessly away down the coulee J G doesn t seem to have much method remarked Miss Whitmore after a critical survey What are all those log cabins scattered down the hill for They look as though J G had a handful that he didn t want and just threw them down toward the stable and left them lying where they happened to fall It does all right conceded Chip They re the bunk house where us fellows sleep and the mess house where we eat and then come the blacksmith shop and a shack we keep all kinds of truck in and What in the world A chorus of shouts and shots arose from below A scurrying group of horsemen burst over the hill behind the house dashed half down the slope and surrounded the bunk house with blood curdling yells Chip held the creams to a walk and furtively watched his companion Miss Whitmore s eyes were very wide open plainly she was astonished beyond measure at the uproar Whether she was also frightened Chip could not determine The menacing yells increased in volume till the very hills seemed to cower in fear Miss Whitmore gasped when a limp form was dragged from the cabin and lifted to the back of a snorting pony They ve got a rope around that man s neck she breathed in a horrified half whisper Are they going to HANG him It kinda looks that way from here said Chip inwardly ashamed All at once it struck him as mean and cowardly to frighten a lady who had traveled far among strangers and who had that tired droop to her mouth It wasn t a fair game it was cheating Only for his promise to the boys he would have told her the truth then and there Miss Whitmore was not a stupid young woman his very indifference told her all that she needed to know She tore her eyes from the confused jumble of gesticulating men and restive steeds to look sharply at Chip He met her eyes squarely for an instant and the horror oozed from her and left only amused chagrin that they should try to trick her so Hurry up she commanded so I can be in at the death Remember I m a doctor They re tying him to his horse he looks half dead with fright Inwardly she added He overacts the part dreadfully The little cavalcade in the coulee fired a spectacular volley into the air and swept down the slope like a dry weather whirlwind across a patch of alkali ground Through the big gate and up the road past the stables they thundered the prisoner bound and helpless in their midst Then something happened A wide open River Press flapping impotently in the embrace of a willow caught the eye of Banjo a little blaze faced bay who bore the captive He squatted ducked backward so suddenly that his reins slipped from Slim s fingers and lowered his head between his white front feet His rider seemed stupid beyond any that Banjo had ever known and he had known many Snorting and pitching he was away before the valiant band realized what was happening in their midst The prisoner swayed drunkenly in the saddle At the third jump his hat flew off disclosing the jagged end of a two by four The Happy Family groaned as one man and gave chase Banjo with almost human maliciousness was heading up the road straight toward Chip and the woman doctor and she must be a poor doctor indeed and a badly frightened one withal if she failed to observe a peculiarity in the horse thief s cranium Cal Emmett dug his spurs into his horse and shot by Slim like a locomotive shouting profanity as he went Head him into the creek yelled Happy Jack and leaned low over the neck of his sorrel Weary Willie stood up in his stirrups and fanned Glory with his hat Yip yee e e Go to it Banjo old boy Watch his nibs ride would yuh He s a broncho buster from away back Weary Willie was the only man of them all who appeared to find any enjoyment in the situation If Chip only had the sense to slow up and give us a chance or spill that old maid over the bank groaned Jack Bates and plied whip and spur to overtake the runaway Now the captive was riding dizzily head downward frightening Banjo half out of his senses What he had started as a grim jest he now continued in deadly earnest what was this uncanny semblance of a cow puncher which he could not unseat yet which clung so precariously to the saddle He had no thought now of bucking in pure devilment he was galloping madly his eyes wild and staring Of a sudden Chip saw danger lurking beneath the fun of it He leaned forward a little got a fresh grip on the reins and took the whip Hang tight now I m going to beat that horse to the Hog s Back Miss Whitmore laughing till the tears stood in her eyes braced herself mechanically Chip had been laughing also but that was before Banjo struck into the hill road in his wild flight from the terror that rode in the saddle A smart flick of the whip upon their glossy backs and the creams sprang forward at a run The buggy was new and strong and if they kept the road all would be well unless they met Banjo upon the narrow ridge between two broad topped knolls known as the Hog s Back Another tap and the creams ran like deer One wheel struck a cobble stone and the buggy lurched horribly Stop There goes my coyote cried Miss Whitmore as a gray object slid down under the hind wheel Hang on or you ll go next was all the comfort she got as Chip braced himself for the struggle before him The Hog s Back was reached but Banjo was pounding up the hill beyond his nostrils red and flaring his sides reeking with perspiration Behind him tore the Flying U boys in a vain effort to head him back into the coulee before mischief was done Chip drew his breath sharply when the creams swerved out upon the broad hilltop just as Banjo thundered past with nothing left of his rider but the legs and with them shorn of their plumpness as the hay dribbled out upon the road A fresh danger straightway forced itself upon Chip s consciousness The creams maddened by the excitement were running away He held them sternly to the road and left the stopping of them to Providence inwardly thanking the Lord that Miss Whitmore did not seem to be the screaming kind of woman The vigilantes drew hastily out of the road and scudded out of sight down a gully as the creams lunged down the steep grade and across the shallow creek bed Fortunately the great gate by the stable swung wide open and they galloped through and up the long slope to the house coming more under control at every leap till by a supreme effort Chip brought them panting to a stand before the porch where the Old Man stood boiling over with anxiety and excitement James G Whitmore was not a man who took things calmly had he been a woman he would have been called fussy What in what was you making a race track out of the grade for he demanded after he had bestowed a hasty kiss beside the nose of his sister Chip dropped a heavy trunk upon the porch and reached for the guitar before he answered I was just trying those new springs on the buggy It was very exciting commented Miss Whitmore airily I shot a coyote J G but we lost it coming down the hill Your men were playing a funny game hare and hounds it looked like Or were they breaking a new horse The Old Man looked at Chip intelligence dawning in his face There was something back of it all he knew He had been asleep when the uproar began and had reached the door only in time to see the creams come down the grade like a daylight shooting star I guess they was breaking a bronk he said carelessly you ve got enough baggage for a trip round the world Dell I hope it ain t all dope for us poor devils Tell Shorty I want t see him Chip Chip took the reins from the Old Man s hands sprang in and drove back down the hill to the stables The reception committee as Chip sarcastically christened them rounded up the runaway and sneaked back to the ranch by the coulee trail With much unseemly language they stripped the saddle and a flapping pair of overalls off poor disgraced Banjo and kicked him out of the corral That s the way Jack s schemes always pan out grumbled Slim By golly yuh don t get me into another jackpot like that You might explain why you let that several kinds of cayuse get away from you retorted Jack fretfully If you d been onto your job things would have been smooth as silk Wonder what the old maid thought broke in Weary bent on preserving peace in the Happy Family I ll bet she never saw us at all laughed Cal Old Splinter gave her all she wanted to do hanging to the rig The way he came down that grade wasn t slow He just missed running into Banjo on the Hog s Back by the skin of the teeth If he had it d be good by doctor and Chip too Gee that was a close shave Well said Happy Jack mournfully if we don t all get the bounce for this I miss my guess It s a little the worst we ve done yet Except that time we tin canned that stray steer last winter amended Weary chuckling over the remembrance as he fastened the big gate behind them Yes that was another of Jack s fool schemes put in Slim Go and tin can a four year old steer and let him take after the Old Man and put him on the calf shed first pass he made Old Man was sure hot about that by golly it didn t help his rheumatism none He ll sure go straight in the air over this reiterated Happy Jack with mournful conviction There s old Splinter at the bunk house drawing our pictures I ll bet a dollar Hey Chip How you vas already yet sung out Weary whose sunny temper no calamity could sour Chip glanced at them and went on cutting the leaves of a late magazine which he had purloined from the Dry Lake barber Cal Emmett strode up and grabbed the limp gray hat from his head and began using it for a football Here Give that back commanded Chip laughing DON T make a dish rag of my new John B Stetson Cal It won t be fit for the dance Gee It don t lack much of being a dish rag now if I m any judge Now Great Scott He held it at arm s length and regarded it derisively Well it was new two years ago explained Chip making an ineffectual grab at it Cal threw it to him and came and sat down upon his heels to peer over Chip s arm at the magazine How s the old maid doctor asked Jack Bates leaning against the door while he rolled a cigarette Scared plum to death I left the remains in the Old Man s arms Was she scared honest Cal left off studying the Types of Fair Women What did she say when we broke loose Jack drew a match sharply along a log Nothing Well yes she said Are they going to H A N G that man Chip s voice quavered the words in a shrill falsetto The deuce she did Jack indulged in a gratified laugh What did she say when you put the creams under the whip up there 
7188_82904_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I don t suppose 
none	none	the old girl is wise to the fact that you saved her neck right then but you sure did You done yourself proud Splinter Cal patted Chip s knee approvingly Chip blushed under the praise and hastily answered the question She hollered out Stop There goes my COYOTE Her COYOTE HER coyote What the devil was she doing with a COYOTE The Happy Family stood transfixed and Chip s eyes were seen to laugh HER COYOTE Did any of you fellows happen to see a dead coyote up on the grade Because if you did it s the doctor s Weary Willie walked deliberately over and seized Chip by the shoulders bringing him to his feet with one powerful yank Don t you try throwing any loads into THIS crowd young man Answer me truly s help yuh How did that old maid come by a coyote a dead one Chip squirmed loose and reached for his cigarette book She shot it he said calmly but with twitching lips Shot it Five voices made up the incredulous echo What with demanded Weary when he got his breath With my rifle I brought it out from town today Bert Rogers had left it at the barber shop for me Gee whiz And them creams hating a gun like poison She didn t shoot from the rig did she Yes said Chip she did The first time she didn t know any better and the second time she was hot at me for hinting she was scared She s a spunky little devil all right She s busy hating me right now for running the grade thinks I did it to scare her I guess That s all some fool women know She s a howling sport then groaned Cal who much preferred the Sweet Young Things No I sized her up as a maverick What does she look like How old is she I never asked her age replied Chip his face lighting briefly in a smile As to her looks she isn t cross eyed and she isn t four eyed That s as much as I noticed After this bald lie he became busy with his cigarette Give me that magazine Cal I didn t finish cutting the leaves CHAPTER III Silver Miss Della Whitmore gazed meditatively down the hill at the bunk house The boys were all at work she knew She had heard J G tell two of them to ride the sheep coulee fence and had been consumed with amazed curiosity at the order Wherefore should two sturdy young men be commanded to ride a fence when there were horses that assuredly needed exercise judging by their antics and needed it badly She resolved to ask J G at the first opportunity The others were down at the corrals branding a few calves which belonged on the home ranch She had announced her intention of going to look on and her brother knowing how the boys would regard her presence had told her plainly that they did not want her He said it was no place for girls anyway Then he had put on a very dirty pair of overalls and hurried down to help for he was not above lending a hand when there was extra work to be done Miss Della Whitmore tidied the kitchen and dusted the sitting room and then having a pair of mischievously idle hands and a very feminine curiosity conceived an irrepressible desire to inspect the bunk house J G would tell her that also was no place for girls she supposed but J G was not present so his opinion did not concern her She had been at the Flying U ranch a whole week and was beginning to feel that its resources for entertainment aside from the masculine contingent which held some promising material were about exhausted She had climbed the bluffs which hemmed the coulee on either side had selected her own private saddle horse a little sorrel named Concho and had made friends with Patsy the cook She had dazzled Cal Emmett with her wiles and had found occasion to show Chip how little she thought of him a highly unsatisfactory achievement since Chip calmly over looked her whenever common politeness permitted him There yet remained the unexplored mystery of that little cabin down the slope from which sounded so much boylike laughter of an evening She watched and waited till she was positive the coast was clear then clapped an old hat of J G s upon her head and ran lightly down the hill With her hand upon the knob she ran her eye critically along the outer wall and decided that it had at some remote date been treated to a coat of whitewash gave the knob a sudden twist with a backward glance like a child stealing cookies stepped in and came near falling headlong She had not expected that remoteness of floor common to cabins built on a side hill Well She pulled herself together and looked curiously about her What struck her at first was the total absence of bunks There were a couple of plain iron bedsteads and two wooden ones made of rough planks There was a funny looking table made of an inverted coffee box with legs of two by four and littered with a characteristic collection of bachelor trinkets There was a glass lamp with a badly smoked chimney a pack of cards a sack of smoking tobacco and a box of matches There was a tin box with spools of very coarse thread some equally coarse needles and a pair of scissors There was also and Miss Whitmore gasped when she saw it a pile of much read magazines with the latest number of her favorite upon the top She went closer and examined them and glanced around the room with doubting eyes There were spurs quirts chaps and queer looking bits upon the walls there were cigarette stubs and burned matches innumerable upon the rough board floor and here in her hand she turned the pages of her favorite abstractedly and a paper fluttered out and fell face upward on the floor She stooped and recovered it glanced and gasped Well It was only a pencil sketch done on cheap unruled tablet paper but her mind dissolved into a chaos of interrogation marks and exclamation points with the latter predominating more and more the longer she looked It showed blunt topped hills and a shallow coulee which she remembered perfectly In the foreground a young woman in a smart tailored costume the accuracy of which was something amazing stood proudly surveying a dead coyote at her feet In a corner of the picture stood a weather beaten stump with a long thin splinter beside it on the ground Underneath was written in characters beautifully symmetrical The old maid s credential card There was no gainsaying the likeness even the rakish tilt of the jaunty felt hat caused by the wind and that wild dash across country was painstakingly reproduced And the fanciful tucks on the sleeve of the gown and I didn t suppose he had deigned so much as a glance was her first coherent thought Miss Whitmore s soul burned with resentment No woman even at twenty three loves to be called the old maid especially by a keen witted young man with square chin and lips with a pronounced curve to them And whoever supposed the fellow could draw like that and notice every tiny little detail without really looking once Of course she knew her hat was crooked with the wind blowing one s head off almost but he had no business The old maid s credential card Old maid indeed The audacity of him Beg pardon Miss Whitmore wheeled quickly her heart in the upper part of her throat judging by the feel of it Chip himself stood just inside the door eying her coldly I was not speaking said Miss Whitmore haughtily in futile denial To this surprising statement Chip had nothing to say He went to one of the iron beds stooped and drew out a bundle which had Miss Whitmore asked him what it was he would probably have called his war sack She did not ask she stood and watched him though her conscience assured her it was a dreadfully rude thing to do and that her place was up at the house Miss Whitmore was frequently at odds with her conscience at this time she stood her ground backed by her pride which was her chiefest ally in such emergencies When he drew a huge murderous looking revolver from its scabbard and proceeded calmly to insert cartridge after cartridge Miss Whitmore was constrained to speech Are you going to SHOOT something The question struck them both as particularly inane in view of his actions I am replied he without looking up He whirled the cylinder into place pushed the bundle back under the bed and rose polishing the barrel of the gun with a silk handkerchief Miss Whitmore hoped he wasn t going to murder anyone he looked keyed up to almost any desperate deed Who what are you going to shoot Really the question asked itself Chip raised his eyes for a fleeting glance which took in the pencil sketch in her hand Miss Whitmore observed that his eyes were much darker than hazel they were almost black And there was strangely enough not a particle of curve to his lips they were thin and straight and stern Silver He broke his leg Oh There was real horror in her tone Miss Whitmore knew all about Silver from garrulous Patsy Chip had rescued a pretty brown colt from starving on the range had bought him of the owner petted and cared for him until he was now one of the best saddle horses on the ranch He was a dark chestnut with beautiful white crinkly mane and tail and white feet Miss Whitmore had seen Chip riding him down the coulee trail only yesterday and now Her heart ached with the pity of it How did it happen I don t know He was in the little pasture Got kicked maybe Chip jerked open the door with a force greatly in excess of the need of it Miss Whitmore started impulsively toward him Her eyes were not quite clear Don t not yet Let me go If it s a straight break I can set the bone and save him Chip savage in his misery regarded her over one square shoulder Are you a veterinary surgeon may I ask Miss Whitmore felt her cheeks grow hot but she stood her ground I am not But a broken bone is a broken bone whether it belongs to a man or some OTHER beast Y e s Chip s way of saying yes was one of his chief weapons of annihilation He had a peculiar taunting inflection which he could give to it upon occasion which caused prickles of flesh upon the victim To say that Miss Whitmore was not utterly quenched argues well for her courage She only gasped as though treated to an unexpected dash of cold water and went on I m sure I might save him if you d let me try Or are you really eager to shoot him Chip s muscles shrank Eager to shoot him Silver the only thing that loved and understood him You may come and look at him if you like he said after a breath or two Miss Whitmore overlooked the tolerance of the tone and stepped to his side mechanically clutching the sketch in her fingers It was Chip looking down at her from his extra foot of height who called her attention to it Are you thinking of using that for a plaster Miss Whitmore started and blushed then with an uptilt of chin If I need a strong irritant yes She calmly rolled the paper into a tiny tube and thrust it into the front of her pink shirt waist for want of a pocket and Chip watching her surreptitiously felt a queer grip in his chest which he thought it best to set down as anger Silently they hurried down where Silver lay his beautiful gleaming mane brushing the tender green of the young grass blades He lifted his head when he heard Chip s step and neighed wistfully Chip bent over him black agony in his eyes Miss Whitmore looking on realized for the first time that the suffering of the horse was a mere trifle compared to that of his master Her eyes wandered to the loaded revolver which bulged his pocket behind and she shuddered but not for Silver She went closer and laid her hand upon the shimmery mane The horse snorted nervously and struggled to rise He s not used to a woman said Chip with a certain accent of pride I guess this is the closest he s ever been to one You see he s never had any one handle him but me Then he certainly is no lady s horse said Miss Whitmore good naturedly Somehow in the last moment her attitude toward Chip had changed considerably Try and make him let me feel the break With much coaxing and soothing words it was accomplished and it did not take long for it was a front leg broken straight across just above the fetlock Miss Whitmore stood up and smiled into the young man s eyes conscious of a desire to bring the curve back into his lips It s very simple she declared cheerfully I know I can cure him We had a colt at home with his leg broken the same way and he was entirely cured and doesn t even limp Of course she added honestly Uncle John doctored him but I helped Chip drew the back of his gloved hand quickly across his eyes and swallowed Miss Whitmore if you could save old Silver Miss Whitmore the self contained young medical graduate blinked rapidly and found urgent need of tucking in wind blown brown locks with her back to the tall cow puncher who had unwittingly dropped his mask for an instant She took off J G s old hat turned it clean around twice and put it back exactly as it was before unless the tilt over her left ear was a trifle more pronounced Show me the woman who can set a hat straight upon her head without aid of a mirror We must get him up from there and into a box stall There is one isn t there Y e s Chip hesitated I wouldn t ask the Old your brother for the use of it though not even for Silver I will returned she promptly I never feel any compunction about asking for what I want if I can t get it any other way I can t understand why you wanted to shoot you must have known this bone could be set I didn t WANT to Chip bent over and drove a fly from Silver s shoulder When a horse belonging to the outfit gets crippled like that he makes coyote bait A forty dollar cow puncher can t expect any better for his own horse He ll GET better whatever he may expect I m just spoiling for something to practice on anyway and he s such a beauty If you can get him up lead him to the stable while I go and tell J G and get some one to help She started away Whom shall I get she called back Weary if you can and Slim s a good hand with horses too Slim is that the tall lanky man No he s the short fat one That bean pole is Shorty Miss Whitmore fixed these facts firmly in her memory and ran swiftly to where rose all the dust and noise from the further corral She climbed up until she could look conveniently over the top rail The fence seemed to her dreadfully high a clear waste of straight sturdy poles J G e e e Baw h h h came answer from a wholly unexpected source as a big red cow charged and struck the fence under her feet a blow which nearly dislodged her from her perch The cow recoiled a few steps and lowered her head truculently Scat Shoo there Go on away you horrid old thing you Oh J G e e e Weary who was roping had just dragged a calf up to the fire and was making a loop to catch another when the cow made a second charge at the fence He dashed in ahead of her his horse narrowly escaping an ugly gash from her long wicked horns As he dodged he threw his rope with the peculiar back hand twist of the practiced roper catching her by the head and one front foot Straight across the corral he shot to the end of a forty foot rope tied fast to the saddle horn The red cow flopped with a thump which knocked all desire for trouble out of her for the time Shorty slipped the rope off and climbed the fence but the cow only shook her aching sides and limped sullenly away to the far side of the corral J G and the boys had shinned up the fence like scared cats up a tree when the trouble began and perched in a row upon the top The Old Man looked across and espied his sister wide eyed and undignified watching the outcome Dell What in thunder the YOU doing on that fence he shouted across the corral What in thunder are you doing on the fence J G she flung back at him The Old Man climbed shamefacedly down followed by the others Is that what you call getting put in the clear asked she genially I see now it means clear on the top rail You go back to the house and stay there commanded J G wrathfully The boys were showing unmistakable symptoms of mirth and the laugh was plainly against the Old Man Oh no came her voice honey sweet and calm Shoo that cow this way again will you mister Weary 
7188_82904_000060_000002	train-clean-360	I like 
none	none	to watch J G shin up the fence It s good for him it makes one supple and J G s actually getting fat Hurry along with that calf shouted the Old Man recovering the branding iron and turning his back on his tormentor The boys beyond grinning furtively at one another behaved with quite praiseworthy gravity Miss Whitmore watched while Weary dragged a spotted calf up to the fire and the boys threw it to the ground and held it until the Old Man had stamped it artistically with a smoking U Oh J G Ain t you gone yet What d yuh want Silver broke his leg Huh I knew that long ago Chip s gone to shoot him You go on to the house doggone it You ll have every cow in the corral on the fight That red waist of yours It isn t red it s pink a beautiful rose pink If your cows don t like it they ll have to be educated up to it Chip isn t either going to shoot that horse J G I m going to set his leg and cure him and I m going to keep him in one of your box stalls There now Cal Emmett took a sudden fit of coughing and leaned his forehead weakly against a rail and Weary got into some unnecessary argument with his horse and bolted across to the gate where his shoulders were seen to shake possibly with a nervous chill the bravest riders are sometimes so affected Nobody laughed however Indeed Slim seemed unusually serious even for him while Happy Jack looked positively in pain I want that short fat man to help Slim squirmed at this blunt identification of himself and mister Weary also Miss Whitmore might have spoken with a greater effect of dignity had she not been clinging to the top of the fence with two dainty slipper toes thrust between the rails not so very far below Under the circumstances she looked like a pretty spoiled little schoolgirl Oh You ve turned horse doctor have yuh J G leaned suddenly upon his branding iron and laughed Doggone it that ain t a bad idea I ve got two box stalls and there s an old gray horse in the pasture the same old gray horse that come out uh the wilderness with a bad case uh string halt I ll have some uh the boys ketch him up and you can start a horsepital Is that supposed to be a joke J G I never can tell YOUR jokes by ear If it is I ll laugh I m going to use whatever I need and you can do without mister er those two men Oh go ahead The horse don t belong to ME so I m willing you should practice on him a while Say Dell Give him that truck you ve been pouring down me for the last week Maybe he ll relish the taste of the doggone stuff I don t I suppose you ve labeled THAT a Joke please laugh here sighed Miss Whitmore plaintively climbing gingerly down CHAPTER IV An Ideal Picture I guess I ll go down to Denson s to day said J G at the breakfast table one morning Maybe we can get that grass widow to come and keep house for us I don t want any old grass widow to keep house protested Della I m getting along well enough so long as Patsy bakes the bread and meat and cake and stuff It s just fun to keep house The only trouble is there isn t half enough to keep me busy I m going to get a license to practice medicine so if there s any sickness around I can be of some use You say it s fifty miles to the nearest doctor But that needn t make a grass widow necessary I can keep house it looks better than when I came and you know it Which remark would have hurt the feelings of several well meaning cow punchers had they overheard it Oh I ain t finding fault with your housekeeping you do pretty well for a green hand But Patsy ll have to go with the round up when it starts and what men I keep on the ranch will have to eat with us That s the way I ve been used to fixing things I was never so good I couldn t eat at the same table with my men if they wasn t fit for my company I fired em and got fellows that was I ve had this bunch a good long while now You can do all right with just me but you couldn t cook for two or three men you can t cook good enough even if it wasn t too much work J G had a blunt way of stating disagreeable facts occasionally Very well get your grass widow by all means retorted she with much wasted dignity She s a swell cook and a fine housekeeper and shell keep yuh from getting lonesome She s good company the Countess is He grinned when he said it I ll have Chip ketch up the creams and you get ready and go along with us It ll give you a chance to size up the kind uh neighbors yuh got There was real pleasure in driving swiftly over the prairie land through the sweet spring sunshine and Miss Whitmore tingled with enthusiasm till they drove headlong into a deep coulee which sheltered the Denson family This road is positively dangerous she exclaimed when they reached a particularly steep place and Chip threw all his weight upon the brake We ll get the Countess in beside yuh coming back and then yuh won t rattle around in the seat so much She s good and solid just hang onto her and you ll be all right said J G If I don t like her looks and I know I won t I ll get into the front seat and you can hang onto her yourself mister J G Whitmore Chip who had been silent till now glanced briefly over his shoulder It s a cinch you ll take the front seat he remarked laconically J G if you hire a woman like that Like what Doggone it it takes a woman to jump at conclusions The Countess is all right She talks some I d tell a man she does broke in Chip tersely Well show me the woman that don t Don t you be bluffed so easy Dell I never seen the woman yet that Chip had any time for The Countess is all right and she certainly can cook I admit she talks consider ble Chip laughed grimly and the Old Man subsided At the house a small ginger whiskered man came down to the gate to greet them Why how de do I couldn t make out who t was comin but Mary she up an rek nized the horses Git right out an come on in We ve had our dinner but I guess the wimmin folks can scare ye up a bite uh suthin This yer sister We heard she was up t your place She the one that set one uh your horse s leg Bill he was tellin about it I dunno as wimmin horse doctors is very common but I dunno why not I get a horse with somethin the matter of his foot and I dunno what I d like t have ye take a look at it fore ye go Course I expect t pay ye The Old Man winked appreciatively at Chip before he came humanely to the rescue and explained that his sister was not a horse doctor and mister Denson looking very disappointed reiterated his invitation to enter missus Denson a large woman who narrowly escaped being ginger whiskered like her husband beamed upon them from the doorway Come right on in Louise here s comp ny The house is all tore up we been tryin t clean house a little Lay off yer things an I ll git yuh some dinner right away I m awful glad yuh come over I do hate t see folks stand on cer mony out here where neighbors is so skurce I guess yuh think we ain t been very neighborly but we been tryin t clean house an me an Louise ain t had a minute we could dast call our own er we d a been over t seen yuh before now Yuh must git awful lonesome comin right out from the East where neighbors is thick Do lay off yer things Della looked appealingly at J G who again came to the rescue Somehow he made himself heard long enough to explain their errand and to emphasize the fact that they were in a great hurry and had eaten dinner before they started from home In his sister s opinion he made one exceedingly rash statement He said that he wished to hire missus Denson s sister for the summer missus Denson immediately sent a shrill call for Louise Then appeared the Countess tall gaunt and muscular with sallow skin and a nervous manner The front seat or walk declared Miss Whitmore mentally after a brief scrutiny and began storing up a scathing rebuke for J G Louise this is Miss Whitmore began missus Denson cheerfully fortified by a fresh lungful of air They re after yuh t go an keep house for em an I guess yuh better go seein we got the house cleaned all but whitewashin the cellar an milk room an kals minin the upstairs an I ll make Bill do that an t won t hurt him a mite They ll give yuh twenty five dollars a month an keep yuh all summer an as much longer as his sister stays I guess yuh might as well go fer they can t git anybody else that ll keep things up in shape an be comp ny fer his sister an I b lieve in helpin a neighbor out when yuh can You go right an pack up yer trunk an don t worry about me I ll git along somehow now the house cleanin s most done Louise had been talking also but her sister seemed to have a stronger pair of lungs for her voice drowned that of the Countess who retreated to pack up The minutes dragged by to the tune of several chapters of family history as voluminously interpreted by missus Denson Miss Whitmore had always boasted the best behaved of nerves but this day she developed a genuine case of fidgets Once she saw Chip s face turned inquiringly toward the window and telegraphed her state of mind while missus Denson s back was turned so eloquently that Chip was swept at once into sympathetic good fellowship He arranged the cushion on the front seat significantly and was rewarded by an emphatic though furtive nod and smile Whereupon he leaned comfortably back rolled a cigarette and smoked contentedly at peace with himself and the world though he did not in the least know why An as I told Louise folks has got t put up with things an not be huntin trouble with a club all the time if they expect t git any comfort out uh this life We ain t had the best uh luck seems t me but we always git along somehow an we ain t had no sickness except when A confused uproar arose in the room above them followed immediately by a humpety bump and a crash as a small pink object burst open a door and rolled precipitately into their midst It proved to be one of the little Densons who kicked feebly with both feet and then lay still Mercy upon us Ellen who pushed Sary down them stairs She s kilt Della sprang up and lifted the child in her arms passing her hand quickly over the head and plump body Bring a little cold water missus Denson She s only stunned I think Well it does beat all how handy you go t work Anybody c d see t you know your business I m awful glad you was here there darlin don t cry Ellen an Josephine an Sybilly an Margreet you come down here t me The quartet snuffling and reluctant was dragged ignominiously to the middle of the floor and there confessed mid tears and much recrimination that they had been peeping down at the comp ny through various knot holes in the chamber floor that as Sary s knot hole was next the wall her range of vision was restricted to the thin spot upon the crown of J G s head and the back of his neck Sary longed for sight of the woman horse doctor and when she essayed to crowd in and usurp Ellen s point of vantage there ensued a war of extermination which ended in the literal downfall of Sary By the time this checked apron court of inquiry adjourned Louise appeared and said she believed she was ready and Miss Whitmore escaped from the house far in advance of the others and such were Chip s telepathic powers that he sprang down voluntarily and assisted her to the front seat without a word being said by either Followed a week of dullness at the ranch with the Countess scrubbing and dusting and cleaning from morning till night The Little Doctor as the bunk house had christened her was away attending the State Medical Examination at Helena Gee whiz sighed Cal on Sunday afternoon It seems mighty queer without the Little Doctor around here sassing the Old Man and putting the hull bunch of us on the fence about once a day If it wasn t for Len Adams It wouldn t do you any good to throw a nasty loop at the Little Doctor broke in Weary cause she s spoken for by all signs and tokens There s some fellow back East got a long rope on her You got the papers for that jeered Cal The Little Doctor don t act the way I d want my girl t act supposin I was some thousand or fifteen hundred miles off her range She ain t doing no pining I tell yuh those She s doing a lot of writing though I ll bet money if we called the roll right here you d see there s been a letter a week hittin the trail to one doctor Cecil Granthum Gilroy Ohio That s what agreed Jack Bates I packed one last week myself I done worse than that said Weary blandly I up and fired a shot at her after the second one she handed me I says as innocent I s pose if I lost this there d be a fellow out on the next train with blood in his eye and a six gun in both hands demanding explanations and she flashed them dimples on me and twinkled them big gray eyes of hers and says It s up to you to carry it safe then or words to that effect I took notice she didn t deny but what he would Two doctors in one family gee whiz mused Cal If I hadn t got the only girl God ever made right I d give one doctor Cecil Granthum of Gilroy Ohio a run for his money I tell yuh those I d impress it upon him that a man s taking long chances when he stands and lets his best girl stampede out here among us cow punchers for a change uh grass That fellow needs looking after he ain t finished his education Jacky you ain t got a female girl yanking your heart around sail in and show us what yuh can do in that line Nit said Jack Bates briefly My heart s doing business at the old stand and doing it satisfactory and proper I don t want to set it to bucking over a girl that wouldn t have me at any price Let Slim The Little Doctor s half stuck on him anyhow While the boys amused themselves in serious debate with Slim Chip put away his magazine and went down to visit Silver in the box stall He was glad they had not attempted to draw him into the banter they had never once thought to do so probably though he had been thrown into the company of the Little Doctor more than any of the others for several good reasons He had broken the creams to harness and always drove them for the Old Man found them more than he cared to tackle And there was Silver with frequent discussions over his progress toward recovery and some argument over his treatment for Chip had certain ideas of his own concerning horses and was not backward about expressing them upon occasion That the Little Doctor should write frequent letters to a man in the East did not concern him why should it Still a fellow without a home and without some woman who cares for him cannot escape having his loneliness thrust upon him at times He wondered why he should care Surely ten years of living his life alone ought to kill that latent homesickness which used to hold him awake at nights Sometimes even of late years when he stood guard over the cattle at night and got to thinking oh it was hell to be all alone in the world There were Cal and Weary they had girls who loved them and they were sure welcome to them And Jack Bates and Happy Jack had sisters and mothers and even Slim had an old maid aunt who always knit him a red and green pair of wristlets for Christmas Chip smoothing mechanically the shimmery white mane of his pet thought he might be contented if he had even an old maid aunt but he would see that she made his wristlets of some other color than those bestowed every year upon Slim As for the Little Doctor it would be something strange if she had gone through life without having some fellow in love with her Probably if the truth was known there had been more than doctor Cecil Granthum bah what a sickening name Cecil It might as well be Adolphus or Regie or what does a man want to pack around a name like that for Probably he was the kind of man that the name sounded like a dude with pink cheeks Chip knew just how he looked Inspiration suddenly seizing upon him he sat down upon the manger drew his memorandum book out of his inner coat pocket carefully sharpened a bit of lead pencil which he found in another pocket tore a leaf from the book and with Silver looking over his shoulder drew a graphic ideal picture of doctor Cecil Granthum CHAPTER V In Silver s Stall Oh are YOU here It s a wonder you don t have your bed brought down here so you can sleep near Silver How has he been doing since I left Chip simply sat still upon the edge of the manger and stared His gray hat was pushed far back upon his head and his dark hair waved and curled upon his forehead very much as a girl s might have done He did not know that he was a very good looking young man but perhaps the Little Doctor did She smiled and came up and patted Silver who had forgotten that he ever had objected to her nearness He nickered a soft welcome and laid his nose on her shoulder You ve been drawing a picture Who s the victim of your satirical pencil this time The Little Doctor reaching out quickly calmly appropriated the sketch before Chip had time to withdraw it even if he had cared to do so He was busy wondering how the Little Doctor came to be there at that particular time and had forgotten the picture which he had not quite finished labeling doctor Cecil Miss Whitmore turned red at first then broke into laughter Oh h ha ha ha Silver you don t know how funny this master of yours can be Ha ha She raised her head from Silver s neck where it had rested and wiped her eyes How did you know about Cecil she demanded of a very discomfited young man upon the manger I didn t know and I didn t WANT to know I heard the boys talking and joshing about him and I just drew their own conclusions Chip grinned a little and whittled at his pencil and wondered how much of the statement was a lie Miss Whitmore tamed red again and ended by laughing even more heartily than at first Their conclusions aren t very complimentary she said I don t believe doctor Cecil would feel flattered at this Why those bowed legs may I ask and wherefore that long lean dyspeptic visage doctor Cecil let me inform you has a digestion that quails not at deviled crabs and chafing dish horrors at midnight as I have abundant reason to know I have seen doctor Cecil prepare a welsh rabbit and eat it also with much relish apparently Oh no their conclusions weren t quite correct There are other details I might mention that cane for instance but let it pass I shall keep this I think as a companion to The old maid s credential card Are you in the habit of keeping other folk s property inquired Chip with some acerbity Nothing but personal caricatures and hearts perhaps returned the Little Doctor sweetly I hardly think your collection of the last named article is very large retorted Chip Still I added to the collection to day pursued Miss Whitmore calmly I shared my seat in the train with J G s silent partner I did not find him silent however mister Duncan Whitaker He hired a team in Dry Lake and we came out together and I believe please don t mention doctor Cecil Granthum to him will you Chip wished quite savagely that she wouldn t let those dimples dodge into her cheeks and the laugh dodge into her eyes like that It made a fellow uncomfortable He was thoroughly disgusted with her or he would be if she would only stop looking like that He was in that state of mind where his only salvation seemingly lay in quarreling with some one immediately So old Dunk s come back If you ve got his heart you must have gone hunting it with a microscope for it s a mighty small one almost as small as his soul No one else even knew he had one You ought to have it set in a ring so you won t lose it I don t wear phony jewelry thank you said Miss Whitmore and Chip thought dimples weren t so bad after all The Little Doctor was weaving Silver s mane about her white fingers and meditating deeply Chip wondered if she were thinking of doctor Cecil Where did you learn to draw like that she asked suddenly turning toward him You do much better than I and I ve always been learning from good teachers Did you ever try painting Chip blushed and looked away from her This was treading close to his deep hidden inner self I don t know where I learned I never took a lesson in my life except from watching people and horses and the country and remembering the lines they made you know I always made pictures ever since I can remember but I never tried colors very much I never had a chance working around cow camps and on ranches I d like to have you look over some of my sketches and things and I ve paints and canvas if you ever care to try that Come up to the house some evening and I ll show you my daubs They re none of them as good as The Old Maid I wish you d tear that thing up said Chip vehemently Why The likeness is perfect One would think you were designer for a fashion paper the way you got the tucks in my sleeve and the braid on my collar and you might have had the kindness to TELL me my hat was on crooked I think There was a rustle in the loose straw a distant slam of the stable door and Chip sat alone with his horse whittling abstractedly at his pencil till his knife blade grated upon the metal which held the eraser CHAPTER VI The Hum of Preparation Miss Whitmore ran down to the blacksmith shop waving an official looking paper in her hand I ve got it J G Got what smallpox J G did not even look up from the iron he was welding No my license I m a really truly doctor now and you needn t laugh either You said you d give a dance if I passed and I did Happy Jack brought it just now Brought the dance The Old Man gave the bellows a pull which sent a shower of sparks toward the really truly doctor Brought the license she explained patiently You can see for yourself They were awfully nice to me they seemed to think a girl doctor is some kind of joke out here They didn t make it any easier though they acted as if they didn t expect me to pass but I did The Old Man rubbed one smutty hand down his trousers leg and extended it for the precious document Let me have a look at it he said trying to hide his pride in her Well but I ll hold it Your hands are dirty doctor Whitmore eyed the hands disapprovingly The Old Man read it slowly through growing prouder every line You re all right Dell I ll be doggoned if you ain t Don t you worry about the dance I ll see t yuh get it You go tell the Countess to bake up a lot of cake and truck and I ll send some uh the boys around t tell the neighbors Better have it Friday night I guess I m goin t start the round up out early next week Doggone it I ve gone and burned that weldin Go on and stop your botherin me In two minutes the Little Doctor was back breathless What about the music J G We want GOOD music Well I ll tend t that part Say You can rig up that room off the dining room for your office I s pose you ll have to have one You make out a list of what dope you want and be sure yuh get a plenty I look for an unhealthy summer among the cow punchers If I ain t mistook in the symptoms Dunk s got palpitation uh the heart right now an got it serious The Old Man chuckled to himself and went back to his welding Oh Louise The Little Doctor hurried to where the Countess was scrubbing the kitchen steps with soft soap and sand and considerable energy J G says I may have a dance next Friday night so we must hurry and fix the house only I don t see much fixing to be done everything is SO clean Oh there ain t a room in the house fit fer comp ny t walk into expostulated the Countess while she scrubbed I do like t see a house clean when folks is expected that only come t be critical an make remarks behind yer back the minit they git away If folks got anything t say I d a good deal ruther they said it t my face an be done with it Yuh can know a man s face but yuh can t know his heart as the sayin is an it s the same way with women anyway it s the same way with Mis Beckman You can know her face a mile off but yuh never know who she s goin t rake over the coals next As the sayin is The tongue of a woman at last it biteth like a serpent an it stingeth like an addle an I guess it s so Anyway Mis Beckman s does I do b lieve on my soul what s the matter Dell What yuh laughin at The Little Doctor was past speech for the moment and the Countess stood up and looked curiously around her It never occurred to her that she might be the cause of that convulsive outburst Oh he never mind he s gone now Who s gone persisted the Countess What kinds of cake do you think we ought to have asked the Little Doctor diplomatically The Countess sank to her knees and dipped a handful of amber jelly like soap from a tin butter can Well I don t know I s pose folks will look for something fancy seein you re givin the dance Mis Beckman sets herself up as a shinin example on cake and she ll come just t be critical an find fault if she can If I can t bake all around her the best day she ever seen I ll give up cookin anything but spuds She had the soggiest kind uh jelly roll t the su prise on Mary last winter I know it was hern fer I seen her bring it in an I went straight an ondone it I guess it was kinda mean uh me but I don t care as the sayin is What s sass fer the goose is good enough sass fer anybody an she done the same trick by me at the su prise at Adamses last fall But she couldn t find no kick about MY cake an hers yuh c d of knocked a cow down with it left handed If that s the best she c n do on cake I d advise er to keep the next batch t home where they re used to it They say t What s one man s meat s pizen t the other feller and I guess it s so enough Maybe Mame an the rest uh them Beckman kids can eat sech truck without comin down in a bunch with gastakutus but I d hate t tackle it myself The Little Doctor gurgled This was a malady which had not been mentioned at the medical college Where shall we set the tables if we dance in the dining room she asked having heard enough of the Beckmans for the present Why we won t set any tables Folks always have a lap supper at ranch dances At the su prise on Mary What is a lap supper Well my stars alive Where under the shinin sun was you brought up if yuh never heard of a lap supper A lap supper is where folks set around the walls or any place they can find and take the plates on their laps and yuh pass em stuff The san wiches You do make such beautiful bread interrupted the Little Doctor very sincerely Well I ain t had the best uh luck lately but I guess it does taste good after that bread yuh had when I come Soggy was no name for Patsy made that bread interposed Miss Whitmore hastily He had bad luck and I guess he did sniffed the Countess contemptuously As I told Mary when I come I wonder how many cakes we ll need Miss Whitmore you will observe had learned to interrupt when she had anything to say It was the only course to pursue with anyone from Denson coulee The Countess having finished her scrubbing rose jerkily and upset the soap can which rolled over and over down the steps leaving a yellow trail as it went Well there if that wasn t a bright trick uh mine They say the more yuh hurry the less yuh ll git along an that s a sample We d ought t have five kinds an about four uh each kind It wouldn t do t run out er Mis Beckman never would let anybody hear the last of it Down t Mary s Twenty cakes Good gracious I ll have to order my stock of medicine for I ll surely have a houseful of patients if the guests eat twenty cakes Well as the sayin is Patience an perseverance can git away with most anything observed the Countess naively The Little Doctor retired behind her handkerchief My stars alive I do b lieve my bread s beginnin t scorch cried the Countess and ran to see The Little Doctor followed her inside and sat down We must make a list of the things we ll need Louise You Dell Oh h Dell The voice of the Old Man resounded from the parlor I m in the kitchen called she remaining where she was He tramped heavily through the house to her I ll send the rig in t morrow if there s anything yuh want he remarked And if you ll make out a list uh dope I ll send the order in t the Falls We ve got plenty uh saws an cold chisels down in the blacksmith shop you can pick out what yuh want He dodged and grinned Got any cake Countess Well there ain t a thing cooked hardly I m going t bake up something right after dinner Here s some sponge cake but it ain t fit t eat hardly I let Dell look in the oven cause my han s was all over flour an she slammed the door an it fell But yuh can t expect one person t know everything an too many han s can t make decent soup as the sayin is an it s the same way with cake The Old Man winked at the Little Doctor over a great wedge of feathery delight I don t see nothing the matter with this only it goes down too easy he assured the Countess between mouthfuls Fix up your list Dell and don t be afraid t order everything yuh need I ll foot the The Old Man thinking to go back to his work stepped into the puddle of soft soap and sat emphatically down upon the top step coasting rapidly to the bottom A carpet slipper shot through the open door and landed in the dishpan the other slipper disappeared mysteriously The wedge of cake was immediately pounced upon by an investigative hen and carried in triumph to her brood Good Lord J G struggled painfully to his feet Dell who in thunder put that stuff there You re a little too doggoned anxious for somebody t practice on seems t me A tiny trickle of blood showed in the thin spot on his head Are you hurt J G We I spilled the soap The Little Doctor gazed solicitous from the doorway Huh I see yuh spilled the soap all right enough I m willin to believe yuh did without no affidavit Doggone it a bachelor never has any such a man trap around in a fellow s road I ve lived in Montana fourteen years an I never slipped up on my own doorstep till you got here It takes a woman t leave things around where s my cake Old Specie took it down by the bunk house Shall I go after it No you needn t Doggone it this wading through ponds uh soft soap has got t stop right here I never had t do it when I was baching I notice He essayed with the aid of a large splinter to scrape the offending soap from his trousers Certainly you didn t Bachelors never use soap retorted Della Oh they don t hey That s all you know about it They don t use this doggoned slimy truck let me tell yuh What d yuh want Chip Oh you ve got t grin too Dell why don t yuh do something fer my head What s your license good f er I d like t know You didn t see Dell s license did yuh Chip Go and get it an show it to him Dell It s good fer everything but gitting married there ain t any cure for that complaint CHAPTER VII Love and a Stomach Pump An electrical undercurrent of expectation pervaded the very atmosphere of Flying U ranch The musicians two supercilious but undeniably efficient young men from Great Falls had arrived two hours before and were being graciously entertained by the Little Doctor up at the house The sandwiches stood waiting the coffee was ready for the boiling water and the dining room floor was smooth as wax could make it For some reason unknown to himself Chip was in the deeps He even threatened to stop in the bunk house and said he didn t feel like dancing but was brought into line by weight of numbers He hated Dick Brown anyway for his cute little yellow mustache that curled up at the ends like the tail of a drake He had snubbed him all the way out from town and handled Dick s guitar with a recklessness that invited disaster And the way Dick smirked when the Old Man introduced him to the Little Doctor a girl with a fellow in the East oughtn t to let her eyes smile that way at a pin headed little dude like Dick Brown anyway And he Chip had given her a letter postmarked blatantly Gilroy Ohio ten thirty P M and she had been so taken up with those cussed musicians that she couldn t even thank him and only just glanced at the letter before she stuck it inside her belt Probably she wouldn t even read it till after the dance He wondered if doctor Cecil Granthum cared oh hell Of COURSE he cared that is if he had any sense at all But the Little Doctor she wasn t above flirting he noticed If HE ever fell in love with a girl which the Lord forbid he d take mighty good care she didn t get time to make dimples and smiles for some other fellow to go to heaven looking at There that was her laughing like she always laughed it reminded him of pines nodding in a canyon and looking wise and whispering things they d seen and heard before you were born and of water falling over rocks somehow Queer maybe but it did He wondered if Dick Brown had been trying to say something funny He didn t see for the life of him how the Little Doctor could laugh at that little imitation man Girls are well they re easy pleased most of them Down in the bunk house the boys were hurrying into their war togs which is being interpreted their best clothes There was a nervous scramble over the cracked piece of a bar mirror which had a history and cries of Get out Let me there a minute can t yuh and Get up off my coat were painfully frequent Happy Jack struggled blindly with a refractory red tie which his face rivaled in hue and sheen for he had been generous of soap Weary had possessed himself of the glass and was shaving as leisurely as though four restive cow punchers were not waiting anxiously their turn For the Lord s sake Weary spluttered Jack Bates Your whiskers grow faster n you can shave em off at that gait Get a move on can t yuh Weary turned his belathered face sweetly upon Jack Getting in a hurry Jacky YOUR girl won t be there and nobody else s girl is going to have time to see whether you shaved to day or last Christmas You don t want to worry so much about your looks none of you I hate to say it but you act vain all of you kids Honest I m ashamed Look at that gaudy countenance Happy s got on and his necktie s most as bad He stropped his razor with exasperating nicety stopping now and then to test its edge upon a hair from his own brown head Happy Jack grown desperate over his tie and purple over Weary s remarks craned his neck over the shoulder of that gentleman and leered into the mirror When Happy liked he could contort his naturally plain features into a diabolical grin which sent prickly waves creeping along the spine of the beholder Weary looked stared half rose from his chair Holy smithereens Quit it Happy You look like the devil by lightning Happy watching seized the hand that held the razor Cal like a cat pounced upon the mirror and Jack Bates deftly wrenched the razor from Weary s fingers Whoopee boys Some of you tie Weary down and set on him while I shave cried Cal jubilant over the mutiny We ll make short work of this toilet business Whereupon Weary was borne to the floor bound hand and foot with silk handkerchiefs carried bodily and laid upon his bed Oh the things I won t do to you for this he asserted darkly There won t nary a son of a gun uh yuh get a dance from my little schoolma am you ll see He grinned prophetically closed his eyes and murmured Call me early mother dear and straightway fell away into slumber and peaceful snoring while the lather dried upon his face Better turn Weary loose and wake him up Chip suggested Jack Bates half an hour later shoving the stopper into his cologne bottle and making for the door At the rate the rigs are rolling in it ll take us all to put up the teams The door slammed behind him as it had done behind the others as they hurried away Here Chip untied Weary s hands and feet and took him by the shoulder Wake up Willie if you want to be Queen o the May Weary sat up and rubbed his eyes Confound them two Jacks What time is it A little after eight YOUR crowd hasn t come yet so you needn t worry I m not going up yet for a while myself You re off your feed Brace up and take all there is going my son Weary prepared to finish his interrupted beautification I m going to all the bottles that is If that Dry Lake gang comes loaded down with whisky like they generally do we ought to get hold of it and cache every drop Weary Weary turned clear around to stare his astonishment When did the W C T U get you by the collar he demanded Aw don t be a fool Weary retorted Chip You can see it wouldn t look right for us to let any of the boys get full or even half shot seeing this is the Little Doctor s dance Weary meditatively scraped his left jaw and wiped the lather from the razor upon a fragment of newspaper Splinter we ve throwed in together ever since we drifted onto the same range and I m with you uh course But don t overlook doctor Cecil Granthum I d hate like the devil to see you git throwed down because it d hurt you worse than anybody I know Chip calmly sifted some tobacco into a cigarette paper His mouth was very straight and his brows very close together It s a devilish good thing it was YOU said that Weary If it had been anyone else I d punch his face for him Why yes an I d help you too Weary his mouth very much on one side of his face that he might the easier shave the other spoke in fragments You don t take it amiss from me though I can see The door slammed with extreme violence and Weary slashed his chin unbecomingly in consequence but he felt no resentment toward Chip He calmly stuck a bit of paper on the cut to stop the bleeding and continued to shave A short time after the Little Doctor came across Chip glaring at Dick Brown who was strumming his guitar with ostentatious ease upon an inverted dry goods box at one end of the long dining room I came to ask a favor of you she said but my courage oozed at the first glance It s hard to believe your courage would ooze at anything What s the favor The Little Doctor bent her head and lowered her voice to a confidential undertone which caught at Chip s blood and set it leaping I want you to come and help me turn my drug store around with its face to the wall All the later editions of Denson Pilgreen and Beckman have taken possession of my office and as the Countess says Them Beckman kids is holy terrors an it s savin the rod an spoilin the kid that makes em so Chip laughed outright The Denson kids are a heap worse if she only knew it he said and followed her willingly The Little Doctor s office was a homey little room with a couch a well worn Morris rocker two willow chairs and a small table for the not imposing furnishing dignified by a formidable stack of medical books in one corner and the drug store which was simply a roomy bookcase filled with jars bottles boxes and packages all labeled in a neat vertical hand The room fairly swarmed with children who seemed for the most part to be enjoying themselves very much Charlotte May Pilgreen and Sary Denson were hunched amicably over one of the books shuddering beatifically over a pictured skeleton A swarm surrounded the drug store the glass door of which stood open The Little Doctor flew across to the group horror white Sybilly got the key an unlocked it an she give us this candy too tattled a Pilgreen with very red hair and a very snub nose I didn t either It was Jos phine Aw you big story teller I never tetched it The Little Doctor clutched the nearest arm till the owner of it squealed How many of you have eaten some of these Tell the truth now They quailed before her sternness quailed and confessed All told seven had swallowed the sweet pellets in numbers ranging from two to a dozen more Is it poison Chip whispered the question in the ear of the perturbed Little Doctor No but it will make them exceedingly uncomfortable for a time I m going to pump them out Good shot Serves em right the little All of you who have eaten this er candy must come with me The rest of you may stay here and play but you must NOT touch this case Yuh going t give em a lickin Sary Denson wetted a finger copiously before turning a leaf upon the beautiful skeleton Never mind what I m going to do to them you had better keep out of mischief yourself however mister Bennett I wish you would get some fellow you can trust some one who won t talk about this afterward turn this case around so that it will be safe and then come to the back bedroom the one off the kitchen And tell Louise I want her will you please I ll get old Weary Yes I ll send the Countess but don t you think she s a mighty poor hand to keep a secret I can t help it I need her Hurry please Awed by the look in her big gray eyes and the mysterious summoning of help the luckless seven were marched silently through the outer door around the house through the coal shed and so into the back bedroom without being observed by the merrymakers who shook the house to its foundation to the cheerful command Gran right n left with a double ELBOW W Chasse by yer pardner balance SWING What under the shinin sun s the matter Dell The Countess breathless from dancing burst in upon the little group Nothing very serious Louise though it s rather uncomfortable to be called from dancing to administer heroic remedies by wholesale Can you hold Josephine whichever one that is She ate the most as nearly as I can find out She ain t gone an took pizen has she What was it strychnine I ll bet them Beckman kids put er up to it Yuh goin t give er an anticdote I m going to use this The Little Doctor held up a fearsome thing to view Open your mouth Josephine Josephine refused her refusal was emphatic and unequivocal punctuated by sundry kicks directed at whoever came within range of her stout little shoes It ain t no use t call Mary in Mary can t handle her no better n I can an not so good Jos phine yuh got Here s where we shine broke in a cheery voice which was sweet to the ears just then Chip and I ain t wrassled with bronks all our lives for nothing This is dead easy all same branding calves Ketch hold of her heels Splinter that s the talk Countess you better set your back against that door some of these dogies is thinking of taking a sneak on us and we d have t go some to cut em out uh that bunch out there and corral em again There yuh are Doctor sail in Upheld mentally by the unfailing sunniness of Weary and the calm determination of Chip to whom flying heels and squirming bodies were as nothing or at most a mere trifle the Little Doctor set to work with a thoroughness and dispatch which struck terror to the hearts of the guilty seven It did not take long as Weary had said it was very much like branding calves No sooner was one child made to disgorge and laid limp and subdued upon the bed than Chip and Weary seized another dexterously by heels and head The Countess did nothing beyond guarding the door and acting as chaperon to the undaunted Little Doctor but she did her duty and held her tongue afterward which was a great deal for her to do The Little Doctor sat down in a chair when it was all over looking rather white Chip moved nearer though there was really nothing that he could do beyond handing her a glass of water which she accepted gratefully Weary held a little paper trough of tobacco in his fingers and drew the tobacco sack shut with his teeth His eyes were fixed reflectively upon the bed He placed the sack absently in his pocket still meditating other things She answered We are seven he quoted softly and solemnly and the Little Doctor forgot her faintness in a hearty laugh You two go back to your dancing now she commanded letting the dimples stand in her cheeks in a way that Chip dreamed about afterward I don t know what I should have done without you a cow puncher seems born to meet emergencies in just the right way PLEASE don t tell anyone will you Never Don t you worry about us Doctor Chip and I don t set up nights emptying our brains out our mouths We don t tell our secrets to nobody but our horses and they re dead safe You needn t think I ll tell either said the Countess earnestly I ain t forgot how you took the blame uh that sof soap Dell As the sayin is Weary closed the door then so they did not hear the saying which seemed to apply to this particular case His arm hooked into Chip s he led the way through the kitchen and down the hill to the hay corral Once safe from observation he threw himself into the sweetly pungent blue joint and laughed and laughed Chip s nervous system did not demand the relief of cachinnation He went away to Silver s stall and groped blindly to the place where two luminous green moons shone upon him in the darkness He rubbed the delicate nose gently and tangled his fingers in the dimly gleaming mane as he had seen HER do Such pink little fingers they were He laid his brown cheek against the place where he remembered them to have rested Silver horse he whispered if I ever fall in love with a girl which isn t likely I ll want her to have dimples and big gray eyes and a laugh like

7188_82904_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It was Sunday the second day after the dance 
none	none	The boys were scattered for the day was delicious one of those sweet soft days which come to us early in May 
7188_82904_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Down in the blacksmith shop Chip was putting new rowels into his spurs and whistling softly to himself while he worked 
none	none	The Little Doctor had gone with him to visit Silver that morning and had not hurried away but had leaned against the manger and listened while he told her of the time Silver swimming the river when it was up had followed him to the Shonkin camp when Chip had thought to leave him at home 
7188_82904_000004_000001	train-clean-360	And they had laughed together over the juvenile seven and the subsequent indignation of the mothers who with the exception of Mary had bundled up their offspring and gone home mad 
none	none	True they had none of them thoroughly understood the situation having only the version of the children who accused the Little Doctor of trying to make them eat rubber just cause she was mad about some little old candy The mystification of the others among the Happy Family who scented a secret with a joke to it but despaired of wringing the truth from either Weary or Chip was dwelt upon with much enjoyment by the Little Doctor It was a good old world and a pleasant and Chip had no present quarrel with fate or with anybody else 
7188_82904_000005_000001	train-clean-360	That was why he whistled 
none	none	Then voices reached him through the open door and a laugh HER laugh Chip smiled sympathetically though he had not the faintest notion of the cause of her mirth 
7188_82904_000006_000001	train-clean-360	As the voices drew nearer the soft smooth hated tones of Dunk Whitaker untangled from the Little Doctor s laugh and Chip stopped whistling 
7188_82904_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Dunk was making a good long stay of it this time usually he came one day and went the next and no one grieved at his departure 
none	none	You find them an entirely new species of course How do you get on with them said Dunk 
7188_82904_000008_000000	train-clean-360	And the Little Doctor answered him frankly and distinctly Oh very well considering all things 
7188_82904_000008_000001	train-clean-360	They furnish me with some amusement and I give them something quite new to talk about so we are quits 
7188_82904_000008_000002	train-clean-360	They are a good hearted lot you know but SO ignorant 
none	none	I don t suppose 
7188_82904_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The words trailed into an indistinct murmur punctuated by Dunk s jarring cackle 
none	none	Chip did not resume his whistling though he might have done so if he had heard a little more or a little less 
7188_82904_000010_000001	train-clean-360	As a matter of fact it was the Densons and the Pilgreens and the Beckmans that were under discussion and not the Flying U cowboys as Chip believed 
7188_82904_000010_000002	train-clean-360	He no longer smiled sympathetically 
none	none	We furnish her with some amusement do we 
7188_82904_000011_000001	train-clean-360	That s good 
none	none	We re a good hearted lot but SO ignorant The devil we are 
7188_82904_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He struck the rivet such a blow that he snapped one shank of his spur short off This meant ten or twelve dollars for a new pair though the cost of it troubled him little just then 
7188_82904_000011_000005	train-clean-360	It was something tangible upon which to pour profanity however and the atmosphere grew sulphurous in the vicinity of the blacksmith shop and remained so for several minutes after which a tall irate cow puncher with his hat pulled low over angry eyes left the shop and strode up the path to the deserted bunk house 
none	none	He did not emerge till the Old Man called to him to ride down to Benson s after one of the Flying U horses which had broken out of the pasture 
7188_82904_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Della was looking from the window when Chip rode up the hill upon the coulee trail which passed close by the house 
7188_82904_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She was tired of the platitudes of Dunk who trying to be both original and polished fell far short of being either and only succeeded in being extremely tiresome 
none	none	Where s Chip going J G she demanded in a proprietary tone Down t Benson s after a horse J G spoke lazily without taking his pipe from his mouth
7188_82904_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I wish I could go I wonder if he d care The Little Doctor spoke impulsively as was her habit 
none	none	Course he wouldn t Hey Chip 
7188_82904_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Hold on a minute 
7188_82904_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The Old Man stood waving his pipe in the doorway 
7188_82904_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Chip jerked his horse to a stand still and half turned in the saddle 
none	none	What Dell wants t go along Will yuh saddle up Concho for er There s no hurry anyhow you ve got plenty uh time Dell s afraid one uh the kids might fall downstairs ag in and she d miss the case I m not either said the Little Doctor coming to stand by her brother it s too nice a day to stay inside and my muscles ache for a gallop over the hills Chip did not look up at her he did not dare 
7188_82904_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He felt that if he met her eyes with the laugh in them he should do one of two undesirable things he should either smile back at her weakly overlooking the hypocrisy of her friendliness or sneer in answer to her smile which would be very rude and ungentlemanly 
7188_82904_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 If you had mentioned wanting a ride I should have been glad to accompany you remarked Dunk reproachfully when Chip had ridden somewhat sullenly back to the stable 
none	none	I didn t think of it before thank you said the Little Doctor lightly and hurried away to put on her blue riding habit with its cunning little jockey cap which she found the only headgear that would stay upon her head in the teeth of Montana wind and which made her look well kissable 
7188_82904_000024_000001	train-clean-360	She was standing on the porch drawing on her gauntlets when Chip returned leading Concho by the bridle 
7188_82904_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me help you begged Dunk at her elbow hoping till the last that she would invite him to go with them 
none	none	The Little Doctor not averse to hiding the bitter of her medicine under a coating of sugar smiled sweetly upon him to the delectation of Dunk and the added bitterness of Chip who was rapidly nearing that state of mind which is locally described as being strictly on the fight
7188_82904_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I expect she thinks I ll amuse her some more he thought savagely as they galloped away through the quivering sunlight 
7188_82904_000028_000000	train-clean-360	For the first two miles the road was level and Chip set the pace which was as he intended it should be too swift for much speech 
none	none	After that the trail climbed abruptly out of Flying U coulee and the horses were compelled to walk 
7188_82904_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Then it was that Chip s native chivalry and self mastery were put to test 
none	none	He was hungry for a solitary ride such as had before now drawn much of the lonely ache out of his heart and keyed him up to the life which he must live and which chafed his spirit more than even he realized Instead of such slender comfort he was forced to ride beside the girl who had hurt him so close that his knee sometimes brushed her horse and to listen to her friendly chatter and make answer at times with at least some show of civility 
7188_82904_000030_000000	train-clean-360	She was talking reminiscently of the dance 
none	none	J G showed splendid judgment in his choice of musicians didn t he 
7188_82904_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Chip looked straight ahead 
none	none	This was touching a sore place in his memory A vision of Dick Brown s vapid smile and curled up mustache rose before him I d tell a man he said with faint irony 
7188_82904_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The Little Doctor gave him a quick surprised look and went on 
7188_82904_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I liked their playing so much 
none	none	mister Brown was especially good upon the guitar Y e s
7188_82904_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes of course 
7188_82904_000037_000001	train-clean-360	You know yourself he plays beautifully 
7188_82904_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Cow punchers aren t expected to know all these things Chip hated himself for replying so but the temptation mastered him 
7188_82904_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Aren t they 
none	none	I can t see why not 
7188_82904_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Chip closed his lips tightly to keep in something impolite 
7188_82904_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The Little Doctor puzzled as well as piqued went straight to the point 
none	none	Why didn t you like mister Brown s playing Did I say I didn t like it
7188_82904_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you not exactly but you implied that you did not 
none	none	Y e s 
7188_82904_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The Little Doctor gave the reins an impatient twitch 
7188_82904_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes YES 
7188_82904_000048_000000	train-clean-360	No answer from Chip 
7188_82904_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He could think of nothing to say that was not more or less profane 
none	none	I think he s a very nice amiable young man strong emphasis upon the second adjective
7188_82904_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 I like amiable young men 
none	none	Silence
7188_82904_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 He s going to come down here hunting next fall 
none	none	J G invited him Yes 
7188_82904_000052_000001	train-clean-360	What does he expect to find 
7188_82904_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Why whatever there is to hunt 
none	none	Chickens and er deer Exactly By this they reached the level and the horses broke of their own accord into a gallop which somewhat relieved the strain upon the mental atmosphere

7188_82904_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you need a change of air mister Bennett 
none	none	Yes I ve felt lately that Eastern airs don t agree with my constitution 
7188_82904_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Whitmore grew red as to cheeks and bright as to eyes 
7188_82904_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I think a few small doses of Eastern manners would improve you very much she said pointedly 
none	none	Y e s 
7188_82904_000066_000001	train-clean-360	They d have to be small because the supply is very limited 
7188_82904_000067_000000	train-clean-360	The Little Doctor grew white around the mouth 
7188_82904_000067_000001	train-clean-360	She held Concho s rein so tight he almost stopped 
7188_82904_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 If you didn t want me to come why in the world didn t you have the courage to say so at the start

none	none	With that she turned astonished Concho short around in the trail and as Chip gave Blazes a vicious jab with his spurs at the same instant the distance between them widened rapidly 
7188_82904_000070_000000	train-clean-360	As Chip raced away over the prairie he discovered a new and puzzling kink in his temper 
7188_82904_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He had been angry with the Little Doctor for coming but it was nothing to the rage he felt when she turned back 
7188_82904_000070_000002	train-clean-360	He did not own to himself that he wanted her beside him to taunt and to hurt with his rudeness but it was a fact for all that 
none	none	And it was a very surly young man who rode into the Denson corral and threw a loop over the head of the runaway CHAPTER IX Before the Round up The Little Doctor wants us all to come up t the White House this evening and have some music announced Cal bursting into the bunk house where the boys were sorting and packing their belongings ready to start with the round up wagon in the morning Jack Bates hurriedly stuffed a miscellaneous collection of socks and handkerchiefs into his war bag and made for the wash basin I ll just call her bluff he said determinedly It ain t any bluff she wants us t come er you bet she wouldn t say so I ve learned that much about her Say you d a died to seen old Dunk look down his nose I ll bet money she done it just t rasp his feelin s and she sure succeeded I d go anyway now just t watch him squirm I notice it grinds him consider ble to see the Little Doctor treat us fellows like white folks He s workin for a stand in there himself I bet he gets throwed down good and hard commented Weary cheerfully It s a cinch he don t know about that pill thrower back in Ohio added Cal Any of you fellows going to take her bid I ll go alone in a minute I don t think you ll go alone asserted Jack Bates grabbing his hat Slim made a few hasty passes at his hair and said he was ready Shorty who had just come in from riding unbuckled his spurs and kicked them under his bed It ll be many a day b fore we listen t the Little Doctor s mandolin ag in croaked Happy Jack Aw shut up admonished Cal Come on Chip sang out Weary You can spoil good paper when you can t do anything else Come and size up the look on Dunk s face when we take possession of all the best chairs and get t pouring our incense and admiration on the Little Doctor Chip took the cigarette from his lips and emptied his lungs of smoke You fellows go on I m not going He bent again to his eternal drawing The dickens you ain t Weary was too astounded to say more Chip said nothing His gray hat brim shielded his face from view save for the thin curved lips and firm chin Weary studied chin and lips curiously and whatever he read there he refrained from further argument He knew Chip so much better than did anyone else Aw what s the matter with yuh Splinter Come on don t be a chump cried Cal from the doorway I guess you ll let a fellow do as he likes about it won t you queried Chip without looking up He was very busy just then shading the shoulders of a high pitching horse so that one might see the tense muscles What s the matter You and the Little Doctor have a falling out Not very bad Chip s tone was open to several interpretations Cal interpreted it as a denial Sick He asked next Yes said Chip shortly and falsely We ll call the doctor in then volunteered Jack Bates I don t think you will When I m sick enough for that I ll let you know I m going to bed Aw come on and let him alone Chip s able t take care of himself I guess said Weary mercifully holding open the door They trooped out and the last heard of them was Cal remarking Gee whiz I d have t be ready t croak before I d miss this chance uh dealing old Dunk misery Chip sat where they had left him staring unseeingly down at the uncompleted sketch His cigarette went out but he did not roll a fresh one and held the half burned stub abstractedly between his lips set in bitter lines Why should he care what a slip of a girl thought of him He didn t care he only that thought he did not follow to the end but started immediately on a new one He supposed he was ignorant according to Eastern standards Lined up alongside doctor Cecil Granthum damn him he would cut a sorry figure no doubt He had never seen the outside of a college let alone imbibing learning within one He had learned some of the wisdom which nature teaches those who can read her language and he had read much lying on his stomach under a summer sky while the cattle grazed all around him and his horse cropped the sweet grasses within reach of his hand He could repeat whole pages of Shakespeare and of Scott and Bobbie Burns he d like to try doctor Cecil on some of them and see who came out ahead Still he was ignorant and none realized it more keenly and bitterly than did Chip He rested his chin in his hand and brooded over his comfortless past and cheerless future He could just remember his mother and he preferred not to remember his father who was less kind to him than were strangers That was his past And the future always to be a cow puncher There was his knack for drawing if he could study and practice perhaps even the Little Doctor would not dare call him ignorant then Not that he cared for what she might say or might not say but a fellow can t help hating to be reminded of something that he knows better than anyone else and that is not pleasant however you may try to cover up the unsightliness of it If doctor Cecil Granthum damn him had been kicked into the world and made to fight fate with tender childish little fists but lately outgrown their baby dimples as had been HIS lot would he have amounted to anything either Maybe doctor Cecil would have grown up just common and ignorant and fit for nothing better than to furnish amusement to girl doctors with dimples and big gray eyes and a way of laughing He d like to show that little woman that she didn t know all about him yet It wasn t too late he was only twenty four he would study and work and climb to where she must look up not down to him if she cared enough to look at all It wasn t too late He would quit gambling and save his money and by next winter he d have enough to go somewhere and learn to make pictures that amounted to something He d show her After reiterating this resolve in several emphatic forms Chip s spirits grew perceptibly lighter so much so that he rolled a fresh cigarette and finished the drawing in his hands which demonstrated the manner in which a particularly snaky broncho had taken a fall out of Jack Bates in the corral that morning Next day early in the afternoon the round up climbed the grade and started on its long trip over the range and after they had gone the ranch seemed very quiet and very lonely to the Little Doctor who revenged herself by snubbing Dunk so unmercifully that he announced his intention of taking the next train for Butte where he lived in the luxury of rich bachelorhood As the Little Doctor showed no symptoms of repenting he rode sullenly away to Dry Lake and she employed the rest of the afternoon writing a full and decidedly prejudiced account to doctor Cecil of her quarrel with Chip whom she said she quite hated CHAPTER X What Whizzer Did I guess Happy lost some of his horses las night said Slim at the breakfast table next morning Slim had been kept at the ranch to look after the fences and the ditches and was doing full justice to the expert cookery of the Countess What makes yuh think that The Old Man poised a bit of tender broiled steak upon the end of his fork They s a bunch hangin around the upper fence an Whizzer s among em I d know that long legged snake ten miles away The Little Doctor looked up quickly She had never before heard of a long legged snake but then she had not yet made the acquaintance of Whizzer Well maybe you better run em into the corral and hold em till Shorty sends some one after em suggested the Old Man I never c d run em in alone not with Whizzer in the bunch objected Slim He s the orneriest cayuse in Chouteau County Whizzer ll make a rattlin good saddle horse some day when he s broke gentle argued the Old Man Huh I don t envy Chip the job uh breakin him though grunted Slim as he went out of the door After breakfast the Little Doctor visited Silver and fed him his customary ration of lump sugar helped the Countess tidy the house and then found herself at a loss for something to do She stood looking out into the hazy sunlight which lay warm on hill and coulee I think I ll go up above the grade and make a sketch of the ranch she said to the Countess and hastily collected her materials Down by the creek a cotton tail sprang out of her way and kicked itself out of sight beneath a bowlder The Little Doctor stood and watched till he disappeared before going on again Further up the bluff a striped snake gave her a shivery surprise before he glided sinuously away under a sagebush She crossed the grade and climbed the steep bluff beyond searching for a comfortable place to work A little higher she took possession of a great gray bowlder jutting like a giant table from the gravelly soil She walked out upon it and looked down a sheer drop of ten or twelve feet to the barren yellow slope below I suppose it is perfectly solid she soliloquized and stamped one stout little boot to see if the rock would tremble If human emotions are possible to a heart of stone the rock must have been greatly amused at the test It stood firm as the hills around it Della sat down and looked below at the house a doll s house at the toy corrals and tiny sheds and stables Slim walking down the hill was a mere pigmy a short waddling insect At least to a girl unused to gazing from a height each object seemed absurdly small Flying U coulee stretched away to the west with a silver ribbon drawn carelessly through it with many a twist and loop fringed with a tender green of young leaves Away and beyond stood the Bear Paws hazily blue with splotches of purple shadows I don t blame J G for loving this place thought the Little Doctor drinking in the intoxication of the West with every breath she drew She had just become absorbed in her work when a clatter arose from the grade below and a dozen horses headed by a tall rangy sorrel she surmised was Whizzer dashed down the hill Weary and Chip galloped close behind They did not look up and so passed without seeing her They were talking and laughing in very good spirits which the Little Doctor resented for some inexplicable reason She heard them call to Slim to open the corral gate and saw Slim run to do their bidding She forgot her sketching and watched Whizzer dodge and bolt back and Chip tear through the creek bed after him at peril of life and limb Back and forth round and round went Whizzer running almost through the corral gate then swerving suddenly and evading his pursuers with an ease which bordered closely on the marvelous Slim saddled a horse and joined in the chase and the Old Man climbed upon the fence and shouted advice which no one heard and would not have heeded if they had As the chase grew in earnestness and excitement the sympathies of the Little Doctor were given unreservedly to Whizzer Whenever a particularly clever maneuver of his set the men to swearing she clapped her hands in sincere though unheard and unappreciated applause Good boy she cried approvingly when he dodged Chip and whirled through the big gate which the Old Man had unwittingly left open J G leaned perilously forward and shook his fist unavailingly Whizzer tossed head and heels alternately and scurried up the path to the very door of the kitchen where he swung round and looked back down the hill snorting triumph Shoo there shrilled the Countess shaking her dish towel at him Who oo oof f snorted he disdainfully and trotted leisurely round the corner Chip galloped up the hill his horse running heavily After him came Weary liberally applying quirt and mild invective At the house they parted and headed the fugitive toward the stables He shot through the big gate lifting his heels viciously at the Old Man as he passed whirled around the stable and trotted haughtily past Slim into the corral of his own accord quite as if he had meant to do so all along Did you ever exclaimed the Little Doctor disgustedly from her perch Whizzer I m ashamed of you I wouldn t have given in like that but you gave them a chase didn t you my beauty The boys flung themselves off their tired horses and went up to the house to beg the Countess for a lunch and Della turned resolutely to her sketching again She was just beginning to forget that the world held aught but soft shadows mellow glow and hazy perspective when a subdued uproar reached her from below She drew an uncertain line or two frowned and laid her pencil resignedly in her lap It s of no use I can t do a thing till those cow punchers take themselves and their bronchos off the ranch and may it be soon she told herself disconsolately and not oversincerely The best of us are not above trying to pull the wool over our own eyes at times In reality their brief presence made the near future seem very flat and insipid to the Little Doctor It was washing all the color out of the picture and leaving it a dirty gray She gazed moodily down at the whirl of dust in the corral where Whizzer was struggling to free himself from the loop Chip had thrown with his accustomed calm precision Whatever Chip did he did thoroughly with no slurring of detail Whizzer was fain to own himself fairly caught Oh he s got you fast my beauty sighed the Little Doctor woefully Why didn t you jump over the fence I think you COULD and run run to freedom She grew quite melodramatic over the humiliation of the horse she had chosen to champion and glared resentfully when Chip threw his saddle with no gentle hand upon the sleek back and tightened the cinches with a few strong relentless yanks Chip you re an ugly mean tempered that s right Whizzer Kick him if you can I ll stand by you This assertion you understand was purely figurative the Little Doctor would have hesitated long before attempting to carry it out literally Now Whizzer when he tries to ride you don t you let him Throw him clear over the STABLE so there Perhaps Whizzer understood the command in some mysterious telepathic manner At any rate he set himself straightway to obey it and there was not a shadow of doubt but that he did his best but Chip did not choose to go over the stable Instead of doing so he remained in the saddle and changed ends with his quirt to the intense rage of the Little Doctor who nearly cried Oh you brute You fiend I ll never speak to you again as long as I live Oh Whizzer you poor fellow why do you let him abuse you so Why DON T you throw him clean off the ranch This is exactly what Whizzer was trying his best to do and Whizzer s best was exceedingly bad for his rider as a general thing But Chip calmly refused to be thrown and Whizzer who was no fool suddenly changed his tactics and became so meek that his champion on the bluff felt tempted to despise him for such servile submission to a tyrant in brown chaps and gray hat I am transcribing the facts according to the Little Doctor s interpretation She watched gloomily while Whizzer in whose brain lurked no thought of submission galloped steadily along behind the bunch which Slim made haste to liberate and bided his time She had expected better rather worse of him than that She had not dreamed he would surrender so tamely As they crossed the Hog s Back and climbed the steep grade just below her she eyed him reproachfully and said again Whizzer I m ashamed of you It did certainly seem that Whizzer heard and felt the pricking of pride at the reproof He made a feint at being frightened by a jack rabbit which sprang out from the shade of a rock and bounced down the hill like a rubber ball As if Whizzer had never seen a jack rabbit before he who had been born and reared upon the range among them It was a feeble excuse at the best but he made the most of it and lost no time seeking a better He stopped short sidled against Weary s horse and snorted Chip in none the best humor with him jerked the reins savagely and dug him with his spurs and Whizzer resenting the affront whirled and bounded high in the air Back down the grade he bucked with the high rocking crooked jumps which none but a Western cayuse can make while Weary turned in his saddle and watched with sharp drawn breaths There was nothing else that he could do Chip was by no means passive For every jump that Whizzer made the rawhide quirt landed across his flaring nostrils and the locked rowels of Chip s spurs raked the sorrel sides from cinch to flank leaving crimson streams behind them Wild with rage at this clinging cow puncher whom he could not dislodge who stung his sides and head like the hornets in the meadow Whizzer gathered himself for a mighty leap as he reached the Hog s Back Like a wire spring released he shot into the air shook himself in one last desperate hope of victory and failing came down with not a joint in his legs and turned a somersault A moment and he struggled to his feet and limped painfully away crushed and beaten in spirit Chip did not struggle He lay a long length of brown chaps pink and white shirt and gray hat just where he had fallen The Little Doctor never could remember getting down that bluff and her sketching materials went to amuse the jack rabbits and the birds Fast as she flew Weary was before her and had raised Chip s head upon one arm She knelt beside him in the dust hovering over the white face and still form like a pitying little gray angel Weary looked at her impersonally but neither of them spoke in those first breathless moments The Old Man who had witnessed the accident came puffing laboriously up the hill taking the short cut straight across from the stable Is he DEAD he yelled while he scrambled Weary turned his head long enough to look down at him with the same impersonal gaze he had bestowed upon the Little Doctor but he did not answer the question He could not for he did not know The Little Doctor seemed not to have heard The Old Man redoubled his exertions and reached them very much out of breath Is he dead Dell he repeated in an awestruck tone He feared she would say yes The Little Doctor had taken possession of the brown head She looked up at her brother a very unprofessional pallor upon her face and down at the long brown lashes and at the curved sensitive lips which held no hint of red She pressed the face closer to her breast and shook her head She could not speak just then for the griping ache that was in her throat One of the best men on the ranch gone under just when we need help the worst complained the Old Man Is he hurt bad J G began the Little Doctor in a voice all the fiercer for being suppressed I want you to kill that horse Do you hear If you don t do it I will You won t have to if old Splinter goes down and out said Weary with quiet meaning and the Little Doctor gave him a grateful flash of gray eyes How bad is he hurt repeated the Old Man impatiently You re supposed t be a doctor don t you know He has a scalp wound which does not seem serious said she in an attempt to be matter of fact and his left collar bone is broken Doggone it A broken collar bone ain t mended overnight No acquiesced the Little Doctor it isn t These last two remarks Chip heard He opened his eyes and looked straight up into the gray ones above a long questioning rebellious look He tried then to rise to free himself from the bitter ecstasy of those soft enfolding arms Only a broken collar bone Good thing it was no worse Ugh A spasm of pain contracted his features and drew beads of moisture to his forehead The spurned arms once more felt the dead weight of him What is it The Little Doctor s voice called to him from afar Must he answer He wanted to drift on and on Can you tell me where the pain is Pain Oh yes there had been pain but he wanted to drift He opened his eyes again reluctantly again the pain clutched him It s my foot For the first time the eyes of the Little Doctor left his face and traveled downward to the spurred boots One was twisted in a horrible unnatural position that told the agonizing truth a badly dislocated ankle They returned quickly to the face and swam full of blinding tears such as a doctor should not succumb to He was not drifting into oblivion now his teeth were not digging into his lower lip for nothing she knew Weary she said forgetting to call him properly by name ride to the house and get my medicine case the little black one The Countess knows and have Slim bring something to carry him home on And RIDE Weary was gone before she had finished and he certainly rode You ll have another crippled cow puncher on yer hands first thing yuh know grumbled the Old Man anxiously as he watched Weary race recklessly down the hill The Little Doctor did not answer She scarcely heard him She was stroking the hair back from Chip s forehead softly unconsciously wondering why she had never before noticed the wave in it but then she had scarcely seen him with his hat off How silky and soft it felt And she had called him all sorts of mean names and had wanted Whizzer to she shuddered and turned sick at the memory of the thud when they struck the hard road together Dell exclaimed the Old Man you re white s a rag Doggone it don t throw up yer hands at yer first case brace up Chip looked up at her curiously forgetting the pain long enough to wonder at her whiteness Did she have a heart then or was it a feminine trait to turn pale in every emergency She had not turned so very white when those kids he felt inclined to laugh only for that cussed foot Instead he relaxed his vigilance and a groan slipped out before he knew Just a minute more and I ll ease the pain for you murmured the girl compassionately All right so long as you don t use the stomach pump he retorted with a miserable makeshift of a laugh What s that asked the Old Man but no one explained The Little Doctor was struggling with the lump in her throat that he should try to joke about it Then Weary was back and holding the little black case out to her She seized it eagerly slipping Chip s head to her knees that she might use her hands freely There was no halting over the tiny vials for she had decided just what she must do She laid something against Chip s closed lips Swallow these she said and he obeyed her Weary oh you knew what to do I see There lay the coat down there for a pillow Relieved of her burden she rose and went to the poor twisted foot Weary and the Old Man watched her go to work systematically and disclose the swollen purpling ankle Very gently she did it and when she had administered a merciful anaesthetic the enthusiasm of the Old Man demanded speech Well I ll be eternally doggoned You re onto your job Dell doggoned if yuh ain t I won t ever josh yuh again about yer doctorin I wish you d been around the time I smashed MY ankle commented Weary fishing for his cigarette book he was beginning to feel the need of a quieting smoke They hauled me forty miles to Benton That must have been torture shuddered the Little Doctor A dislocated ankle is a most agonizing thing Yes assented Weary striking a match it sure is all right CHAPTER XI Good Intentions mister Davidson have you nerve enough to help me replace this ankle The Countess is too nervous and J G is too awkward Chip was lying oblivious to his surroundings or his hurt in the sunny south room which Dunk Whitaker chose to call his I ve never been accused of wanting nerve grinned Weary I guess I can stand it if you can And a very efficient assistant he proved himself to be When the question of a nurse arose when all had been done that could be done and Weary had gone the Little Doctor found herself involved in an argument with the Countess The Countess wanted them to send for Bill Bill just thought the world and all of Chip she declared and would just love to come She was positive that Bill was the very one they needed and the Little Doctor who had conceived a violent dislike for Bill a smirky self satisfied youth addicted to chewing tobacco red neckties and a perennial grin was equally positive he was the very one they did not want In despair she retrenched herself behind the assertion that Chip should choose for himself I just know he ll choose Bill crowed the Countess after the flicker of the doctor s skirts Chip turned his head rebelliously upon the pillow and looked up at her Something in his eyes brought to mind certain stormy crises in the headstrong childhood of the Little Doctor crises in which she was forced to submission very much against her will It was the same mutinous surrender to overwhelming strength the same futile defiance of fate I came to ask you who you would rather have to nurse you she said trying to keep the erratic color from crimsoning her cheeks You see she had never had a patient of her very own before and there were certain embarrassing complications in having this particular young man in charge Chip s eyes wandered wistfully to the window where a warm spring breeze flapped the curtains in and out How long have I got to lie here he asked reluctantly A month at the least more likely six weeks she said with kind bluntness It was best he should know the worst at once Chip turned his face bitterly to the wall for a minute and traced an impossible vine to its breaking point where the paper had not been properly matched Twenty miles away the boys were hurrying through their early dinner that they might catch up their horses for the afternoon s work And they had two good feet to walk on two sound arms to subdue restless horseflesh and he was not there He could fairly smell the sweet trampled sod as the horses circled endlessly inside the rope corral and hear them snort when a noose swished close He wondered who would get his string to ride and what they would do with his bed He didn t need it now he would lie on wire springs instead of on the crisp prairie grass He would be waited on like a yearling baby and The Countess just knows you will choose Bill interrupted a whimsical girl voice Chip said something which the Little Doctor did not try to hear distinctly Don t she think I ve had enough misery dealt me for once he asked without taking his eyes from the poor broken vine He rather pitied the vine it seemed to have been badly used by fate just as he had been He was sure it had not wanted to stop right there on that line as it had been forced to do HE had not wanted to stop either He She says Bill would just love to come said the voice with a bit of a laugh in it Chip turning his head back suddenly looked into the gray eyes and felt inexplicably cheered He almost believed she understood something of what it all meant to him And she mercifully refrained from spoken pity which he felt he could not have borne just then His lips took back some of their curve You tell her I wouldn t just love to have him he said grimly I d never dare She dotes on Bill Whom DO you want When it comes to that I don t want anybody But if you could get Johnny Beckman to come Oh I will I ll go myself to make sure of him Which one is Johnny Johnny s the red headed one said Chip But they re ALL Yes but his head is several shades redder than any of the others interrupted he quite cheerfully The Little Doctor observing the twinkle in his eyes felt her spirits rise wonderfully She could not bear that hurt rebellious lonely look which they had worn I ll bring him but I may have to chloroform the Countess to get him into the house You must try to sleep while I m gone and don t fret will you You ll get well all the quicker for taking things easily Chip smiled faintly at this wholesome advice and the Little Doctor laid her hand shyly upon his forehead to test its temperature drew down the shade over the south window and left him in dim shadowy coolness to sleep She came again before she started for Johnny and found him wide awake and staring hungrily at the patch of blue sky visible through the window which faced the East You ll have to learn to obey orders better than this she said severely and took quiet possession of his wrist I told you not to fret about being hurt I know you hate it Chip flushed a little under her touch and the tone in which she spoke the last words It seemed to mean that she hated it even more than he did having him helpless in the house with her It hadn t been so long since she had told him plainly how little she liked him He was not going to forget in a hurry Why don t you send me to the hospital he demanded brusquely I could stand the trip all right The Little Doctor the color coming and going in her cheeks pressed her cool fingers against his forehead Because I want you here to practice on Do you think I d let such a chance escape After she was gone Chip found some things to puzzle over He felt that he was no match for the Little Doctor and for the first time in his life he deeply regretted his ignorance of woman nature When the dishes were done the Countess put her resentment behind her and went in to sit with Chip with the best of intentions The most disagreeable trait of some disagreeable people is that their intentions are invariably good She had her crochy work and Chip groaned inwardly when he saw her settle herself comfortably in a rocking chair and unwind her thread The Countess had worked hard all her life and her hands were red and big jointed There was no pleasure in watching their clever manipulation of the little steel hook If it had been the Little Doctor s hands now Chip turned again to the decapitated pale blue vine with its pink flowers and no leaves The Countess counted off chain leven and began in a constrained tone such as some well meaning people employ against helpless sick folk How re yuh feelin now Yuh want a drink or anything Chip did not want a drink and he felt all right he guessed The Countess thought to cheer him a little Well I do think it s too bad yuh got t lay here all through this purty spring weather If it had been in the winter when it s cold and stormy outside a person wouldn t mind it s much I know yuh must feel purty blew over it fer yuh was always sech a hand t be tearin around the country on the dead run seems like I always told Mary t you n Weary always rode like the sheriff wa nt more n a mile b hind yuh An I s pose you feel it all the more seein the round up s jest startin out Weary said yuh was playin big luck if yuh only knew enough t cash in yer chips at the right time but he s afraid yuh wouldn t be watching the game close enough an ud lose yer pile I don t know what he was drivin at an I guess he didn t neither It s too bad anyway I guess yuh didn t expect t wind up in bed when yuh rode off up the hill But as the sayin is Man plans an God displans an I guess it s so Here yuh are laid up fer the summer Dell says the las thing on earth I guess that yuh was lookin fer An yuh rode buckin bronks right along too I never looked fer Whizzer t buck yuh off I must say yuh got the name uh bein sech a good rider too But they say t the pitcher t s always goin t the well is bound t git busted sometime an I guess your turn come t git busted Anyway I didn t get bucked off broke in Chip angrily A bronch fighter is not more jealous of his sweetheart than of his reputation as a rider A fellow can t very well make a pretty ride while his horse is turning a somersault Oh well I didn t happen t se it I thought Weary said t yuh got throwed off on the Hog s Back Anyway I don t know s it makes much difference how yuh happened t hit the ground I guess it does make a difference cried Chip hotly His eyes took on the glitter of fever It makes a whole heap of difference let me tell you I d like to hear Weary or anybody else stand up and tell me that I got bucked off I may be pretty badly smashed up but I d come pretty near showing him where he stood Oh well yuh needn t go t work an git mad about it remonstrated the Countess dropping her thread in her perturbation at his excitement The spool rolled under the bed and she was obliged to get down upon her knees and claw it back and she jarred the bed and set Chip s foot to hurting again something awful When she finally secured the spool and resumed her chair Chip s eyes were tightly closed but the look of his mouth and the flush in his cheeks together with his quick breathing precluded the belief that he was asleep The Countess was not a fool she saw at once that fever which the Little Doctor had feared was fast taking hold of him She rolled her half yard of edging around the spool of thread jabbed the hook through the lump and went out and told the Old Man that Chip was getting worse every minute which was the truth The Old Map knocked the ashes out of his pipe and went in to look at him Did Weary say I got bucked off demanded the sick man before the Old Man was fairly in the room If he did he lied that s all I didn t think Weary d do me dirt like that I thought he d stand by me if anybody would He knows I wasn t throwed I Here young fellow put in the Old Man calmly don t yuh git t rampagin around over nothin You turn over there an go t sleep I ll be hanged if I will retorted Chip If Weary s taken to lying about me I ll have it out with him if I break all the rest of my bones doing it Do you think I m going to stand a thing like that I ll see Easy there doggone it I never heard Weary say t yuh got bucked off Whizzer turned over on his head s near as I c d make out fer dust I took it he turned a summerset Chip s befogged brain caught at the last word Yes that s just what he did It beats me how Weary could say or even think that I it was the jack rabbit first and I told her the supply was limited and if we do furnish lots of amusement but I guess I made her understand I wasn t so easy as she took me to be She Hey The Old Man could hardly be blamed for losing the drift of Chip s rapid utterances If we want to get them rounded up before the dance I ll it s a good thing it wasn t poison for seven dead kids at once The Old Man knew something about sickness himself He hurried out returning in a moment with a bowl of cool water and a fringed napkin which he pilfered from the dining room table wisely intending to bathe Chip s head But Chip would have none of him or his wise intentions He jerked the wet napkin from the Old Man s fingers and threw it down behind the bed knocked up the bowl of water into the Old Man s face and called him some very bad names The Countess came and looked in and Chip hurled a pillow at her and called her a bad name also so that she retreated to the kitchen with her feelings very much hurt After that Chip had the south room to himself until the Little Doctor returned with Johnny The Old Man looking rather scared met her on the porch The Little Doctor read his face before she was off her horse What s the matter Is he worse she demanded abruptly That s fer you t find out I ain t no doctor He got on the fight a while back an took t throwin things an usin langwidge He can t git out uh bed thank the Lord or we d be takin t the hills by now Then somebody has it to answer for He was all right when I left him two hours ago with not a sign of fever Has the Countess been pestering him No said the Countess popping her head out of the kitchen window and speaking in an aggrieved tone I hope I never pester anybody I went an done all I could t cheer im up an that s all the thanks I git fer it I must say some folks ain t overburdened with gratitude anyhow The Little Doctor did not wait to hear her out She went straight to the south room pulling off her gloves on the way The pillow on the floor told her an eloquent tale and she sighed as she picked it up and patted some shape back into it Chip stared at her with wide bright eyes from the bed I don t suppose doctor Cecil Granthum would throw pillows at anybody he remarked sarcastically as she placed it very gently under his head Perhaps if the provocation was great enough What have they been doing to you Did Weary say I got bucked off he demanded excitedly The Little Doctor was counting his pulse and waited till she had finished It was a high number much higher than she liked No Weary didn t How could he You didn t you know I saw it all from the bluff and I know the horse turned over upon you It s a wonder you weren t killed outright Now don t worry about it any more I expect it was the Countess told you that Weary hated dreadfully to leave you I wonder if you know how much he thinks of you I didn t till I saw how he looked when you here drink this all of it You ve got to sleep you see There was a week when the house was kept very still and the south room very cool and shadowy and Chip did not much care who it was that ministered to him only that the hands of the Little Doctor were always soft and soothing on his head and he wished she would keep them there always when he was himself enough to wish anything coherently CHAPTER XII The Last Stand To use a trite expression and say that Chip fought his way back to health would be simply stating a fact and stating it mildly He went about it much as he would go about gentling a refractory broncho and with nearly the same results His ankle however simply could not be hurried or bluffed into premature soundness and the Little Doctor was at her wits end to keep Chip from fretting himself back into fever once he was safely pulled out of it She made haste to explain the bit of overheard conversation which he harped on more than he dreamed when his head went light in that first week and so established a more friendly feeling between them Still there was a certain aloofness about him which she could not conquer try as she might Just so far they were comrades beyond Chip walked moodily alone The Little Doctor did not like that overmuch She preferred to know that she fairly understood her friends and was admitted sometimes to their full confidence She did not relish bumping her head against a blank wall that was too high to look over or to climb and in which there seemed to be no door To be sure he talked freely and amusingly of his adventures and of the places he had known but it was always an impersonal recital and told little of his real self or his real feelings Still when she asked him he told her exactly what he thought about things whether his opinion pleased her or not There were times when he would sit in the old Morris chair and smoke and watch her make lacey stuff in a little round frame Battenberg she said it was He loved to see her fingers manipulate the needle and the thread and take wonderful pains with her work but once she showed him a butterfly whose wings did not quite match and he pointed it out to her She had been listening to him tell a story of Indians and cowboys and with some wild riding mixed into it and well she used the wrong stitch but no one would notice it in a thousand years This her argument You ll always know the mistake s there and you won t get the satisfaction out of it you would if it was perfect would you argued Chip letting his eyes dwell on her face more than was good for him The Little Doctor pouted her lips in a way to tempt a man all he could stand and snipped out the wing with her scissors and did it over So with her painting She started a scene in the edge of the Bad Lands down the river Chip knew the place well There was a heated discussion over the foreground for the Little Doctor wanted him to sketch in some Indian tepees and some squaws for her and Chip absolutely refused to do so He said there were no Indians in that country and it would spoil the whole picture anyway The Little Doctor threatened to sketch them herself drawing on her imagination and what little she knew of Indians but something in his eyes stayed her hand She left the easel in disgust and refused to touch it again for a week She was to spend a long day with Miss Satterly the schoolma am and started off soon after breakfast one morning I hope you ll find something to keep you out of mischief while I m gone she remarked with a pretty authoritative air Make him take his medicine Johnny and don t let him have the crutches Well I think I shall hide them to make sure I wish to goodness you had that picture done grumbled Chip It seems to me you re doing a heap of running around lately Why don t you finish it up Those lonesome hills are getting on my nerves I ll cover it up said she Let it be I like to look at them Chip leaned back in his chair and watched her a hunger greater than he knew in his eyes It was most awfully lonesome when she was gone all day and last night she had been writing all the evening to doctor Cecil Granthum damn him Chip always hitched that invective to the unknown doctor s name for some reason he saw fit not to explain to himself He didn t see what she could find to write about so much for his part And he did hate a long day with no one but Johnny to talk to He craned his neck to keep her in view as long as possible drew a long discontented breath and settled himself more comfortably in the chair where he spent the greater part of his waking hours Hand me the tobacco will you kid He fished his cigarette book from his pocket Thanks He tore a narrow strip from the paper and sifted in a little tobacco Now a match kid and then you re done Johnny placed the matches within easy reach shoved a few magazines close to Chip s elbow and stretched himself upon the floor with a book Chip lay back against the cushions and smoked lazily his eyes half closed dreaming rather than thinking The unfinished painting stood facing him upon its easel and his eyes idly fixed upon it He knew the place so well Jagged pinnacles dotted here and there with scrubby pines hemmed in a tiny basin below where was blank canvas He went mentally over the argument again and from that drifted to a scene he had witnessed in that same basin one day but that was in the winter Dirty gray snow drifts where a chinook had cut them and icy side hills made the place still drearier And the foreground if the Little Doctor could get that now she would be doing something ah that foreground A poor half starved range cow with her calf which the round up had overlooked in the fall stood at bay against a steep cut bank Before them squatted five great gaunt wolves intent upon fresh beef for their supper But the cow s horns were long and sharp and threatening and the calf snuggled close to her side shivering with the cold and the fear of death The wolves licked their cruel lips and their eyes gleamed hungrily but the eyes of the cow answered them gleam for gleam If it could be put upon canvas just as he had seen it with the bitter biting cold of a frozen chinook showing gray and sinister in the slaty sky Kid Huh Johnny struggled reluctantly back to Montana Get me the Little Doctor s paint and truck over on that table and slide that easel up here Johnny stared opened his mouth to speak then wisely closed it and did as he was bidden Philosophically he told himself it was Chip s funeral if the Little Doctor made a kick All right kid Chip tossed the cigarette stub out of the window You can go ahead and read now Lock the door first and don t you bother me not on your life Then Chip plunged headlong into the Bad Lands so to speak A few dabs of dirty white here and there a wholly original manipulation of the sky what mattered the method so he attained the result Half an hour and the hills were clutched in the chill embrace of a frozen chinook such as the Little Doctor had never seen in her life But Johnny peeping surreptitiously over Chip s shoulder stared at the change then feeling the spirit of it shivered in sympathy with the barren hills Hully gee he muttered under his breath he s sure a corker t paint cold that fair makes yer nose sting And he curled up in a chair behind where he could steal a look now and then without fear of detection But Chip was dead to all save that tiny basin in the Bad Lands to the wolves and their quarry His eyes burned as they did when the fever held him each cheek bone glowed flaming red As wolf after wolf appeared with what to Johnny seemed uncanny swiftness and squatted grinning and sinister in a relentless half circle the book slipped unheeded to the floor with a clatter that failed to rouse the painter whose ears were dulled to all else than the pitiful blat of a shivering panic stricken calf whose nose sought his mother s side for her comforting warmth and protection The Countess rapped on the door for dinner and Johnny rose softly and tiptoed out to quiet her May he be forgiven the lies he told that day of how Chip s head ached and he wanted to sleep and must not be disturbed by strict orders of the Little Doctor The Countess to whom the very name of the Little Doctor was a fetich closed all intervening doors and walked on her toes in the kitchen and Johnny rejoiced at the funeral quiet which rested upon the house Faster flew the brush Now the eyes of the cow glared desperate defiance One might almost see her bony side ruffled by the cutting north wind heave with her breathing She was fighting death for herself and her baby but for how long Already the nose of one great gray beast was straight uplifted sniffing impatient Would they risk a charge upon those lowered horns The dark pines shook their feathery heads hopelessly A little while perhaps and then Chip laid down the brush and sank back in the chair Was the sun so low He could do no more yes he took up a brush and added the title The Last Stand He was very white and his hand shook Johnny leaned over the back of the chair his eyes glued to the picture Gee he muttered huskily I d like t git a whack at them wolves once Chip turned his head until he could look at the lad s face What do you think of it kid he asked shakily Johnny did not answer for a moment It was hard to put what he felt into words I dunno just how t say it he said gropingly at last but it makes me want t go gunnin fer them wolves b fore they hamstring her It well it don t seem t me like it was a pitcher somehow It seems like the reel thing kinda Chip moved his head languidly upon the cushion I m dead tired kid No I m not hungry nor I don t want any coffee or anything Just roll this chair over to the bed will you I m dead tired Johnny was worried He did not know what the Little Doctor would say for Chip had not eaten his dinner or taken his medicine Somehow there had been that in his face that had made Johnny afraid to speak to him He went back to the easel and looked long at the picture his heart bursting with rage that he could not take his rifle and shoot those merciless grinning brutes Even after he had drawn the curtain before it and stood the easel in its accustomed place he kept lifting the curtain to take another look at that wordless tragedy of the West CHAPTER XIII Art Critics It was late the next forenoon when the Little Doctor feeling the spirit of artistic achievement within her gathered up brushes and paints for a couple hours work Chip sitting by the window smoking a cigarette watched her uneasily from the tail of his eye Looking back to yesterday s spasm as he dubbed it mentally he was filled with a great and unaccountable shyness What had seemed so real to him then he feared to day to face as trivial and weak He wanted to cry Stop when she laid hand to the curtain but he looked instead out across the coulee to the hills beyond the blood surging unevenly through his veins He felt when she drew the cloth aside she stopped short off in the middle of telling him something Miss Satterly had said some whimsical thing and he could hear his heart pounding in the silence which followed The little nickel alarm clock tick tick ticked with such maddening precision and speed that Chip wanted to shy a book at it but his eyes never left the rocky bluff opposite and the clock ticked merrily on One minute two the silence was getting unbearable He could not endure another second He looked toward her she stood one hand full of brushes gazing white faced at The Last Stand As he looked a tear rolled down the cheek nearest him and compelled him to speech What s the matter His voice seemed to him rough and brutal but he did not mean it so The Little Doctor drew a long quivering breath Oh the poor brave thing she said in a hushed tone She turned sharply away and sat down I expect I spoiled your picture all right but I told you I d get into mischief if you went gadding around and left me alone The Little Doctor stealthily wiped her eyes hoping to goodness Chip had not seen that they had need of wiping Why didn t you tell me you could paint like that She turned upon him fiercely Here you ve sat and looked on at me daubing things up and if I d known you could do better than Looking again at the canvas she forgot to finish The fascination of it held her I m not in the habit of going around the country shouting what I don t know said Chip defensively You ve taken heaps of lessons and I never did I just noticed the color of everything and oh I don t know it s in me to do those things I can t help trying to paint and draw I suppose old Von Heim would have something to say of your way of doing clouds but you got the effect though better than he did sometimes And that cow I can see her breathe I tell you And the wolves oh don t sit there and smoke your everlasting cigarettes and look so stoical over it What are you made of anyway Can t you feel proud Oh don t you know what you ve done I I d like to shake you so now Well I don t much blame you I knew I d no business to meddle Maybe if you ll touch it up a little I ll not touch a brush to THAT I I m afraid I might kill the cow She gave a little hysterical laugh Don t you think you re rather excitable for a doctor scoffed Chip and her chin went up for a minute I d like t kill them wolves said Johnny coming in just then Turn the thing around kid so I can see it commanded Chip suddenly I worked at it yesterday till the colors all ran together and I couldn t tell much about it Johnny turned the easel and Chip looking fell silent Had HIS hand guided the brush while that scene grew from blank canvas to palpitating reality Verily he had builded better than he knew Something in his throat gripped achingly and dry Did anybody see it yesterday asked the Little Doctor No not unless the kid I never said a word about it denied Johnny hastily and vehemently I lied like the dickens I said you had headache an was tryin t sleep it off I kep the Countess teeterin around on her toes all afternoon Johnny giggled at the memory of it Well I m going to call them all in and see what they say declared she starting for the door I don t THINK you will began Chip rebelliously blushing over his achievement like a girl over her graduation essay I don t want to be Well we needn t tell them you did it suggested she Oh if you re willing to shoulder the blame compromised Chip much relieved He hated to be fussed over The Little Doctor regarded him attentively a moment smiled queerly to herself and stood back to get a better view of the painting I ll shoulder the blame and maybe claim the glory It was mine in the first place you know She watched him from under her lashes Yes it s yours all right said Chip readily but something went out of his face and lodged rather painfully in the deepest corner of his heart He ignored it proudly and smiled back at her Do such things really happen out here she asked hurriedly I d tell a man said Chip his eyes returning to the picture I was riding through that country last winter and I came upon that very cow just as you see her there in that same basin That s how I came to paint it into your foreground I got to thinking about it and I couldn t help trying to put it on canvas Only I opened up on the wolves with my six shooter and I got two that big fellow ready to howl there and that one next the cut bank The rest broke out down the coulee and made for the breaks where I couldn t follow They Say Old Dunk s comin announced Johnny hurrying in Why don t yuh let im see the pitcher an think all the time the Little Doctor done it Gee it d be great t hear im go on an praise it up like he always does an not know the diffrunce Johnny you re a genius cried she effusively Don t tell a soul that Chip had a brush in his hand yesterday will you He he d rather not have anyone know he did anything to the painting you see Aw I won t tell interrupted Johnny gruffly eying his divinity with distrust for the first time in his short acquaintance with her Was she mean enough to claim it really Just at first as a joke it would be fun but afterward oh she wouldn t do a thing like that Don t you bring Dunk in here warned Chip or things might happen I don t want to run up against him again till I ve got two good feet to stand on Their relation was a thing to be watched over tenderly since Chip s month of invalidism Dunk had notions concerning master and servant and concerning Chip as an individual He did not fancy occupying the back bedroom while Chip reigned in his sunny south room waited on petted Dunk applied the term petted and amused indefatigably by the Little Doctor And there had been a scene short but exceeding strenuous over a pencil sketch which graphically portrayed an incident Dunk fain would forget the incident of himself as a would be broncho fighter with Banjo of vigilante fame as the means of his downfall physical mental and spiritual Dunk might in time have forgiven the crippled ankle and the consequent appropriation of his room but never would he forgive the merciless detail of that sketch I ll carry easel and all into the parlor and leave the door open so you can hear what they all say said the Little Doctor cheerfully I wish Cecil could be here to day I always miss Cecil when there s anything especial going on in the way of fun Yes answered Chip and made himself another cigarette He would be glad when he could hobble out to some lonely spot and empty his soul of the profane language stored away opposite the name of doctor Cecil Granthum There is so little comfort in swearing all inside when one feels deeply upon a subject It s a wonder you wouldn t send for him if you miss him that bad he remarked after a minute hoping the Little Doctor would not find anything amiss with his tone which he meant should be cordial and interested and which evinced plenty of interest of a kind but was curiously lacking in cordiality I did beg and tease and entreat but Cecil s in a hospital as a physician you understand not as a patient and can t get off just yet In a month or two perhaps Dinner called shrilly by the Countess interrupted her and she flitted out of the room looking as little like a lovelorn maiden as she did like a doctor which was little indeed She begged and teased and entreated repeated Chip savagely to himself when the door closed upon her and fell into gloomy meditation which left him feeling that there was no good thing in this wicked world no not one that was not appropriated by some one with not sense enough to understand and appreciate his blessing After dinner the Little Doctor spoke to the unsuspecting critics That picture which I started a couple of weeks ago is finished at last and I want you good people to come and tell me what you think of it I want you all you Slim and Louise you are to come and give your opinion Well I don t know the first thing about paintin remonstrated the Countess coming in from the kitchen The Old Man lighted his pipe and followed her into the parlor with the others and Slim rolled a cigarette to hide his embarrassment for the role of art critic was new to him There was some nervousness in the Little Doctor s manner as she set the easel to her liking and drew aside the curtain She did not mean to be theatrical about it but Chip watching through the open door fancied so and let his lip curl a trifle He was not in a happy frame of mind just then A silence fell upon the group The Old Man took his pipe from his mouth and stared The cheeks of the Little Doctor paled and grew pink again She laughed a bit as though she would much rather cry Say something somebody quick she cried when her nerves would bear no more Well I do think it s awfully good Dell began the Countess By golly I don t see how you done that without seein it happen exclaimed Slim looking very dazed and mystified That s a Diamond Bar cow remarked J G abstractedly That outfit never does git half their calves I remember the last time I rode through there last winter that cow doggone it Dell how the dickens did you get that cow an calf in You must a had a photograph t work from By golly that s right chimed in Slim That there s the cow I had sech a time chasin out uh the bunch down on the bottom I run her till I was plum sick an so was she by golly I d know her among a thousand Yuh got her complete all but the beller an by golly yuh come blame near gittin that too Slim always slow and very much in earnest gradually became infused with the spirit of the scene Jest look at that ole gray sinner with his nose r ared straight up in the air over there By golly he s callin all his wife s relations t come an help em out He s thinkin the ole Diamon Bar s goin t be one too many fer em She shore looks fighty with er head down an er eyes rollin all ways t oncet ready fer the first darn cuss that makes a crooked move An they know it too by golly er they wouldn t hang back like they re a doin I d shore like t be cached behind that ole pine stub with a thirty thirty an a fist full uh shells I d shore make a scatteration among em A feller could easy But Slim they re nothing but paint The Little Doctor s eyes were shining Slim turned red and grinned sheepishly at the others I kinda fergot it wasn t nothin but a pitcher he stammered apologetically That is the gist of the whole matter said Dunk You couldn t ask for a greater compliment or higher praise than that Miss Della One forgets that it is a picture One only feels a deep longing for a good rifle You must let me take it with me to Butte That picture will make you famous among cattlemen at least That is to say out West here And if you will sell it I am positive I can get you a high price for it The eyes of the Little Doctor involuntarily sought the Morris chair in the next room but Chip was looking out across the coulee as he had a habit of doing lately and seemed not to hear what was going on in the parlor He was indifference personified if one might judge from his outward appearance The Little Doctor turned her glance resentfully to her brother s partner Do you mean all that she demanded of him I certainly do It is great Miss Della I admit that it is not quite like your other work the treatment seems different in places and er stronger It is the best picture of the kind that I have ever seen I think It holds one in a way By golly I bet Chip took a pitcher uh that exclaimed Slim who had been doing some hard thinking He was tellin us last winter about ridin up on that ole Diamon Bar cow with a pack uh wolves around her an her a standin em off an he shot two uh the wolves Yes sir Chip jest about got a snap shot of em Well doggone it what if he did The Old Man turned jealously upon him It ain t everyone that kin paint like that with nothin but a little kodak picture t go by Doggone it I don t care if Dell had a hull apurn full uh kodak pictures that Chip took it s a rattlin good piece uh work all the same I ain t sayin anything agin the pitcher retorted Slim I was jest wonderin how she happened t git that cow down s fine brand n all without some kind uh pattern t go by S fur s the pitcher goes it s about as good s kin be did with paint I guess I ain t ever seen anything in the pitcher line that looked any natcherler Well I do think it s just splendid gurgled the Countess It s every bit as good s the one Mary got with a year s subscription t the Household Treasure fer fifty cents That one s got some hounds chasin a deer and a man hidin in the bushes sost yuh kin jest see his head It s an awful purty pitcher but this one s jest as good I do b lieve it s a little bit better if anything Mary s has got some awful nice green grass an the sky s an awful purty blue jest about the color uh my blue silk waist But yuh can t expect t have grass an sky like that in the winter an this is more of a winter pitcher It looks awful cold an lonesome somehow an it makes yuh want t cry if yuh look at it long enough The critics stampeded as they always did when the Countess began to talk You better let Dunk take it with him Dell was the parting advice of the Old Man CHAPTER XIV Convalescence You don t mind do you The Little Doctor was visibly uneasy Mind what Chip s tone was one of elaborate unconsciousness Mind Dunk s selling the picture for you Why should I It s yours you know I think you have some interest in it yourself she said without looking at him You don t think I mean to to I don t think anything except that it s your picture and I put in a little time meddling with your property for want of something else to do All I painted doesn t cover one quarter of the canvas and I guess you ve done enough for me to more than make up I guess you needn t worry over that cow and calf you re welcome to them both and if you can get a bounty on those five wolves I ll be glad to have you Just keep still about my part of it Chip really felt that way about it after the first dash of wounded pride He could never begin to square accounts with the Little Doctor anyhow and he was proud that he could do something for her even if it was nothing more than fixing up a picture so that it rose considerably above mediocrity He had meant it that way all along but the suspicion that she was quite ready to appropriate his work rather shocked him just at first No one likes having a gift we joy in bestowing calmly taken from our hands before it has been offered He wanted her to have the picture for her very own but but He had not thought of the possibility of her selling it or of Dunk as her agent It was all right of course if she wanted to do that with it but There was something about it that hurt and the hurt of it was not less simply because he could not locate the pain His mind fidgeted with the subject If he could have saddled Silver and gone for a long gallop over the prairie land he could have grappled with his rebellious inner self and choked to death several unwelcome emotions he thought But there was Silver crippled and swung uncomfortably in canvas wrappings in the box stall and here was himself crippled and held day after day in one room and one chair albeit a very pleasant room and a very comfortable chair and a gallop as impossible to one of them as to the other I do wish The Little Doctor checked herself abruptly and hummed a bit of coon song What do you wish Chip pushed his thoughts behind him and tried to speak in his usual manner Nothing much I was just wishing Cecil could see The Last Stand Chip said absolutely nothing for five minutes and for an excellent reason There was not a single thought during that time which would sound pretty if put into words and he had no wish to shock the Little Doctor After that day a constraint fell upon them both which each felt keenly and neither cared to explain away The Last Stand was tacitly dismissed from their conversation of which there grew less and less as the days passed Then came a time when Chip strongly resented being looked upon as an invalid and Johnny was sent home greatly to his sorrow Chip hobbled about the house on crutches and chafed and fretted and managed to be very miserable indeed because he could not get out and ride and clear his brain and heart of some of their hurt for it had come to just that he had been compelled to own that there was a hurt which would not heal in a hurry It was a very bitter young man who lounging in the big chair by the window one day suddenly snorted contempt at a Western story he had been reading and cast the magazine one of the Six Leading clean into the parlor where it sprawled its artistic leaves in the middle of the floor The Little Doctor was somewhere he never seemed to know just where nowadays and the house was lonesome as an isolated peak in the Bad Lands I wish I had the making of the laws I d put a bounty on all the darn fools that think they can write cowboy stories just because they rode past a roundup once on a fast train he growled reaching for his tobacco sack Huh I d like to meet up with the yahoo that wrote that rank yarn I d ask him where he got his lack of information Huh A cow puncher togged up like he was going after the snakiest bronk in the country when he was only going to drive to town in a buckboard His pistol belt and dirk and leathern chaps oh Lord oh Lord And spurs I wonder if he thinks it takes spurs to ride a buckboard Do they think back East that spurs grow on a man s heels out here and won t come off Do they think we SLEEP in em I wonder He drew a match along the arm of the chair where the varnish was worn off They think all a cow puncher has to do is eat and sleep and ride fat horses I d like to tell some of them a few things that they don t I ve brought you a caller Chip Aren t you glad to see him It was the Little Doctor at the window and the laugh he loved was in her voice and in her eyes that it hurt him to meet lately The color surged to his face and he leaned from the window his thin white hand outstretched caressingly I d tell a man he said and choked a little over it Silver old boy Silver nickering softly limped forward and nestled his nose in the palm of his master He s been out in the corral for several days but I didn t tell you I wanted it for a surprise said the Little Doctor This is his longest trip but he ll soon be well now Yes I d give a good deal if I could walk as well as he can said Chip gloomily He wasn t hurt as badly as you were You ought to be thankful you can walk at all and that you won t limp all your life I was afraid for a while just at first You were Why didn t you tell me Chip s eyes were fixed sternly upon her Because I didn t want to It would only have made matters worse anyway And you won t limp you know if you re careful for a while longer I m going to get Silver his sugar He has sugar every day Silver lifted his head and looked after her inquiringly whinnied complainingly and prepared to follow as best he could Silver oh Silver Chip snapped his fingers to attract his attention Hang the luck come back here Would you throw down your best friend for that girl Has she got to have you too His voice grew wistfully rebellious You re mine Come back here you little fool she doesn t care Silver stopped at the corner swung his head and looked back at Chip beckoning coaxing swearing under his breath His eyes sought for sign of his goddess who had disappeared most mysteriously Throwing up his head he sent a protest shrilling through the air and looked no more at Chip I m coming now be still Oh don t you dare paw with your lame leg Why didn t you stay with your master He s no use for his master any more said Chip with a hurt laugh A woman always does play the mischief somehow I wonder why They look innocent enough Wait till your turn comes and perhaps you ll learn why retorted she Chip knowing that his turn had come and come to tarry found nothing to say Beside continued the Little Doctor Silver didn t want me so much it was the sugar I hope you aren t jealous of me because I know his heart is big enough to hold us both She stayed a long half hour and was so gay that it seemed like old times to listen to her laugh and watch her dimples while she talked Chip forgot that he had a quarrel with fate and he also forgot doctor Cecil Granthum of Gilroy Ohio until Slim rode up and handed the Little Doctor a letter addressed in that bold up and down writing that Chip considered a little the ugliest specimen of chirography he had ever seen in his life It s from Cecil said the Little Doctor simply and unnecessarily and led Silver back down the hill Chip gazing at that tiresome bluff across the coulee renewed his quarrel with fate CHAPTER XV The Spoils of Victory I wish while I m gone you d paint me another picture Will you PLEASE When a girl has big gray eyes that half convince you they are not gray at all but brown or blue at times and a way of using them that makes a fellow heady like champagne and a couple of dimples that will dodge into her cheeks just when a fellow is least prepared to resist them why what can a fellow do but knuckle under and say yes especially when she lets her head tip to one side a little and says please like that Chip tried not to look at her but he couldn t help himself very well while she stood directly in front of him He compromised weakly instead of refusing point blank as he told himself he wanted to do I don t know maybe I can t again Maybe you can though Here s an eighteen by twenty four canvas and here are all the paints I have in the house and the brushes I ll expect to see something worth while when I return Well but if I can t Look here Straight in the eye if you please Now will you TRY Chip looking into her eyes that were laughing but with a certain earnestness behind the laugh threw up his hands mentally you know Yes I ll try How long are you going to be gone Oh perhaps a week she said lightly and Chip s heart went heavy You may paint any kind of picture you like but I d rather you did something like The Last Stand only better And put your brand as you call it in one corner You won t sell it will you The words slipped out before he knew No no I won t sell it for it won t be mine It s for yourself this time Then there won t be any picture said Chip shortly Oh yes there will smiled the Little Doctor sweetly and went away before he could contradict her Perhaps a week Heavens that was seven days and every day had at least sixteen waking hours How would it be when it was years then When doctor Cecil Granthum er no I won t The invective attached to that gentleman s name was something not to be repeated here At any rate a week was a long long time to put in without any gray eyes or any laugh or any dimples or in short without the Little Doctor He could not see for his part why she wanted to go gadding off to the Falls with Len Adams and the schoolma am anyway Couldn t they get along without her They always had before she came to the country but for that matter so had he The problem was how was he going to get along without her for the rest of his life What did they want to stay a week for Couldn t they buy everything they wanted in a day or so And the Giant Spring wasn t such great shakes nor the Rainbow Falls that they need to hang around town a week just to look at them And the picture what was he such a fool for Couldn t he say no with a pair of gray eyes staring into his It seemed not He supposed he must think up something to daub on there the poorer the better That first day Chip smoked something like two dozen cigarettes gazed out across the coulee till his eyes ached glared morosely at the canvas on the easel which stared back at him till the dull blankness of it stamped itself upon his brain and he could see nothing else look where he might Whereupon he gathered up hat and crutches and hobbled slowly down the hill to tell Silver his troubles The second day threatened to be like the first Chip sat by the window and smoked but little by little the smoke took form and substance until when he turned his eyes to the easel a picture looked back at him even though to other eyes the canvas was yet blank and waiting There was no Johnny this time to run at his beckoning He limped about on his crutches collected all things needful and sat down to work As he sketched and painted with a characteristic rapidity that was impatient of the slightest interruption yet patient in its perfectness of detail the picture born of the smoke grew steadily upon the canvas It seemed at first that The Last Stand was to be repeated There were the same jagged pinnacles and scrubby pines held in the fierce grip of the frozen chinook The same But there was a difference not to be explained perhaps but certainly to be felt The Little Doctor s hills were jagged barren hills her pines were very nice pines indeed Chip s hills were jagged they were barren they were desolate his pines were shuddering lonely pines for he had wandered alone among them and had caught the Message of the Wilderness His sky was the cold sinister sky of The Last Stand but it was colder more sinister for it was night A young moon hung low in the west its face half hidden behind a rift of scurrying snow clouds The tiny basin was shadowy and vague the cut bank a black wall touched here and there by a quivering shaft of light There was no threatening cow with lowered horns and watchful eye there was no panic stricken calf to whip up her flagging courage with its trust in her The wolves Yes there were the wolves but there were more of them They were not sitting in a waiting half circle they were scattered unwatchful Two of them in the immediate foreground were wrangling over a half gnawed bone The rest of the pack were nosing a heap pitifully eloquent As before so now they tricked the eye into a fancy that they lived One could all but hear the snarls of the two standing boldly in the moonlight the hair all bristly along the necks the white fangs gleaming between tense drawn lips One felt tempted to brace oneself for the rush that was to come For two days Chip shut himself in his room and worked through the long hours of daylight jealous of the minutes darkness stole from him He clothed the feast in a merciful shade which hid the repugnance and left only the pathos two long sharp horns which gleamed in the moonlight but were no longer threatening He centered his energy upon the two wolves in the foreground grimly determined that Slim should pray for a Gatling gun when he saw them The third day when he was touching up the shoulders of one of the combatants a puff of wind blew open the door which led to the parlor He did not notice it and kept steadily at work painting his brand into a corner Beneath the stump and its splinter he lettered his name a thing he had never done before Well I ll be doggoned Chip jumped half out of his chair giving his lame ankle a jolt which made him grind his teeth Darn it Chip did YOU do that It kind of looks that way don t it Chip was plainly disconcerted and his ankle hurt H m m The Old Man eyed it sharply a minute It s a wonder you wouldn t paint in a howl or two while you re about it I suppose that s a mate to doggone you Chip why didn t yuh tell us you painted that other one I didn t said Chip getting red and uncomfortable except the cow and Yes except the part that makes the picture worth the paint it s done with snorted the Old Man I must say I never thought that uh Dell Thought what flared Chip hotly forgetting everything but that the Little Doctor was being censured It was her picture she started it and intended to finish it I painted on it one day when she was gone and she didn t know it I told her not to tell anyone I had anything to do with it It wasn t her fault Huh grunted the Old Man as if he had his own opinion on that matter Well it s a rattling good picture but this one s better Poor ole Diamond Bar she couldn t come through with it after all She put up a good fight out there alone but she had t go under her an her calf He stood quiet a minute gazing and gazing Doggone them measly wolves Why in thunder can t a feller pump lead into em like he wants t Chip s heart glowed within him His technique was faulty his colors daring perhaps but his triumph was for that the greater If men could FEEL his pictures and they did That was the joy of it they did Darn them snarlin brutes anyway I thought it was doggone queer if Dell could dab away all her life at nice common things that you only think is purty an then blossom out all of a sudden with one like that other was that yuh felt all up an down yer back The little cheat she d no business t take the glory uh that n like she done I ll give her thunder when she gits back You won t do anything of the kind said Chip quietly too quietly not to be menacing I tell you that was my fault I gave her all I did to the picture and I told her not to say anything Do you think I don t know what I owe to her Do you think I don t know she saved Silver s life and maybe mine Forty pictures wouldn t square me with the Little Doctor not if they were a heap better than they are and she claimed every darned one I m doing this and I ll thank you not to buy in where you re not wanted This picture is for her too but I don t want the thing shouted from the housetops When you go out I wish you d shut the door The Old Man thoroughly subdued took the hint He went out and he shut the door CHAPTER XVI Weary Advises I have a short article here which may interest you Miss Della said Dunk coming out on the porch a few days later with a Butte paper in his hand The Little Doctor was swinging leisurely in the hammock It s about the picture he added smiling The picture Oh let me see The Little Doctor stopped the hammock with her toe and sat up The wind had tumbled her hair about her face and drawn extra color to her cheeks and she looked very sweet Dunk thought He held out the paper pointing a well kept finger at the place he wished her to read There was a rather large headline for news was scarce just then and every little thing was made the most of The eyes of the Little Doctor clung greedily to the lines It is reported that The Last Stand has been sold The painting which has been on exhibition in the lobby of the Summit Hotel has attracted much attention among art lovers and many people have viewed it in the last week Duncan Gray Whitaker the well known mine owner and cattleman who brought the picture to Butte is said to have received an offer which the artist will probably accept mister Whitaker still declines to give the artist s name but whoever he is he certainly has a brilliant future before him and Montana can justly feel proud of him It has been rumored that the artist is a woman but the best critics are slow to believe this claiming that the work has been done with a power and boldness undoubtedly masculine Those who have seen The Last Stand will not easily forget it and the price offered for it is said to be a large one mister Whitaker will leave the city to morrow to consult the unknown artist and promises upon his return to reveal the name of the modest genius who can so infuse a bit of canvas with palpitating life What do you think of that Isn t the modest genius rather proud of the hit she has made I wish you could have seen the old stockmen stand around it and tell wolf stories to one another by the hour The women came and cried over it they were so sorry for the cow Really Miss Della she s the most famous cow in Butte just now I had plenty of smaller offers but I waited till Senator Blake came home he s a crank on Western pictures and he has a long pocketbook and won t haggle over prices He took it just as I expected but he insists that the artist s name must be attached to it and if you take his offer he may bring the picture down himself for he s quite anxious to meet you I am to wire your decision at once The Little Doctor watched a pale green measuring worm loop its way hurriedly along the floor of the porch She was breathing rather quickly and unevenly and she seemed to be thinking very fast When the worm reaching the end doubled out of sight she started the hammock swinging and leaned back upon her cushions You may tell him to come I should like very much to see him she said And I am very much obliged to you for the service you have performed She became very much interested in a magazine and seemed to dismiss Dunk and the picture entirely from her mind Dunk after waiting till he was convinced she had no intention of saying more went off to the stables to find a messenger for the telegram telling himself on the way that Miss Della Whitmore was a very cool young person and not as grateful as he would like her to be The Little Doctor went immediately to find Chip but that young man who had been just inside the window and had heard every word was not so easily found He was down in the bunk house thinking things And when she did find him near supper time he was so utterly unapproachable that her courage and her patience failed together and she did not mention the picture at all Hello Doctor It was a heartening voice sounding very sweet to the ears of the Little Doctor just then She turned eagerly her arms still clasping Silver s neck She had come down to the corral to feed him sugar and tell him what a very difficult young man his master was and how he held her at arm s length with his manner and yet was nice and friendly and sunny enough like the sun shining on an iceberg But human sympathy was within reach of her hand and it was much more satisfying than the mute sympathy of a horse Weary Willy Davidson you don t know how glad I am to see you As the sayin is Yuh think of angels an their opposets ain t fur off I AM glad to see you Dirt and all grinned Weary for he had ridden far in the heat and was dust grimed and travelworn He pulled the saddle off Glory also travelworn and sweat grimed and gave him an affectionate slap of dismissal I d chance money you wasn t thinking of me he said pointedly How is the old ranch anyhow Splinter up yet You must think I m a feeble excuse for a doctor retorted she Of course he s up He walks all around the house and yard with a cane I promoted him from crutches yesterday Good shot That was sure a bad foot he had on him and I didn t know What s he been putting in the time at Making pictures or love Pictures said the Little Doctor hastily laying her cheek against Silver s mane I d like to see him making love Yuh would said Weary innocently disregarding the irony of her tone Well if yuh ever do I tell yuh right now you ll see the real thing If he makes love like he does other things there won t any female girl dodge his loop that s straight What about the pictures Well he drew a picture of J G sliding down the kitchen steps before he was out of bed And he made a picture of Dunk that time Banjo bucked him off you saw that happen I suppose and it was great Dunk was standing on his head in front of his horse but I can t show you it because it blew out of the window and landed at Dunk s feet in the path and he picked it up and tore it into little bits And he doesn t play in Chip s yard any more He never did grinned Weary Dunk s a great hand to go around shooting off his mouth about things he s no business to buy into and old Splinter let him down on his face once or twice Chip can sure give a man a hard fall when he wants to and not use many words either What little he does say generally counts The Little Doctor s memory squirmed assentingly It s the tone he uses she said reflectively The way he can say yes sometimes You ve bumped into that huh Bert Rogers lit into him with a tent peg once for saying yes at him They sure was busy for a few minutes I just sat in the shade of a wagon wheel and laughed till I near cracked a rib When they got through they laughed too and they played ten games uh pool together that night and got Weary caught himself up suddenly Pool ain t any gambling game he hastened to explain It s just knocking balls into the pockets innocent like yuh see mister Davidson there s something I d like to tell you about Will you wait a few minutes more for your supper Sure said Weary wonderingly and sat down upon the edge of the watering trough The Little Doctor her arms still around Silver s neck told him all about The Last Stand and The Spoils of Victory and Chip and Dunk and herself And Weary listened silently digging little trenches in the hard soil with the rowels of his spurs and knowing Chip as he did understanding the matter much better than did the Little Doctor And he doesn t seem to know that I never meant to claim the picture as my work and I can t explain while he acts so oh you know how he can act And Dunk wouldn t have sold the picture if he had known Chip painted it and it was wrong of course but I did so want Chip to have some real encouragement so he would make that his life work YOU know he is fitted for something better than cow punching And now the picture has made a hit and brought a good price and he must own it Dunk will be furious of course but that doesn t matter to me it s Chip that I can t seem to manage Weary smiled queerly down at his spurs It s a cinch you could manage him easy enough if you took the right way to do it he said quietly Probably the right way would be too much trouble said the Little Doctor with her chin well up Once I get this picture deal settled satisfactorily I m quite willing to resign and let him manage himself Senator Blake is coming to morrow and I m so glad you will be here to help me I d sure like to see yuh through with the deal Old Blake won t be hard to throw I know him and so does Chip Didn t he tell yuh about it Tell me flashed the Little Doctor I told him Senator Blake was coming and that he wanted to buy the picture and he just made him a cigarette and said Ye e es And after that there wasn t any conversation of any description Weary threw back his head and laughed That sure sounds just like him he said and at that minute Chip himself hobbled into the corral and the Little Doctor hastened to leave it and retreat to the house CHAPTER XVII When a Maiden Wills It was Dunk who drove to meet the train next day and it was an extremely nervous young woman who met Senator Blake upon the porch Chip sprawled in the hammock on the east porch out of sight The senator was a little man whose coat did not fit and whose hair was sandy and sparse and who had keen twinkling blue eyes which managed to see a great deal more than one would suspect from the rest of his face He pumped the Little Doctor s hand up and down three times and called her My dear young lady After the first ten minutes the Little Doctor s spirits rose considerably and her heart stopped thumping so she could hear it She remembered what Weary had told her that Old Blake won t be hard to throw She no longer feared the senator but she refused to speculate upon what Chip might do He seemed more approachable to day but that did not count probably he was only reflecting Weary s sunshine and would freeze solid the minute And so you are the mysterious genius who has set the Butte critics by the ears chuckled the senator They say your cloud treatment is all wrong and that your coloring is too bold but directly they forget all that and wonder which wolf will make the first dash and how many the cow will put out of business before she goes under herself Don t be offended if I say that you look more capable of portraying woolly white lambs at play than ravening wolves measuring the strength of their quarry I must confess I was looking for the er MAN behind that brush I told the senator coming out that it was a lady he would have to make terms with He would hardly believe it smiled Dunk He needn t believe it said the Little Doctor much more calmly than she felt I don t remember ever saying that I painted The Last Stand Dunk threw up his head and looked at her sharply Genius is certainly modest he said with a laugh that was not nice to hear In this case the genius is unusually modest assented she getting rather white Unfortunately for myself senator I did not paint the ravening wolves which caught your fancy It would be utterly beyond my brush A glimmering of the truth came to Dunk and his eyes narrowed Who did paint it for you Your friend Chip The Little Doctor caught her breath at the venomous accent he employed and the Old Man half rose from his chair But Della could fight her own battles She stood up and faced Dunk tight lipped and proud Yes mister Whitaker my friend mister Bennett of whose friendship I am rather proud painted the best part of The Last Stand Senator Blake must forgive my being misled by your previous statement that the picture was yours sneered Dunk I made no previous statement mister Whitaker The Little Doctor s tone was sweetly freezing I said that the picture which I had begun was finished and I invited you all to look at it It was your misfortune that you took too much for granted It s a mistake to take anything for granted where a woman is concerned At the same time I shouldn t be blamed if I take it for granted Chip Suppose you say the rest to me Dunk suggested Chip from the doorway where he leaned heavily upon his cane It begins to look as though I held a hand in this game Dunk wheeled furiously upon him You re playing a high hand for a forty dollar man he grated and you ve about reached your limit The stakes are beyond your reach my friend Chip went white with anger at the thrust which struck deeper than Dunk knew But he stood his ground Ye es Wait till the cards are all turned It turned him sick though the emptiness of the boast It was such a pitiful ghastly bluff for the cards were all against him and he knew it A man in Gilroy Ohio would take the trick which decided the game Hearts were trumps and doctor Cecil Granthum had the ace The little senator got out of his chair and faced Chip tactfully Kid Bennett you rascal aren t you going to shake hands His own was outstretched waiting Chip crowded several hot words off his tongue and gave up his hand for a temporary pump handle How do you do Blake I didn t think you d remember me You didn t How could I help it I can feel the cold of the water yet and your rope settling over my shoulders You never gave me a chance to say God bless you for that you just coiled up your rope swearing all the time you did it because it was wet and rode off dripping like a muskrat What did you do it for I was in a hurry to get back to camp grinned Chip sinking into a chair And you weren t a senator then It would have been all the same if I had been I reckon responded the senator shaking Chip s hand again Well well So you are the genius that sounds more likely No offense Miss Whitmore Do you remember that picture you drew with charcoal on a piece of pine board It stands on the mantel in my library and I always point it out to my friends as the work of a young man with a future And you painted The Last Stand Well well I think I ll have to send the price up another notch just to get even with you for swearing at me when my lungs were so full of water I couldn t swear back While he talked he was busy unwrapping the picture which he had brought with him and he reminded the Little Doctor of a loquacious peddler opening his pack He was much more genial and unpretentious since Chip entered the room and she wondered why She wanted to ask about that reference to the water but he stood the painting against the wall just then and she forgot everything but that Chip s eyes clung to the scene greedily After all it was his and he knew in his heart that it was good After a minute he limped into his room and brought The Spoils of Victory and stood it beside The Last Stand A h h The senator breathed the word deep in his throat and fell silent Even the Old Man leaned forward in his chair that he might see the better The Little Doctor could not see anything just then but no one noticed anything wrong with her eyes for they were all down in the Bad Lands watching an old range cow defend her calf Bennett do the two go together asked the senator at last I don t know I painted it for Miss Whitmore said Chip a dull glow in his cheeks The Little Doctor glanced at him quickly rather startled if the truth be known Oh that was just a joke mister Bennett I would much rather have you paint me another one this one makes me want to cry and a doctor must forego the luxury of tears I have no claim upon either of them mister Blake It was like this I started The Last Stand but I only had the background painted and one day while I was gone mister Bennett finished it up and it is his work that makes the picture worth anything I let it pass as mine for the time but I never intended to wear the laurel crown really I only borrowed it for a little while I hope you can make mister Bennett behave himself and put his brand on it for if he doesn t it will go down to posterity unsigned This other The Spoils of Victory he cannot attempt to disown for I was away at Great Falls when he painted it and he was here alone so far as help of any kind is concerned Now do make him be sensible The senator looked at Chip then at the Little Doctor chuckled and sat down on the couch Well well Kid Bennett hasn t changed I see He s just as ornery as he ever was And you re the mysterious modest genius How did you come out after that dip into the old Missouri he asked abruptly You didn t take cold riding in those wet clothes I hope I No I was all right I stopped at that sheep camp and borrowed some dry clothes Chip was very uncomfortable He wished Blake wouldn t keep bringing up that affair which was four years old and quite trivial in his opinion It was a good thing Dunk pulled out when he saw he d got the worst of it or there d have been trouble most likely And Blake The senator went on addressing the others Do you know what this young fellow did four years ago this last spring I tried to cross the river near my place in a little boat while the water was high Bennett here came along and swore that a man with no more sense than I had ought to drown which was very true I admit I had just got out a nice little distance for drowning properly when a tree came bobbing along and upset my boat and Kid Bennett as we called him then rode in as far as he could which was a great deal further than was safe for him and roped me just as he would have roped a yearling Ha ha I can see him yet scowling at me and whirling the loop over his head ready to throw A picture of THAT now When he had dragged me to the bank he used some rather strong language a cowboy does hate to wet his rope and rode off before I had a chance to thank him This is the first time I ve seen him since then Chip got very red I was young and foolish those days and you weren t a senator he repeated apologetically My being a senator wouldn t have mattered at all They ve been changing your name over this side the river I see How did that happen Again Chip was uncomfortable We ve got a cook that is out of sight when it comes to Saratoga chips and I m a fiend for them you see The boys got to calling me Saratoga Chip and then they cut it down to Chip and stuck to it I see There was a fellow with you over there Davidson What has become of him Weary He works here too He s down in the bunk house now I guess Well well Let s go and hunt him up and we can settle about the pictures at the same time You seem to be crippled How did that happen Some dare devil performance I expect The senator smiled reassuringly at the Little Doctor and got Chip out of the house and down in the bunk house with Weary and whatever means he used to make Chip behave himself they certainly were a success For when he left the next day he left behind him a check of generous size and Chip was not so aloof as he had been with the Little Doctor and planned with her at least a dozen pictures which he meant to paint some time There was one which he did paint at once however though no one saw it but Della It was the picture of a slim young woman with gray eyes and an old felt hat on her head standing with her fingers tangled in the mane of a chestnut horse If there was a heartache in the work if the brush touched the slim figure caressingly and lingered wistfully upon the face no one knew but Chip and Chip had learned long ago to keep his own counsel There were some thoughts which he could not whisper into even Silver s ear CHAPTER XVIII doctor Cecil Granthum The Little Doctor leaned from the window and called down the hill to her recovered patient more properly her nearly recovered patient for Chip still walked with the aid of a cane though by making use of only one stirrup he could ride very well He limped up the hill to her and sat down on the top step of the porch What s the excitement now he asked banteringly I ve got the best the most SPLENDID news you couldn t guess what in a thousand years Then I won t try It s too hot Chip took off his hat and fanned himself with it Well can t you LOOK a little bit excited Try and look the way I feel Anybody as cool as you are shouldn t suffer with the heat I don t know I get pretty hot sometimes Well what is the most splendid news Can t you tell a fellow after calling him up here in the hot sun Well listen The Gilroy hospital you know where Cecil is Chip knew has a case of blighted love and shattered hopes Chip s foolish man heart nearly turned a somersault Was it possible and it s the luckiest thing ever happened Yes Chip wished to goodness she would get to the point She could be direct enough in her statements when what she said was going to hurt a fellow His heart was thumping so it hurt him Yes A doctor there was planning to get married and go away on his honeymoon you know Chip nodded half suffocated with crowding incredulous hopes Well and now he isn t His ladylove was faithless and loves another and his honeymoon is indefinitely postponed Do you see now where the good news comes in Chip shook his head once and looked away up the grade Funny but something had gone wrong with his throat He was half choked Well you ARE dull Now that fellow isn t going to have any vacation so Cecil can come out right away Next week Think of it Chip tried to think of it but he couldn t think of anything just then He was only conscious of wishing Whizzer had made a finish of the job up there on the Hog s Back that day His heart no longer thumped it was throbbing in a tired listless fashion Why can t you look a little bit pleased smiled the torturer from the window You sit there like a an Indian before a cigar store You ve just about the same expression I can t help it I never was fierce to meet strangers somehow Judging from my own experience I think you are uncommonly fierce at meeting strangers I haven t forgotten how unmercifully you snubbed me when I came to the ranch or how you risked my neck on the grade up there trying to make me scared enough to scream I didn t though I wanted to I ll admit when you made the horses run down the steepest part but I didn t and so I could easily forgive you Could you said Chip in a colorless tone If you had gained your object I couldn t have remarked she I did though You did Didn t you do it just to frighten me Chip gave her a glance of weary tolerance You must think I ve about as much sense as a jack rabbit I was taking long chances to run that hill Well for pity s sake what did you do it for It was the only thing to do How do you think we d have come out of the mix up if we had met Banjo on the Hog s Back where there isn t room to pass Don t you think we d have been pretty well smashed up both of us by the time we got to the bottom of that gully there A runaway horse is a nasty thing to meet let me tell you especially when it s as scared as Banjo was They won t turn out they just go straight ahead and let the other fellow get out of the way if he can I I thought you did it just for a joke said the Little Doctor weakly I told Cecil you did it to frighten me and Cecil said I don t think you need to tell me what Cecil said Chip remarked with the quiet tone that made one very uncomfortable It wasn t anything so dreadful you know I don t want to know When is he coming did you say Next Wednesday and this is Friday I know you ll like Cecil Chip made him a cigarette but he hadn t heart enough to light it He held it absently in his fingers Everybody likes Cecil Yes Secretly Chip had his doubts He knew one that didn t and wouldn t We ll have all kinds of fun and go everywhere and do everything As soon as the round up is over I think I ll make J G give another dance but I ll take care that the drug store is safely locked away And some day we ll take a lunch and go prowling around down in the Bad Lands you ll have to go so we won t get lost and we ll have Len Adams and Rena and the schoolma am over here often and oh my brain just buzzes with plans I m so anxious for Cecil to see the Countess and well everybody around here You too I m sure a curiosity said Chip getting on his feet again I ve always had the name of being something of a freak I don t wonder you want to exhibit me to your friends He went down the hill to the bunk house holding the unlighted cigarette still in his fingers When Slim opened the door to tell him supper was ready he found Chip lying on his bed his face buried in his arms If Chip never had understood before how a man can stand up straight on the gallows throw back his shoulders and smile at his executioner he learned the secret during that twenty two mile drive to Dry Lake with the Little Doctor He would have shirked the ordeal gladly and laid awake o nights planning subterfuges that would relieve him but the Little Doctor seemed almost malignantly innocent and managed to checkmate every turn She could not trust anyone else to manage the creams she was afraid Slim might get drunk while they waited for the train or forget his duties in a game She hated J G s way of fussing over trifles and wouldn t have him along Chip was not able to help much with the ranch work and she knew he could manage the horses so much better than anyone else and Cecil had been in a runaway once and so was dreadfully nervous behind a strange team which last declaration set Chip s lips a curl The woman usually does have her own way in the end and so Chip marched to the gallows with his chin well up smiling at his executioner The train was late The Little Doctor waited in the hotel parlor and Chip waited in the hotel saloon longing to turn a deluge of whisky down his throat to deaden that unbearable heavy ache in his heart but instead he played pool with Bert Rogers who happened to be in town that day and took cigars after each game instead of whiskey varying the monotony occasionally by lemon soda till he was fairly sick Then the station agent telephoned up that the train was coming and Chip threw down his billiard cue swallowed another glass of lemon soda and gagged over it sent Bert Rogers to tell the Little Doctor the train was coming and went after the team He let the creams lope in the harness all the way to the depot excusing himself on the plea that the time was short the fact was Chip wanted the agony over as soon as possible nothing so wears a man s patients as to have a disagreeable duty drag At the depot he drove around to the back where freight was unloaded with the explanation that the creams were afraid of the train and the fact of that matter was that Chip was afraid doctor Cecil might greet the Little Doctor with a kiss he d be a fool if he didn t and Chip did not want to witness the salute Sitting with his well foot in the brake he pictured the scene on the other side of the building when the train pulled in and stopped He could not hear much on account of the noise the engine made pumping air but he could guess about what was taking place Now the fellow was on the platform probably and he had a suit case in one hand and a light tan overcoat over the other arm and now he was advancing toward the Little Doctor who would have grown shy and remained by the waiting room door Now he had changed his suit case to the other hand and was bending down over oh hell He d settle up with the Old Man and pull out back across the river Old Blake would give him work on his ranch over there that was a cinch And the Little Doctor could have her Cecil and be hanged to him He would go to morrow er no he d have to wait till Silver was able to make the trip for he wouldn t leave him behind No he couldn t go just yet he d have to stay with the deal another month He wouldn t stay a day longer than he had to thought you could gamble on that There the train was sliding out say what if the fellow hadn t come though Such a possibility had not before occurred to Chip wouldn t the Little Doctor be fighty though Serve her right the little flirt er no he couldn t think anything against the Little Doctor no matter what she did No he d sure hate to see her disappointed still if the fellow HADN T come Chip wouldn t be to blame for that and doctor Cecil Can t you drive around to the platform now to load in the trunk Sure said Chip with deceitful cheerfulness and took his foot off the brake while the Little Doctor went back to her Cecil The agent had the trunk on the baggage truck and trundled it along the platform and Chip s eyes searched for his enemy They were in the waiting room he could hear that laugh of the Little Doctor s Lord how he hated to hear it directed at some other fellow that is Yes there was the suit case it looked just as he had expected it would and there was a glimpse of tan cloth just inside the door Chip turned to help the agent push the suit case under the seat where it was an exceeding tight fit getting it there with the trunk taking up so much room When he straightened up the Little Doctor stood ready to get into the buggy and behind her stood doctor Cecil Granthum smiling in a way that disclosed some very nice teeth Cecil this is mister Bennett the Chip that I have mentioned as being at the ranch Chip allow me to present doctor Cecil Granthum doctor Cecil advanced with hand out invitingly I ve heard so much about Chip that I feel very well acquainted I hope you won t expect me to call you mister Bennett for I shan t you know Too utterly at sea to make reply Chip took the offered hand in his Hate doctor Cecil How could he hate this big breezy blue eyed young woman She shook his hand heartily and smiled deep into his troubled eyes and drew the poison from his wounds in that one glance The Little Doctor plumped into the seat and made room for Cecil like the spoiled little girl that she was compared with the other I m going to sit in the middle Cecil you re the biggest and you can easily hang on and beside this young man is so fierce with strangers that he d snub you something awful if we d give him a chance He s been scheming ever since I told him you were coming to get out of driving in to meet you He tried to make me take Slim Slim doctor Cecil smiled at Chip behind the Little Doctor s back and Chip could have hugged her then and there for he knew somehow that she understood and was his friend I should like very much to say that it seemed to Chip that the sun shone brighter and that the grass was greener and the sky several shades bluer on that homeward drive but I must record the facts which are these Chip did not know whether the sun shone or the moon and he didn t care just so there was light to see the hair blowing about the Little Doctor s face and to watch the dimple come and go in the cheek next him And whether the grass was green and the sky blue or whether the reverse was the case he didn t know and if you had asked him he might have said tersely that he didn t care a darn about the grass that is if he gave you sufficient attention to reply at all CHAPTER XIX Love Finds Its Hour Bay Denver s broke out uh the little pasture announced the Old Man putting his head in at the door of the blacksmith shop where Chip was hammering gayly upon a bent branding iron for want of a better way to kill time and give vent to his surplus energy I wish you d saddle up an go after him Chip if yuh can I just seen him takin down the coulee trail like a scared coyote Sure I ll go Darn that old villain he d jump a fence forty feet high if he took a notion that way Chip threw down the hammer and reached for his coat I guess the fence must be down som ers I ll go take a look Say Dell ain t come back from Denson s yit Yuh want t watch out Denver don t meet her he d scare the liver out uh her Chip was well aware that the Little Doctor had not returned from Denson s where she had been summoned to attend one of the children who had run a rusty nail into her foot She had gone alone for doctor Cecil was learning to make bread and had refused to budge from the kitchen till her first batch was safely baked Chip limped hurriedly to the corral and two minutes later was clattering down the coulee upon Blazes after the runaway Denver was a beautiful bay stallion the pride and terror of the ranch He was noted for his speed and his vindictive hatred of the more plebeian horses scarcely one of which but had at some time felt his teeth in their flesh and he was hated and feared by them all He stopped at the place where the trail forked tossed his crinkly mane triumphantly and looked back Freedom was sweet to him sweet as it was rare His world was a roomy box stall with a small high corral adjoining it for exercise with an occasional day in the little pasture as a great treat Two miles was a long long way from home it seemed to him He watched the hill behind a moment threw up his head and trotted off up the trail to Denson s Chip galloping madly caught a glimpse of the fugitive a mile away set his teeth together and swung Blazes sharply off the trail into a bypath which intersected the road further on He hoped the Little Doctor was safe at Denson s but at that very moment he saw her ride slowly over a distant ridge Now there was a race Denver cantering gleefully down the trail Chip spurring desperately across the prairie The Little Doctor had disappeared into a hollow with Concho pacing slowly half asleep the reins drooping low on his neck The Little Doctor loved to dream along the road and Concho had learned to do likewise and to enjoy it very much At the crest of the next hill she looked up saw herself the apex of a rapidly shortening triangle and grasped instantly the situation she had peeped admiringly and fearsomely between the stout rails of the little round corral too often not to know Denver when she saw him and in a panic turned from the trail toward Chip Concho was rudely awakened by a stinging blow from her whip a blow which filled him with astonishment and reproach He laid back his ears and galloped angrily not in the path the Little Doctor was too frightened for that but straight as a hawk would fly Denver marking Concho for his prey and not to be easily cheated turned and followed Chip swore inwardly and kept straight ahead leaving the path himself to do so He knew a deep washout lay now between himself and the Little Doctor and his only hope was to get within speaking distance before she was overtaken Concho fled to the very brink of the washout and stopped so suddenly that his forefeet plowed a furrow in the grass and the Little Doctor came near going clean over his head She recovered her balance and cast a frightened glance over her shoulder Denver was rushing down upon them like an express train Get off your H O R S E shouted Chip making a trumpet of his hands Fight Denver off with your whip The last command the Little Doctor did not hear distinctly The first she made haste to obey Throwing herself from the saddle she slid precipitately into the washout just as Denver thundered up snorting a challenge Concho scared out of his wits turned and tore off down the washout whipped around the end of it and made for home his enemy at his heels and Chip after the two of them leaning low over his horse as Blazes catching the excitement and urged by the spurs ran like an antelope The Little Doctor climbing the steep bank to level ground gazed after the fleeing group with consternation Here was she a long four miles from home five if she followed the windings of the trail and it looked very much as if her two feet must take her there The prospect was not an enlivening one but she started off across the prairie very philosophically at first very dejectedly later on and very angrily at last The sun was scorching and it was dinner time and she was hungry and hot and tired and mad She did not bless her rescuer she heaped maledictions upon his head mild ones at first but growing perceptibly more forcible and less genteel as the way grew rougher and her feet grew wearier and her stomach emptier Then as if her troubles were all to come in a lump as they have a way of doing she stepped squarely into a bunch of pincushion cactus I just HATE Montana she burst out vehemently blinking back some tears I don t care if Cecil did just come day before yesterday I shall pack up and go back home She can stay if she wants to but I won t live here another day I hate Chip Bennett too and I ll tell him so if I ever get home I don t see what J G s thinking of to live in such a God forgotten hole where there s nothing but miles upon miles of cactuses The downfall of Eastern up bringing To deliberately say cactuses but the provocation was great I admit If any man doubts let him tread thin shod upon a healthy little pincushion and be convinced I think he will confess that cactuses is an exceedingly conservative epithet and all too mild for the occasion Half an hour later Chip leading Concho by the bridle rein rode over the brow of a hill and came suddenly upon the Little Doctor sitting disconsolately upon a rock She had one shoe off and was striving petulantly to extract a cactus thorn from the leather with a hat pin Chip rode close and stopped regarding her with satisfaction from the saddle It was the first time he had succeeded in finding the Little Doctor alone since the arrival of doctor Cecil Granthum God bless her Hello What you trying to do No answer The Little Doctor refused even to lift her lashes which were wet and clung together in little groups of two or three Chip also observed that there were suggestive streaks upon her cheeks and not a sign of a dimple anywhere He lifted one leg over the horn of the saddle to ease his ankle which still pained him a little after a ride and watched her a moment What s the matter Doctor Step on a cactus Oh no snapped the Doctor in a tone to take one s head off I didn t step on a cactus I just walked all over acres and acres of them There was a suspicious gurgle from somewhere The Little Doctor looked up Don t hesitate to laugh mister Bennett if you happen to feel that way mister Bennett evidently felt that way He rocked in the saddle and shouted with laughter The Little Doctor stood this for as much as a minute Oh no doubt it s very funny to set me afoot away off from everywhere Her voice quivered and broke from self pity her head bent lower over her shoe Chip made haste to stifle his mirth in fear that she was going to cry He couldn t have endured that He reached for his tobacco and began to make a cigarette I didn t set you afoot he said That was a bad break you made yourself Why didn t you do as I told you hang to the bridle and fight Denver off with your whip You had one Yes and let him gnaw me Chip gurgled again and drew the tobacco sack shut with his teeth He wouldn t gnaw you he wouldn t have come near you He s whip trained And I d have been there myself in another minute I didn t want you there And I don t pretend to be a horse trainer mister Bennett There s several things about your old ranch life that I don t know and don t want to know I m going back to Ohio to morrow so there Yes He drew a match sharply along his stamped saddle skirt and applied it to the cigarette pinched out the blaze with extreme care and tossed the match end facetiously against Concho s nose He did not seem particularly alarmed at her threat or perhaps he did not care The Little Doctor prodded savagely at her shoe too angry to see the thorn and Chip drove another nail into his coffin with apparent relish and watched her After a little he slid to the ground and limped over to her Here give me that shoe you ll have it all picked to pieces and not get the thorn either Where is it IT sniffed the Little Doctor surrendering the shoe with hypocritical reluctance It There s a dozen at the very least Chip emptied his lungs of smoke and turned the shoe in his hands Oh I guess not there isn t room in this little bit of leather for a dozen Two would be crowded I detest flattery above all things But being a woman the brow of the Little Doctor cleared perceptibly Yes You re just like me in that respect I love the truth Thinking of doctor Cecil the Little Doctor grew guiltily red But she had never said Cecil was a man she reflected with what comfort she could The boys like Dunk had simply made the mistake of taking too much for granted Chip opened the smallest blade of his knife deliberately sat down upon a neighboring rock and finished his cigarette still turning the shoe reflectively and caressingly in his hand I d smile to see the Countess try to put that shoe on he remarked holding the cigarette in some mysterious manner on his lip I ll bet she couldn t get one toe in it I don t see that it matters whether she could or not snapped the Little Doctor For goodness sake hurry You re pretty mad aren t you inquired he shoving his hat back off his forehead and looking at her as though he enjoyed doing so Do I look mad asked she tartly I d tell a man you do Well my appearance doesn t half express the state of my mind Your mind must be in an awful state It is Two minutes passed silently doctor Cecil s bread is done she gave me a slice as big as your hat with butter and jelly on it It was out of sight The Little Doctor groaned and rallied Butter and jelly on my hat did you say Not on your hat on the bread I ate it coming back down the coulee and I sure had my hands full leading Concho too The Little Doctor held back the question trembling on her hungry parched lips as long as she could but it would come Was it good I d tell a man said Chip briefly and eloquently The Little Doctor sighed doctor Cecil Granthum s a mighty good fellow I m stuck on him myself and if I haven t got the symptoms sized up wrong the Old Man s GOING to be That s all the good it will do him Cecil and I are going somewhere and practice medicine together and we aren t either of us going to get married ever Have you got the papers for that grinned Chip utterly unmoved I have my license said the Little Doctor coldly You re ahead of me there for I haven t yet I can soon get one though I wish to goodness you d hurry up with that shoe I m half starved Well show me a dimple and you can have it My you are cranky The Little Doctor showed him two and Chip laid the shoe in her lap after he had surprised himself and the doctor by planting a daring little kiss upon the toe The idea exclaimed she with a feeble show of indignation and slipped her foot hurriedly into its orthodox covering Feeling his inscrutable hazel eyes upon her she blushed uncomfortably and fumbled the laces You better let me lace that shoe you won t have it done in a thousand years at that gait If you re in a hurry said she without looking at him you can ride on ahead It would please me better if you did Yes You ve been pleased all summer at my expense I m going to please myself this time It s my deal Little Doctor Do you want to know what s trumps No I don t Still without looking at him she tied her shoelaces with an impatient twitch that came near breaking them and walked haughtily to where Concho stood dutifully waiting With an impulsive movement she threw her arms around his neck and hid her hot face against his scanty mane A pair of arms clad in pink and white striped sleeves went suddenly about her Her clasp on Concho loosened and she threw back her head startled to be still more startled at the touch of lips that were curved and thin and masterful The arms whirled her about and held her against a heart which her trained senses knew at once was beating very irregularly You you ought to be ashamed she asserted feebly at last I m not though The arms tightened their clasp a little You you don t SEEM to be admitted the Little Doctor meekly For answer he kissed her hungrily not once but many times Aren t you going to let me go she demanded afterward but very faintly No said he boldly I m going to keep you always There was conviction in the tone She stood silent a minute listening to his heart and her own and digesting this bit of news Are you quite sure about that she asked at length I d tell a man Unless he held her off and looked at her you don t like me But you do don t you His eyes were searching her face The Little Doctor struggled to release herself from the arms which held her unyieldingly and tenderly Failing this she raised her eyes to the white silk handkerchief knotted around his throat to the chin to the lips wistful with their well defined curve to the eyes where they lingered shyly a moment and then looked away to the horizon Don t you like me Say He gave her a gentle shake Ye er it doesn t seem to matter whether I do or not she retorted with growing spirit witness the dimple dodging into her cheek Yes it does it matters a whole heap You ve dealt me misery ever since I first set eyes on you and I believe on my soul you liked to watch me squirm But you do like me don t you I I d tell a man said she and immediately hid a very red face from sight of him Concho turned his head and gazed wonderingly upon the two What amazed him was to see Chip kissing his mistress again and again and to hear the idolatrous tone in which he was saying MY Little Doctor THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Chip of the Flying U by B
