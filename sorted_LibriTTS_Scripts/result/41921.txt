6535-114962-0000	train-other-500	THE OLD COAT OF DREAMS A PROLOGUE People in London not merely literary folk but even those higher social circles to which a certain publisher whose name
6535-114962-0001	train-other-500	or race it is hardly fair to mention had so obsequiously climbed often wondered whence had come the wealth that enabled him to maintain such an establishment give such elaborate parties
6535-114962-0002	train-other-500	have so many automobiles and generally make all that display which is so convincing to the modern mind Of course they were not seriously concerned because so long as it is a party
6535-114962-0003	train-other-500	and the chef is paid so much and the wines are as old as they should be not even the rarest blossom on the most ancient and distinguished genealogical tree cares whose party it is
6535-114962-0004	train-other-500	or indeed with whom she dances There is only one democracy and that is controlled by gentlemen with names that hardly sound beautiful enough to mention in fairy tales
6535-114962-0005	train-other-500	that democracy of money to which the fairest flower of our aristocracy now bows her coroneted head Strange
none	none	 but we all know that so it is 
6535-114962-0006	train-other-500	Therefore all sorts of distinguished and beautiful people came to the publisher s parties It would have made no difference really to their hard hearts
6535-114962-0007	train-other-500	could they have known where all the champagne and conservatories and music came from they would have gone on dancing all the same
none	none	 and eating pate de foie gras and sherbets 
6535-114962-0008	train-other-500	yet it may interest a sad heart here and there to know how it was that that publisher whose name I forget but whose nose I can never forget was able to pay for all that music and dancing
6535-114962-0009	train-other-500	strange flowers and enchanted food none of which he of course understood Aristocrats in London of course know nothing of a northern district of New York City called Harlem
6535-114962-0010	train-other-500	with so many streets that a learned arithmetician would be needed to number them a district which at the first call of spring becomes vocal with children on door steps and venders of every vegetable in every language
6535-114962-0011	train-other-500	In this district too you hear strange trumpets blow announcing knife and scissors grinders and strange bells ringing from strings suspended across carts whose merchandise
6535-114962-0012	train-other-500	is bottles and old newspapers You will hear too just when the indomitable sweet smells from the terrible eternal spring are blowing in at your window
6535-114962-0013	train-other-500	and the murmur of rich happy people going away is heard in the land a raucous cry in the hot street a cry full of melancholy even despair it goes something like this
none	none	 Cash clo Cash clo 
6535-114962-0014	train-other-500	Well it was just then that a young poet living in one of those highly arithmetical streets was wondering as all the sad spring murmur came to his ears
6535-114962-0015	train-other-500	how he could possibly buy a rose for the bosom of his sweetheart with whom he was to dance that night at a local ball Everything he had in the world had gone He had sold everything
6535-114962-0016	train-other-500	except his poems All his precious books had gone sad one by one Little paintings that once made his walls seem like the Louvre had gone
6535-114962-0017	train-other-500	All his old silver spoons and all the little intaglios he loved so well and yes he had even sold the old copper chest of the Renaissance all studded nails
6535-114962-0018	train-other-500	with three locks in which well all had gone Only where was that rose for the bosom of his sweetheart where was it growing Where and how was it to be bought
6535-114962-0019	train-other-500	Just as he was at his wit s end he heard a cry through the window It had meant nothing to him before Now strange as it may sound it meant a rose Cash clo
none	none	 Cash clo 
6535-114962-0020	train-other-500	He had an old dress suit in his wardrobe Perhaps that would buy a rose So leaning through the window he called down to the voice to come up The gentleman from Palestine came up
6535-114962-0021	train-other-500	It would be easy to describe the contempt with which he surveyed the distinguished though somewhat ancient garments thus offered to him in exchange for a rose how he affected to
6535-114962-0022	train-other-500	examine linings and seams knowing all the time the distinguished tailor that had made them and what a bargain he was about to drive Of course they weren t well really
none	none	 practically they weren t worth buying 
6535-114962-0023	train-other-500	The poet wondered a moment about the cost of a rose Are they worth the price of a rose he asked
6535-114962-0024	train-other-500	The gentleman from Palestine didn t of course understand You see said he finally I d like to give you more but
none	none	 you know how it is look at these linings and buttonholes 
6535-114962-0025	train-other-500	Honestly I don t really care about them at all but really
none	none	 a dollar and a half is the best I can do on them 
6535-114962-0026	train-other-500	And he eyed the poet s clothes with contempt A dollar seventy five said the poet standing firm All right at last said the gentleman from Palestine
6535-114962-0027	train-other-500	but I don t see where I am to make any profit however
none	none	 And he handed out the small dirty money 
6535-114962-0028	train-other-500	Then the poet bowed him out gently saying in his heart Now I can buy my rose When the Palestinian dealer in old dress suits went home
6535-114962-0029	train-other-500	after sadly leaving behind him that dollar seventy five he made an astonishing discovery In the necessary process of re examining the goods
6535-114962-0030	train-other-500	something fell out of one of the pockets something the poet after his nature had quite forgotten The old clothes man now a publisher
6535-114962-0031	train-other-500	picked them up from the floor and gazed at them in delight The poet in his grandiose carelessness had forgotten to empty his pockets
6535-114962-0032	train-other-500	of various old dreams Now to be fair to the gentleman from Palestine he belonged to a race that loves dreams and to do him justice
none	none	 he forgot all about the profit he was to make 
6535-114962-0033	train-other-500	of the poor poet s clothes as he sat cross legged on the floor and read the dreams that had fallen from the pocket of the poet s old dress suit He read on and read on
6535-114962-0034	train-other-500	and laughed and cried such a curious treasure trove such an odd medley of fairy tales and fables and poems had fallen out of the poet s pocket
6535-114962-0035	train-other-500	and it was only later that the thought came to him that he might change from an old clothes man into a publisher of dreams Now
none	none	 these are some of the dreams that fell out of the poet s pocket THE MAKER OF RAINBOWS 
7073-114963-0000	train-other-500	It was a bleak November morning in the dreary little village of Twelve trees Nature herself seemed hopeless and disgusted with the universe as the chill mists stole wearily among the bare trees
7073-114963-0001	train-other-500	and the boughs dripped with a clammy moisture that had nothing of the energy of tears Twelve trees was a poor little village at the best of times but the past summer had been more than usually unkind to it
7073-114963-0002	train-other-500	and the lean wheat fields and the ragged orchards had been leaner and more ragged than ever before so said the memory of the oldest villagers There was very little to eat in the village of Twelve trees and practically no money at all
none	none	 Some of the inhabitants found consolation in the fact that at the Inn of the Blessed Rood the cider kegs still held out against despair 
7073-114963-0003	train-other-500	But this was no comfort to the gaunt and shivering children left to themselves on the chill door steps half heartedly trying to play their innocent little games
7073-114963-0004	train-other-500	Even the heart of childhood felt the shadows that November morning in the dreary little village of Twelve trees
none	none	 and even the dogs and the cats of the village seemed to be under the same spell of gloom 
7073-114963-0005	train-other-500	and moved about with a dank hopelessness evidently expecting nothing in the shape of discarded fish or transfiguring smells There was no life in the long disheveled High Street
none	none	 No one seemed to think it worth while to get up and work 
7073-114963-0006	train-other-500	There was nothing to get up for and no work worth doing So naturally in all this echoing emptiness this lack of excitement anything that happened attracted a gratefully alert attention
7073-114963-0007	train-other-500	even from those cats and dogs so sadly prowling amid the dejected refuse of the village
none	none	 Presently amid all the November numbness 
7073-114963-0008	train-other-500	the blank nothingness of the damp deserted street there was to be seen approaching from the south a curious little figure of an old man trundling at his side a strange apparatus resembling a knife grinder s wheel
7073-114963-0009	train-other-500	and he carried some forlorn old umbrellas under one arm Evidently he was an itinerant knife grinder and umbrella mender As he proceeded up the street he called out some strange sing song
7073-114963-0010	train-other-500	the words of which it was impossible to distinguish But though his cry was melancholy his old puckered and wizened face seemed to be alight with some inner and inextinguishable gladness and his electrical blue eyes startlingly set in a network of wrinkles
7073-114963-0011	train-other-500	were as full of laughter as a boy s His cry attracted a weary face here and there at window and door but seeing nothing but an old knife grinder the faces lost interest and immediately disappeared
7073-114963-0012	train-other-500	The children however being less sophisticated were filled with a grateful curiosity toward the stranger and left the chill door steps and trooped about him in wonder A little girl with tears making channels down her pale unwashed face
7073-114963-0013	train-other-500	caught the old man s eye Little one he said with a magical smile and a voice all reassuring love give me one of those tears and I will show you what I can make of it
7073-114963-0014	train-other-500	And he touched the child s face with his hand and caught one of her tears on his finger and placed it glittering on his wheel Then working a pedal with his foot the wheel began to move so swiftly
7073-114963-0015	train-other-500	that one could see nothing but its whirling and as it whirled wonderful colored rays began to rise from it so that presently the dreary street seemed full of rainbows The sad houses were lit up with a fairy radiance
7073-114963-0016	train-other-500	and the faces of the children were all laughter again Well little one he said when the wheel stopped whirling did you like what I made out of that sad little tear And the children laughed and begged him to do some other trick for them
none	none	 At that moment there came down the street a poor old half witted woman 
7073-114963-0017	train-other-500	indescribably dirty and bedraggled talking to herself and laughing in a creepy way The village knew her as Crazy Sal and the children were accustomed to make cruel sport of her As she came near they began to jeer at her
7073-114963-0018	train-other-500	with the heartlessness of young unknowing things
none	none	 But the strange old man who had made rainbows out of the little girl s tear suddenly stopped them 
7073-114963-0019	train-other-500	Stay children he said and watch And as he said this his wheel went whirling again and as it whirled a light shot out from it so that it illuminated the poor old woman
7073-114963-0020	train-other-500	and in its radiance she became strangely transfigured In place of Crazy Sal whom they had been accustomed to mock the children saw a beautiful young girl all blushes and bright eyes and pretty ribbons
none	none	 and so great was the murmur of their surprise 
7073-114963-0021	train-other-500	that it drew to the door steps their fathers and mothers who also saw Crazy Sal as none of them had ever seen her before except a very old man who remembered her as a beautiful young girl and remembered too
7073-114963-0022	train-other-500	how her mind had gone from her as the news came one day that her sweetheart a sailor had been drowned in the North Sea
none	none	 Who and what are you said this old man stepping out a little in front of the gathering crowd 
7073-114963-0023	train-other-500	Are you a wizard that you change a child s tears into laughter
none	none	 and turn an old half witted woman back to a young girl 
7073-114963-0024	train-other-500	You must be of the devil
none	none	 Give me an ear of corn from your last harvest answered the old knife grinder and let me put it on my wheel An ear of corn was brought to him 
7073-114963-0025	train-other-500	and once more his wheel went whirring and again that strange light shot out from it and spread far past the houses over the fields beyond
none	none	 and lo to the astonished sad eyes of the weary farmers 
7073-114963-0026	train-other-500	they appeared waving with golden grain waiting for the scythe And again as the wheel stopped whirring the old man who had remembered Crazy Sal as a young girl spoke to the knife grinder again he asked
7073-114963-0027	train-other-500	What and who are you Are you a wizard that you change a child s tears into laughter and turn an old half witted woman back to a young girl and make of a barren glebe a waving corn field
7073-114963-0028	train-other-500	And the man with the strange wheel answered I am the maker of rainbows I am the alchemist of hope To me November is always May tears are always laughter that is going to be
7073-114963-0029	train-other-500	and darkness is light misunderstood The sad heart makes its own sorrow the happy heart makes its own joy The harvest is made by the harvestman and there is nothing hard or black or weary that is not waiting for the magic touch
7073-114963-0030	train-other-500	of hope to become soft as a spring flower bright as the morning star and valiant as a young runner in the dawn But the village of Twelve trees was not to be convinced by such words made out of moonshine
7073-114963-0031	train-other-500	Only the children believed in the laughing old man with the strange wheel Rainbows mocked their fathers and mothers rainbows Much good are rainbows to a starving village The old maker of rainbows took their taunts in silence
7073-114963-0032	train-other-500	and made ready to go his way but as he started once more along the road he said with a cynical smile Have you never heard that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow A pot of gold cried out the whole village of Twelve trees
7073-114963-0033	train-other-500	Yes he answered a pot of gold I know where it is and I am going to find it And he moved on his way Then the villagers looked at one another and said over and over again A pot of gold
none	none	 And they took cloaks and walking staves 
7073-114963-0034	train-other-500	and set out to accompany the old visitor but when they reached the outskirts of the village there was no sign of him He had mysteriously disappeared
none	none	 But the children never forgot the rainbows THE MAN WITH SOMETHING IN HIS EYE Once on a time toward the end of February when the snow still festered in the New York streets and the wind blew cruelly from river to river a strange figure made a somewhat storm tossed progress along Forty second Street walking toward the East Side He was a tall distinguished curiously sad looking man with longish hair growing gray and clothes which though they had been brushed many times still proclaimed aloud a Bond Street tailor As he walked along he had evidently some trouble with one of his eyes which he rubbed from time to time as though a cinder perhaps from the Elevated Railroad had lodged there and at last he held a handkerchief to it as he walked along But whatever the trouble was it did not seem to interfere with a keen and kindly vision that noted every object and character of the thronged street Now and again strangers in that noisy and bewildering quarter would ask direction from him and he never failed to stop with an aristocratic painstaking courtesy and set them on their way Nervous old women with bundles at perilous crossings found his arm ready to pilot them safely to the other side There was about him a curious gentleness which after a while did not fail to attract the attention of enterprising boys and observing beggars for whom as he walked along evidently sorely troubled with his eye he did not fail to find pennies and kind words At last he had become so noticeable for these oddities of behavior that as he went along he had collected quite an escort of miscellaneous individuals ragged children with pale precocious faces voluble old Irishwomen with bedraggled petticoats sturdy beggars on crutches and a sprinkling of so called respectable people curiously hovering on the skirts of the strange crowd From some of these last came at length unkindly comments The man was evidently crazy more probably he was drunk But it was plainly evident that he had something the matter with his eye At last a kindly individual suggested that he should go to a drug store and get the drug clerk to look at his eye To this the stranger assented and accompanied by his motley escort he entered a drug store and put himself into the hands of the clerk while the crowd thronged the door and glared through the windows wondering what was the matter with the eccentric gentleman who after all was very free with his pence and had so kind a tongue A policeman did not of course fail to elbow himself into the store to inquire what was the matter Meanwhile the drug clerk proceeded to lift up the stranger s eyelid in a professional manner searching for the extraneous particle of pain At last he found something and made a strange announcement The something in the stranger s eye was Pity No wonder it had caused such a sensation in the most pitiless city in the world MOTHER OF PEARL There was once a poet who lived all alone by the sea He had built for himself a little house of boulders mortised in among the rocks so hidden that it was seldom that any wayfarer stumbled upon his retreat Wayfarers indeed were few in that solitary island which was for the most part covered with thick beech woods and had for its inhabitants only the wild creatures of wood and water and the strange unearthly shapes that none but the poet s eyes could see The nearest village was miles away on the mainland and for months at a time the solitude would be undisturbed by sound of human voice or footstep which was the poet s idea of happiness The world of men had seemed to him a world of sorrow and foolishness and lies and so he had forsaken it to dwell with silence and beauty and the sound of the sea For him the world had been an uncompanioned wilderness Here at last his spirit had found its home and its kindred The speech of men had been to him a vain confusion but here were the voices he had been born to understand the elemental voices of earth and sea and sky the secret wisdom of the eternal From morning till night his days were passed in listening to these voices and in writing down in beautiful words the messages of wonder they brought him So his little house grew to be filled with the lovely songs that had come to him out of the sky and the sea and the haunted beeches He had written them in a great book with silver clasps and often at evening when the moon was rising over the sea he would sing them to himself for joy in the treasure which he had thus hoarded out of the air as a man might weigh the grains of gold sifted from some flowing river One night as he thus sat singing to himself in the solitude he was startled by a deep sigh as of some human creature near at hand and looking around he was aware of a lovely form half in and half out of the water gazing at him with great moonlit eyes from beneath masses of golden hair In awe and delight he gazed back spellbound at the unearthly vision It was a fairy woman of the sea more beautiful than tongue can tell Over her was the supernatural beauty of dreams and as he looked at her the poet s heart filled with that more than mortal happiness that only comes to us in dreams Beautiful spirit at length he cried stretching out his arms to the vision but as he did so she was gone and in the place where she had been there was nought but the lonely moonlight falling on the rocks It was all a trick of the moonlight said the poet to himself but even as he said it there seemed to come floating to him the cadences of an unearthly music of farewell In his heart the poet knew that it had not been the moonlight but that nature had granted him one of those mystic visitations which come only to those whose loving meditation upon her secrets have opened the hidden doors She had drawn aside for a moment the veil of her visible beauty and vouchsafed him a glimpse of her invisible mystery But the veil had been drawn again almost instantly and the poet s eyes were left empty and hungered for the face that had thus momentarily looked at him through the veil Yet his heart was filled with a high happiness for the vision once his would it not be his again Did it not mean that through the long initiation of his solitary contemplation he had come at length to that aery boundary where the wall between the seen and the unseen grows transparent and the human meets the immortal face to face Still days passed and the poet watched in vain for the beautiful woman of the sea She came not again for all his singing and his heart grew heavy within him but one day as he walked the seashore at dawn it gave a great bound of joy for there in mystical writing upon the silver sand was a message which no eyes but his could have read But the poet was skilled in the secret script of the elements To him the patterns of leaves and flowers the traceries of moss and lichen the markings on rocks and trees which to others were but meaningless decorations were the letters of nature s hidden language the spell words of her runic wisdom To other eyes the message he had found written on the sand would have seemed but a tangle of delicate weeds and shells cast up by the sea To him as he turned it into our coarser human speech it said Seek me not unsought I come Daughter of the moonlit foam Near and far am I to thee Near and far as earth and sea As wave to wave as star to star Near and far near and far And that night when the poet sat and sang with full heart in the moonlight lo the vision was there once more But again as he stretched out his arms she was gone But this time the poet did not grieve as before for he knew that she would come again as indeed it befell When she appeared to him the third time she had stolen so near to his side that he could gaze deep into her strange eyes as into the fathomless moonlit sea and at the ending of his song she did not fade away as before but her long hair fell all about him like a net of moonbeams and she lay like the moon herself in his enraptured arms To the passionate lover of nature the anchorite of her solitudes there often comes in the very hour of his closest approach to her an aching sense of incomplete oneness with her a human desire for some responsive embodiment of her mysterious beauty and there are ecstatic moments in which nature seems on the tremulous verge of sending us a magic answer moments of intense reverie when the woods seem about to reveal to us the inner heart of their silence in some sudden shape of unimaginable enchantment or the infinite of the starry night take form at our side in some companionable radiance We long as it were to press our lips to the forehead of the dawn to crush the leafy abundance of summer to our breast and to fold the infinite ocean in our embrace To the poet reward of his lonely vigils and endless longing nature had granted this marvel How often as he had gazed at the moon rising out of the sea had he dreamed of a shining shape that came to him along her silver pathway And to night the mystery of the moonlit sea was in his arms No longer a lovely vision calling him from afar an unapproachable wonder a voice a gleam but a miraculously embodied spirit of the elements supernaturally fair The poet was more than all men learned in beautiful words but he could find no words for this strange happiness that had befallen him indeed he had now passed beyond the world of words and as he gazed into those magic eyes that seemed like sea flowers growing out of the air they spoke to each other as wave talks to wave or the leaves whisper together on the trees So it was that the poet ceased to be alone in his solitude and the fairy woman from the sea became his wife and very wonderful was their happiness But as with all happiness theirs too was not without its touch of sorrow For marvelously wedded though they were so closely united that they seemed veritably one rather than two beings there had been a deep meaning to that little song which the poet had found written in seaweed upon the sand Near and far am I to thee Near and far as earth and sea it had said Near and far near and far For not even their love could cast down for them one eternal barrier They could meet and love across it but it was still there They were children of two diverse elements and neither could cross from one into the other she a child of the blue sea he a child of the green earth She must always leave him at the edge of the mysterious woods in which her heart ached to wander and however far out into the wide waters he would swim at her side there would always be those deep sea grottoes and flower gardens whither he could never follow Down into these enchanted depths he would watch her glide her shimmering way but never might he follow her to the hidden kingdoms of the sea He must await her out there an alien in the upper sunshine and watch her glittering kindred stream in and out the rainbowed portals till again she was at his side her hands filled for his consolation with the secret treasures of the sea So would she from the shore with despair in her eyes watch him disappear among the beech trees to gather for her the waxen flowers and the sweet smelling green leaves and grasses she loved more than any that grew in the sea Thus across their barrier would they make exchange of the marvels that grew on either side and thus indeed the barrier grew less and less by reason of their love Sometimes they asked each other if that other mystery Death would remove the barrier altogether But at the heart of the woman Life was already whispering another answer What said she as they watched the solemn stars in the still water one summer night what if a little being were born to us that should belong to both our worlds to your green earth and to my blue sea Would you seem so lonely then A little being that could run by your side in the meadows and swim with me into the depths of the sea Would you be so lonely then he echoed And lo after a season it was this very marvel that came to pass for one night as she came along the moon path to his side she was not alone but a tiny fairy woman was with her a little radiant creature that as her mother had dreamed could gather with one hand the flowers that grow in the deeps of the wood and with the other the flowers that grow in the deeps of the sea Like any other mortal babe she was save for this around her waist ran a shimmering girdle of mother of pearl So the poet and his wife called her Mother of Pearl and she became for them as it were a baby bridge between two elements In her mysterious life their two lives became one as never before So near she brought them to each other that often there seemed no barrier at all And thus days and years passed and very wonderful was their happiness But by this the world which the poet had forgotten had grown curious regarding the life which he lived alone among the rocks Many of his songs as songs will had escaped from his solitude and floated singing among men and weird rumors grew of the strange happiness that had come to him Some of the more curious had spied upon him in his seclusion and had brought back to the town marvelous accounts of having seen him in the moonlight with his fairy wife and child at his side And after its fashion the world had decided that here was plainly the work of the devil and that the poet was a wizard in league with the powers of darkness So the ignorant world has ever interpreted the beauty it could not understand and the happiness it could not give Thus a cloud began to gather of which the poet and his mer wife and little Mother of Pearl knew nothing and one evening at moonrise as they were disporting themselves in their innocent happiness by the sea it burst upon them from the beech trees with a gathering murmur and a sudden roar A great mob uttering cries and waving torches broke from the wood and ran toward them Death to the wizard they cried Death Death As the poet heard them he turned to his wife and little Mother of Pearl Fear not he cried they cannot hurt us Then as again the cry went up Death to the wizard a sudden light shone in his face Death yes That is the last door of the barrier and he plunged into the moonlit water And when the rabble at length reached the shore with their torches the poet and his loved ones were already lost in the silver pathway that leads to the hidden kingdoms of the sea THE MER MOTHER One day walking by the sea I heard a sweet voice calling me I looked but nothing could I see I listened but no more I heard Only the sea and the sea bird And the blue sky were there with me But on another happier day When all the sea was sun and spray And laughing shout of wind and foam I seemed to hear the voice once more Wilder and sweeter than before O wild as love and sweet as home I looked and lo before me there A maiden sat in seaweeds drest Sea flowers hiding in her breast And with a comb of deep sea pearl She combed like any other girl Her golden hair her golden hair And as each shining yellow curl Flickered like sunshine through the pearl She laughed and sang but not for me Three little babies of the sea Were diving in and out for joy Two mer girls and a small mer boy That fairy song was not for me Nor those green eyes nor that gold hair Deep in the caves beneath the foam There was a husband and a home It was a mermaid taking care Of her small children of the sea Illustration THE SLEEPLESS LORD There was once a great lord He was lord of seven castles and there were seven coronets upon his head He was richer than he ever gave himself the trouble to think of for north south east and west the horizon even set no bounds to his estates A thousand villages and ten thousand farms were in the hollow of his hand and into his coffers flowed the fruitfulness and labor of all these Therefore as you can imagine he was a very rich lord He had more beautiful titles denoting the various principalities over which he was lord than the deepest lunged herald could proclaim without taking breath at least three times In person he was most noble and beautiful to look upon and his voice was like the rippling of waters under the moon save when it was like the call of a golden trumpet He stood foremost in the counsels of his realm not only for his eloquence but for his wisdom Also God had given him a good heart Only one gift had been denied him the gift of sleep By whatever means he might weary himself in the day in study in sport in recreation or in the business of the realm night found him sleepless and all the dark hours the lights burned in his bedchamber and in his library as he would pace from one to the other with eyes tragically awake and brain torturingly alert and clear Every means known to science by which to bring sleep to the eyes of sleepless men had been tried in vain Learned physicians from all parts of the world had come to my lord s castle and had gone thence confessing that their skill had availed nothing All strange and terrible drugs that have power over the spirit of man had failed to conquer those stubborn eyelids My lord still paced from his bedchamber to his library from his library to his bedchamber sleepless Illustration A SUDDEN STRANGE NEW LIGHT WOULD SHINE OUT OF ITS PAGES Sometimes in his anguish he had thrown himself on his knees in prayer before a God whom he had not always remembered the God who giveth His beloved sleep but his prayers had remained unanswered and in his darkest moments he had dreamed of snatching by his own hands that sleep perpetual of which a great Latin poet he loved had sung Often as he paced his library he would say over and over to himself Nox est perpetua una dormienda and in the still night the old words would often sound like soft dark voices calling him away into the endless night of the endless sleep But he was not the man to take that way of escape No whatever the suffering might be he would fight it out to the end and so he continued sleepless trying this resource and that but most of all that first and last resource courage It is seldom that courage fails to wrest for us some recompense from the hardest situation and the sleepless man as night after night he fought with his fate did not miss such hard wrung rewards Often as in the deepest hush of the night he wearily took up some great old book of philosopher or poet familiar to him from his youth a sudden strange new light would shine out of its pages as of some inner radiance of truth which he had missed in his daylight reading At such times an exaltation would come over him and it would almost seem as though the curse upon him was really a blessing of initiation into the world of a deeper wisdom the gate of which is hidden by the glare of the sun In the daylight the eternal voices are lost in the transitory clamor of human business it is only when the night falls and the stars rise and the noise of men dies down like the drone of some sleeping insect that the solemn thoughts of God may be heard Other compensations he found when weary of his books and despairing of sleep he would leave his house and wander through the silent city where the roaring thoroughfares of the daytime were silent as the pyramids and the great warehouses seemed like deserted palaces haunted by the moon Night walkers like himself grew to find his figure familiar and would say to themselves or to each other There goes the lord who never sleeps and the watchmen on their rounds all knew and saluted the man whose eyelids never closed Enforced as these nocturnal rambles were they revealed to him much beautiful knowledge which those more fortunate ones asleep in their beds must ever miss Thus he came in contact with all the vast nocturnal labor of the world the toil of sleepless men who keep watch over the sleeping earth and work through the night to make it ready for the new born day all that labor which is put away and forgotten with the rising of the sun and of which the day asks no questions so that the result be there This brought him very near to humanity and taught him a deep pity for the grinding lot of man Then was it no compensation for this sleepless one that he thus became a companion of all the ensorceled beauty of Night walking by her side a confidant of her mystic talk as he gazed into her everlasting eyes Was it nothing to be the intimate of all her sibylline moods learned in every haunted murmur of her voice intrusted with her lunar secrets and a friend of all her stars Yes it was much indeed he often said to himself as he turned homeward with the first flush of morning and met the great sweet smelling wains coming from the country laden with fruits and flowers and making their way like moving orchards and meadows through the city streets The big wagoners too were well acquainted with the great lord who never slept and would always stop when they saw him for it was his custom to buy from them a bunch of country flowers The country dew is still on them he would say it will have dried long since when the people sleeping yonder come to buy them and as he slipped back into his house he would often feel a sort of pity for those who slept so well that they never saw the stars set and the sun rise Such were some of the compensations with which he strove to strengthen his soul not all in vain So time passed but at length the strain of those interminable nights began to tell upon the sleepless man and strange fancies began to take possession of him His vigils were no longer lonely but inhabited by spectral voices and shadowy faces Rebellion against his fate began to take the place of courage and one night in anger against his unending ordeal he said to himself Am I not a great lord It is intolerable that I should be denied that simple thing which the humblest and poorest possess so abundantly Am I not rich I will go forth and buy sleep So saying he took from a cabinet a great jewel of priceless value It is worth half my estate he said Surely with this I can buy sleep And he went out into the night As if in irony the night was unusually wide awake with stars and the moon was almost at its full As the sleepless one looked up into the firmament it almost seemed as though it mocked him with his brilliant wakefulness From horizon to horizon in all the heaven there was to be seen no downiest feather of the wings of sleep To his upturned eyes pleading for the mercy of sleep the stars sent down an answer of polished steel And so he turned his eyes again upon the earth Everything there also even the keenly cut shadows seemed pitilessly awake It almost seemed as though God had withdrawn the blessing of sleep from His universe But no Suddenly he gave a cry of joy as presently by the riverside stretched in an angle of its granite embankment as though it had been a bed of down he came upon a great workman fast asleep with his arms over his head and his face full in the light of the moon His breath came and went with the regularity of a man who has done his days work and is healthily tired out He seemed to be drinking great draughts of sleep out of the sky as one drinks water from a spring He was poorly clad and evidently a wanderer on the earth but houseless as he was to him had been granted that healing gift which the great lord who gazed at him had prayed for in vain for months and years and for which this night he was willing to surrender half nay the whole of his wealth if needs be Only a little holiday of sleep Soft sleep sweet sleep a little soothing psalm Of slumber from Thy sanctuaries of calm A little sleep it matters not how deep A little falling feather from Thy wing Merciful Lord is it so great a thing The sleepless one gazed at the sleeper a long time fascinated by the mystery and beauty of that strange gift that had been denied him Then he took the jewel in his hand and looked at it picturing to himself the sleeping man s surprise when he awoke in the morning and found so unexpected a treasure in his possession and all that the sudden acquisition of such wealth would mean to him But as I said at the beginning God had given him a good heart and as he gazed on the man s sleep again a pang of misgiving shot through him After all what were worldly possessions compared with this natural boon of which he was about to rob the sleeping man Would all his castles be a fair exchange for that And was he about to subject a fellow human being to the torture which he had endured to the verge of madness For a long time he stood over the sleeper struggling with himself No at last he said I cannot rob him of his sleep and turned and passed on his way Illustration HE WENT FORTH INTO THE DAWN SLEEPLESS Presently he came to where a beautiful woman lay asleep with a little child in her arms They were evidently poor outcasts yet how tranquilly they lay there as if all the riches of the earth were theirs and as if there was no hard world to fight on the morrow If sleep had seemed beautiful on the face of the sleeping workman how much more beautiful it seemed here laying its benediction upon this poor mother and child How trustfully they lay in its arms out there in the shelterless night as though relying on the protection of the ever watchful stars Surely he could not violate this sanctuary of sleep and think to make amends by exchange of his poor worldly possessions No he must go on his way again But first he took a ring from his finger and slipped it gently into the baby s hand The tiny hand closed over it with the firmness of a baby s clutch It will be safe there till morning he said to himself and left them to their slumbers So he passed along through the city and everywhere were sleeping forms and houses filled with sleepers but he could not bring himself to carry out his plan and buy sleep Sleep was too beautiful and sacred a thing to be bought with the most precious stone and man was so piteously in need of it at each long day s end Thus he went on his way and at last as the dawn was showing faint in the sky he found himself in a churchyard and above one of the graves was growing a shining silver flower It is the flower of sleep said the sleepless one and he bent over eagerly to gather it but as he did so his eyes fell upon an inscription on the stone It was the grave of a beautiful girl who had died of heart break for her lover I may not pluck it he said She needs her sleep as well And he went forth into the dawn sleepless THE MAN WITH NO MONEY A FABLE FOR CAPITALISTS Once upon a time there was a man who found himself suddenly and sadly without any money I am aware that in these days it is hard to believe such a story Nowadays everybody has money and it may seem like a stretch of the imagination to suggest a time when a man should search his pockets and find them empty But this is merely a fairy tale so I trust that the reader will help me out by taking so apparently preposterous a statement for granted The man had been a merchant of butterflies in Ispahan and though his butterflies had flitted all about the flowered world the delight of many tongued and many colored nations he found himself at the close of the day a very poor and weary man He had but one consolation and companion left a strange black butterfly which he kept in a silver cage and only looked at now and again when he was quite sure that he was alone He had sold all his other butterflies all the rainbow wings but this dark butterfly he would keep till the end Kings and queens in sore sorrow and need had offered him great sums for his black butterfly but it was the only beautiful thing he had left so selfishly he kept it to himself Meanwhile he starved and wandered the country roads homeless and foodless his breakfast the morning star his supper the rising moon But sad as was his heart and empty as was his stomach laughter still flickered in his tired eyes and he possessed too a very shrewd mind as a man who sells butterflies must Making his breakfast of blackberries one September morning in the middle of an old wood with the great cages of bramble overladen with the fruit of the solitude an idea came to him Thereupon he sought out some simple peasants and said Why do you leave these berries to fall and wither in the solitude when in the markets of the world much money may be made of them for you and for your household Gather them for me and I will sell them and give you a fair return for your labor Now of course the blackberries did not belong to the dealer in butterflies They were the free gift of God to men and birds But the simple peasants never thought of that Instead they gathered them east and west into bushel and hogshead and the man that had no money that September morning smiled to himself as he paid them their little wage and filled his pockets that before had been so empty with the money that God and the blackberries and the peasants had made for him Thus he grew so rich that he seldom looked at the dark butterfly in the silver cage but sometimes in the night he heard the beating of its wings THE RAGS OF QUEEN COPHETUA When the first dazzle of bewildered happiness in her new estate had faded from her eyes and the miracle of her startling metamorphosis from a wandering beggar maid to a great Queen on a throne was beginning to lose a little of its wonder and to take its place among the accepted realities of life Queen Cophetua became growingly conscious of some dim dissatisfaction and unrest in her heart Indeed she had all that the world could give and surely all that a woman s heart is supposed to desire The King s love was still hers as when he found her at dawn by the pool in the forest and in exchange for the tattered rags which had barely concealed the water lily whiteness of her body countless wardrobes were filled with garments of every variety of subtle design and exquisite fabric textures light as the golden sun purple as the wine dark sea iridescent as the rainbow and soft as summer clouds the better to set off her strange beauty for the eyes of the King And every day of the year the King brought her a new and priceless jewel to hang about her neck or wear upon her moonbeam hands or to shine in the fragrant night of her hair Ah what a magical wooing that had been in the depths of the forest that strange morning The sun was hardly above the tops of the trees when she had awakened from sleep at the mossy foot of a giant beech and its first beams were casting a solemn enchantment across a great pool of water lilies and filling their ivory cups with strange gold She had lain still a while watching through her sleepy eyelids the unfolding marvel of the dawn and then rousing herself she had knelt by the pool and letting down her long hair that fell almost to her feet had combed and braided it with the pool for her mirror a mirror with water lilies for its frame And as she gazed at herself in the clear water with a girlish happiness in her own beauty a shadow fell over the pond and startled she saw beside her own face in the mirror the face of a beautiful young knight so it seemed bending over her shoulder In fear and maiden modesty for her hair was only half braided and whiter than any water lily in the pond her bosom glowed bare in the morning sunlight she turned around and met the eyes of the King Without moving each gazed at the other as in a dream eyes lost fathom deep in eyes At last the King found voice to speak You must be a fairy he had said for surely you are too beautiful to be human Nay my lord she had answered I am but a poor girl that wanders with my lute yonder from village to village and town to town singing my little songs You shall wander no more said the King Come with me and you shall sit upon a throne and be my Queen and I will love you forever But she could not answer a word for fear and joy And therewith the King took her by the hand and set her upon his horse that was grazing hard by and mounting behind her he rode with her in his arms to the city and all the while her eyes looked up into his eyes as she leaned upon his shoulder and his eyes looked deep down into hers but they spake not a word Only once at the edge of the forest he had bent down and kissed her on the lips and it seemed to both as if heaven with all its stars was falling into their hearts As they rode through the city to the palace surrounded by wondering crowds she nestled closer to his side like a frightened bird and like a wild birds were her great eyes gazing up into his in a terror of joy Not once did she move them to right or left for all the murmur of the people about them Nor did the King see aught but her water lily face as they wended thus in a dream through the crowded streets and at length came to the marble steps of the palace Then the King leaping from his horse took her tenderly in his arms and carried her lightly up the marble steps Upon the topmost step he set her down and taking her hand in his as she stood timidly by his side he turned his face to the multitude and spake Lo my people he said this is your Queen whom God has sent to me by a divine miracle to rule over your hearts from this day forth as she holds rule over mine My people salute your Queen And therewith the King knelt on one knee to his beggar maid and kissed her hand and all the people knelt likewise with bowed heads and a great cry went up Our Queen Our Queen Then the King and Queen passed into the palace and the tiring maids led the little beggar maid into a great chamber hung with tapestries and furnished with many mirrors and they took from off her white body the tattered gown she had worn in the forest and robed her in perfumed linen and cloth of gold and set jewels at her throat and in her hair and at evening in the cathedral before the high altar in the presence of all the people the King placed a sapphire beautiful as the evening star upon her finger and the twain became man and wife and the moon rose and the little beggar maid was a Queen and lay in a great King s arms On the morrow the King summoned a famous worker in metals attached to his court and commanded him to make a beautiful coffer of beaten gold in which to place the little ragged robe of his beggar maid for it was very sacred to him because of his great love After due time the coffer was finished and it was acclaimed the masterpiece of the great artificer who had made it About its sides was embossed the story of the King s love On one side was the pool with the water lilies and the beggar maid braiding her hair on its brink And on another she was riding on horseback with the King through the forest And on another she was standing by his side on the steps of the palace before all the people And on the fourth side she was kneeling by the King s side before the high altar in the cathedral The King placed the coffer in a secret gallery attached to the royal apartments and very tenderly he placed therein the little tattered gown and the lute with which his Queen was wont to wander from village to village and town to town singing her little songs Often at evening when his heart brimmed over with the tenderness of his love he would persuade his Queen to doff her beautiful royal garments and clothe herself again in that little tattered gown through the rents of which her white body showed whiter than any water lilies And however rich or exquisite the other garments she wore it was in those beloved rags the King declared that she looked most beautiful In them he loved her best But this had been a while ago and though as has been said the King s love was still hers as when he had met her that strange morning in the forest and though every day he brought her a new and priceless jewel to hang about her neck or wear upon her moonbeam hands or to shine in the fragrant night of her hair it was many months since he had asked her to wear for him the little tattered gown Was the miracle of their love beginning to lose a little of its wonder for him too was it beginning to take its place among the accepted realities of life Sometimes the Queen fancied that he seemed a little impatient with her elfin bird like ways as though in his heart he was beginning to wish that she was more in harmony with the folk around her more like the worldly court ladies with their great manners and artificial smiles For though she had now been a Queen a long while she had never changed She was still the wild gipsy hearted child the King had found braiding her hair that morning by the lilied pool Often she would steal away by herself and enter that secret gallery and lift the lid of the golden coffer and look wistfully at the little tattered robe and run her hands over the cracked strings of her little lute There was a long window in the gallery from which far away she could see the great green cloud of the forest and as the days went by she often found herself seated at this window gazing in its direction with vague unformed feelings of sadness in her heart One day as she sat there at the window an impulse came over her that she could not resist and swiftly she slipped off her beautiful garments and taking the little robe from the coffer clothed herself in the rags that the King had loved And she took the old lute in her hands and sang low to herself her old wandering songs And she danced too an elfin dance all alone there in the still gallery danced as the apple blossoms dance on the spring winds or the autumn leaves dance in the depths of the forest Suddenly she ceased in alarm The King had entered the gallery unperceived and was watching her with sad eyes Are you weary of being a Queen said he sadly For answer she threw herself on his breast and wept bitterly she knew not why Oh I love you I love you she sobbed but this life is not real And the King went from her with a heavy heart And from day to day an unspoken sorrow lay between them and from day to day the King s words haunted the Queen with a more insistent refrain Are you weary of being a Queen Was she weary of being a Queen And so the days went by One day as the Queen passed down the palace steps she came upon a beautiful girl clothed in tatters as she had once been seated on the lowest step selling flowers water lilies The Queen stopped Where did you gather your water lilies child she asked I gathered them from a pool in the great forest yonder answered the girl with a curtsey Give me one of them said the Queen with a sob in her voice and she slipped a piece of gold into the girl s hand and fled back into the palace That night as she lay awake by her sleeping King she rose silently and stole into the secret gallery There with tears running down her cheeks she dressed herself in the little tattered gown and took the lute in her hand and then stole back and pressed a last kiss on the brow of her sleeping King who still slept on But at sunrise the King awoke with a sudden fear in his heart and lo where his Queen had lain was only a white water lily And at that moment in the depths of the forest a beggar maid was braiding her hair with a pool of water lilies for her mirror THE WIFE FROM FAIRY LAND Her talk was of all woodland things Of little lives that pass Away in one green afternoon Deep in the haunted grass For she had come from fairy land The morning of a day When the world that still was April Was turning into May Green leaves and silence and two eyes Twas so she seemed to me A silver shadow of the woods Whisper and mystery I looked into her woodland eyes And all my heart was hers And then I led her by the hand Home up my marble stairs And all my granite and my gold Was hers for her green eyes And all my sinful heart was hers From sunset to sunrise I gave her all delight and ease That God had given to me I listened to fulfil her dreams Rapt with expectancy But all I gave and all I did Brought but a weary smile Of gratitude upon her face As though a little while She loitered in magnificence Of marble and of gold And waited to be home again When the dull tale was told Sometimes in the chill galleries Unseen she deemed unheard I found her dancing like a leaf And singing like a bird So lone a thing I never saw In lonely earth and sky So merry and so sad a thing One sad one laughing eye There came a day when on her heart A wild wood blossom lay And the world that still was April Was turning into May In her green eyes I saw a smile That turned my heart to stone My wife that came from fairy land No longer was alone For there had come a little hand To show the green way home Home through the leaves home through the dew Home through the greenwood home Illustration THE BUYER OF SORROWS 
8097_114971_000004_000000	train-clean-360	On an evening of singular sunset about the rich beginning of May the little market town of Beethorpe was startled by the sound of a trumpet 
8097_114971_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Beethorpe was an ancient town mysteriously sown centuries ago like a wandering thistle down of human life amid the silence and the nibbling sheep of the great chalk downs 
8097_114971_000005_000001	train-clean-360	It stood in a hollow of the long smooth billows of pale pasture that suavely melted into the sky on every side The evening was so still that the little river running across the threshold of the town and encircling what remained of its old walls was the noisiest thing to be heard dominating with its talkative murmur the bedtime hum of the High Street 
none	none	Suddenly as the flamboyance of the sky was on the edge of fading and the world beginning to wear a forlorn forgotten look a trumpet sounded from the western heights above the town as though the sunset itself had spoken and the people in Beethorpe looking up saw three horsemen against the lurid sky Three times the trumpet blew And the simple folk of Beethorpe tumbling out into the street at the summons and looking to the west with sleepy bewilderment asked themselves Was it the last trumpet Or was it the long threatened invasion of the King of France 
8097_114971_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Again the trumpet blew and then the braver of the young men of the town hastened up the hill to learn its meaning 
8097_114971_000010_000000	train-clean-360	As they approached the horsemen they perceived that the center of the three was a young man of great nobility of bearing richly but somberly dressed and with a dark beautiful face filled with a proud melancholy He kept his eyes on the fading sunset sitting motionless upon his horse apparently oblivious of the commotion his arrival had caused 
8097_114971_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The horseman on his right hand was clad after the manner of a herald and the horseman on his left hand was clad after the manner of a steward And the three horsemen sat motionless awaiting the bewildered ambassadors of Beethorpe 
8097_114971_000011_000000	train-clean-360	When these had approached near enough the herald once more set the trumpet to his lips and blew and then unfolding a parchment scroll read in a loud voice 
8097_114971_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 To the Folk of Beethorpe Greeting from the High and Mighty Lord Mortimer of the Marches 
none	none	Whereas our heart had gone out toward the sorrows of our people in the counties and towns and villages of our domain we hereby issue proclamation that whosoever hath a sorrow let him or her bring it forth and we out of our private purse will purchase the said sorrow according to its value that the hearts of our people be lightened of their burdens 
8097_114971_000014_000000	train-clean-360	And when the herald had finished reading he blew again upon the trumpet three times and the villagers looked at one another in bewilderment but some ran down the hill to tell their neighbors of the strange proposal of their lord 
8097_114971_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Thus presently nearly all the village of Beethorpe was making its way up the hill to where those three horsemen loomed against the evening sky 
8097_114971_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Never was such a sorrowful company 
8097_114971_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Up the hill they came carrying their sorrows in their hands sorrows for which in excited haste they had rummaged old drawers and forgotten cupboards and even ran hurriedly into the churchyard 
none	none	Illustration THE HERALD ONCE MORE SET THE TRUMPET TO HIS LIPS AND BLEW 
8097_114971_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Mortimer of the Marches sat his horse with the same austere indifference his melancholy profile against the fading sky 
8097_114971_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Only those who stood near to him noted a kindly ironic flicker of a smile in his eyes as he saw apparently seeing nothing the poor little raked up sorrows of his village of Beethorpe 
none	none	He was a fantastic young lord of many sorrows 
8097_114971_000018_000001	train-clean-360	His heart had been broken in a very strange way 
8097_114971_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Death and Pity were his closest friends 
8097_114971_000018_000003	train-clean-360	He was so sad himself that he had come to realize that sorrow is the only sincerity of life 
8097_114971_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Thus sorrow had become a kind of passion with him even a kind of connoisseurship and he had come so to say to be a collector of sorrows 
8097_114971_000018_000005	train-clean-360	It was partly pity and partly an odd form of dilettanteism for his own sad heart made him pitiful for and companionable with any other sad heart but the sincerity of his sorrow made him jealous of the sanctity of sorrow and at the same time sternly critical of and sadly amused by the hypocrisies of sorrow 
8097_114971_000019_000000	train-clean-360	So as he sat his horse and gazed at the sunset he smiled sadly to himself as he heard without seeming to hear the small insincere sorrows of his village of Beethorpe sorrows forgotten long ago but suddenly rediscovered in old drawers and unopened cupboards at the sound of his lordship s trumpet and the promise of his strange proclamation 
8097_114971_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Was there a sorrow in the world that no money could buy 
8097_114971_000021_000000	train-clean-360	It was to find such a sorrow that Lord Mortimer thus fantastically rode from village to village of his estates with herald and steward 
8097_114971_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The unpurchasable sorrow the sorrow no gold can gild no jewel can buy 
8097_114971_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Far and wide he had ridden over his estates seeking so rare a sorrow but as yet he had found no sorrow that could not be bought with a little bag of gold and silver coins 
8097_114971_000024_000000	train-clean-360	So he sat his horse while the villagers of Beethorpe were paid out of a great leathern bag by the steward for the steward understood the mind of his master and without troubling him paid each weeping and whimpering peasant as he thought fit 
8097_114971_000025_000000	train-clean-360	In another great bag the steward had collected the sorrows of the Village of Beethorpe and by this the moon was rising and with another blast of trumpet by way of farewell the three horsemen took the road again to Lord Mortimer s castle 
8097_114971_000026_000000	train-clean-360	When out of the great leathern bag in Lord Mortimer s cabinet they poured upon the table the sorrows of Beethorpe the young lord smiled to himself turning over one sorrow after the other as though they had been precious stones for there was not one genuine sorrow among them 
8097_114971_000027_000000	train-clean-360	But later there came news to him that there was one real sorrow in Beethorpe and he rode alone on horseback to the village and found a beautiful girl laying flowers on a grave 
8097_114971_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She was so beautiful that he forgot his ancient grief and he thought that all his castles would be but a poor exchange for her face 
none	none	Maiden said he let me buy your sorrow with three counties and seven castles 
8097_114971_000029_000000	train-clean-360	And the girl looked up at him from the grave with eyes of forget me not and said My lord you mistake 
8097_114971_000029_000001	train-clean-360	This is not sorrow 
none	none	It is my only joy THE PRINCESS S MIRROR The sun was scarcely risen but the young princess was already seated by her window 
8071-114972-0000	train-other-500	Never did window open upon a scene of such enchantment Never has the dawn risen over so fair a land Meadows so fresh and grass so green rivers of such mystic silver and far mountains
none	none	 so majestically purple no eye has seen outside of Paradise and over all was now outspread the fairy land of the morning sky Even a princess might rise early to behold so magic a spectacle 
8071-114972-0001	train-other-500	Yet strangely enough it was not upon this miracle that the eyes of the princess were gazing In fact she seemed entirely oblivious of it all oblivious of all that was passing in the sky
none	none	 and of all the dewy awakening of the earth Her eyes were lost in a trance over what she deemed a rarer beauty 
8071-114972-0002	train-other-500	a stranger marvel
none	none	 The princess was gazing at her own face in a golden mirror Illustration HER 
8071-114972-0003	train-other-500	ONLY CARE WAS TO GAZE ALL DAY AT HER OWN FACE And indeed it was a beautiful face that she saw there so beautiful that the princess might well be pardoned
none	none	 for thinking it the most beautiful face in the world So fascinated had she become by her own beauty that she carried her mirror ever at her girdle and gazed at it night and day Whenever she saw another beautiful thing she looked in her mirror and smiled to herself She had looked at the most beautiful rose in the world and then she had looked in her mirror and said 
8071-114972-0004	train-other-500	I am more beautiful She had looked at the morning star and then she had looked in her mirror and said
none	none	 I am more beautiful 
8071-114972-0005	train-other-500	She had looked at the rising moon and then she had looked in her mirror and still she said I am more beautiful Whenever she heard of a beautiful face in her kingdom
8071-114972-0006	train-other-500	she caused it to be brought before her and then she looked in her mirror and always she smiled to herself and said I am more beautiful
none	none	 Thus it had come about that her only care was to gaze all day at her own face So enamored had she become of it 
8071-114972-0007	train-other-500	that she hated even to sleep but not even in sleep did she lose the beautiful face she loved for it was still there in the mirror of dreams Yet often she would wake in the night to gaze at it and always
8071-114972-0008	train-other-500	she arose at dawn that with the first rays of the sun she might look into her mirror
none	none	 Thus from the rising sun to the setting moon 
8071-114972-0009	train-other-500	she would sit at her window and never take her eyes from those beautiful eyes that looked back at her and the longest day in the year was not long enough to return their gaze
8071-114972-0010	train-other-500	This particular morning was a morning in May all bloom and song and crowding leaves and thickening grass The valley was a mist of blossom
8071-114972-0011	train-other-500	and the air thrilled with the warbling of innumerable birds Soft dewy scents floated hither and thither on the wandering breeze But the princess took no note of these things
8071-114972-0012	train-other-500	lost in the dream of her face and saw the changes of the dawn only as they were reflected in her mirror and suffused her beauty with their rainbow tints
none	none	 So rapt in her dream was she that when a bird alighted near at hand 
8071-114972-0013	train-other-500	and broke into sudden song she was so startled that the mirror slipped from her hand Now the princess s window was in the wall of an old castle built high above the valley
8071-114972-0014	train-other-500	and beneath it the ground sloped precipitately covered with underbrush and thick grasses to a highroad winding far beneath As the mirror slipped from the hand of the princess it fell among this underbrush and rolled glittering
none	none	 down the slope 
8071-114972-0015	train-other-500	till the princess finally lost sight of it in a belt of wild flowers overhanging the highroad As it finally disappeared she screamed so loudly that the ladies in waiting ran to her in alarm
8071-114972-0016	train-other-500	and servants were instantly sent forth to search for the lost mirror It was a very beautiful mirror the work of a goldsmith famous for his fantastic masterpieces in the precious metals
8071-114972-0017	train-other-500	The fancy he had skilfully embodied was that of beauty as the candle attracting the moths The handle of the mirror which was of ivory represented the candle
none	none	 the golden flame of which swept round in a circle to hold the crystal 
8071-114972-0018	train-other-500	Wrought here and there on the golden back of the mirror were moths with wings of enamel and precious stones It was a marvel of the goldsmith s art and as such was beyond price
8071-114972-0019	train-other-500	Yet it was not merely for this as we know that the princess loved it but because it had been so long the intimate of her beauty For this reason it had become sacred in her eyes
8071-114972-0020	train-other-500	and as she watched it roll down the hillside
none	none	 she realized that it had gained for her also a superstitious value It almost seemed as if to lose it would be to lose her beauty too She ran to another mirror in panic No her beauty still remained But no other mirror could ever be to her like the mirror she had lost So forgetting her beauty for a moment she wept and tore her hair and beat her tiring maids in her misery 
8071-114972-0021	train-other-500	and when the men returned from their searching without the mirror she gave orders to have them soundly flogged for their failure Meanwhile the mirror rested peacefully among the wild flowers
8071-114972-0022	train-other-500	and the humming of bees A short while after the serving men had been flogged and the tiring maids had been beaten there came along the white road at the foot of the castle a tired minstrel
none	none	 He was singing to himself out of the sadness of his heart He was forty years old and the exchange that life had given him for his dreams had not seemed to him a fair equivalent 
8071-114972-0023	train-other-500	He had even grown weary of his own songs He sat dejected amid the green grasses and looked up at the ancient heaven and thought to himself Then suddenly
none	none	 he turned his tired eyes again to earth and saw the daisies growing there and the butterflies flitting from flower to flower And the road as he looked at it seemed long longer than ever He took his old lute in his hand wondering to himself if they could play another tune They were so in love with each other and so tired of each other 
8071-114972-0024	train-other-500	He played one of his old songs of which he was heartily weary and as he played the butterflies flitted about him and filled his old hair with blue wings He was forty years old and very weary
8071-114972-0025	train-other-500	He was alone His last nightingale had ceased singing The time had come for him when one thinks and even dreams of the fireside the hearth and the beautiful old memories
8071-114972-0026	train-other-500	He had in short arrived at that period of life when one begins to perceive the beauty of money As a boy he had never given a thought to gold or silver A butterfly had seemed more valuable to him than a gold piece
none	none	 But he was growing old and as I have said he was beginning to perceive the beauty of money 
8071-114972-0027	train-other-500	The daisies were all around him
none	none	 and the lark was singing up there in the sky But how could he cash a daisy or negotiate a lark Dreams after all were dreams He was saying this to himself when suddenly his eye fell upon the princess s mirror lying there in the grass so covered with butterflies looking at themselves that no wonder the serving men had been unable to find it 
8071-114972-0028	train-other-500	The mirror of the princess as I have said was made of gold and ivory and wonderful crystal and many precious stones So when the minstrel took it in his hands out of the grass he thought
8071-114972-0029	train-other-500	well that he might at least buy a breakfast at the next town For he was very hungry Well he caught up the mirror and hid it in his faded doublet and took his way to a wood of living green
8071-114972-0030	train-other-500	and when he was alone that is alone with a few flowers and a bird or two and a million leaves and the soft singing of a little river
none	none	 hiding its music under many boughs 
8071-114972-0031	train-other-500	he took out the mirror from his doublet Shame upon him he a poet of the rainbow had only one thought as he took up the mirror the gold and ivory and the precious stones
8071-114972-0032	train-other-500	He was merely thinking of them and his breakfast
none	none	 But when he looked into the mirror expecting to see his own ancient face what did he see He saw something so beautiful that just like the princess 
8071-114972-0033	train-other-500	he dropped the mirror Have you ever seen the wild rose as it opens its heart to the morning sky have you ever seen the hawthorn holding in its fragrant arms its innumerable blooms have you seen the rising of the moon
none	none	 or looked in the face of the morning star 
8071-114972-0034	train-other-500	The minstrel looked in the mirror and saw something far more wonderful than all these wonderful things He saw the face of the princess
none	none	 eternally reflected there for her love of her own beautiful face had turned the mirror into a magic glass To worship oneself is the only way to make a beautiful face And as the minstrel looked into the mirror he sadly realized 
8071-114972-0035	train-other-500	that he could never bring himself to sell it and that he must go without his breakfast The moon had fallen into his hand out of the sky Could he a poet exchange this celestial windfall for a meal and a new doublet
none	none	 As the minstrel gazed and gazed at the beautiful face he understood that he could no more sell the mirror than he could sell his own soul and in his pilgrimage through the world he had received many offers for his soul Also 
8071-114972-0036	train-other-500	many kings and captains had vainly tried to buy from him his gift of courage But the minstrel had sold neither And now had fallen out of the sky one more precious thing to guard the most beautiful face in the world
none	none	 So as he gazed in the mirror he forgot his hunger forgot his faded doublet forgot the long sorrow of his days and at length there came the setting sun Suddenly 
8071-114972-0037	train-other-500	the minstrel awoke from his dream at the sound of horsemen in the valley The princess was sending heralds into every corner of her dominions to proclaim the loss of the mirror and for its return a beautiful reward a lock of her strange hair
8071-114972-0038	train-other-500	The minstrel hid himself with his treasure amid the fern and when the trumpets had faded in the distance found the highroad again and went upon his way Now it chanced that a scullery maid of the castle
8071-114972-0039	train-other-500	as she was polishing a copper saucepan had lifted her eyes from her work and looking down toward the highroad had seen
none	none	 the minstrel pick up the mirror He 
8071-114972-0040	train-other-500	was a very well known minstrel All the scullery maids and all the princesses had his songs by heart Even the birds were fabled to sing his songs as they flitted to and fro
none	none	 on their airy business Thus through the little scullery maid it became known to the princess that the mirror had been found by the wandering minstrel and so his life became a life of peril Bandits hoping for the reward of that lock of strange hair hunted him through the woodland across the marshes and over the moors 
8071-114972-0041	train-other-500	Jews with great money bags came to buy from him the beautiful face Sometimes he had to climb up into trees to look at it in the sunrise the woods were so filled with the voices of his pursuers But neither hunger nor poverty
8071-114972-0042	train-other-500	nor small ferocious enemies were able to take from him the beautiful face It never left his heart All night long and all the watching day it was pressed close to his side Meanwhile the princess was in despair
8071-114972-0043	train-other-500	More and more the fancy possessed her that with the lost mirror her beauty too was lost In her unhappiness like all sad people she took strange ways of escape She consulted the stars
8071-114972-0044	train-other-500	and empirics from the four winds settled down upon her castle Each of course had his own invaluable nostrum and all went their way For not one of these understood the heart of a poet However
none	none	 at last there came to the aid of the princess a reverend old man 
8071-114972-0045	train-other-500	of ninety years a famous seer deeply and gently and pitifully learned in the hearts of men
none	none	 His was that wisdom which comes of great goodness He understood the princess and he understood the minstrel for having lived so long alone with the Infinite he understood the Finite To him the princess was as a little child 
8071-114972-0046	train-other-500	and his old wise heart went out to her And as I have said his heart understood the minstrel too Therefore he said to the princess I know the hearts of poets
none	none	 In seven days I will bring you back your mirror And the old man went and at length found the poet eating wild berries in the middle of the wood That is a beautiful mirror you have by your side said the old man This mirror answered the poet holds in its deeps the most beautiful face in the world It is true said the wise old man I have seen the beautiful face but I too possess a mirror Will you look into it 
8071-114972-0047	train-other-500	And the poet took the mirror from the old man and looked and as he looked the mirror of the princess fell neglected in the grass
none	none	 Why said the wise old man 
8071-114972-0048	train-other-500	do you let fall the princess s mirror But the poet made no answer
none	none	 for his eyes were lost in the strange mirror which the wise old man had brought him 
8071-114972-0049	train-other-500	What do you see in the mirror said the old man that you gaze so earnestly in it I see answered the minstrel the infinite miracle of the universe I see the august and lonely elements
none	none	 I see the solitary stars and the untiring sea I see the everlasting hills and as a crocus raises its rainbow head from the black earth in springtime I see the young moon growing like a slender flower out of the mountains 
8071-114972-0050	train-other-500	Yet look again said the old man into this other mirror the mirror of the princess Look again And the poet looked taking the two mirrors in his hands
8071-114972-0051	train-other-500	and looking from one to the other At last he said gazing into the face he had fought so long to keep
none	none	 at last I understand that this is but a fleeting phantom of beauty 
8071-114972-0052	train-other-500	a fluttering flower of a face just one beautiful flower in the innumerable meadows of the Infinite but here
none	none	 And he turned to the other mirror 
8071-114972-0053	train-other-500	Here is the Eternal Beauty the Divine Harmony the Sacred Unfathomable All Would a man be content with one rose when all the roses of all the rose gardens of the world were his
8071-114972-0054	train-other-500	You mean said the wise old man smiling to himself that I may take the mirror back to the princess Are you really willing to exchange her face for the face of the sky I am answered the minstrel
none	none	 I knew you were a poet said the sage And I know that you are very wise answered the minstrel Yet after all the princess was not so happy to have her mirror back again as she had expected to be for had not a wandering poet found something more beautiful than her face THE PINE LADY O have you seen the Pine Lady Or heard her how she sings Have you heard her play Your soul away On a harp with moonbeam strings In a palace all of the night black pine She hides like a queen all day Till a moonbeam knocks On her secret tree And she opens her door With a silver key While the village clocks Are striking bed Nine times sleepily O come and hear the Pine Lady Up in the haunted wood The stars are rising the moths are flitting The owls are calling The dew is falling And high in the boughs Of her haunted house The moon and she are sitting Out on the moor the night jar drones Rough throated love The beetle comes With his sudden drums And many a silent unseen thing Frightens your cheek with its ghostly wing While there above In a palace builded of needles and cones The pine is telling the moon her love Telling her love on the moonbeam strings O have you seen the Pine Lady Or heard her how she sings Illustration THE KING ON HIS WAY TO BE CROWNED In a green outlying corner of the kingdom of Bohemia one summer afternoon the Grand Duke Stanislaus was busy in his garden swarming a hive of bees He was a tall middle aged man of a scholarly almost priest like type a gentle mannered recluse living only in his books and his garden and much loved by the country folk for the simple kindness of his heart He had the most winning of smiles and a playful wisdom radiated from his wise rather weary eyes No man had ever heard him utter a harsh word and indeed life passed so tranquilly in that green corner of Bohemia that even less peaceful natures found it hard to be angry There was so little to be angry about Therefore it was all the stranger to see the good duke suddenly lose his temper this summer afternoon Preposterous he exclaimed was there ever anything quite so preposterous To think of interrupting me at such a moment with such news He spoke from inside a veil of gauze twisted about his head after the manner of beekeepers and was indeed just at that moment engaged in the delicate operation of transferring a new swarm to another hive The necessity of keeping his mind on his task somewhat restored his calm Give the messenger refreshment he said and send for Father Scholasticus Father Scholasticus was the priest of the village and the duke s very dear friend The reason for this explosion was the news brought by swiftest courier that Duke Stanislaus brother was dead and that he himself was thus become King of Bohemia By the time Father Scholasticus arrived the bees were housed in their new home and the duke was seated in his library among the books that he loved no less than his bees with various important looking parchments spread out before him despatches of state brought to him by the courier which he had been scanning with great impatience I warn you my friend he said looking up as the good father entered that you will find me in a very bad temper Ferdinand is dead can you imagine anything more unreasonable of him He was always the most inconsiderate of mortals and now without the least warning he shuffles his responsibilities upon my shoulders The priest knew his friend and the way of his thought and he could not help smiling at his quaint petulance Which means that you are King of Bohemia sire said he with a half whimsical reverence Where on earth he was wondering was there another man who would be so put out at being made a king Exactly answered the duke Do you wonder that I am out of temper You must give me your advice There must be some way out of it What what am I to do I am afraid there is nothing for you to do but reign your Majesty answered the priest I agree with you that it is a great hardship Do you really understand how great a hardship it is retorted the king to his friend Will you share it with me Share it with you asked the priest Yes as it appears that I must consent to be Head of the World Temporal will you consent to be the Head of the World Spiritual In short will you consent to be Archbishop of Bohemia Leave the little church that I love and the kind simple hearts in my care given into my keeping by the goodness of God asked the priest To be the spiritual shepherd answered the king not without irony of the sad flocks of souls that wander without pastor the strange streets of lost cities The king paused and added with his sad understanding smile and to sit on a gold throne in a great cathedral filled with incense and colored windows And the priest smiled back for the king and the priest were old friends and understood and loved each other At that moment there came a sound of trumpets through the quiet boughs and the priest rising and looking through the window saw a procession of gilded carriages from the first of which stepped out a dignified man with white hair and many years and robed in purple and ermine It is your Prime Minister and your court answered the priest to the mute question of the king And again they smiled together but the smile on the face of the king was weary beyond all human words because of all the perils that beset a man the one peril he had feared was the peril of being made a king of all the sorrows that sorrow of all the foolishness that foolishness for vanity had long since passed away from his heart and the bees and the blossoms of his garden seemed just as worthy of his care as that swarming hive of ambitious human wasps and earwigs over which he was thus summoned by sound of trumpet that happy summer afternoon to be the king Think of being the king of so foul a kingdom when one might be the king of a garden But in spite of his reluctance the good duke at length admitted the truth urged upon him by the good priest that there are sacred duties inherited by those born in high places and to noble destinies from which there is no honorable escape and on the priest agreeing to be the Archbishop of Bohemia he resigned himself to being its king Thereupon he received all the various dignitaries and functionaries that could so little have understood his heart having in the interval recovered his lost temper with all the graciousness for which he was famous and appointed a day as far off as possible when he would set out with all his train for his coronation in the capital a journey of many leagues However when the day came and in fact at the very moment of the starting out of the long and glittering cortege all the gilded carriages were suddenly brought to a halt by news coming to the duke of the sickness and imminent death of a much loved dependent of his an old shepherd with whom as a boy he was wont to wander the hills and listen eagerly to the lore of times and seasons of rising and setting stars and of the ways of the winds which are hidden in the hearts of tanned and withered old men who have spent their lives out of doors under sun and rain But to the great impatience of the court ladies and the great bewigged and powdered gentlemen the old shepherd lived on for several days during which time the duke was constantly at his side At last however the old shepherd went to his rest and the procession which he humble soul would not have believed that he could have delayed started on its magnificent way again with flutter of pennant and feather and song of trumpet and ladies laughter But it had traveled only a few leagues when it was again brought to a standstill by the duke who was thus progressing to his coronation catching sight from his carriage window as it flitted past of an extremely lovely and uncommon butterfly The duke had all his days been a passionate entomologist and this particular butterfly was the one that so far he had been unable to add to his collection Therefore he commanded the trumpets to call a halt and had his butterfly net brought to him and he and several of his gentlemen went in pursuit of the flitting painted thing but not that day nor the next was it captured in the royal net not in fact till a whole week had gone by and meanwhile the carriages stood idly in the stables and the postilions kicked their heels and the great ladies and gentlemen fumed at their enforced exile amid country ways and country freshness pining to be back once more in that artificial world where alone they could breathe To think of a man chasing a butterfly with a king s crown awaiting him and even perhaps a kingdom at stake said many a tongue for rumors came on the wind that a half brother of the dead king was meditating usurpation of the throne and was already gathering a large following about him Urgent despatches were said to have come from the imperial city begging that his Majesty for the good of his loyal subjects continue his journey with all possible expedition His kingdom was at stake The good duke smiled on the messenger and said Yes but look at my butterfly and no one but his friend the priest of course had understood Murmurs began to arise indeed among the courtiers and hints of plots even as the duke pursued his leisurely journey turning aside for each wayward fancy One day it would be a turtle crossing the road with her little ones which would bring to a respectful halt all those beautiful gold coaches and caracoling horses Tenderly would the good duke step from his carriage and watch her with his gentle smile not doubtless without sly laughter in his heart and an understanding glance from the priest that so humble and helpless a creature should for once have it in its power thus to delay so much worldly pomp and vanity On another occasion when they had journeyed for a whole day without any such fanciful interruptions and the courtiers began to think that they would reach the imperial city at last the duke decided to turn aside several long leagues out of their course to visit the grave of a great poet whose songs were one of the chief glories of his land I may have no other opportunity to do him honor said the duke And when his advisers ventured to protest and even to murmur urging the increasing jeopardy of his crown he gently admonished them Poets are greater than kings he said and what is my poor crown compared with that crown of laurel which he wears forever among the immortals There was no one found to agree with this except the good priest and one other a poor poet who had somehow been included in the train but whom few regarded The priest kept his thoughts to himself but the poet created some amusement by openly agreeing with the duke But of course the royal will had to be accepted with such grace as the courtiers could find to hide their discontented and even in the case of some their disaffected hearts for some of them at this new whimsy of the duke s secretly sent messengers to the would be usurper promising him their allegiance and support So at length after a day s journey the peaceful valley was reached where the poet lay at rest among the simple peasants whom he had loved kindly folk who still carried his songs in their hearts and sang them at evening to their babies and sweethearts and each day brought flowers to his green bird haunted grave When the duke came and bowed his head in that quiet place carrying in his hands a wreath of laurel his heart was much moved by their simple flowers lying there fresh and glittering as with new shed tears and as he reverently knelt and placed the wreath upon the sleeping mound he said aloud in the humility of his great heart What is such an offering as mine compared with these And a picture came to him of the peaceful valley he had left behind and of the simple folk he loved who were his friends and more and more his heart missed them and less and less it rejoiced at the journey still before him and still more foolish seemed his crown So with a great sigh he rose from the poet s grave and gave word for the carriages once more to move along the leafy lanes And to the great satisfaction of the courtiers the duke delayed them no more for his heart grew heavier within him and he sat with his head on his breast speaking little even to his dear friend the priest who rode with him and scarcely looking out of the windows of his carriage for any wonder of the way At length the broad walls and towers of the city came in sight a city set in a fair land of meadow and stream The morning sun shone bright over it and the priest looking up perceived how it glittered upon a great building of many white towers whose gilt pinnacles gleamed like so many crowns of gold Look your Majesty he said with a sad attempt at gaiety yonder is your palace And the duke looked up from a deep reverie and saw his palace and groaned aloud But presently there came a sad twinkle in his sad eyes as he descried another building of many peaks and pinnacles glittering in the sun Look up my Lord Archbishop he said turning to his friend yonder is your palace And as the good priest looked his face was all sorrow and the tears overflowed his eyes as he thought of the simple souls once in his keeping in his parish far away But presently the king looking again toward the palace descried a flag floating from one of the towers covered with heraldic devices As he looked it seemed that ten years of weariness fell from his face and a great joy returned Look he said almost in a whisper to the priest those are not my arms The priest looked and then looked again into the duke s eyes and ten years of weariness fell from his face also and a great joy returned Thank God we are saved the duke and the priest exclaimed together and fell laughing upon each other s shoulders For the arms floating from the tower of the palace were the arms of the usurper and the king that cared not to be a king had lost his kingdom And while they were still rejoicing together there came the sound of many horsemen from the direction of the city a cavalcade of many glittering spears The duke halted his train to await their coming and when they had arrived where the duke was a herald in cloth of gold broke from their ranks and read aloud from a great parchment many sounding words the meaning of which was that the good Duke Stanislaus had been deposed from his kingdom and that the High and Mighty Prince the usurper reigned in his stead When the herald had concluded the duke s voice was heard in reply It is well it is very well he said Gather yonder white flower and take it back to your master and say that it is the white flower of peace betwixt him and me And astonishment fell on all and no one of course except the priest understood All thought that the good duke had lost his wits which indeed had been the growing belief of his courtiers for some time But the herald gathered the white flower and carried it back to the city with sound of many trumpets Need one say that the usurper least of all understood With the herald went all the gilded coaches and the fine ladies and gentlemen complaining sadly that they had had such a long and tedious journey to no purpose and hastening with all speed to take their allegiance to the new king The duke s own people alone remained with him and when all the rest had gone the duke gave orders for the horses heads to be turned homeward to the green valley in which alone he cared to be a king Back to the bees and the books and the kind country hearts cried the duke to his friend Back to the little church among the quiet trees added the priest who had cared as little for an archbishop s miter as the duke for a kingly crown Since then the duke had been left to hive his bees in peace and it may be added that he has never been known to lose his temper again

none	none	 borne done by a heavy pack came wearily through the wood and at last as if worn out with the day s travel unshouldered his burden and threw himself down to rest at the foot of a great oak tree 
8071-114975-0001	train-other-500	He was very old
none	none	 older far he seemed than the tree under whose gnarled boughs he was resting though that looked as if it had been growing since the beginning of the world His back was bent as with the weight of years though really it had become so from the weight of the pack that he carried 
8071-114975-0002	train-other-500	his cheeks were furrowed like the bark of a tree and far down upon his breast fell a beard as white as snow But his deep set eyes were still bright and keen though sly and cruel
8071-114975-0003	train-other-500	and his long nose was like the beak of a hawk His hands were like roots strong and knotted and his fingers ended in talon like nails In repose
none	none	 even they seemed to be clutching something something they loved to touch and would never let go His clothes were in rags and his shoes scarce held to his feet 
8071-114975-0004	train-other-500	He seemed as abjectly poor as he was abjectly old Presently when he had rested awhile he turned to his pack and furtively glancing with his keen eyes up and down the wood
8071-114975-0005	train-other-500	to make sure that he was alone he drew from it a sack of leather which was evidently of great weight Its mouth was fastened by sliding thongs which he loosened with tremulous eager hands
none	none	 First he took from the bag a square of some purple silk stuff which he spread out on the turf beside him and then his eyes gleaming with a wild light he carefully poured out the contents of the bag on to the purple square 
8071-114975-0006	train-other-500	a torrent of gold and silver coins and precious stones flashing like rainbows a king s treasure The setting sun flashed on the glittering heap turning it into a dazzle of many colored fire
8071-114975-0007	train-other-500	The treasure seemed to light up the wood far and near and the gaudy summer flowers that a moment before had seemed so bright and splendid fell into shadow before its radiance The old man
none	none	 bathed his claw like hands in the treasure with a ghoulish ecstasy and let the gold and silver pour through his fingers over and over again streams of jeweled light gleaming and flashing in the level rays of the sun As he did so he murmured inarticulately to himself gloating and gurgling with a lonely hideous joy Suddenly a look of fear came over his face he seemed to hear voices coming up the wood and huddling his treasure swiftly back again into the leathern bag and the bag into the folds of his pack he rose and sought some bushes near by to hide himself from the sight of whomsoever it was that approached But as he shouldered his pack he half staggered for the pack was of great weight and he heaved a deep sigh 
8071-114975-0008	train-other-500	It grows heavier and heavier he muttered I cannot carry it much longer I shall never be able to carry it with me to the grave As he disappeared among the bushes
8071-114975-0009	train-other-500	a young man and a young woman with arms twined round each other came slowly up the glade and presently sat down at the foot of the tree where the old man had been resting a moment or two before
none	none	 Why what is this presently exclaimed the young girl picking up something bright out of the grass It was a gold coin which in his haste the old man had let slip through his fingers Gold they both exclaimed 
8071-114975-0010	train-other-500	together It will buy you a new silk gown said the lover Who ever heard of such luck And then he sighed Ah dear heart he said if only we had more like that Then we could fulfil our dream
none	none	 As the sun poured its last rays over them there at the foot of the oak it was to be seen that they were very poor Their clothes were old and weather stained and they had no shoes to their feet 
8071-114975-0011	train-other-500	but the white feet of the girl shone like ivory flowers in the grass and her hair was a sheaf of ruddy gold Nor was there a jewel in all the old man s treasure as blue as her eyes And the young man
8071-114975-0012	train-other-500	in his manly fashion was no less brave and fair to look upon In a little while they turned to a poor wallet at the young man s side Let us eat our supper they said
8071-114975-0013	train-other-500	But there was little more than a crust or two a few morsels of cheese and a mouthful or two of sour wine Still they were accustomed to being hungry and the thought of the gold coin cheered their hearts
none	none	 So they grew content and after a while they nestled close into each other s arms and fell asleep while slowly and softly through the woods came the light of the moon Now all this time the old man had lain hidden crouched down among the bushes afraid almost to draw his breath but from where he was he could hear and see all and had overheard all that had been said At length 
8071-114975-0014	train-other-500	after the lovers had been silent for a long time he took courage to peer out from his hiding place
none	none	 and he saw that they were asleep 
8071-114975-0015	train-other-500	He would wait a little longer though till their sleep was sounder and then he might be able perhaps to creep away unheard So he waited on and the moon grew brighter and brighter and flooded the woods with its strange silver
none	none	 And the lovers fell deeper and deeper asleep It will be safe now said the old man half rising and looking out from his bushes But this time as he looked out he saw something 
8071-114975-0016	train-other-500	something very strange and beautiful Hovering over the sleeping lovers was a floating flickering shape that seemed made of moonbeams with two great shining stars for its eyes
8071-114975-0017	train-other-500	It was the dream that came nightly to watch over the sleep of the lovers
none	none	 and as the miser gazed at it in wonder 
8071-114975-0018	train-other-500	a strange change came over his soul and he saw that all the treasure he had hoarded so long
none	none	 gathered by the cruel practices of years and with carrying which about the world his back had grown bent was as dross compared with this beautiful dream of two poor lovers to whom but one of all his gold pieces had seemed like a fortune What 
8071-114975-0019	train-other-500	after all is it to me but a weary burden my shoulders grow too old to carry he murmured and for the sake of which my life is in danger wherever I go and to guard which I must hide away from the eyes of men
8071-114975-0020	train-other-500	And the longer he gazed on the fair shining vision the more the longing grew within him to possess it for himself They shall have my treasure in exchange he said to himself approaching nearer to the sleepers
8071-114975-0021	train-other-500	treading softly lest he should awaken them But they slept on lost in the profound slumber of innocent youth As he drew near the dream shrank from him with fear in its starry eyes
8071-114975-0022	train-other-500	but it seemed the more beautiful to the old man the closer he came to it and saw of what divine radiance it was made and with his desire his confidence grew greater So
8071-114975-0023	train-other-500	softly placing his leather bag in the flowers by the side of the sleepers he thrust out his talon like fingers and snatched the dream by the hand
none	none	 and hurried away dragging it after him down the wood fearfully turning now and again to see that he was not pursued But the sleepers still slept on and by morning the miser was far away with the captive dream by his side 
8071-114975-0024	train-other-500	As the earliest birds chimed through the wood and the dawn glittered on the dewy flowers
none	none	 the lovers awoke and kissed each other and laughed in the light of the new day But what is this 
8071-114975-0025	train-other-500	cried the girl and her hands fell from the pretty task of coiling up the sunrise of her hair With a cry they both fell upon the leather bag lying there so mysteriously among the wood lilies in the grass
8071-114975-0026	train-other-500	With eager fingers they drew apart the leather thongs and went half mad with wonder and joy as they poured out the glittering treasure
none	none	 in the morning sun What can it all mean they cried The fairies must have been here in the night But the treasure seemed real enough The jewels were not merely dewdrops turned to diamonds and rubies and amethysts by the magic beams of the sun 
8071-114975-0027	train-other-500	nor was the gold mere gold of faerie but coins bearing the image of the king of the land Here were real jewels real gold and silver Like children they dabbled their hands in the shining heap
none	none	 tossing them up and pouring them from one hand to the other flashing and shimmering in the morning light Then a fear came on them But folk will say that we have stolen them said the youth they will take them from us and cast us into prison No I believe some god has heard our prayer said the girl 
8071-114975-0028	train-other-500	and sent them down from heaven in the night He who sent them will see that we come to no harm And again they fell to pouring them through their fingers and babbling in their delight
none	none	 Do you remember what we said last night when we found the gold piece said the girl 
8071-114975-0029	train-other-500	If only we had more of them Surely our good angel heard us and sent them in answer It is true said the young man They were sent to fulfil our dream
8071-114975-0030	train-other-500	Our poor starved and tattered dream said the girl How splendidly we can clothe and feed it now
none	none	 What a fine house we can build for it to live in It shall eat from gold and silver plate and it shall wear robes of wonderful silks 
8071-114975-0031	train-other-500	and lawns like rainbows and glitter with jewels blue and yellow and ruby jewels like fire fountains and the depths of the sea But as they spoke
8071-114975-0032	train-other-500	a sudden disquietude fell over them and they looked at each other with a new fear But where is our dream said the girl looking anxiously around And they realized
8071-114975-0033	train-other-500	that their dream was nowhere to be seen I seemed to miss it once in the night answered the young man in alarm
none	none	 but I was too sleepy to heed Where can it 
8071-114975-0034	train-other-500	be It cannot be far away said the girl Perhaps it has wandered off among the flowers But they were now thoroughly alarmed
none	none	 Where can it have gone they both cried And they rose up and ran 
8071-114975-0035	train-other-500	to and fro through the wood calling out aloud on their dream But no voice came back in reply nor though they sought high and low in covert and brake could they find a sign of it anywhere
none	none	 Their dream was lost Seek as they might it was nowhere to be found And then they sat down by the treasure weeping 
8071-114975-0036	train-other-500	forgetting it all in this new sorrow What shall we do
none	none	 they cried We have lost our dream 
8071-114975-0037	train-other-500	For a while they sat on inconsolable Then a thought came to the girl Some one must have stolen it from us It would never have left us of its own accord said she
none	none	 And as she spoke her eyes fell on the forgotten treasure What use are these to us now without our dream she said Who knows said the young man perhaps some one has stolen our dream to sell it into bondage We must go and seek it 
8071-114975-0038	train-other-500	and maybe we can buy it back again with this treasure Let us start at once said the girl drying her tears at this ray of hope and so replacing the treasure in the bag the young man slung it at the end of his staff and together
none	none	 they set off down the wood seeking their lost dream Meanwhile the old man had journeyed hastily and far the dream following in his footsteps sorrowing and at length he came to a fair meadow and by the edge of a stream he sat down to rest himself and called the dream to his side The dream shone nothing like so brightly as in the moonlit woodland and its eyes were heavy as with weeping 
8071-114975-0039	train-other-500	Sing to me said the old man to cheer my tired heart
none	none	 I know no songs said the dream sadly 
8071-114975-0040	train-other-500	You lie said the old man I saw the songs last night in the depths of your eyes I cannot sing them to you said the dream I can only sing them to the simple hearts I made them for
8071-114975-0041	train-other-500	the hearts you stole me from
none	none	 Stole you said the old man 
8071-114975-0042	train-other-500	Did I not leave my treasure in exchange Your treasure will be nothing to them without me said the dream
none	none	 You talk folly said the old man 
8071-114975-0043	train-other-500	With my treasure they can buy other dreams just as fair as you are Do you think that you are the only dream in the world There is no dream that money cannot buy But I am their own dream
8071-114975-0044	train-other-500	They will be happy with no other said the dream You shall sing to me all the same said the old man angrily But the dream shrank from him and covered its face
none	none	 If I sang to you you would not understand Your heart is old and hard and cruel and my songs are all of youth and love and joy Those are the songs I would hear said the old man But I cannot sing them to you and if I sang them you could not hear 
8071-114975-0045	train-other-500	Sing again cried the old man harshly sing I bid you I can never sing again said the dream I can only die
none	none	 And for none of the old man s threats would the dream sing to him but sat apart mourning the loved ones it had lost So several days passed by and every day the dream was growing less bright a creature of tears and sighs more and more fading away like a withering flower At length it was nothing but a gray shadow a weary shape of mist that seemed ready to dissolve and vanish at any breath of wind No one could have known it for that radiant vision that had hovered shimmering with such a divine light over the sleep of the lovers At length the old man lost patience and began to curse himself for a fool in that he had parted with so great a treasure for this worthless 
8071-114975-0046	train-other-500	whimpering thing And he raved like a madman as he saw in fancy all the gold and silver and rainbow tinted jewels he had so foolishly thrown away Take me back to them said the dream and they will give you back your treasure
none	none	 A likely thing raged the old man to give back a treasure like that for such a sorry phantom 
8071-114975-0047	train-other-500	You will see said the dream As there was nothing else to be done the old man took up his staff Come along then said he and started off in the direction of the wood
none	none	 and though it was some days journey a glow flushed all through the gray shape of the dream at the news and its eyes began to shine again 
8071-114975-0048	train-other-500	And so they took their way But meanwhile the two lovers had gone from village to village and city to city vainly asking news of their dream And to every one they asked they showed their treasure and said
none	none	 This is all yours if you can but give us back our dream 
8071-114975-0049	train-other-500	But nowhere could they learn any tidings
none	none	 but gleaned only mockery and derision 
8071-114975-0050	train-other-500	You must be mad said some to seek a dream when you have all that wealth in your pack Of what use is a dream to any one And what more dream do you want than gold and precious stones
8071-114975-0051	train-other-500	Ah our dream said the lovers is worth all the gold and jewels in the world Sometimes others would come bringing their own dreams Take this they would say and give us your treasure
8071-114975-0052	train-other-500	But the lovers would shake their heads sadly No your dreams are not so beautiful as ours
none	none	 No other dream can take its place We can only be happy with our own dream 
8071-114975-0053	train-other-500	And indeed the dreams that were brought to them seemed poor pitiful make believe things often ignoble misbegotten sordid and cruel
none	none	 To the lovers they seemed not dreams at all but shapes of greed and selfish desire So the days passed bringing them neither tidings nor hope and there came at length an evening when they turned their steps again to the woodland 
8071-114975-0054	train-other-500	and sat down once more under the great oak tree in the sunset Perhaps our dream has been waiting for us here all the time they said But the wood was empty and echoing
8071-114975-0055	train-other-500	and they sat and ate their supper as before but silently and in sorrow and as the sun set they fell asleep as before in each other s arms
none	none	 but with tears glittering on their eyelids 
8071-114975-0056	train-other-500	And again the moon came flooding the spaces of the wood and nothing was heard but their breathing and the song of a distant nightingale But presently while they slept there was a sound of stealthy footsteps coming up the wood
none	none	 It was the old man with the dream shining by his side and ever and anon running ahead of him in the eagerness of its hope Suddenly it stopped glowing and shimmering like the dancing of the northern lights and placed a starry finger on its lips for silence See it whispered and there were the lovers lying lost in sleep 
8071-114975-0057	train-other-500	But the old man s wolfish eyes saw but one thing There lay the leather bag of his treasure just as he had left it Without a word he snatched it up and hastened off with it down the wood gurgling uncouthly to himself
8071-114975-0058	train-other-500	Oh my beauties he cried as he sat himself down afar off and poured out the gold and the silver and the gleaming stones into the moonlight Oh my love my life and my delight
none	none	 What other dream could I have but you Meanwhile the lovers stirred in their sleep and murmured to each other 
8071-114975-0059	train-other-500	I seemed to hear singing each said
none	none	 And half opening their eyes they saw their dream shining and singing above them in the moonbeams lovelier than ever before a shape of heavenly silver with two stars for its eyes Our dream has come back they cried to each other Dear dream we had to lose you to know how beautiful you are And with a happy sigh they turned to sleep again while the dream kept watch over them till the dawn THE STERN EDUCATION OF CLOWNS A clown out of work for many weeks had trudged the country roads footsore and hungry vainly seeking an engagement At length one afternoon he arrived at a certain village and spied the canvas tent and the painted wagons of a traveling circus This sight put a pale hope into his sad heart and he approached the tent as bravely as he could to find the proprietor of the show Sad as was his heart his face looked sadder and he did not it is to be feared make a very impressive appearance as at last he found the proprietor sitting on the side of the sawdust ring eating lunch with the Columbine The circus proprietor was large and swarthy and brutal to look on and his sullen cruel eyes looked sternly at the little clown who between a sad heart and a long empty stomach had very little courage left in his frame Well roared the proprietor What is it The little clown explained his profession and his need of an engagement and stood there hat in hand with tremulous knees The circus proprietor looked at him a long time in contemptuous silence and then with an ugly sneer said Have you ever had your heart broken Indeed I have answered the clown For to have your heart broken is part of the business of a clown How many times Six Not enough answered the proprietor roughly turning again to his lunch with the Columbine Get it broken again and come back then perhaps we can talk business And the little clown went away but he had hardly gone a few yards before his heart broke for the seventh time because of the bitterness of the world Yet being wise he waited a day or two living as best he could along the country roads and then at length he came back about noon to the circus and again the proprietor was eating lunch with the Columbine and again he looked up sullen and sneering and said Well The clown explained that his heart had been broken for the seventh time Good said the circus proprietor Wait till I have eaten lunch and we will talk business And the clown sat at the side of the ring and the proprietor and the Columbine ate and laughed as if he were not there At length finishing a tankard of ale and wiping his mouth on the back of his hand the circus proprietor arose and beckoned the clown to come to him At the same time he took a long ringmaster s whip and the Columbine took one end of a skipping rope while he held the other Now said the circus proprietor while we twirl the skipping rope you are to dance over it and at the same time I will lash your shins with this whip and if as you skip over the rope you can laugh and sing like a child dancing on blue flowers in a meadow I will give you the proprietor hesitated a moment six dollars a week So it was that the clown at last got an engagement THE END Transcriber s note Underscores have
