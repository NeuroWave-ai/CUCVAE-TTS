REMARKS ON THE GENTLE ART OF LAUGH MAKING BY MARSHALL P WILDER Happiness and laughter are two of the most beautiful things in the world for they are of the few that are purely unselfish Laughter is not for yourself but for others When people are happy they present a cheerful spirit which finds its reflection in every one they meet for happiness is as contagious as a yawn Of all the emotions laughter is the most versatile for it plays equally well the role of either parent or child to happiness Then can we say too much in praise of the men who make us laugh God never gave a man a greater gift than the power to make others laugh unless it is the privilege of laughing himself We honor revere admire our great soldiers statesmen and men of letters but we love the man who makes us laugh No other man to day enjoys to such an extent the close personal affection individual yet national that is given to mister Samuel L Clemens He is ours he is one of us we have a personal pride in him dear Mark Twain the beloved child of the American nation And it was through our laughter that he won our love He is the exponent of the typically American style of fun making the humorous story I asked mister Clemens one day if he could remember the first money he ever earned With his inimitable drawl he said Yes Marsh it was at school All boys had the habit of going to school in those days and they hadn t any more respect for the desks than they had for the teachers There was a rule in our school that any boy marring his desk either with pencil or knife would be chastised publicly before the whole school or pay a fine of five dollars Besides the rule there was a ruler I knew it because I had felt it it was a darned hard one too One day I had to tell my father that I had broken the rule and had to pay a fine or take a public whipping and he said Sam it would be too bad to have the name of Clemens disgraced before the whole school so I ll pay the fine But I don t want you to lose anything so come upstairs I went upstairs with father and he was for giving me I came downstairs with the feeling in one hand and the five dollars in the other and decided that as I d been punished once and got used to it I wouldn t mind taking the other licking at school So I did and I kept the five dollars That was the first money I ever earned The humorous story as expounded by Mark Twain Artemus Ward and Robert J Burdette is purely American Artemus Ward could get laughs out of nothing by mixing the absurd and the unexpected and then backing the combination with a solemn face and earnest manner For instance he was fond of such incongruous statements as I once knew a man in New Zealand who hadn t a tooth in his head here he would pause for some time look reminiscent and continue and yet he could beat a base drum better than any man I ever knew Robert J Burdette who wrote columns of capital humor for The Burlington Hawkeye and told stories superbly on his first visit to New York was spirited to a notable club where he told stories leisurely until half the hearers ached with laughter and the other half were threatened with apoplexy Everyone present declared it the red letter night of the club and members who had missed it came around and demanded the stories at secondhand Some efforts were made to oblige them but without avail for the tellers had twisted their recollections of the stories into jokes and they didn t sound right so a committee hunted the town for Burdette to help them out of their difficulty Humor is the kindliest method of laugh making Wit and satire are ancient but humor it has been claimed belongs to modern times A certain type of story having a sudden and terse conclusion to a direct statement has been labeled purely American For instance Willie Jones loaded and fired a cannon yesterday The funeral will be to morrow But the truth is it is older than America it is very venerable If you will turn to the twelfth verse of the sixteenth chapter of II Chronicles you will read And Asa in the thirty ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not the Lord but turned to the physicians and Asa slept with his fathers Bill Nye was a sturdy and persistent humorist of so good a sort that he never could help being humorous yet there was never a sting in his jokes Gentle raillery was the severest thing he ever attempted and even this he did with so genial a smile and so merry an eye that a word of his friendly chaffing was worth more than any amount of formal praise Few of the great world s great despatches contained so much wisdom in so few words as Nye s historic wire from Washington My friends and money gave out at three A M Eugene Field the lover of little children and the self confessed bibliomaniac gives us still another sort of laugh the tender indulgent sort Nothing could be finer than the gentle reminiscence of Long Ago a picture of the lost kingdom of boyhood which for all its lightness holds a pathos that clutches one in the throat And yet this writer of delicate and subtle humor this master of tender verse had a keen and nimble wit An ambitious poet once sent him a poem to read entitled Why do I live and Field immediately wrote back Because you sent your poem by mail Laughter is one of the best medicines in the world and though some people would make you force it down with a spoon there is no doubt that it is a splendid tonic and awakens the appetite for happiness Colonel Ingersoll wrote on his photograph which adorns my home To the man who knows that mirth is medicine and laughter lengthens life Abraham Lincoln that divinely tender man believed that fun was an intellectual impetus for he read Artemus Ward to his Cabinet before reading his famous emancipation proclamation and laying down his book marked the place to resume Joel Chandler Harris whose delightful stories of negro life hold such a high place in American literature told me a story of an old negro who claimed that a sense of humor was necessary to happiness in married life He said I met a poor old darkey one day pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with cooking utensils and household effects Seeing me looking curiously at him he shook his head and said I cain t stand her no longer boss I jes nash ully cain t stand her no longer What s the matter uncle I inquired Well you see suh she ain t got no idee o fun she won t take a joke nohow The other night I went home an I been takin a little jes to waam ma heart das all jes to waam ma heart an I got to de fence an tried to climb it I got on de top an thar I stays I couldn t git one way or t other Then a gem en comes along an I says Would you min givin me a push He says Which way you want to go I says Either way don t make no dif unce jes so I git off de fence for hit s pow ful oncom fable up yer So he give me a push an sont me over to ard ma side an I went home Then I want sum in t eat an my ol ooman she wouldn git it fo me an so jes fo a joke das all jes a joke I hit er awn de haid But would you believe it she couldn t take a joke She tu n aroun an sir she sail inter me sum in scan lous I didn do nothin cause I feelin kind o weak jes then an so I made up ma min I wasn goin to stay with her Dis mawnin she gone out washin an I jes move right out Hit s no use tryin to live with a ooman who cain t take a joke From the poems of Thomas Bailey Aldrich to George Ade s Fables in Slang is a far cry but one is as typical a style of humor as the other Ade s is the more distinctly original for he not only created the style but another language The aptness of its turns and the marvelous way in which he hit the bull s eye of human foibles and weaknesses lifted him into instantaneous popularity A famous bon mot of George Ade s which has been quoted threadbare but which serves excellently to illustrate his native wit is his remark about a suit of clothes which the tailor assured him he could never wear out He said when he put them on he didn t dare to From the laughter makers pure and simple we come to those who while acknowledging the cloud yet see the silver lining the exponents of the smile through tears The best of these Frank L Stanton has beautifully said This world that we re a livin in Is mighty hard to beat With every rose you get a thorn But ain t the roses sweet He does not deny the thorns but calls attention to the sweetness of the roses a gospel of compensation that speaks to the heart of all kind words of cheer to the weary traveler Such a philosopher was the kind hearted and sympathetic Irish boy who walking along with the parish priest met a weary organ grinder who asked how far it was to the next town The boy answered Four miles The priest remonstrated Why Mike how can you deceive him so You know it is eight Well your riverence said the good natured fellow I saw how tired he was and I wanted to kape his courage up If I d told him the truth he d have been down hearted intirely This is really a jolly old world and people are very apt to find just what they are looking for If they are looking for happiness the best way to find it is to try to give it to others If a man goes around with a face as long as a wet day perfectly certain that he is going to be kicked he is seldom disappointed A typical exponent of the tenderly human the tearfully humorous is James Whitcomb Riley a name to conjure with Only mention it to anyone and note the spark of interest the smiling sigh the air of gentle retrospection into which he will fall There is a poem for each and every one that commends itself for some special reason and holds such power of memory or sentiment as sends it straight into the heart to remain there treasured and unforgotten In these volumes are selections from the pen of all whom I have mentioned as well as many more including a number by the clever women humorists of whom America is justly proud It is with pride and pleasure that I acknowledge the honor done me in being asked to introduce this company of fun makers such a goodly number that space permits the mention of but a few But we cannot have too much or even enough of anything so good or so necessary as the literature that makes us laugh In that regard we are like a little friend of mister Riley s The Hoosier poet as everyone knows is the devoted friend companion and singer of children He has a habit of taking them on wild orgies where they are turned loose in a candy store and told to do their worst This particular young lady had been allowed to choose all the sorts of candy she liked until her mouth both arms and her pockets were full Just as they got to the door to go out she hung back and when mister Riley stooped over asking her what was the matter she whispered Don t you think it smells like ice cream Poems stories humorous articles fables and fairy tales are offered for your choice with subjects as diverse as the styles but however the laugh is gained in whatever fashion the jest is delivered the laugh maker is a public benefactor for laughter is the salt of life and keeps the whole dish sweet Merrily yours MARSHALL

MELONS BY BRET HARTE As I do not suppose the most gentle of readers will believe that anybody s sponsors in baptism ever wilfully assumed the responsibility of such a name I may as well state that I have reason to infer that Melons was simply the nickname of a small boy I once knew If he had any other I never knew it Various theories were often projected by me to account for this strange cognomen His head which was covered with a transparent down like that which clothes very small chickens plainly permitting the scalp to show through to an imaginative mind might have suggested that succulent vegetable That his parents recognizing some poetical significance in the fruits of the season might have given this name to an August child was an oriental explanation That from his infancy he was fond of indulging in melons seemed on the whole the most likely particularly as Fancy was not bred in McGinnis s Court He dawned upon me as Melons His proximity was indicated by shrill youthful voices as Ah Melons or playfully Hi Melons or authoritatively You Melons McGinnis s Court was a democratic expression of some obstinate and radical property holder Occupying a limited space between two fashionable thoroughfares it refused to conform to circumstances but sturdily paraded its unkempt glories and frequently asserted itself in ungrammatical language My window a rear room on the ground floor in this way derived blended light and shadow from the court So low was the window sill that had I been the least disposed to somnambulism it would have broken out under such favorable auspices and I should have haunted McGinnis s Court My speculations as to the origin of the court were not altogether gratuitous for by means of this window I once saw the Past as through a glass darkly It was a Celtic shadow that early one morning obstructed my ancient lights It seemed to belong to an individual with a pea coat a stubby pipe and bristling beard He was gazing intently at the court resting on a heavy cane somewhat in the way that heroes dramatically visit the scenes of their boyhood As there was little of architectural beauty in the court I came to the conclusion that it was McGinnis looking after his property The fact that he carefully kicked a broken bottle out of the road somewhat strengthened me in the opinion But he presently walked away and the court knew him no more He probably collected his rents by proxy if he collected them at all Beyond Melons of whom all this is purely introductory there was little to interest the most sanguine and hopeful nature In common with all such localities a great deal of washing was done in comparison with the visible results There was always some thing whisking on the line and always some thing whisking through the court that looked as if it ought to be there A fish geranium of all plants kept for the recreation of mankind certainly the greatest illusion straggled under the window Through its dusty leaves I caught the first glance of Melons His age was about seven He looked older from the venerable whiteness of his head and it was impossible to conjecture his size as he always wore clothes apparently belonging to some shapely youth of nineteen A pair of pantaloons that when sustained by a single suspender completely equipped him formed his every day suit How with this lavish superfluity of clothing he managed to perform the surprising gymnastic feats it has been my privilege to witness I have never been able to tell His turning the crab and other minor dislocations were always attended with success It was not an unusual sight at any hour of the day to find Melons suspended on a line or to see his venerable head appearing above the roofs of the outhouses Melons knew the exact height of every fence in the vicinity its facilities for scaling and the possibility of seizure on the other side His more peaceful and quieter amusements consisted in dragging a disused boiler by a large string with hideous outcries to imaginary fires Melons was not gregarious in his habits A few youth of his own age sometimes called upon him but they eventually became abusive and their visits were more strictly predatory incursions for old bottles and junk which formed the staple of McGinnis s Court Overcome by loneliness one day Melons inveigled a blind harper into the court For two hours did that wretched man prosecute his unhallowed calling unrecompensed and going round and round the court apparently under the impression that it was some other place while Melons surveyed him from an adjoining fence with calm satisfaction It was this absence of conscientious motives that brought Melons into disrepute with his aristocratic neighbors Orders were issued that no child of wealthy and pious parentage should play with him This mandate as a matter of course invested Melons with a fascinating interest to them Admiring glances were cast at Melons from nursery windows Baby fingers beckoned to him Invitations to tea on wood and pewter were lisped to him from aristocratic back yards It was evident he was looked upon as a pure and noble being untrammelled by the conventionalities of parentage and physically as well as mentally exalted above them One afternoon an unusual commotion prevailed in the vicinity of McGinnis s Court Looking from my window I saw Melons perched on the roof of a stable pulling up a rope by which one Tommy an infant scion of an adjacent and wealthy house was suspended in mid air In vain the female relatives of Tommy congregated in the back yard expostulated with Melons in vain the unhappy father shook his fist at him Secure in his position Melons redoubled his exertions and at last landed Tommy on the roof Then it was that the humiliating fact was disclosed that Tommy had been acting in collusion with Melons He grinned delightedly back at his parents as if by merit raised to that bad eminence Long before the ladder arrived that was to succor him he became the sworn ally of Melons and I regret to say incited by the same audacious boy chaffed his own flesh and blood below him He was eventually taken though of course Melons escaped But Tommy was restricted to the window after that and the companionship was limited to Hi Melons and You Tommy and Melons to all practical purposes lost him forever I looked afterward to see some signs of sorrow on Melons s part but in vain he buried his grief if he had any somewhere in his one voluminous garment At about this time my opportunities of knowing Melons became more extended I was engaged in filling a void in the Literature of the Pacific Coast As this void was a pretty large one and as I was informed that the Pacific Coast languished under it I set apart two hours each day to this work of filling in It was necessary that I should adopt a methodical system so I retired from the world and locked myself in my room at a certain hour each day after coming from my office I then carefully drew out my portfolio and read what I had written the day before This would suggest some alterations and I would carefully rewrite it During this operation I would turn to consult a book of reference which invariably proved extremely interesting and attractive It would generally suggest another and better method of filling in Turning this method over reflectively in my mind I would finally commence the new method which I eventually abandoned for the original plan At this time I would become convinced that my exhausted faculties demanded a cigar The operation of lighting a cigar usually suggested that a little quiet reflection and meditation would be of service to me and I always allowed myself to be guided by prudential instincts Eventually seated by my window as before stated Melons asserted himself Though our conversation rarely went further than Hello Mister and Ah Melons a vagabond instinct we felt in common implied a communion deeper than words In this spiritual commingling the time passed often beguiled by gymnastics on the fence or line always with an eye to my window until dinner was announced and I found a more practical void required my attention An unlooked for incident drew us in closer relation A sea faring friend just from a tropical voyage had presented me with a bunch of bananas They were not quite ripe and I hung them before my window to mature in the sun of McGinnis s Court whose forcing qualities were remarkable In the mysteriously mingled odors of ship and shore which they diffused throughout my room there was lingering reminiscence of low latitudes But even that joy was fleeting and evanescent they never reached maturity Coming home one day as I turned the corner of that fashionable thoroughfare before alluded to I met a small boy eating a banana There was nothing remarkable in that but as I neared McGinnis s Court I presently met another small boy also eating a banana A third small boy engaged in a like occupation obtruded a painful coincidence upon my mind I leave the psychological reader to determine the exact company relation between the circumstance and the sickening sense of loss that overcame me on witnessing it I reached my room the bananas were gone There was but one that knew of their existence but one who frequented my window but one capable of gymnastic effort to procure them and that was I blush to say it Melons Melons the depredator Melons despoiled by larger boys of his ill gotten booty or reckless and indiscreetly liberal Melons now a fugitive on some neighborhood house top I lit a cigar and drawing my chair to the window sought surcease of sorrow in the contemplation of the fish geranium In a few moments something white passed my window at about the level of the edge There was no mistaking that hoary head which now represented to me only aged iniquity It was Melons that venerable juvenile hypocrite He affected not to observe me and would have withdrawn quietly but that horrible fascination which causes the murderer to revisit the scene of his crime impelled him toward my window I smoked calmly and gazed at him without speaking He walked several times up and down the court with a half rigid half belligerent expression of eye and shoulder intended to represent the carelessness of innocence Once or twice he stopped and putting his arms their whole length into his capacious trousers gazed with some interest at the additional width they thus acquired Then he whistled The singular conflicting conditions of John Brown s body and soul were at that time beginning to attract the attention of youth and Melons s performance of that melody was always remarkable But to day he whistled falsely and shrilly between his teeth At last he met my eye He winced slightly but recovered himself and going to the fence stood for a few moments on his hands with his bare feet quivering in the air Then he turned toward me and threw out a conversational preliminary They is a cirkis said Melons gravely hanging with his back to the fence and his arms twisted around the palings a cirkis over yonder indicating the locality with his foot with hosses and hossback riders They is a man wot rides six hosses to onct six hosses to onct and nary saddle and he paused in expectation Even this equestrian novelty did not affect me I still kept a fixed gaze on Melons s eye and he began to tremble and visibly shrink in his capacious garment Some other desperate means conversation with Melons was always a desperate means must be resorted to He recommenced more artfully Do you know Carrots I had a faint remembrance of a boy of that euphonious name with scarlet hair who was a playmate and persecutor of Melons But I said nothing Carrots is a bad boy Killed a policeman onct Wears a dirk knife in his boots saw him to day looking in your windy I felt that this must end here I rose sternly and addressed Melons Melons this is all irrelevant and impertinent to the case You took those bananas Your proposition regarding Carrots even if I were inclined to accept it as credible information does not alter the material issue You took those bananas The offense under the Statutes of California is felony How far Carrots may have been accessory to the fact either before or after is not my intention at present to discuss The act is complete Your present conduct shows the animo furandi to have been equally clear By the time I had finished this exordium Melons had disappeared as I fully expected He never reappeared The remorse that I have experienced for the part I had taken in what I fear may have resulted in his utter and complete extermination alas he may not know except through these pages For I have never seen him since Whether he ran away and went to sea to reappear at some future day as the most ancient of mariners or whether he buried himself completely in his trousers I never shall know I have read the papers anxiously for accounts of him I have gone to the Police Office in the vain attempt of identifying him as a lost child But I never saw him or heard of him since Strange fears have sometimes crossed my mind that his venerable appearance may have been actually the result of senility and that he may have been gathered peacefully to his fathers in a green old age I have even had doubts of his existence and have sometimes thought that he was providentially and mysteriously offered to fill the void I have before alluded to In that hope I have written these pages

ll Kill you if you Quote it THE CURSE OF THE COMPETENT BY HENRY J FINN My spirit hath been seared as though the lightning s scathe had rent In the swiftness of its wrath through the midnight firmament The darkly deepening clouds and the shadows dim and murky Of destiny are on me for my dinner s naught but turkey The chords upon my silent lute no soft vibrations know Save where the meanings of despair out breathings of my woe Tell of the cold and selfish world In melancholy mood The soul of genius chills with only fourteen cords of wood The dreams of the deserted float around my curtained hours And young imaginings are as the thorns bereft of flowers A wretched outcast from mankind my strength of heart has sank Beneath the evils of ten thousand dollars in the bank This life to me a desert is and kindness as the stream That singly drops upon the waste where burning breezes teem A banished blasted plant I droop to which no freshness lends Its healing balm for Heaven knows I ve but a dozen friends And Sorrow round my brow has wreathed its coronal of thorns No dewy pearl of Pleasure my sad sunken eyes adorns Calamity has clothed my thoughts I feel a bliss no more Alas my wardrobe now would only stock a clothing store The joyousness of Memory from me for aye hath fled It dwells within the dreary habitation of the dead I breathe my midnight melodies in languor and by stealth For Fate inflicts upon my frame the luxury of health Envy Neglect and Scorn have been my hard inheritance And a baneful curse clings to me like the stain on innocence My moments are as faded leaves or roses in their blight I m asked but once a day to dine to parties every night Would that I were a silver ray upon the moonlit air Or but one gleam that s glorified by each Peruvian s prayer My tortured spirit turns from earth to ease its bitter loathing My hatred is on all things here because I want for nothing THE GRAMMATICAL BOY BY BILL NYE Sometimes a sad homesick feeling comes over me when I compare the prevailing style of anecdote and school literature with the old McGuffey brand so well known thirty years ago To day our juvenile literature it seems to me is so transparent so easy to understand that I am not surprised to learn that the rising generation shows signs of lawlessness Boys to day do not use the respectful language and large luxuriant words that they did when mister McGuffey used to stand around and report their conversations for his justly celebrated school reader It is disagreeable to think of but it is none the less true and for one I think we should face the facts I ask the careful student of school literature to compare the following selection which I have written myself with great care and arranged with special reference to the matter of choice and difficult words with the flippant and commonplace terms used in the average school book of to day One day as George Pillgarlic was going to his tasks and while passing through the wood he spied a tall man approaching in an opposite direction along the highway Ah thought George in a low mellow tone of voice whom have we here Good morning my fine fellow exclaimed the stranger pleasantly Do you reside in this locality Indeed I do retorted George cheerily doffing his cap In yonder cottage near the glen my widowed mother and her thirteen children dwell with me And is your father dead exclaimed the man with a rising inflection Extremely so murmured the lad and oh sir that is why my poor mother is a widow And how did your papa die asked the man as he thoughtfully stood on the other foot a while Alas sir said George as a large hot tear stole down his pale cheek and fell with a loud report on the warty surface of his bare foot he was lost at sea in a bitter gale The good ship foundered two years ago last Christmastide and father was foundered at the same time No one knew of the loss of the ship and that the crew was drowned until the next spring and it was then too late And what is your age my fine fellow quoth the stranger If I live till next October said the boy in a declamatory tone of voice suitable for a Second Reader I will be seven years of age And who provides for your mother and her large family of children queried the man Indeed I do sir replied George in a shrill tone I toil oh so hard sir for we are very very poor and since my elder sister Ann was married and brought her husband home to live with us I have to toil more assiduously than heretofore And by what means do you obtain a livelihood exclaimed the man in slowly measured and grammatical words By digging wells kind sir replied George picking up a tired ant as he spoke and stroking it on the back I have a good education and so I am able to dig wells as well as a man I do this day times and take in washing at night In this way I am enabled barely to maintain our family in a precarious manner but oh sir should my other sisters marry I fear that some of my brothers in law would have to suffer And do you not fear the deadly fire damp asked the stranger in an earnest tone Not by a damp sight answered George with a low gurgling laugh for he was a great wag You are indeed a brave lad exclaimed the stranger as he repressed a smile And do you not at times become very weary and wish for other ways of passing your time Indeed I do sir said the lad I would fain run and romp and be gay like other boys but I must engage in constant manual exercise or we will have no bread to eat and I have not seen a pie since papa perished in the moist and moaning sea And what if I were to tell you that your papa did not perish at sea but was saved from a humid grave asked the stranger in pleasing tones Ah sir exclaimed George in a genteel manner again doffing his cap I am too polite to tell you what I would say and besides sir you are much larger than I am But my brave lad said the man in low musical tones do you not know me Georgie Oh George I must say replied George that you have the advantage of me Whilst I may have met you before I can not at this moment place you sir My son oh my son murmured the man at the same time taking a large strawberry mark out of his valise and showing it to the lad Do you not recognize your parent on your father s side When our good ship went to the bottom all perished save me I swam several miles through the billows and at last utterly exhausted gave up all hope of life Suddenly I stepped on something hard It was the United States And now my brave boy exclaimed the man with great glee see what I have brought for you It was but the work of a moment to unclasp from a shawl strap which he held in his hand and present to George s astonished gaze a large forty cent watermelon which until now had been concealed by the shawl strap SIMPLE ENGLISH BY RAY CLARKE ROSE Ofttimes when I put on my gloves I wonder if I m sane For when I put the right one on The right seems to remain To be put on that is tis left Yet if the left I don The other one is left and then I have the right one on But still I have the left on right The right one though is left To go right on the left right hand All right if I am deft PARTINGTONIAN PATCHWORK BY B P SHILLABER VII Are you in favor of the prohibitive law or the license law asked her opposite neighbor of the relict of P P corporal of the Bloody Leventh She carefully weighed the question as though she were selling snuff and answered Sometimes I think I am and then again I think I am not Her neighbor was perplexed and repeated the question varying it a little Have you seen the missus Partington Twilight Soap she asked Yes was the reply everybody has seen that but why Because said the dame it has two sides to it and it is hard to choose between them Now here are my two neighbors contagious to me on both sides one goes for probation t other for licentiousness and I think the best thing for me is to keep nuisance She meant neutral of course The neighbor admired and smiled while Ike lay on the floor with his legs in the air trying to balance missus Partington s fancy waiter on his toe IX Christmas Ike was made the happy possessor of a fiddle which he found in the morning near his stocking Has he got a musical bent Banfield asked of whom missus Partington was buying the instrument Bent indeed said she no he s as straight as an error He explained by repeating the question regarding his musical inclination Yes she replied he s dreadfully inclined to music since he had a drum and I want the fiddle to see if I can t make another Pickaninny or an Old Bull of him Jews harps is simple though I can t see how King David played on one of em and sung his psalms at the same time but the fiddle is best because genius can show itself plainer on it without much noise Some prefers a violeen but I don t know The fiddle was well improved till the horsehair all pulled out of the bow and it was then twisted up into a fish line XVI How limpid you walk said a voice behind us as we were making a hundred and fifty horse power effort to reach a table whereon reposed a volume of Bacon What is the cause of your lameness It was missus Partington s voice that spoke and missus Partington s eyes that met the glance we returned over our left shoulder Gout said we briefly almost surlily Dear me said she you are highly flavored It was only rich people and epicacs in living that had the gout in olden times Ah we growled partly in response and partly with an infernal twinge Poor soul she continued with commiseration like an anodyne in the tones of her voice the best remedy I know for it is an embarkation of Roman wormwood and lobelia for the part infected though some say a cranberry poultice is best but I believe the cranberries is for erisipilis and whether either of em is a rostrum for the gout or not I really don t know If it was a fraction of the arm I could jest know what to subscribe We looked into her eye with a determination to say something severely bitter because we felt allopathic just then but the kind and sympathizing look that met our own disarmed severity and sinking into a seat with our coveted Bacon we thanked her It was very evident all the while that she or they stayed that Ike was seeing how near he could come to our lame member and not touch it He did touch it sometimes but those didn t count XX I ve always noticed said missus Partington on New Year s Day dropping her voice to the key that people adopt when they are disposed to be philosophical or moral I ve always noticed that every year added to a man s life is apt to make him older just as a man who goes a journey finds as he jogs on that every mile he goes brings him nearer where he is going and farther from where he started I am not so young as I was once and I don t believe I shall ever be if I live to the age of Samson which Heaven knows as well as I do I don t want to for I wouldn t be a centurion or an octagon and survive my factories and become idiomatic by any means But then there is no knowing how a thing will turn out till it takes place and we shall come to an end some day though we may never live to see it There was a smart tap on the looking glass that hung upon the wall followed instantly by another Gracious said she what s that I hope the glass isn t fractioned for it is a sure sign of calamity and mercy knows they come along full fast enough without helping em by breaking looking glasses There was another tap and she caught sight of a white bean that fell on the floor and there reflected in the glass was the face of Ike who was blowing beans at the mirror through a crack in the door XXI As for the Chinese question said missus Partington reflectively holding her spoon at present while the vapor of her cup of tea curled about her face which shone through it like the moon through a mist it is a great pity that somebody don t answer it though who under the canister of heaven can do it with sich letters as they have on their tea chists is more than I can tell It is really too bad though that some lingister doesn t try it and not have this provoking question asked all the time as if we were ignoramuses and did not know Toolong from No Strong and there never was sich a thing as the seventh commandment which Heaven knows suits this case to a T and I hope the breakers of it may escape but I don t see how they can The question must be answered unless it is like a cannondrum to be given up which nobody of any spirit should do She brought the spoon down into the cup and looked out through the windows of her soul into celestial fields peopled with pig tails that were all in her eye while Ike took a double charge of sugar for his tea and gave an extra allowance of milk to the kitten THE MENAGERIE BY WILLIAM VAUGHN MOODY Thank God my brain is not inclined to cut Such capers every day I m just about Mellow but then There goes the tent flap shut Rain s in the wind I thought so every snout Was twitching when the keeper turned me out That screaming parrot makes my blood run cold Gabriel s trump the big bull elephant Squeals Rain to the parched herd The monkeys scold And jabber that it s rain water they want It makes me sick to see a monkey pant I ll foot it home to try and make believe I m sober After this I stick to beer And drop the circus when the sane folks leave A man s a fool to look at things too near They look back and begin to cut up queer Beasts do at any rate especially Wild devils caged They have the coolest way Of being something else than what you see You pass a sleek young zebra nosing hay A nylghau looking bored and distingue And think you ve seen a donkey and a bird Not on your life Just glance back if you dare The zebra chews the nylghau hasn t stirred But something s happened Heaven knows what or where To freeze your scalp and pompadour your hair I m not precisely an aeolian lute Hung in the wandering winds of sentiment But drown me if the ugliest meanest brute Grunting and fretting in that sultry tent Didn t just floor me with embarrassment Twas like a thunder clap from out the clear One minute they were circus beasts some grand Some ugly some amusing and some queer Rival attractions to the hobo band The flying jenny and the peanut stand Next minute they were old hearth mates of mine Lost people eyeing me with such a stare Patient satiric devilish divine A gaze of hopeless envy squalid care Hatred and thwarted love and dim despair Within my blood my ancient kindred spoke Grotesque and monstrous voices heard afar Down ocean caves when behemoth awoke Or through fern forests roared the plesiosaur Locked with the giant bat in ghastly war And suddenly as in a flash of light I saw great Nature working out her plan Through all her shapes from mastodon to mite Forever groping testing passing on To find at last the shape and soul of Man Till in the fullness of accomplished time Comes brother Forepaugh upon business bent Tracks her through frozen and through torrid clime And shows us neatly labeled in a tent The stages of her huge experiment Babbling aloud her shy and reticent hours Dragging to light her blinking slothful moods Publishing fretful seasons when her powers Worked wild and sullen in her solitudes Or when her mordant laughter shook the woods Here round about me were her vagrant births Sick dreams she had fierce projects she essayed Her qualms her fiery prides her craze mirths The troublings of her spirit as she strayed Cringed gloated mocked was lordly was afraid On that long road she went to seek mankind Here were the darkling coverts that she beat To find the Hider she was sent to find Here the distracted footprints of her feet Whereby her soul s Desire she came to greet But why should they her botch work turn about And stare disdain at me her finished job Why was the place one vast suspended shout Of laughter Why did all the daylight throb With soundless guffaw and dumb stricken sob Helpless I stood among those awful cages The beasts were walking loose and I was bagged I I last product of the toiling ages Goal of heroic feet that never lagged A little man in trousers slightly jagged Deliver me from such another jury The Judgment day will be a picnic to t Their satire was more dreadful than their fury And worst of all was just a kind of brute Disgust and giving up and sinking mute Survival of the fittest adaptation And all their other evolution terms Seem to omit one small consideration To wit that tumblebugs and angleworms Have souls there s soul in everything that squirms And souls are restless plagued impatient things All dream and unaccountable desire Crawling but pestered with the thought of wings Spreading through every inch of earth s old mire Mystical hanker after something higher Wishes are horses as I understand I guess a wistful polyp that has strokes Of feeling faint to gallivant on land Will come to be a scandal to his folk Legs he will sprout in spite of threats and jokes And at the core of every life that crawls Or runs or flies or swims or vegetates Churning the mammoth s heart blood in the galls Of shark and tiger planting gorgeous hates Lighting the love of eagles for their mates Yes in the dim brain of the jellied fish That is and is not living moved and stirred From the beginning a mysterious wish A vision a command a fatal Word The name of Man was uttered and they heard Upward along the aeons of old war They sought him wing and shank bone claw and bill Were fashioned and rejected wide and far They roamed the twilight jungles of their will But still they sought him and desired him still Man they desired but mind you Perfect Man The radiant and the loving yet to be I hardly wonder when they come to scan The upshot of their strenuosity They gazed with mixed emotions upon me Well my advice to you is Face the creatures Or spot them sideways with your weather eye Just to keep tab on their expansive features It isn t pleasant when you re stepping high To catch a giraffe smiling on the sly If Nature made you graceful don t get gay Back to before the hippopotamus If meek and godly find some place to play Besides right where three mad hyenas fuss You may hear language that we won t discuss If you re a sweet thing in a flower bed hat Or her best fellow with your tie tucked in Don t squander love s bright springtime girding at An old chimpanzee with an Irish chin There may be hidden meaning in his grin DOWN AROUND THE RIVER BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY Noon time and June time down around the river Have to furse with Lizey Ann but lawzy I fergive her Drives me off the place

Galileo was born at Pisa on the fourteenth day of February fifteen sixty four He was the man who discovered some of the fundamental principles governing the movements habits and personal peculiarities of the earth He discovered things with marvelous fluency Born as he was at a time when the rotary motion of the earth was still in its infancy and astronomy was taught only in a crude way Galileo started in to make a few discoveries and advance some theories which he loved He was the son of a musician and learned to play several instruments himself but not in such a way as to arouse the jealousy of the great musicians of his day They came and heard him play a few selections and then they went home contented with their own music Galileo played for several years in a band at Pisa and people who heard him said that his manner of gazing out over the Pisan hills with a far away look in his eye after playing a selection while he gently up ended his alto horn and worked the mud valve as he poured out about a pint of moist melody that had accumulated in the flues of the instrument was simply grand At the age of twenty Galileo began to discover His first discoveries were of course clumsy and poorly made but very soon he commenced to turn out neat and durable discoveries that would stand for years It was at this time that he noticed the swinging of a lamp in a church and observing that the oscillations were of equal duration he inferred that this principle might be utilized in the exact measurement of time From this little accident years after came the clock one of the most useful of man s dumb friends And yet there are people who will read this little incident and still hesitate about going to church Galileo also invented the thermometer the microscope and the proportional compass He seemed to invent things not for the money to be obtained in that way but solely for the joy of being first on the ground He was a man of infinite genius and perseverance He was also very fair in his treatment of other inventors Though he did not personally invent the rotary motion of the earth he heartily indorsed it and said it was a good thing He also came out in a card in which he said that he believed it to be a good thing and that he hoped some day to see it applied to the other planets He was also the inventor of a telescope that had a magnifying power of thirty times He presented this to the Venetian senate and it was used in making appropriations for river and harbor improvements By telescopic investigation Galileo discovered the presence of microbes in the moon but was unable to do anything for it I have spoken of mister Galileo informally calling him by his first name all the way through this article for I feel so thoroughly acquainted with him though there was such a striking difference in our ages that I think I am justified in using his given name while talking of him Galileo also sat up nights and visited with Venus through a long telescope which he had made himself from an old bamboo fishing rod But astronomy is a very enervating branch of science Galileo frequently came down to breakfast with red heavy eyes eyes that were swollen full of unshed tears Still he persevered Day after day he worked and toiled Year after year he went on with his task till he had worked out in his own mind the satellites of Jupiter and placed a small tin tag on each one so that he would know it readily when he saw it again Then he began to look up Saturn s rings and investigate the freckles on the sun He did not stop at trifles but went bravely on till everybody came for miles to look at him and get him to write something funny in their autograph albums It was not an unusual thing for Galileo to get up in the morning after a wearisome night with a fretful new born star to find his front yard full of albums Some of them were little red albums with floral decorations on them while others were the large plush and alligator albums of the affluent Some were new and had the price mark still on them while others were old foundered albums with a droop in the back and little flecks of egg and gravy on the title page All came with a request for Galileo to write a little witty characteristic sentiment in them Galileo was the author of the hydrostatic paradox and other sketches He was a great reader and a fluent penman One time he was absent from home lecturing in Venice for the benefit of the United Aggregation of Mutual Admirers and did not return for two weeks so that when he got back he found the front room full of autograph albums It is said that he then demonstrated his great fluency and readiness as a thinker and writer He waded through the entire lot in two days with only two men from West Pisa to assist him Galileo came out of it fresh and youthful and all of the following night he was closeted with another inventor a wicker covered microscope and a bologna sausage The investigations were carried on for two weeks after which Galileo went out to the inebriate asylum and discovered some new styles of reptiles Galileo was the author of a little work called I Discarsi e Dimas Trazioni Matematiche Intorus a Due Muove Scienze It was a neat little book of about the medium height and sold well on the trains for the Pisan newsboys on the cars were very affable as they are now and when they came and leaned an armful of these books on a passenger s leg and poured into his ear a long tale about the wonderful beauty of the work and then pulled in the name of the book from the rear of the last car where it had been hanging on behind the passenger would most always buy it and enough of the name to wrap it up in He also discovered the isochronism of the pendulum He saw that the pendulum at certain seasons of the year looked yellow under the eyes and that it drooped and did not enter into its work with the old zest He began to study the case with the aid of his new bamboo telescope and a wicker covered microscope As a result in ten days he had the pendulum on its feet again Galileo was inclined to be liberal in his religious views more especially in the matter of the Scriptures claiming that there were passages in the Bible which did not literally mean what the translator said they did This was where Galileo missed it So long as he discovered stars and isochronisms and such things as that he succeeded but when he began to fool with other people s religious beliefs he got into trouble He was forced to fly from Pisa we are told by the historian and we are assured at the same time that Galileo who had always been far far ahead of all competitors in other things was equally successful as a fleer Galileo received but sixty scudi per year as his salary while at Pisa and a part of that he took in town orders worth only sixty cents on the scudi WANTED A COOK BY ALAN DALE There was a ring at the front door bell Letitia wrought up nervously clutched my arm For a moment a sort of paralysis seized me Then alertly as a young calf I bounded toward the door hope aroused and expectation keen It was rather dark in the outside hall and I could not quite perceive the nature of our visitor But I soon gladly realized that it was something feminine and as I held the door open a thin small soiled wisp of a woman glided in and smiled at me Talar ni svensk she asked but I had no idea what she meant She may have been impertinent or even rude or perhaps improper but she looked as though she might be a domestic and I led her gently reverently to Letitia in the drawing room I smiled back at her in a wild endeavor to be sympathetic I would have anointed her or bathed her feet or plied her with figs and dates or have done anything that any nationality craves as a welcome As the front door closed I heaved a sigh of relief Here was probably the quintessence of five advertisements Out of the mountain crept a mouse and quite a little mouse too Talar ni svensk proved to be nothing more outrageous than Do you speak Swedish My astute little wife discovered this intuitively I left them together my mental excuse being that women understand each other and that a man is unnecessary under the circumstances I had some misgivings on the subject of Letitia and svensk but the universal language of femininity is not without its uses I devoutly hoped that Letitia would be able to come to terms as the mere idea of a cook who couldn t excoriate us in English was at that moment delightful At the end of a quarter of an hour I strolled back to the drawing room Letitia was smiling and the hand maiden sat grim and uninspired I ve engaged her Archie said Letitia She knows nothing as she has told me in the few words of English that she has picked up but you remember what Aunt Julia said about a clean slate I gazed at the maiden and reflected that while the term slate might be perfectly correct the adjective seemed a bit over enthusiastic She was decidely soiled this quintessence of a quintette of advertisements I said nothing anxious not to dampen Letitia s elation She has no references continued my wife as she has never been out before She is just a simple little Stockholm girl I like her face immensely Archie immensely She is willing to begin at once which shows that she is eager and consequently likely to suit us Wait for me Archie while I take her to the kitchen Kom Gerda Exactly why Letitia couldn t say Come Gerda seemed strange She probably thought that Kom must be Swedish and that it sounded well She certainly invented Kom on the spur of the Scandinavian moment and I learned afterward that it was correct My inspired Letitia Still in spite of all my opinion is that Come Gerda would have done just as well Isn t it delightful cried Letitia when she joined me later I am really enthusiastic at the idea of a Swedish girl I adore Scandinavia Archie It always makes me think of Ibsen Perhaps Gerda Lyberg that s her name will be as interesting as Hedda Gabler and missus Alving and Nora and all those lovely complex Ibsen creatures They were Norwegians dear I said gently anxious not to shatter illusions the Ibsen plays deal with Christiania not with Stockholm But they are so near declared Letitia amiable and seraphic once more Somehow or other I invariably mix up Norway and Sweden and Denmark I know I shall always look upon Gerda as an Ibsen girl who has come here to live her life or work out her inheritance Perhaps dear she has some interesting internal disease or a maggoty brain Don t you think Archie that the Ibsen inheritances are always most fascinating A bit morbid but surely fascinating I prefer a healthy cook Letitia I said meditatively somebody willing to interest herself in our inheritance rather than in her own I don t mind what you say now she pouted I am not to be put down by clamor We really have a cook at last and I feel more lenient toward you Archie Of course I was only joking when I suggested the Ibsen diseases Gerda Lyberg may have inherited from her ancestors something quite nice and attractive Then you mustn t look upon her as Ibsen Letitia I protested The Ibsen people never inherit nice things Their ancestors always bequeath nasty ones That is where their consistency comes in They are receptacles for horrors Personally if you ll excuse my flippancy I prefer Norwegian anchovies to Norwegian heroines It is a mere matter of opinion I m ashamed of you retorted Letitia defiantly You talk like some of the wretchedly frivolous criticisms so called that men like Acton Davies and Alan Dale inflict upon the long suffering public They never amuse me Ibsen may make his heroines the recipients of ugly legacies but he has never yet cursed them with the odious incubus known as a sense of humor The people with a sense of humor have something in their brains worse than maggots We ll drop the subject Archie I m going to learn Swedish Before Gerda Lyberg has been with us a month I intend to be able to talk fluently It will be most useful Next time we go to Europe we ll take in Sweden and I ll do the piloting I am going to buy some Swedish books and study Won t it be jolly And just think how melancholy we were this morning you and I looking out of that window and trying to materialize cooks Wasn t it funny Archie What amusing experiences we shall be able to chronicle later on Letitia babbled on like half a dozen brooks and thinking up a gentle parody in the shape of cooks may come and men may go I decided to leave my household gods for the bread earning contest down town I could not feel quite as sanguine as Letitia who seemed to have forgotten the dismal results of the advertisement just one little puny Swedish result I should have preferred to make a choice Letitia was as pleased with Gerda Lyberg as though she had been a selection instead of a that or nothing If somebody had dramatized Gerda Lyberg s initial dinner it would probably have been considered exceedingly droll As a serious episode however its humor to my mind lacked spontaneity Letitia had asked her to cook us a little Swedish meal so that we could get some idea of Stockholm life in which for some reason or other we were supposed to be deeply interested Unfortunately I was extremely hungry and had carefully avoided luncheon in order to give my appetite a chance We sat down to a huge bowl of cold greasy soup in which enormous lumps of meat swam as though for their life awaiting rescue at the prongs of a fork In addition to this epicurean dish was a teeming plate of water soaked potatoes delicately boiled That was all Letitia said that it was Swedish and the most annoying part of the entertainment was that I was alone in my critical disapprobation Letitia was so engrossed with a little Swedish conversation book that she brought to table that she forgot the mere material question of food forgot everything but the horrible jargon she was studying and the soiled wisp like maiden who looked more unlike a clean slate than ever What shall I say to her Archie asked Letitia turning over the pages of her book as I tried to rescue a block of meat from the cold fat in which it lurked Here is a chapter on dinner I am very hungry Jag aer myckel hungrig Rather pretty isn t it Hark at this Kypare gif mig matsedeln och vinlistan That means Waiter give me the bill of fare and the list of wines Don t I cried don t This woman doesn t know what dining means Look out a chapter on feeding Letitia was perfectly unruffled She paid no attention to me whatsoever She was fascinated with the slovenly girl who stood around and gaped at her Swedish Gerda said Letitia with her eyes on the book Gif mir apven senap och naegra potaeter And then as Miss Lyberg dived for the drowned potatoes Letitia exclaimed in an ecstasy of joy She understands Archie she understands I feel I am going to be a great success Jag tackar Gerda That means I thank you Jag tackar See if you can say it Archie Just try dear to oblige me Jag tackar Now that s a good boy jag tackar I won t I declared spitefully No jag tackar ing for a parody like this Letitia You don t seem to realize that I m hungry Honestly I prefer a delicatessen dinner to this Pray give me a piece of venison read Letitia absolutely disregarding my mood Var god och gif mig ett stycke vildt It is almost intelligible isn t it dear Ni aeter icke you do not eat I can t I asserted mournfully anxious to gain Letitia s sympathy It was not forthcoming Letitia s eyes were fastened on Gerda and I could not help noting on the woman s face an expression of scorn I felt certain of it She appeared to regard my wife as a sort of irresponsible freak and I was vexed to think that Letitia should make such an exhibition of herself and countenance the alleged meal that was set before us I have really dined very well she continued joyously Jag har verkligen atit mycket bra If you are quite sure that she doesn t understand English Letitia I said viciously I ll say to you that this is a kind of joke I don t appreciate I won t keep such a woman in the house Let us put on our things and go out and have dinner Better late than never Letitia was turning over the pages of her book quite lost to her surroundings As I concluded my remarks she looked up and exclaimed How very funny Archie Just as you said Better late than never I came across that very phrase in the list of Swedish proverbs It must be telepathy dear Better late than never Battre sent aen aldrig What were you saying on the subject dear Will you repeat it And do try it in Swedish Say Battre sent aen aldrig Letitia I shot forth in a fury I m not in the humor for this sort of thing I think this dinner and this woman are rotten See if you can find the word rotten in Swedish I am surprised at you Letitia declared glacially roused from her book by my heroic though unparliamentary language Your expressions are neither English nor Swedish Please don t use such gutter words before a servant to say nothing of your own wife But she doesn t understand I protested glancing at Miss Lyberg I could have sworn that I detected a gleam in the woman s eyes and that the sphinx like attitude of dull incomprehensibility suggested a strenuous effort She doesn t understand anything She doesn t want to understand In a week from now said Letitia she will understand everything perfectly for I shall be able to talk with her Oh Archie do be agreeable Can t you see that I am having great fun Don t be such a greedy boy If you could only enter into the spirit of the thing you wouldn t be so oppressed by the food question Oh dear How important it does seem to be to men Gerda hur gammal aer ni The maiden sullenly left the room and I felt convinced that Letitia had Swedishly asked her to do so I was wrong Hur gammal aer ni Letitia explained simply meant How old are you She evidently didn t want to tell me was my wife s comment as we went to the drawing room I imagine dear that she doesn t quite like the idea of my ferreting out Swedish so persistently But I intend to persevere The worst of conversation books is that one acquires a language in such a parroty way Now in my book the only answer to the question How old are you is I was born on the tenth of August eighteen fifty two For the life of me I couldn t vary that and it would be most embarrassing It would make me fifty two If any one asked me in Swedish how old I was I should have to be fifty two When I think of my five advertisements I said lugubriously as I threw myself into an arm chair fatigued at my efforts to discover dinner when I remember our expectation and the pleasant anticipations of to day I feel very bitter Letitia Just to think that from it all nothing has resulted but that beastly mummy that atrocious ossified thing Archie Archie said my wife warningly please be calm Perhaps I was too engrossed with my studies to note the deficiencies of dinner But do remember that I pleaded with her for a Swedish meal The poor thing did what I asked her to do Our dinner was evidently Swedish It was not her fault that I asked for it To morrow dear it shall be different We had better stick to the American regime It is more satisfactory to you At any rate we have somebody in the house and if our five advertisements had brought forth five hundred applicants we should only have kept one So don t torture yourself Archie Try and imagine that we had five hundred applicants and that we selected Gerda Lyberg I can t Letitia I said sulkily and I heaved a heavy sigh Come she said soothingly come and study Swedish with me It will be most useful for your Lives of Great Men You can read up the Swedes in the original I ll entertain you with this book and you ll forget all about missus Potz I mean Gerda Lyberg By the by Archie she doesn t remind me so much of Hedda Gabler I don t fancy that she is very subtile You Letitia I retorted remind me of missus Nickleby You ramble on so Letitia looked offended She always declared that Dickens got on her nerves She was one of the new fashioned readers who have learned to despise Dickens Personally I regretted only his nauseating sense of humor Letitia placed a cushion behind my head smoothed my forehead kissed me made her peace and settled down by my side Lack of nourishment made me drowsy and Letitia s babblings sounded vague and muffled It is a most inclusive little book she said and if I can succeed in memorizing it all I shall be quite at home with the language In fact dear I think I shall always keep Swedish cooks Hark at this If the wind be favorable we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours Om vinden aer god sa aero vi pa pyrtio timmar i Goteborg I think it is sweetly pretty You are seasick Steward bring me a glass of brandy and water We are now entering the harbor We are now anchoring Your passports gentlemen A comfortable lethargy was stealing o er me Letitia took a pencil and paper and made notes as she plied the book A chapter on seeing a town is most interesting Archie Of course it must be a Swedish town Do you know the two private galleries of mister Smith the merchant and mister Muller the chancellor To morrow morning I wish to see all the public buildings and statues Statyerna is Swedish for statues Archie Are you listening dear We will visit the Church of the Holy Ghost at two then we will make an excursion on Lake Maelan and see the fortress of Vaxholm It is a charming little book Don t you think that it is a great improvement on the old Ollendorff system I don t find nonsensical sentences like The hat of my aunt s sister is blue but the nose of my brother in law s sister in law is red I rose and stretched myself Letitia was still plunged in the irritating guide to Sweden where I vowed I would never go Nothing on earth should ever induce me to visit Sweden If it came to a choice between Hoboken and Stockholm I mentally determined to select the former As I paced the room I heard a curious splashing noise in the kitchen Letitia s studies must have dulled her ears She was evidently too deeply engrossed I strolled nonchalantly into the hall and proceeded deliberately toward the kitchen The thick carpet deadened my footsteps The splashing noise grew louder The kitchen door was closed I gently opened it As I did so a wild scream rent the air There stood Gerda Lyberg in in my pen declines to write it a simple unsophisticated birthday dress taking an ingenuous reluctant bath in the stationary tubs with the plates and dishes and dinner things grouped artistically around her The instant she saw me she modestly seized a dish towel and shouted at the top of her voice The kitchen was filled with the steam from the hot water Venus arising looked nebulous and mystic I beat a hasty retreat aghast at the revelation and almost fell against Letitia who dropping her conversation book came to see what had happened She s bathing I gasped in the kitchen among the plates near the soup Never cried Letitia Then melodramatically Let me pass Stand aside Archie I ll go and see Perhaps perhaps you had better come with me Letitia I gurgled I m shocked She has nothing on but a dish towel Letitia paused irresolutely for a second and going into the kitchen shut the door The splashing noise ceased I heard the sound of voices or rather of a voice Letitia s Evidently she had forgotten Swedish and such remarks as If the wind be favorable we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours I listened attentively and could not even hear her say We will visit the Church of the Holy Ghost at two It is strange how the stress of circumstances alters the complexion of a conversation book All the evening she had studied Swedish and yet suddenly confronted by a Swedish lady bathing in our kitchen dish toweled but unashamed all she could find to say was How disgusting and How disgraceful in English You see said Letitia when she emerged she is just a simple peasant girl and only needs to be told It is very horrid of course And unappetizing I chimed in Of course certainly unappetizing I couldn t think of anything Swedish to say but I said several things in English She was dreadfully sorry that you had seen her and never contemplated such a possibility After all Archie bathing is not a crime And we were hunting for a clean slate I suggested satirically Do you think Letitia that she also takes a cold bath in the morning among the bacon and eggs and things That is enough said Letitia sternly The episode need not serve as an excuse for indelicacy It was with the advent of Gerda Lyberg that we became absolutely certain beyond the peradventure of any doubt that there was such a thing as the servant question The knowledge had been gradually wafted in upon us but it was not until the lady from Stockholm had definitively planted herself in our midst that we admitted to ourselves openly unblushingly that the problem existed Gerda blazoned forth the enigma in all its force and defiance The remarkable thing about our latest acquisition was the singularly blank state of her gastronomic mind There was nothing that she knew Most women and a great many men intuitively recognize the physical fact that water at a certain temperature boils Miss Lyberg apparently seeking to earn her living in the kitchen had no certain views as to when the boiling point was reached Rumors seemed vaguely to have reached her that things called eggs dropped into water would in the course of time any time and generally less than a week become eatable Letitia bought a little egg boiler for her one of those antique arrangements in which the sands of time play to the soft boiled egg The maiden promptly boiled it with the eggs and undoubtedly thought that the hen in a moment of perturbation or aberration had laid it I say thought because it is the only term I can use It is perhaps inappropriate in connection with Gerda Potatoes subjected to the action of hot water grow soft She was certain of that Whether she tested them with the poker or with her hands or feet we never knew I inclined to the last suggestion The situation was quite marvelous Here was an alleged worker in a particular field asking the wages of skilled labor and densely ignorant of every detail connected with her task It seemed unique Carpenters plumbers bricklayers seamstresses dressmakers laundresses all the sowers and reapers in the little garden of our daily needs were forced by the inexorable law of competition to possess some inkling of the significance of their undertakings With the cook it was different She could step jubilantly into any kitchen without the slightest idea of what she was expected to do there If she knew that water was wet and that fire was hot she felt amply primed to demand a salary Impelled by her craving for Swedish literature Letitia struggled with Miss Lyberg Compared with the Swede my exquisitely ignorant wife was a culinary queen She was an epicurean caterer Letitia s slate pencil coffee was ambrosia for the gods sweetest nectar by the side of the dishwater that cook prepared I began to feel quite proud of her She grew to be an adept in the art of boiling water If we could have lived on that fluid everything would have moved clockworkily I ve discovered one thing said Letitia on the evening of the third day The girl is just a peasant probably a worker in the fields That is why she is so ignorant I thought this reasoning foolish Even peasants eat my dear I muttered She must have seen somebody cook something Field workers have good appetites If this woman ever ate what did she eat and why can t we have the same We have asked her for no luxuries We have arrived at the stage my poor girl when all we need is prosaically to fill up You have given her opportunities to offer us samples of peasant food The result has been nil It is odd Letitia declared a wrinkle of perplexity appearing in the smooth surface of her forehead Of course she says she doesn t understand me And yet Archie I have talked to her in pure Swedish I suppose you said Pray give me a piece of venison from the conversation book Don t be ridiculous Archie I know the Swedish for cauliflower green peas spinach a leg of mutton mustard roast meat soup and If the wind be favorable we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours I interrupted She was silent and I went on It seems a pity to end your studies in Swedish Letitia but fascinating though they be they do not really necessitate our keeping this barbarian You can always pursue them and exercise on me I don t mind Even with an American cook if such a being exist you could still continue to ask for venison steak in Swedish and to look forward to arriving at Gothenburg in forty hours Letitia declined to argue My mood was that known as cranky We were in the drawing room after what we were compelled to call dinner It had consisted of steak burned to cinders potatoes soaked to a pulp and a rice pudding that looked like a poultice the morning after and possibly tasted like one Letitia had been shopping and was therefore unable to supervise Our delicate repast was capped by black coffee of an indefinite straw color and with globules of grease on the surface People who can feel elated with the joy of living after a dinner of this description are assuredly both mentally and morally lacking Men and women there are who will say Oh give me anything I m not particular so long as it is plain and wholesome I ve met many of these people My experience of them is that they are the greatest gluttons on earth with veritably voracious appetites and that the best isn t good enough for them To be sure at a pinch they will demolish a score of potatoes if there be nothing else but offer them caviare canvas back duck quail and nesselrode pudding and they will look askance at food that is plain and wholesome The plain and wholesome liver is a snare and a delusion like the bluff and genial visitor whose geniality veils all sorts of satire and merciless comment Letitia and I both felt weak and miserable We had made up our minds not to dine out We were resolved to keep the home up even if in return the home kept us down Give in we wouldn t Our fighting blood was up We firmly determined not to degenerate into that clammy American institution the boarding house feeder and the restaurant diner We knew the type in the feminine it sits at table with its bonnet on and a sullen gnawing expression of animal hunger in the masculine it puts its own knife in the butter and uses a toothpick No cook no lack of cook should drive us to these abysmal depths Letitia made no feint at Ovid I simply declined to breathe the breath of The Lives of Great Men She read a sweet little classic called The Table How to Buy Food How to Cook It and How to Serve It by Alessandro Filippini a delightful table d hote y name I lay back in my chair and frowned waiting until Letitia chose to break the silence As she was a most chattily inclined person on all occasions I reasoned that I should not have to wait long I was right Archie said she according to this book there is no place in the civilized world that contains so large a number of so called high livers as New York City which was educated by the famous Delmonico and his able lieutenants Great Heaven I exclaimed with a groan why rub it in Letitia I should also say that no city in the world contained so large a number of low livers Westward the course of Empire sways she read and the great glory of the past has departed from those centers where the culinary art at one time defied all rivals The scepter of supremacy has passed into the hands of the metropolis of the New World What sickening cant I cried What fiendishly exaggerated restaurant talk There are perhaps fifty fine restaurants in New York In Paris there are five hundred finer Here we have places to eat in there they have artistic resorts to dine in One can dine anywhere in Paris In New York save for those fifty fine restaurants one feeds Don t read any more of your cook book to me my girl It is written to catch the American trade with the subtile pen of flattery Try and be patriotic dear she said soothingly Of course I know you wouldn t allow a Frenchman to say all that and that you are just talking cussedly with your own wife A ring at the bell caused a diversion We hailed it We were in the humor to hail anything The domestic hearth was most trying We were bored to death I sprang up and ran to the door a little pastime to which I was growing accustomed Three tittering young women each wearing a hat in which roses violets poppies cornflowers forget me nots feathers and ribbons ran riot confronted me Miss Gerda Lyberg said the foremost who wore a bright red gown and from whose hat six spiteful poppies lurched forward and almost hit me in the face For a moment dazed from the cook book I was nonplussed All I could say was No meaning that I wasn t Miss Gerda Lyberg I felt so sure that I wasn t that I was about to close the door She lives here I believe asserted the damsel again shooting forth the poppies I came to myself with an effort She is the the cook I muttered weakly We are her friends quoth the damsel an indignant inflection in her voice Kindly let us in We ve come to the Thursday sociable The three bedizened ladies entered without further parley and went toward the kitchen instinctively recognizing its direction I was amazed I heard a noisy greeting a peal of laughter a confusion of tongues and then I groped my way back to Letitia They ve come to the Thursday sociable I cried Who she asked in astonishment and I imparted to her the full extent of my knowledge Letitia took it very nicely She had always heard she said in fact missus Archer had told her that Thursday nights were festival occasions with the Swedes She thought it rather a pleasant and convivial notion Servants must enjoy themselves after all Better a happy gathering of girls than a rowdy collection of men Letitia thought the idea felicitous She had no objections to giving privileges to a cook Nor had I for the matter of that I ventured to remark however that Gerda didn t seem to be a cook Then let us call her a girl said Letitia Gerda is a girl only because she isn t a boy I remarked tauntingly If by girl you even mean servant then Gerda isn t a girl Goodness knows what she is Hello Another ring This time Miss Lyberg herself went to the door and we listened More arrivals for the sociable four Swedish guests all equally gaily attired in flower hats Some of them wore bangles the noise of which in the hall sounded like an infuriation of sleigh bells They were Christina and Sophie and Sadie and Alexandra as we soon learned It was wonderful how welcome Gerda made them and how quickly they were at home They rustled through the halls chatting and laughing and humming Such merry girls Such light hearted little charmers Letitia stood looking at them through the crack of the drawing room door Perhaps it was just as well that somebody should have a good time in our house Just the same Letitia I observed galled I think I should say to morrow that this invasion is most impertinent most uncalled for Yes Archie said Letitia demurely you think you should say it But please don t think I shall for I assure you that I shan t I suppose that we must discharge her She can t do anything and she doesn t want to learn I don t blame her She can always get the wages she asks by doing nothing You would pursue a similar policy Archie if it were possible Everybody would But all other laborers must know how to labor I was glad to hear Letitia echoing my sentiments She was quite unconsciously plagiarizing Once again she took up the cook book The sound of merrymaking in the kitchen drifted in upon us From what we could gather Gerda seemed to be dressing up for the delectation of her guests Shrieks of laughter and clapping of hands made us wince My nerves were on edge Had any one at that moment dared to suggest that there was even a suspicion of humor in these proceedings I should have slain him without compunction Letitia was less irate and tried to comfort me Letitia sighed and shut up the cook book Eggs a la reine seemed as difficult as trigonometry or conic sections or differential calculus and much more expensive Certainly the eight giggling cooks in the kitchen now at the very height of their exhilaration worried themselves little about such concoctions My nerves again began to play pranks The devilish pandemonium infuriated me Letitia was tired and wanted to go to bed I was tired and hungry and disillusioned It was close upon midnight and the Swedish Thursday was about over I thought it unwise to allow them even an initial minute of Friday When the clock struck twelve I marched majestically to the kitchen threw open the door revealed the octette in the enjoyment of a mound of ice cream and a mountain of cake that in my famished condition made my mouth water and announced in a severe yet subdued tone that the revel must cease You must go at once I said I am going to shut up the house Then I withdrew and waited There was a delay during which a Babel of tongues was let loose and then Miss Lyberg s seven guests were heard noisily leaving the house Two minutes later there was a knock at our door and Miss Lyberg appeared her eyes blazing her face flushed and the expression of the hunted antelope defiantly asserting that it would never be brought to bay on her perspiring features You ve insulted my guests she cried in English as good as my own I ve had to turn them out of the house and I ve had about enough of this place Letitia s face was a psychological study Amazement consternation humiliation all seemed determined to possess her Here was the obtuse Swede for whose dear sake she had dallied with the intricacies of the language of Stockholm furiously familiar with admirable English The dense dumb Scandinavian the lady of the me no understand rejoinder apparently had the gift of tongues Letitia trembled Rarely have I seen her so thoroughly perturbed Yet seemingly she was unwilling to credit the testimony of her own ears for with sudden energy she confronted Miss Lyberg and exclaimed imperiously in Swedish that was either pure or impure Tig Ga din vaeg Ah come off cried the handmaiden insolently I understand English I haven t been in this country fifteen years for nothing It s just on account of folks like you that poor hard working girls who ain t allowed to take no baths or entertain no lady friends have to protect themselves Pretend not to understand them says I I ve found it worked before this If they think you don t understand em they ll let you alone and stop worriting It s like your impidence to turn my lady friends out of this flat It s like your impidence I ll Letitia s crestfallen look following upon her perturbation completely upset me A wave of indignation swamped me I advanced and in another minute Miss Gerda Lyberg would have found herself in the hall impelled there by a persuasive hand upon her shoulder However it was not to be You just lay a hand on me she said with cold deliberation and a smile and I ll have you arrested for assault Oh I know the law I haven t been in this country fifteen years for nothing The law looks after poor weak Swedish girls Just push me out It s all I ask Just you push me out She edged up to me defiantly My blood boiled I would have mortgaged the prospects of my Lives of Great Men not that they were worth mortgaging for the exquisite satisfaction of confounding this abominable woman Then I saw the peril of the situation I thought of horrid headliners in the papers Author charged with abusing servant girl or Arrest of Archibald Fairfax on serious charge and my mood changed I understood you all the time continued Miss Lyberg insultingly I listened to you I knew what you thought of me Now I m telling you what I think of you The idea of turning out my lady friends on a Thursday night too And me a slaving for them and a bathing for them and a treating them to ice cream and cake and in me own kitchen You ain t no lady As for you I seemed to be her particular pet when I sees a man around the house all the time a molly coddling and a fussing I says to myself he ain t much good if he can t trust the women folk alone We stood there like dummies listening to the tirade What could we do To be sure there were two of us and we were in our own house The antagonist however was a servant not in her own house The situation for reasons that it is impossible to define was hers She knew it too We allowed her full sway because we couldn t help it The sympathy of the public in case of violent measures would not have been on our side The poor domestic oppressed and enslaved would have appealed to any jury of married men living luxuriously in cheap boarding houses When she left us as she did when she was completely ready to do so Letitia began to cry The sight of her tears unnerved me and I checked a most unfeeling remark that I intended to make to the effect that if the wind be favorable we shall be at Gothenburg in forty hours It s not that I mind her insolence she sobbed we were going to send her off anyway weren t we But it s so humiliating to be done We ve been done Here have I been working hard at Swedish writing exercises learning verbs studying proverbs just to talk to a woman who speaks English as well as I do It s it s so so mor mortifying Never mind dear I said drying her eyes for her the Swedish will come in handy some day No she declared vehemently don t say that you ll take me to Sweden I wouldn t go to the hateful country It s a hideous language anyway isn t it Archie It is a nasty laconic ugly tongue You heard me say Tig to her just now Tig means be silent Could anything sound more repulsive Tig Tig Ugh Letitia stamped her foot She was exceeding wroth SIMILAR CASES BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN There was once a little animal No bigger than a fox And on five toes he scampered Over Tertiary rocks They called him Eohippus And they called him very small And they thought him of no value When they thought of him at all For the lumpish old Dinoceras And

explanation of the kindergarten system a cook book that had belonged to her grandmother and a treatise on crochet There her domestic literature came to an end She accordingly bought a book entitled North American Homes then having in addition begged or borrowed everything within two covers relating to architecture that was to be found in her immediate circle of acquaintance she plunged into that unfamiliar science with hopeful zeal The result of her studies was a mixed one It was necessary it seemed to construct the North American home in so many contradictory methods or else fail forever of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that Corona felt herself to be laboring under a chronic aberration of mind Then the plans Well the plans it must be confessed Corona did find it difficult to understand She always had found it difficult to understand such things but then she had hoped several weeks of close architectural study would shed light upon the density of the subject She grew quite morbid about it She counted the steps when she went up stairs to bed at night She estimated the bedroom post when she walked in the cold gray dawn But the most perplexing thing about the plans was how one story ever got upon another Corona s imagination never fully grappled with this fact although her intellect accepted it She took her books down stairs one night and Susy came and looked them over Why these houses are all one story said Susy Besides they re nothing but lines anyway I shouldn t draw a house so Corona laughed with some embarrassment and no effort at enlightenment She was not used to finding herself and Susy so nearly on the same intellectual level as in this instance She merely asked How should you draw it Why so said Susy after some severe thought So she took her little blunt lead pencil that the baby had chewed and drew her plan as follows Illustration SUSY S PLAN Corona made no comment upon this plan except to ask Susy if that were the way to spell L and then to look in the dictionary and find that it was not spelled at all Tom came in and asked to see what they were doing I m helping Corona said Susy with much complacency These architects things don t look any more like houses than they do like the first proposition in Euclid and the poor girl is puzzled I ll help you to morrow company said Tom who was in too much of a hurry to glance at his wife s plan But to morrow Tom went into town by the early train and when Corona emerged from her North American Homes with wild eye and knotted brow at five o clock p m she found Susy crying over a telegram which ran Called to California immediately Those lost cargoes A No one hides turned up Can t get home to say good by Send overcoat and flannels by Simpson on midnight express Gone four weeks Love to all TOM This unexpected event threw Corona entirely upon her own resources and after a few days more of patient research she put on her hat and stole away at dusk to a builder she knew of down town a nice fatherly man who had once built a piazza for Tom and had just been elected superintendent of the Sunday school These combined facts gave Corona confidence to trust her case to his hands She carried a neat little plan of her own with her the result of several days hard labor Susy s plan she had taken the precaution to cut into paper dolls for the baby Corona found the good man at home and in her most business like manner presented her points Got any plan in yer own head asked the builder hearing her in silence In silence Corona laid before him the paper which had cost her so much toil It was headed in her clear black hand PLAN FOR A SMALL BUT HAPPY HOME This was Illustration CORONA S PLAN Well said the builder after a silence well I ve seen worse Thank you said Corona faintly How does she set asked the builder Who set said Corona a little wildly She could think of nothing that set but hens Why the house Where s the points o compass I hadn t thought of those said Corona And the chimney suggested the builder Where s your chimneys I didn t put in any chimneys said Corona Where did you count on your stairs pursued the builder Stairs I forgot the stairs That s natural said mister Timbers Had a plan brought me once without an entry or a window to it It wasn t a woman did it neither It was a widower in the noospaper line What s your scale Scale asked Corona without animation Scale of feet Proportions Oh I didn t have any scales but I thought about forty feet front would do I have but five hundred dollars A small house must answer The builder smiled He said he would show her some plans He took a book from his table and opened at a plate representing a small snug cottage not uncomely It stood in a flourishing apple orchard and a much larger house appeared dimly in the distance upon a hill The cottage was what is called a story and half and contained six rooms The plan was drawn with the beauty of science There said mister Timbers I know a lady built one of those upon her brother in law s land He give her the land and she just put up the cottage and they was all as pleasant as pease about it That s about what I d recommend to you if you don t object to the name of it What is the matter with the name asked Corona Why said the builder hesitating it is called the Old Maid s House in the book mister Timbers said Corona with decision why should we seek further than the truth I will have that house Pray draw me the plan at once DISTICHS BY JOHN HAY I Wisely a woman prefers to a lover a man who neglects her This one may love her some day some day the

Occasionally a gem occurs to me which I am unable to favor you with because of late we are not much together Appreciating the keen delight with which you have been kind enough to receive my philosophy I take the liberty of sending herewith a number of ideas which may please and benefit you and which I have divided into paragraphs with headings HAPPINESS I have observed that happiness and brains seldom go together The pin headed woman who regards her thin witted husband as the greatest man in the world is happy and much good may it do her In such cases ignorance is a positive blessing for good sense would cause the woman to realize her distressed condition A man who can think he is as good as anybody is happy The fact may be notorious that the man is not so good as anybody until he is as industrious as educated and as refined as anybody but he has not brains enough to know this and content with conceit is happy A man with a brain large enough to understand mankind is always wretched and ashamed of himself REPUTATION Reputation is not always desirable The only thing I have ever heard said in Twin Mounds concerning Smoky Hill is that good hired girls may be had there WOMEN one Most women seem to love for no other reason than that it is expected of them two I know too much about women to honor them more than they deserve in fact I know all about them I visited a place once where doctors are made and saw them cut up one three A woman loses her power when she allows a man to find out all there is to her I mean by this that familiarity breeds contempt I knew a young man once who worked beside a woman in an office and he never married four If men would only tell what they actually know about women instead of what they believe or hear they would receive more credit for chastity than is now the case for they deserve more LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE As a people we lack self confidence The country is full of men that will readily talk you to death privately who would run away in alarm if asked to preside at a public meeting In my Alliance movement I often have trouble in getting out a crowd every farmer in the neighborhood feeling of so much importance as to fear that if he attends he will be called upon to say something IN DISPUTE In some communities where I have lived the women were mean to their husbands in others the husbands were mean to their wives It is usually the case that the friends of a wife believe her husband to be a brute and the friends of the husband believe the wife to possess no other talent than to make him miserable You can t tell how it is the evidence is divided MAN There is only one grade of men they are all contemptible The judge may seem to be a superior creature so long as he keeps at a distance for I have never known one who was not constantly trying to look wise and grave but when you know him you find there is nothing remarkable about him except a plug hat a respectable coat and a great deal of vanity induced by the servility of those who expect favors OPPORTUNITY You hear a great many persons regretting lack of opportunity If every man had opportunity for his desires this would be a nation of murderers and disgraced women EXPECTATION Always be ready for that which you do not expect Nothing that you expect ever happens You have perhaps observed that when you are waiting for a visitor at the front door he comes in at the back and surprises you WOMAN S WORK A woman s work is never done as the almanacs state for the reason that she does not go about it in time to finish it THE GREATEST OF THESE IS CHARITY If you can not resist the low impulse to talk about people say only what you actually know instead of what you have heard And while you are about it stop and consider whether you are not in need of charity yourself NEIGHBORS Every man overestimates his neighbors because he does not know them so well as he knows himself A sensible man despises himself because he knows what a contemptible creature he is I despise Lytle Biggs but I happen to know that his neighbors are just as bad VIRTUE Men are virtuous because the women are women are virtuous from necessity ASHAMED OF THE TRUTH I believe I never knew any one who was not ashamed of the truth Did you ever notice that a railroad company numbers its cars from one thousand instead of from one KNOWING ONLY ONE OF THEM We are sometimes unable to understand why a pretty little woman marries a fellow we know to be worthless but the fellow who knows the woman better than we do considers that he has thrown himself away We know the fellow but we do not know the woman AN APOLOGY I detest an apology The world is full of people who are always making trouble and apologizing for it If a man respects me he will not give himself occasion for apology An offense can not be wiped out in that way If it could we would substitute apologies for hangings I hope you will never apologize to me I should regard it as evidence that you had wronged me OLDEST INHABITANTS The people of Smoky Hill are only fit for oldest inhabitants In thirty or forty years from now there will be a great demand for reminiscences of the pioneer days I recommend that they preserve extensive data for the only period in their lives when they can hope to attract attention Be good enough sir to regard me as of old your friend L BIGGS To NED WESTLOCK Twin Mounds missus JOHNSON BY WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS It was on a morning of the lovely New England May that we left the horse car and spreading our umbrellas walked down the street to our new home in Charlesbridge through a storm of snow and rain so finely blent by the influences of this fortunate climate that no flake knew itself from its sister drop or could be better identified by the people against whom they beat in unison A vernal gale from the east fanned our cheeks and pierced our marrow and chilled our blood while the raw cold green of the adventurous grass on the borders of the sopping side walks gave as it peered through its veil of melting snow and freezing rain a peculiar cheerfulness to the landscape Here and there in the vacant lots abandoned hoop skirts defied decay and near the half finished wooden houses empty mortar beds and bits of lath and slate strewn over the scarred and mutilated ground added their interest to the scene This heavenly weather which the Pilgrim Fathers with the idea of turning their thoughts effectually from earthly pleasures came so far to discover continued with slight amelioration throughout the month of May and far into June and it was a matter of constant amazement with one who had known less austere climates to behold how vegetable life struggled with the hostile skies and in an atmosphere as chill and damp as that of a cellar shot forth the buds and blossoms upon the pear trees called out the sour Puritan courage of the currant bushes taught a reckless native grape vine to wander and wanton over the southern side of the fence and decked the banks with violets as fearless and as fragile as New England girls so that about the end of June when the heavens relented and the sun blazed out at last there was little for him to do but to redden and darken the daring fruits that had attained almost their full growth without his countenance Then indeed Charlesbridge appeared to us a kind of Paradise The wind blew all day from the southwest and all day in the grove across the way the orioles sang to their nestlings The house was almost new and in perfect repair and better than all the kitchen had as yet given no signs of unrest in those volcanic agencies which are constantly at work there and which with sudden explosions make Herculaneums and Pompeiis of so many smiling households Breakfast dinner and tea came up with illusive regularity and were all the most perfect of their kind and we laughed and feasted in our vain security We had out from the city to banquet with us the friends we loved and we were inexpressibly proud before them of the Help who first wrought miracles of cookery in our honor and then appeared in a clean white apron and the glossiest black hair to wait upon the table She was young and certainly very pretty she was as gay as a lark and was courted by a young man whose clothes would have been a credit if they had not been a reproach to our lowly basement She joyfully assented to the idea of staying with us till she married In fact there was much that was extremely pleasant about the little place when the warm weather came and it was not wonderful to us that Jenny was willing to remain It was very quiet we called one another to the window if a large dog went by our door and whole days passed without the movement of any wheels but the butcher s upon our street which flourished in ragweed and buttercups and daisies and in the autumn burned like the borders of nearly all the streets in Charlesbridge with the pallid azure flame of the succory The neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country The horse cars the type of such civilization full of imposture discomfort and sublime possibility as we yet possess went by the head of our street and might perhaps be available to one skilled in calculating the movements of comets while two minutes walk would take us into a wood so wild and thick that no roof was visible through the trees We learned like innocent pastoral people of the golden age to know the several voices of the cows pastured in the vacant lots and like engine drivers of the iron age to distinguish the different whistles of the locomotives passing on the neighboring railroad We played a little at gardening of course and planted tomatoes which the chickens seemed to like for they ate them up as fast as they ripened and we watched with pride the growth of our Lawton blackberries which after attaining the most stalwart proportions were still as bitter as the scrubbiest of their savage brethren and which when by advice left on the vines for a week after they turned black were silently gorged by secret and gluttonous flocks of robins and orioles As for our grapes the frost cut them off in the hour of their triumph So as I have hinted we were not surprised that Jenny should be willing to remain with us and were as little prepared for her desertion as for any other change of our mortal state But one day in September she came to her nominal mistress with tears in her beautiful eyes and protestations of unexampled devotion upon her tongue and said that she was afraid she must leave us She liked the place and she never had worked for any one that was more of a lady but she had made up her mind to go into the city All this so far was quite in the manner of domestics who in ghost stories give warning to the occupants of haunted houses and Jenny s mistress listened in suspense for the motive of her desertion expecting to hear no less than that it was something which walked up and down the stairs and dragged iron links after it or something that came and groaned at the front door like populace dissatisfied with a political candidate But it was in fact nothing of this kind simply there were no lamps upon our street and Jenny after spending Sunday evening with friends in East Charlesbridge was always alarmed on her return in walking from the horse car to our door The case was hopeless and Jenny and our household parted with respect and regret We had not before this thought it a grave disadvantage that our street was unlighted Our street was not drained nor graded no municipal cart ever came to carry away our ashes there was not a water butt within half a mile to save us from fire nor more than the one thousandth part of a policeman to protect us from theft Yet as I paid a heavy tax I somehow felt that we enjoyed the benefits of city government and never looked upon Charlesbridge as in any way undesirable for residence But when it became necessary to find help in Jenny s place the frosty welcome given to application at the intelligence offices renewed a painful doubt awakened by her departure To be sure the heads of the offices were polite enough but when the young housekeeper had stated her case at the first to which she applied and the Intelligencer had called out to the invisible expectants in the adjoining room Anny wan wants to do giner l housewark in Charlsbrudge there came from the maids invoked so loud so fierce so full a No as shook the lady s heart with an indescribable shame and dread The name that with an innocent pride in its literary and historical associations she had written at the heads of her letters was suddenly become a matter of reproach to her and she was almost tempted to conceal thereafter that she lived in Charlesbridge and to pretend that she dwelt upon some wretched little street in Boston You see said the head of the office the gairls doesn t like to live so far away from the city Now if it was on y in the Port This pen is not graphic enough to give the remote reader an idea of the affront offered to an inhabitant of Old Charlesbridge in these closing words Neither am I of sufficiently tragic mood to report here all the sufferings undergone by an unhappy family in finding servants or to tell how the winter was passed with miserable makeshifts Alas is it not the history of a thousand experiences Any one who looks upon this page could match it with a tale as full of heartbreak and disaster while I conceive that in hastening to speak of missus Johnson I approach a subject of unique interest I say our last Irish girl went with the last snow and on one of those midsummer like days that sometimes fall in early April to our yet bleak and desolate zone our hearts sang of Africa and golden joys A Libyan longing took us and we would have chosen if we could to bear a strand of grotesque beads or a handful of brazen gauds and traffic them for some sable maid with crisp locks whom uncoffling from the captive train beside the desert we should make to do our general housework forever through the right of lawful purchase But we knew that this was impossible and that if we desired colored help we must seek it at the intelligence office which is in one of those streets chiefly inhabited by the orphaned children and grandchildren of slavery To tell the truth these orphans do not seem to grieve much for their bereavement but lead a life of joyous and rather indolent oblivion in their quarter of the city They are often to be seen sauntering up and down the street by which the Charlesbridge cars arrive the young with a harmless swagger and the old with the generic limp which our Autocrat has already noted as attending advanced years in their race How gayly are the young ladies of this race attired as they trip up and down the side walks and in and out through the pendent garments at the shop doors They are the black pansies and marigolds and dark blooded dahlias among womankind They try to assume something of our colder race s demeanor but even the passer on the horse car can see that it is not native with them and is better pleased when they forget us and ungenteelly laugh in encountering friends letting their white teeth glitter through the generous lips that open to their ears In the streets branching upward from this avenue very little colored men and maids play with broken or enfeebled toys or sport on the wooden pavements of the entrances to the inner courts Now and then a colored soldier or sailor looking strange in his uniform even after the custom of several years emerges from those passages or more rarely a black gentleman stricken in years and cased in shining broadcloth walks solidly down the brick sidewalk cane in hand a vision of serene self complacency and so plainly the expression of virtuous public sentiment that the great colored louts innocent enough till then in their idleness are taken with a sudden sense of depravity and loaf guiltily up against the house walls At the same moment perhaps a young damsel amorously scuffling with an admirer through one of the low open windows suspends the strife and bids him Go along now do More rarely yet than the gentleman described one may see a white girl among the dark neighbors whose frowsy head is uncovered and whose sleeves are rolled up to her elbows and who though no doubt quite at home looks as strange there as that pale anomaly which may sometimes be seen among a crew of blackbirds An air not so much of decay as of unthrift and yet hardly of unthrift seems to prevail in the neighborhood which has none of the aggressive and impudent squalor of an Irish quarter and none of the surly wickedness of a low American street A gayety not born of the things that bring its serious joy to the true New England heart a ragged gayety which comes of summer in the blood and not in the pocket or the conscience and which affects the countenance and the whole demeanor setting the feet to some inward music and at times bursting into a line of song or a child like and irresponsible laugh gives tone to the visible life and wakens a very friendly spirit in the passer who somehow thinks there of a milder climate and is half persuaded that the orange peel on the side walks came from fruit grown in the soft atmosphere of those back courts It was in this quarter then that we heard of missus Johnson and it was from a colored boarding house there that she came out to Charlesbridge to look at us bringing her daughter of twelve years with her She was a matron of mature age and portly figure with a complexion like coffee soothed with the richest cream and her manners were so full of a certain tranquillity and grace that she charmed away all our will to ask for references It was only her barbaric laughter and lawless eye that betrayed how slightly her New England birth and breeding covered her ancestral traits and bridged the gulf of a thousand years of civilization that lay between her race and ours But in fact she was doubly estranged by descent for as we learned later a sylvan wildness mixed with that of the desert in her veins her grandfather was an Indian and her ancestors on this side had probably sold their lands for the same value in trinkets that bought the original African pair on the other side The first day that missus Johnson descended into our kitchen she conjured from the malicious disorder in which it had been left by the flitting Irish kobold a dinner that revealed the inspirations of genius and was quite different from a dinner of mere routine and laborious talent Something original and authentic mingled with the accustomed flavors and though vague reminiscences of canal boat travel and woodland camps arose from the relish of certain of the dishes there was yet the assurance of such power in the preparation of the whole that we knew her to be merely running over the chords of our appetite with preliminary savors as a musician acquaints his touch with the keys of an unfamiliar piano before breaking into brilliant and triumphant execution Within a week she had mastered her instrument and thereafter there was no faltering in her performances which she varied constantly through inspiration or from suggestion But after all it was in puddings that missus Johnson chiefly excelled She was one of those cooks rare as men of genius in literature who love their own dishes and she had in her personally child like simplicity of taste and the inherited appetites of her savage forefathers a dominant passion for sweets So far as we could learn she subsisted principally upon puddings and tea Through the same primitive instincts no doubt she loved praise She openly exulted in our artless flatteries of her skill she waited jealously at the head of the kitchen stairs to hear what was said of her work especially if there were guests and she was never too weary to attempt emprises of cookery While engaged in these she wore a species of sightly handkerchief like a turban upon her head and about her person those mystical swathings in which old ladies of the African race delight But she most pleasured our sense of beauty and moral fitness when after the last pan was washed and the last pot was scraped she lighted a potent pipe and taking her stand at the kitchen door laded the soft evening air with its pungent odors If we surprised her at these supreme moments she took the pipe from her lips and put it behind her with a low mellow chuckle and a look of half defiant consciousness never guessing that none of her merits took us half so much as the cheerful vice which she only feigned to conceal Some things she could not do so perfectly as cooking because of her failing eyesight and we persuaded her that spectacles would both become and befriend a lady of her years and so bought her a pair of steel bowed glasses She wore them in some great emergencies at first but had clearly no pride in them Before long she laid them aside altogether and they had passed from our thoughts when one day we heard her mellow note of laughter and her daughter s harsher cackle outside our door and opening it beheld missus Johnson in gold bowed spectacles of massive frame We then learned that their purchase was in fulfilment of a vow made long ago in the life time of mister Johnson that if ever she wore glasses they should be gold bowed and I hope the manes of the dead were half as happy in these votive spectacles as the simple soul that offered them She and her late partner were the parents of eleven children some of whom were dead and some of whom were wanderers in unknown parts During his life time she had kept a little shop in her native town and it was only within a few years that she had gone into service She cherished a natural haughtiness of spirit and resented control although disposed to do all she could of her own notion Being told to say when she wanted an afternoon she explained that when she wanted an afternoon she always took it without asking but always planned so as not to discommode the ladies with whom she lived These she said had numbered twenty seven within three years which made us doubt the success of her system in all cases though she merely held out the fact as an assurance of her faith in the future and a proof of the ease with which places are to be found She contended moreover that a lady who had for thirty years had a house of her own was in nowise bound to ask permission to receive visits from friends where she might be living but that they ought freely to come and go like other guests In this spirit she once invited her son in law Professor Jones of Providence to dine with her and her defied mistress on entering the dining room found the Professor at pudding and tea there an impressively respectable figure in black clothes with a black face rendered yet more effective by a pair of green goggles It appeared that this dark professor was a light of phrenology in Rhode Island and that he was believed to have uncommon virtue in his science by reason of being blind as well as black I am loath to confess that missus Johnson had not a flattering opinion of the Caucasian race in all respects In fact she had very good philosophical and Scriptural reasons for looking upon us as an upstart people of new blood who had come into their whiteness by no creditable or pleasant process The late mister Johnson who had died in the West Indies whither he voyaged for his health in quality of cook upon a Down East schooner was a man of letters and had written a book to show the superiority of the black over the white branches of the human family In this he held that as all islands have been at their discovery found peopled by blacks we must needs believe that humanity was first created of that color missus Johnson could not show us her husband s work a sole copy in the library of an English gentleman at Port au Prince is not to be bought for money but she often developed its arguments to the lady of the house and one day with a great show of reluctance and many protests that no personal slight was meant let fall the fact that mister Johnson believed the white race descended from Gehaz the leper upon whom the leprosy of Naaman fell when the latter returned by Divine favor to his original blackness And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow said missus Johnson quoting irrefutable Scripture Leprosy leprosy she added thoughtfully nothing but leprosy bleached you out It seems to me much in her praise that she did not exult in our taint and degradation as some white philosophers used to do in the opposite idea that a part of the human family were cursed to lasting blackness and slavery in Ham and his children but even told us of a remarkable approach to whiteness in many of her own offspring In a kindred spirit of charity no doubt she refused ever to attend church with people of her elder and wholesomer blood When she went to church she said she always went to a white church though while with us I am bound to say she never went to any She professed to read her Bible in her bedroom on Sundays but we suspected from certain sounds and odors which used to steal out of this sanctuary that her piety more commonly found expression in dozing and smoking I would not make a wanton jest here of missus Johnson s anxiety to claim honor for the African color while denying this color in many of her own family It afforded a glimpse of the pain which all her people must endure however proudly they hide it or light heartedly forget it from the despite and contumely to which they are guiltlessly born and when I thought how irreparable was this disgrace and calamity of a black skin and how irreparable it must be for ages yet in this world where every other shame and all manner of wilful guilt and wickedness may hope for covert and pardon I had little heart to laugh Indeed it was so pathetic to hear this poor old soul talk of her dead and lost ones and try in spite of all mister Johnson s theories and her own arrogant generalizations to establish their whiteness that we must have been very cruel and silly people to turn her sacred fables even into matter of question I have no doubt that her Antoinette Anastasia and her Thomas Jefferson Wilberforce it is impossible to give a full idea of the splendor and scope of the baptismal names in missus Johnson s family have as light skins and as golden hair in heaven as her reverend maternal fancy painted for them in our world There certainly they would not be subject to tanning which had ruined the delicate complexion and had knotted into black woolly tangles the once wavy blonde locks of our little maid servant Naomi and I would fain believe that Toussaint Washington Johnson who ran away to sea so many years ago has found some fortunate zone where his hair and skin keep the same sunny and rosy tints they wore to his mother s eyes in infancy But I have no means of knowing this or of telling whether he was the prodigy of intellect that he was declared to be Naomi could no more be taken in proof of the one assertion than of the other When she came to us it was agreed that she should go to school but she overruled her mother in this as in everything else and never went Except Sunday school lessons she had no other instruction than that her mistress gave her in the evenings when a heavy day s play and the natural influences of the hour conspired with original causes to render her powerless before words of one syllable The first week of her services she was obedient and faithful to her duties but relaxing in the atmosphere of a house which seems to demoralize all menials she shortly fell into disorderly ways of lying in wait for callers out of doors and when people rang of running up the front steps and letting them in from the outside As the season expanded and the fine weather became confirmed she modified even this form of service and spent her time in the fields appearing at the house only when nature importunately craved molasses In her untamable disobedience Naomi alone betrayed her sylvan blood for she was in all other respects negro and not Indian But it was of her aboriginal ancestry that missus Johnson chiefly boasted when not engaged in argument to maintain the superiority of the African race She loved to descant upon it as the cause and explanation of her own arrogant habit of feeling and she seemed indeed to have inherited something of the Indian s hauteur along with the Ethiop s supple cunning and abundant amiability She gave many instances in which her pride had met and overcome the insolence of employers and the kindly old creature was by no means singular in her pride of being reputed proud She could never have been a woman of strong logical faculties but she had in some things a very surprising and awful astuteness She seldom introduced any purpose directly but bore all about it and then suddenly sprung it upon her unprepared antagonist At other times she obscurely hinted a reason and left a conclusion to be inferred as when she warded off reproach for some delinquency by saying in a general way that she had lived with ladies who used to come scolding into the kitchen after they had taken their bitters Quality ladies took their bitters regular she added to remove any sting of personality from her remark for from many things she had let fall we knew that she did not regard us as quality On the contrary she often tried to overbear us with the gentility of her former places and would tell the lady over whom she reigned that she had lived with folks worth their three and four hundred thousand dollars who never complained as she did of the ironing Yet she had a sufficient regard for the literary occupations of the family mister Johnson having been an author She even professed to have herself written a book which was still in manuscript and preserved somewhere among her best clothes It was well on many accounts to be in contact with a mind so original and suggestive as missus Johnson s We loved to trace its intricate yet often transparent operations and were perhaps too fond of explaining its peculiarities by facts of ancestry of finding hints of the Pow wow or the Grand Custom in each grotesque development We were conscious of something warmer in this old soul than in ourselves and something wilder and we chose to think it the tropic and the untracked forest She had scarcely any being apart from her affection she had no morality but was good because she neither hated nor envied and she might have been a saint far more easily than far more civilized people There was that also in her sinuous yet malleable nature so full of guile and so full of goodness that reminded us pleasantly of lowly folks in elder lands where relaxing oppressions have lifted the restraints of fear between master and servant without disturbing the familiarity of their relation She advised freely with us upon all household matters and took a motherly interest in whatever concerned us She could be flattered or caressed into almost any service but no threat or command could move her When she erred she never acknowledged her wrong in words but handsomely expressed her regrets in a pudding or sent up her apologies in a favorite dish secretly prepared We grew so well used to this form of exculpation that whenever missus Johnson took an afternoon at an inconvenient season we knew that for a week afterwards we should be feasted like princes She owned frankly that she loved us that she never had done half so much for people before and that she never had been nearly so well suited in any other place and for a brief and happy time we thought that we never should part One day however our dividing destiny appeared in the basement and was presented to us as Hippolyto Thucydides the son of missus Johnson who had just arrived on a visit to his mother from the State of New Hampshire He was a heavy and loutish youth standing upon the borders of boyhood and looking forward to the future with a vacant and listless eye I mean this was his figurative attitude his actual manner as he lolled upon a chair beside the kitchen window was so eccentric that we felt a little uncertain how to regard him and missus Johnson openly described him as peculiar He was so deeply tanned by the fervid suns of the New Hampshire winter and his hair had so far suffered from the example of the sheep lately under his charge that he could not be classed by any stretch of comparison with the blonde and straight haired members of missus Johnson s family He remained with us all the first day until late in the afternoon when his mother took him out to get him a boarding house Then he departed in the van of her and Naomi pausing at the gate to collect his spirits and after he had sufficiently animated himself by clapping his palms together starting off down the street at a hand gallop to the manifest terror of the cows in the pasture and the confusion of the less demonstrative people of our household Other characteristic traits appeared in Hippolyto Thucydides within no very long period of time and he ran away from his lodgings so often during the summer that he might be said to board round among the outlying cornfields and turnip patches of Charlesbridge As a check upon this habit missus Johnson seemed to have invited him to spend his whole time in our basement for whenever we went below we found him there balanced perhaps in homage to us and perhaps as a token of extreme sensibility in himself upon the low window sill the bottoms of his boots touching the floor inside and his face buried in the grass without We could formulate no very tenable objection to all this and yet the presence of Thucydides in our kitchen unaccountably oppressed our imaginations We beheld him all over the house a monstrous eidolon balanced upon every window sill and he certainly attracted unpleasant notice to our place no less by his furtive and hangdog manner of arrival than by the bold displays with which he celebrated his departures We hinted this to missus Johnson but she could not enter into our feeling Indeed all the wild poetry of her maternal and primitive nature seemed to cast itself about this hapless boy and if we had listened to her we should have believed there was no one so agreeable in society or so quick witted in affairs as Hippolyto when he chose At last when we said positively that Thucydides should come to us no more and then qualified the prohibition by allowing him to come every Sunday she answered that she never would hurt the child s feelings by telling him not to come where his mother was that people who did not love her children did not love her and that if Hippy went she went We thought it a masterstroke of firmness to rejoin that Hippolyto must go in any event but I am bound to own that he did not go and that his mother stayed and so fed us with every cunning propitiatory dainty that we must have been Pagans to renew our threat In fact we begged missus Johnson to go into the country with us and she after long reluctation on Hippy s account consented agreeing to send him away to friends during her absence We made every preparation and on the eve of our departure missus Johnson went into the city to engage her son s passage to Bangor while we awaited her return in untroubled security But she did not appear till midnight and then responded with but a sad Well sah to the cheerful Well missus Johnson that greeted her All right missus Johnson missus Johnson made a strange noise half chuckle and half death rattle in her throat All wrong sah Hippy s off again and I ve been all over the city after him Then you can t go with us in the morning How can I sah missus Johnson went sadly out of the room Then she came back to the door again and opening it uttered for the first time in our service words of apology and regret I hope I ha n t put you out any I wanted to go with you but I ought to knowed I couldn t All is I loved you too much

HENRY LEWIS Panthers what we all calls mountain lions observed the Old Cattleman wearing meanwhile the sapient air of him who feels equipped of his subject is plenty furtive not to say mighty sedyoolous to skulk That s why a gent don t meet up with more of em while pirootin about in the hills Them cats hears him or they sees him an him still ignorant tharof an with that they bashfully withdraws Which it s to be urged in favor of mountain lions that they never forces themse fs on no gent they re shore considerate that a way an speshul of themse fs If one s ever hurt you can bet it won t be a accident However it ain t for me to go round impugnin the motives of no mountain lion partic lar when the entire tribe is strangers to me complete But still a love of trooth compels me to concede that if mountain lions ain t cowardly they re shore cautious a lot Cattle an calves they passes up as too bellicose an none of em ever faces any anamile more warlike than a baby colt or mebby a half grown deer I m ridin along the Caliente once when I hears a crashin in the bushes on the bluff above two hundred foot high she is an as sheer as the walls of this yere tavern As I lifts my eyes a fear frenzied mare an colt comes chargin up an projects themse fs over the precipice an lands in the valley below They re dead as Joolius Caesar when I rides onto em while a brace of mountain lions is skirtin up an down the aige of the bluff they leaps from mewin an lashin their long tails in hot enthoosiasm Shore the cats has been chasin the mare an foal an they locoes em to that extent they don t know where they re headin an makes the death jump I relates I bangs away with my six shooter but beyond givin the mountain lions a convulsive start I can t say I does any execootion They turns an goes streakin it through the pine woods like a drunkard to a barn raisin Timid Shore They re that timid seminary girls compared to em is as sternly courageous as a passel of buccaneers Out in Mitchell s canyon a couple of the Lee Scott riders cuts the trail of a mountain lion and her two kittens Now whatever do you all reckon this old tabby does Basely deserts her offsprings without even barin a tooth an the cow punchers takes em gently by their tails an beats out their joovenile brains That s straight that mother lion goes swarmin up the canyon like she ain t got a minute to live An you can gamble the limit that where a anamile sees its children perish without frontin up for war it don t possess the commonest roodiments of sand Sech son is mountain lions It s one evenin in the Red Light when Colonel Sterett who s got through his day s toil on that Coyote paper he s editor of onfolds concernin a panther round up which he pulls off in his yooth This panther hunt says Colonel Sterett as he fills his third tumbler occurs when mighty likely I m goin on seventeen winters I m a leader among my young companions at the time in fact I allers is An I m proud to say that my soopremacy that a way is doo to the dom nant character of my intellects I m ever bright an sparklin as a child an I recalls how my aptitoode for learnin promotes me to be regyarded as the smartest lad in my set If thar s visitors to the school or if the selectman invades that academy to sort o size us up the teacher allers plays me on em I d go to the front for the outfit Which I m wont on sech harrowin o casions to recite a ode the teacher s done wrote it himse f an which is entitled Napoleon s Mad Career Thar s twenty four stanzas to it an while these interlopin selectmen sets thar lookin owley an sagacious I d wallop loose with the twenty four verses stampin up and down an accompanyin said recitations with sech a multitood of reckless gestures it comes plenty clost to backin everybody plumb outen the room Yere s the first verse I d drink an sw ar an r ar an t ar An fall down in the mud While the y earth for forty miles about Is kivered with my blood You all can see from that speciment that our school master ain t simply flirtin with the muses when he originates that epic no sir he means business an whenever I throws it into the selectmen I does it jestice The trustees used to silently line out for home when I finishes an never a yeep It stuns em it shore fills em to the brim As I gazes r arward goes on the Colonel as by one rapt impulse he uplifts both his eyes an his nosepaint as I gazes r arward I says on them sun filled days an speshul if ever I gets betrayed into talkin about em I can hardly t ar myse f from the subject I explains yeretofore that not only by inclination but by birth I m a shore enough ristocrat This captaincy of local fashion I assoomes at a tender age I wears the record as the first child to don shoes throughout the entire summer in that neighborhood an many a time an oft does my yoothful but envy eaten compeers lambaste me for the insultin innovation But I sticks to my moccasins an to day shoes in the Bloo Grass is almost as yooniversal as the licker habit Thar dawns a hour however when my p sition in the van of Kaintucky ton comes within a ace of bein ser ously shook It s on my way to school one dewy mornin when I gets involved all inadvertent in a onhappy rupture with a polecat I never does know how the misonderstandin starts After all the seeds of said dispoote is by no means important it s enough to say that polecat finally has me thoroughly convinced Followin the difference an my defeat I m witless enough to keep goin on to school whereas I should have returned homeward an cast myse f upon my parents as a sacred trust Of course when I m in school I don t go impartin my troubles to the other chil en I emyoolates the heroism of the Spartan boy who stands to be eat by a fox an keeps em to myself But the views of my late enemy is not to be smothered they appeals to my young companions who tharupon puts up a most onneedful riot of coughin s an sneezin s But nobody knows me as the party who s so pungent It s a tryin moment I can see that once I m located I m goin to be as onpop lar as a b ar in a hawg pen I ll come tumblin from my pinnacle in that proud commoonity as the glass of fashion an the mold of form You can go your bottom peso the thought causes me to feel plenty perturbed At this peril I has a inspiration as good too as I ever entertains without the aid of rum I determines to cast the opprobrium on some other boy an send the hunt of general ral indignation sweepin along his trail Thar s a innocent infant who s a stoodent at this temple of childish learnin an his name is Riley Bark This Riley is one of them giant children who s only twelve an weighs three hundred pounds An in proportions as Riley is a son of Anak physical he s dwarfed mental he ain t half as well upholstered with brains as a shepherd dog That s right Riley s intellects is like a fly in a saucer of syrup they struggles round plumb slow I decides to uplift Riley to the public eye as the felon who s disturbin that seminary s sereenity Comin to this decision I p ints at him where he s planted four seats ahead all tangled up in a spellin book an says in a loud whisper to a child who s sittin next Throw him out That s enough No gent will ever realize how easy it is to direct a people s sentiment ontil he take a whirl at the game In two minutes by the teacher s bull s eye copper watch every soul knows it s pore Riley an in three the teacher s done drug Riley out doors by the ha r of his head an chased him home Gents I look back on that yoothful feat as a triumph of diplomacy it shore saved my standin as the Beau Brummel of the Bloo Grass Good old days them observes the Colonel mournfully an ones never to come ag in My sternest studies is romances an the peroosals of old tales as I tells you all prior fills me full of moss an mockin birds in equal parts I reads deep of Walter Scott an waxes to be a sharp on Moslems speshul I dreams of the Siege of Acre an Richard the Lion Heart an I simply can t sleep nights for honin to hold a tournament an joust a whole lot for some fair lady s love Once I commits the error of my career by joustin with my brother Jeff This yere Jeff is settin on the bank of the Branch fishin for bullpouts at the time an Jeff don t know I m hoverin near at all Jeff s reedic lous fond of fishin which he d sooner fish than read Paradise Lost I m romancin along sim larly bent when I notes Jeff perched on the bank To my boyish imagination Jeff at once turns to be a Paynim I drops my bait box couches my fishpole an emittin a impromptoo warcry charges him It s the work of a moment Jeff s onhossed an falls into the Branch But thar s bitterness to follow vict ry Jeff emerges like Diana from the bath an frales the wamus off me with a club Talk of puttin a crimp in folks Gents when Jeff s wrath is assuaged I m all on one side like the leanin tower of Pisa Jeff actooally confers a skew gee to my spinal column A week later my folks takes me to a doctor That practitioner puts on his specs an looks me over with jealous care Whatever s wrong with him Doc says my father Nothin says the physician only your son Willyum s five inches out o plumb Then he rigs a contraption made up of guy ropes an stay laths an I has to wear it an mebby in three or four weeks or so he s got me warped back into the perpendic lar But how about this cat hunt asks Dan Boggs Which I don t aim to be introosive none but I m camped yere through the second drink waitin for it an these procrastinations is makn me kind o batty That panther hunt is like this says the Colonel turnin to Dan At the age of seventeen me an eight or nine of my intimate brave comrades founds what we all denom nates as the Chevy Chase Huntin Club Each of us maintains a passel of odds an ends of dogs an at stated intervals we convenes on hosses an with these fourscore curs at our tails goes yellin an skally hootin up an down the countryside allowin we re shore a band of Nimrods The Chevy Chasers ain t been in bein as a institootion over long when chance opens a gate to ser ous work The deep snows in the Eastern mountains it looks like has done drove a panther into our neighborhood You could hear of him on all sides Folks glimpses him now an then They allows he s about the size of a yearlin calf an the way he pulls down sech feeble people as sheep or lays desolate some he pless henroost don t bother him a bit This panther spreads a horror over the county Dances pra er meetin s an even poker parties is broken up an the social life of that region begins to bog down Even a weddin suffers the bridesmaids stayin away lest this ferocious monster should show up in the road an chaw one of em while she s en route for the scene of trouble That s gospel trooth the pore deserted bride has to heel an handle herse f an never a friend to yoonite her sobs with hers doorin that weddin ordeal The old ladies present shakes their heads a heap solemn It s a worse augoory says one than the hoots of a score of squinch owls When this reign of terror is at its height the local eye is rolled appealin ly towards us Chevy Chasers We rises to the opportoonity Day after day we re ridin the hills an vales readin the milk white snow for tracks An we has success One mornin I comes up on two of the Brackenridge boys an five more of the Chevy Chasers settin on their hosses at the Skinner cross roads Bob Crittenden s gone to turn me out they says Then they p ints down to a handful of close wove bresh an stunted timber an allows that this maraudin cat o mount is hidin thar they sees him go skulkin in Gents I ain t above admittin that the news puts my heart to a canter I m brave but conflicts with wild an savage beasts is to me a novelty an while I faces my fate without a flutter I m yere to say I d sooner been in pursoot of minks or raccoons or some varmint whose grievous cap bilities I can more ackerately stack up an in whose merry ways I m better versed However the dauntless blood of my grandsire mounts in my cheek an as if the shade of that old Trojan is thar personal to su gest it I searches forth a flask an renoos my sperit thus qualified for perils come in what form they may I resolootely stands my hand Thar s forty dogs if thar s one in our company as we pauses at the Skinner cross roads An when the Crittenden yooth returns he brings with him the Rickett boys an forty added dogs Which it s worth a ten mile ride to get a glimpse of that outfit of canines Thar s every sort onder the canopy thar s the stolid hound the alert fice the sapient collie that is thar s individyool beasts wherein the hound or fice or collie seems to preedominate as a strain The trooth is thar s not that dog a whinin about our hosses fetlocks who ain t proudly descended from fifteen different tribes an they shorely makes a motley mass meetin Still they re good zealous dogs an as they re going to go for ard an take most of the resks of that panther it seems invidious to criticize em One of the Twitty boys rides down an puts the eighty or more dogs into the bresh The rest of us lays back an strains our eyes Thar he is A shout goes up as we descries the panther stealin off by a far corner He s headin along a hollow that s full of bresh an baby timber an runs parallel with the pike Big an yaller he is we can tell from the slight flash we gets of him as he darts into a second clump of bushes With a cry what young Crittenden calls a view halloo we goes stampeedin down the pike in pursoot Our dogs is sta nch they shore does themse fs proud Singin in twenty keys reachin from growls to yelps an from yelps to shrillest screams they pushes dauntlessly on the fresh trail of their terrified quarry Now an then we gets a squint of the panther as he skulks from one copse to another jest ahead Which he s goin like a arrow no mistake As for us Chevy Chasers we parallels the hunt an continyoos poundin the Skinner turnpike abreast of the pack ever an anon givin a encouragin shout as we briefly sights our game Gents says Colonel Sterett as he ag in refreshes hims ef it s needless to go over that hunt in detail We hustles the flyin demon full eighteen miles our faithful dogs crowdin close an breathless at his coward heels Still they don t catch up with him he streaks it like some saffron meteor Only once does we approach within strikin distance that s when he crosses at old Stafford s whisky still As he glides into view Crittenden shouts Thar he goes For myse f I m prepared I ve got one of these misguided cap an ball six shooters that s built doorin the war an I cuts that hardware loose This weapon seems a born profligate of lead for the six chambers goes off together Which you should have seen the Chevy Chasers dodge An well they may that broadside ain t in vain My aim is so troo that one of the r armost dogs evolves a howl an rolls over then he sets up gnawin an lickin his off hind laig in frantic alternations That hunt is done for him We leaves him doctorin himse f an picks him up two hours later on our triumphant return As I states we harries that foogitive panther for eighteen miles an in our hot ardor founders two hosses Fatigue an weariness begins to overpower us also our prey weakens along with the rest In the half glimpses we now an ag in gets of him it s plain that both pace an distance is tellin fast Still he presses on an as thar s no spur like fear that panther holds his distance But the end comes We ve done run him into a rough wild stretch of country where settlements is few an cabins roode Of a sudden the panther emerges onto the road an goes rackin along the trail We pushes our spent steeds to the utmost Thar s a log house ahead out in the stump filled lot in front is a frowsy woman an five small children The panther leaps the rickety worm fence an heads straight as a bullet for the cl arin Horrors the sight freezes our marrows Mad an savage he s doo to bite a hunk outen that devoted household Mutooally callin to each other we goads our horses to the utmost We gain on the panther He may wound but he won t have time to slay that fam ly Gents it s a soopreme moment The panther makes for the female squatter an her litter we pantin an pressin clost behind The panther is among em the woman an the children seems transfixed by the awful spectacle an stands rooted with open eyes an mouths Our emotions shore beggars deescriptions Now ensooes a scene to smite the hardiest of us with dismay No sooner does the panther find himse f in the midst of that he pless bevy of little ones than he stops turns round abrupt an sets down on his tail an then upliftin his muzzle he busts into shrieks an yells an howls an cries a complete case of dog hysterics That s what he is a great yeller dog his reason is now a wrack because we harasses him the eighteen miles Thar s a ugly outcast of a squatter mattock in hand comes tumblin down the hillside from some ers out back of the shanty where he s been grubbin What be you all eediots chasin my dog for demands this onkempt party Then he menaces us with the implement We makes no retort but stands passive The great orange brute whose nerves has been torn to rags creeps to the squatter an with mournful howls explains what we ve made him suffer No thar s nothin further to do an less to be said That cavalcade erstwhile so gala an buoyant drags itself wearily homeward the exhausted dogs in the r ar walkin stiff an sore like their laigs is wood For more n a mile the complainin howls of the hysterical yeller dog is wafted to our years Then they ceases an we figgers his sympathizin master has done took him into the shanty an shet the door No one comments on this adventure not a word is heard Each is silent ontil we mounts the Big Murray hill As we collects ourse fs on this eminence one of the Brackenridge boys holds up his hand for a halt Gents he says as hosses hunters an dogs we all gathers round gents I moves you the Chevy Chase Huntin Club yereby stands adjourned sine die Thar s a moment s pause an then as by one impulse every gent hoss an dog says Ay It s yoonanimous an from that hour till now the Chevy Chase Huntin Club ain t been nothin save tradition But that panther shore disappears it s the end of his vandalage an ag in does quadrilles pra rs an poker resoom their wonted sway That s the end an now gents if Black Jack will caper to his dooties we ll uplift our drooped energies with the usual forty drops WOUTER VAN TWILLER BY WASHINGTON IRVING It was in the year of our Lord sixteen twenty nine that Mynheer Wouter Van Twiller was appointed governor of the province of Nieuw Nederlandts under the commission and control of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General of the United Netherlands and the privileged West India Company This renowned old gentleman arrived at New Amsterdam in the merry month of June the sweetest month in all the year when dan Apollo seems to dance up the transparent firmament when the robin the thrush and a thousand other wanton songsters make the woods to resound with amorous ditties and the luxurious little bob lincoln revels among the clover blossoms of the meadows all which happy coincidence persuaded the old dames of New Amsterdam who were skilled in the art of foretelling events that this was to be a happy and prosperous administration The renowned Wouter or Walter Van Twiller was descended from a long line of Dutch burgomasters who had successively dozed away their lives and grown fat upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam and who had comported themselves with such singular wisdom and propriety that they were never either heard or talked of which next to being universally applauded should be the object of ambition of all magistrates and rulers There are two opposite ways by which some men make a figure in the world one by talking faster than they think and the other by holding their tongues and not thinking at all By the first many a smatterer acquires the reputation of a man of quick parts by the other many a dunderpate like the owl the stupidest of birds comes to be considered the very type of wisdom This by the way is a casual remark which I would not for the universe have it thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller It is true he was a man shut up within himself like an oyster and rarely spoke except in monosyllables but then it was allowed he seldom said a foolish thing So invincible was his gravity that he was never known to laugh or even to smile through the whole course of a long and prosperous life Nay if a joke were uttered in his presence that set light minded hearers in a roar it was observed to throw him into a state of perplexity Sometimes he would deign to inquire into the matter and when after much explanation the joke was made as plain as a pike staff he would continue to smoke his pipe in silence and at length knocking out the ashes would exclaim Well I see nothing in all that to laugh about With all his reflective habits he never made up his mind on a subject His adherents accounted for this by the astonishing magnitude of his ideas He conceived every subject on so grand a scale that he had not room in his head to turn it over and examine both sides of it Certain it is that if any matter were propounded to him on which ordinary mortals would rashly determine at first glance he would put on a vague mysterious look shake his capacious head smoke some time in profound silence and at length observe that he had his doubts about the matter which gained him the reputation of a man slow of belief and not easily imposed upon What is more it gained him a lasting name for to this habit of the mind has been attributed his surname of Twiller which is said to be a corruption of the original Twijfler or in plain English Doubter The person of this illustrious old gentleman was formed and proportioned as though it had been moulded by the hands of some cunning Dutch statuary as a model of majesty and lordly grandeur He was exactly five feet six inches in height and six feet five inches in circumference His head was a perfect sphere and of such stupendous dimensions that Dame Nature with all her sex s ingenuity would have been puzzled to construct a neck capable of supporting it wherefore she wisely declined the attempt and settled it firmly on the top of his backbone just between the shoulders His body was oblong and particularly capacious at bottom which was wisely ordered by Providence seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits and very averse to the idle labor of walking His legs were short but sturdy in proportion to the weight they had to sustain so that when erect he had not a little the appearance of a beer barrel on skids His face that infallible index of the mind presented a vast expanse unfurrowed by those lines and angles which disfigure the human countenance with what is termed expression Two small gray eyes twinkled feebly in the midst like two stars of lesser magnitude in a hazy firmament and his full fed cheeks which seemed to have taken toll of everything that went into his mouth were curiously mottled and streaked with dusty red like a spitzenberg apple His habits were as regular as his person He daily took his four stated meals appropriating exactly an hour to each he smoked and doubted eight hours and he slept the remaining twelve of the four and twenty Such was the renowned Wouter Van Twiller a true philosopher for his mind was either elevated above or tranquilly settled below the cares and perplexities of this world He had lived in it for years without feeling the least curiosity to know whether the sun revolved round it or it round the sun and he had watched for at least half a century the smoke curling from his pipe to the ceiling without once troubling his head with any of those numerous theories by which a philosopher would have perplexed his brain in accounting for its rising above the surrounding atmosphere In his council he presided with great state and solemnity He sat in a huge chair of solid oak hewn in the celebrated forest of the Hague fabricated by an experienced timmerman of Amsterdam and curiously carved about the arms and feet into exact imitations of gigantic eagle s claws Instead of a scepter he swayed a long Turkish pipe wrought with jasmin and amber which had been presented to a stadtholder of Holland at the conclusion of a treaty with one of the petty Barbary powers In this stately chair would he sit and this magnificent pipe would he smoke shaking his right knee with a constant motion and fixing his eye for hours together upon a little print of Amsterdam which hung in a black frame against the opposite wall of the council chamber Nay it has even been said that when any deliberation of extraordinary length and intricacy was on the carpet the renowned Wouter would shut his eyes for full two hours at a time that he might not be disturbed by external objects and at such times the internal commotion of his mind was evinced by certain regular guttural sounds which his admirers declared were merely the noise of conflict made by his contending doubts and opinions It is with infinite difficulty I have been enabled to collect these biographical anecdotes of the great man under consideration The facts respecting him were so scattered and vague and divers of them so questionable in point of authenticity that I have had to give up the search after many and decline the admission of still more which would have tended to heighten the coloring of his portrait I have been the more anxious to delineate fully the person and habits of Wouter Van Twiller from the consideration that he was not only the first but also the best governor that ever presided over this ancient and respectable province and so tranquil and benevolent was his reign that I do not find throughout the whole of it a single instance of any offender being brought to punishment a most indubitable sign of a merciful governor and a case unparalleled excepting in the reign of the illustrious King Log from whom it is hinted the renowned Van Twiller was a lineal descendant The very outset of the career of this excellent magistrate was distinguished by an example of legal acumen that gave flattering presage of a wise and equitable administration The morning after he had been installed in office and at the moment that he was making his breakfast from a prodigious earthen dish filled with milk and Indian pudding he was interrupted by the appearance of Wandle Schoonhoven a very important old burgher of New Amsterdam who complained bitterly of one Barent Bleecker inasmuch as he refused to come to a settlement of accounts seeing that there was a heavy balance in favor of the said Wandle Governor Van Twiller as I have already observed was a man of few words he was likewise a mortal enemy to multiplying writings or being disturbed at his breakfast Having listened attentively to the statement of Wandle Schoonhoven giving an occasional grunt as he shoveled a spoonful of Indian pudding into his mouth either as a sign that he relished the dish or comprehended the story he called unto him his constable and pulling out of his breeches pocket a huge jack knife dispatched it after the defendant as a summons accompanied by his tobacco box as a warrant This summary process was as effectual in those simple days as was the seal ring of the great Haroun Alraschid among the true believers The two parties being confronted before him each produced a book of accounts written in a language and character that would have puzzled any but a High Dutch commentator or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks The sage Wouter took them one after the other and having poised them in his hands and attentively counted over the number of leaves fell straightway into a very great doubt and smoked for half an hour without saying a word at length laying his finger beside his nose and shutting his eyes for a moment with the air of a man who has just caught a subtle idea by the tail he slowly took his pipe from his mouth puffed forth a column of tobacco smoke and with marvelous gravity and solemnity pronounced that having carefully counted over the leaves and weighed the books it was found that one was just as thick and as heavy as the other therefore it was the final opinion of the court that the accounts were equally balanced therefore Wandle should give Barent a receipt and Barent should give Wandle a receipt and the constable should pay the costs This decision being straightway made known diffused general joy throughout New Amsterdam for the people immediately perceived that they had a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule over them But its happiest effect was that not another lawsuit took place throughout the whole of his administration and the office of constable fell into such decay that there was not one of those losel scouts known in the province for many years I am the more particular in dwelling on this transaction not only because I deem it one of the most sage and righteous judgments on record and well worthy the attention of modern magistrates but because it was a miraculous event in the history of the renowned Wouter being the only time he was ever known to come to a decision in the whole course of his life THE EXPERIENCES OF THE A C BY BAYARD TAYLOR Bridgeport Change cars for the Naugatuck Railroad shouted the conductor of the New York and Boston Express Train on the evening of May twenty seven eighteen fifty eight mister Johnson carpet bag in hand jumped upon the platform entered the office purchased a ticket for Waterbury and was soon whirling in the Naugatuck train towards his destination On reaching Waterbury in the soft spring twilight mister Johnson walked up and down in front of the station curiously scanning the faces of the assembled crowd Presently he noticed a gentleman who was performing the same operation upon the faces of the alighting passengers Throwing himself directly in the way of the latter the two exchanged a steady gaze Is your name Billings Is your name Johnson were simultaneous questions followed by the simultaneous exclamations Ned Enos Then there was a crushing grasp of hands repeated after a pause in testimony of ancient friendship and mister Billings returning to practical life asked Is that all your baggage Come I have a buggy here Eunice has heard the whistle and she ll be impatient to welcome you The impatience of Eunice missus Billings of course was not of long duration for in five minutes thereafter she stood at the door of her husband s chocolate colored villa receiving his friend J Edward Johnson was a tall thin gentleman of forty five A year before some letters signed Foster Kirkup company per Enos Billings had accidently revealed to him the whereabouts of the old friend of his youth with whom we now find him domiciled Enos said he as he stretched out his hand for the third cup of tea which he had taken only for the purpose of prolonging the pleasant table chat I wonder which of us is most changed You of course said mister Billings with your brown face and big moustache Your own brother wouldn t have known you if he had seen you last as I did with smooth cheeks and hair of unmerciful length Why not even your voice is the same That is easily accounted for replied mister Johnson But in your case Enos I am puzzled to find where the difference lies Your features seem to be but little changed now that I can examine them at leisure yet it is not the same face But really I never looked at you for so long a time in those days I beg pardon you used to be so so remarkably shy mister Billings blushed slightly and seemed at a loss what to answer His wife however burst into a merry laugh exclaiming Oh that was before the days of the A C He catching the infection laughed also in fact mister Johnson laughed but without knowing why The A C said mister Billings Bless me Eunice how long it is since we have talked of that summer I had almost forgotten that there ever was an A C Well the A C culminated in forty five You remember something of the society of Norridgeport the last winter you were there Abel Mallory for instance Let me think a moment said mister Johnson reflectively Really it seems like looking back a hundred years Mallory wasn t that the sentimental young man with wispy hair a tallowy skin and big sweaty hands who used to be spouting Carlyle on the reading evenings at Shelldrake s Yes to be sure and there was Hollins with his clerical face and infidel talk and Pauline Ringtop who used to say The Beautiful is the Good I can still hear her shrill voice singing Would that I were beautiful would that I were fair There was a hearty chorus of laughter at poor Miss Ringtop s expense It harmed no one however for the tar weed was already becoming thick over her Californian grave Oh I see said mister Billings you still remember the absurdities of those days In fact I think you partially saw through them then But I was younger and far from being so clear headed and I looked upon those evenings at Shelldrake s as being equal at least to the symposia of Plato Something in Mallory always repelled me I detested the sight of his thick nose with the flaring nostrils and his coarse half formed lips of the bluish color of raw corned beef But I looked upon these feelings as unreasonable prejudices and strove to conquer them seeing the admiration which he received from others He was an oracle on the subject of Nature Having eaten nothing for two years except Graham bread vegetables without salt and fruits fresh or dried he considered himself to have attained an antediluvian purity of health or that he would attain it so soon as two pimples on his left temple should have healed These pimples he looked upon as the last feeble stand made by the pernicious juices left from the meat he had formerly eaten and the coffee he had drunk His theory was that through a body so purged and purified none but true and natural impulses could find access to the soul Such indeed was the theory we all held Shelldrake was a man of more pretense than real cultivation as I afterwards discovered He was in good circumstances and always glad to receive us at his house as this made him virtually the chief of our tribe and the outlay for refreshments involved only the apples from his own orchard and water from his well Well twas in the early part of forty five I think in April when we were all gathered together discussing as usual the possibility of leading a life in accordance with Nature Abel Mallory was there and Hollins and Miss Ringtop and Faith Levis with her knitting and also Eunice Hazleton a lady whom you have never seen but you may take my wife as her representative I wish I could recollect some of the speeches made on that occasion Abel had but one pimple on his temple there was a purple spot where the other had been and was estimating that in two or three months more he would be a true unspoiled man His complexion nevertheless was more clammy and whey like than ever Yes said he I also am an Arcadian This false dual existence which I have been leading will soon be merged in the unity of Nature Our lives must conform to her sacred law Why can t we strip off these hollow Shams he made great use of that word and be our true selves pure perfect and divine Shelldrake however turning to his wife said Elviry how many up stairs rooms is there in that house down on the Sound Four besides three small ones under the roof Why what made you think of that Jesse said she I ve got an idea while Abel s been talking he answered We ve taken a house for the summer down the other side of Bridgeport right on the water where there s good fishing and a fine view of the Sound Now there s room enough for all of us at least all that can make it suit to go Abel you and Enos and Pauline and Eunice might fix matters so that we could all take the place in partnership and pass the summer together living a true and beautiful life in the bosom of Nature There we shall be perfectly free and untrammelled by the chains which still hang around us in Norridgeport You know how often we have wanted to be set on some island in the Pacific Ocean where we could build up a true society right from the start Now here s a chance to try the experiment for a few months anyhow Eunice clapped her hands yes you did and cried out Splendid Arcadian I ll give up my school for the summer Abel Mallory of course did not need to have the proposal repeated He was ready for anything which promised indolence and the indulgence of his sentimental tastes I will do the fellow the justice to say that he was not a hypocrite He firmly believed both in himself and his ideas especially the former He pushed both hands through the long wisps of his drab colored hair and threw his head back until his wide nostrils resembled a double door to his brain O Nature he said you have found your lost children We shall obey your neglected laws we shall hearken to your divine whispers we shall bring you back from your ignominious exile and place you on your ancestral throne The company was finally arranged to consist of the Shelldrakes Hollins Mallory Eunice Miss Ringtop and myself We did not give much thought either to the preparations in advance or to our mode of life when settled there We were to live near to Nature that was the main thing What shall we call the place asked Eunice Arcadia said Abel Mallory rolling up his large green eyes Then said Hollins let us constitute ourselves the Arcadian Club Aha interrupted mister Johnson I see The A C Yes you see the A C now but to understand it fully you should have had a share in those Arcadian experiences It was a lovely afternoon in June when we first approached Arcadia Perkins Brown Shelldrake s boy of all work awaited us at the door He had been sent on two or three days in advance to take charge of the house and seemed to have had enough of hermit life for he hailed us with a wild whoop throwing his straw hat half way up one of the poplars Perkins was a boy of fifteen the child of poor parents who were satisfied to get him off their hands regardless as to what humanitarian theories might be tested upon him As the Arcadian Club recognized no such thing as caste he was always admitted to our meetings and understood just enough of our conversation to excite a silly ambition in his slow mind Our board that evening was really tempting The absence of meat was compensated to us by the crisp and racy onions and I craved only a little salt which had been interdicted as a most pernicious substance I sat at one corner of the table beside Perkins Brown who took an opportunity while the others were engaged in conversation to jog my elbow gently As I turned towards him he said nothing but dropped his eyes significantly The little rascal had the lid of a blacking box filled with salt upon his knee and was privately seasoning his onions and radishes I blushed at the thought of my hypocrisy but the onions were so much better that I couldn t help dipping into the lid with him Oh said Eunice we must send for some oil and vinegar This lettuce is very nice Oil and vinegar exclaimed Abel Why yes said she innocently they are both vegetable substances Abel at first looked rather foolish but quickly recovering himself said All vegetable substances are not proper for food you would not taste the poison oak or sit under the upas tree of Java Well Abel Eunice rejoined how are we to distinguish what is best for us How are we to know what vegetables to choose or what animal and mineral substances to avoid I will tell you he answered with a lofty air See here pointing to his temple where the second pimple either from the change of air or because in the excitement of the last few days he had forgotten it was actually healed My blood is at last pure The struggle between the natural and the unnatural is over and I am beyond the depraved influences of my former taste My instincts are now therefore entirely pure also What is good for man to eat that I shall have a natural desire to eat what is bad will be naturally repelled How does the cow distinguish between the wholesome and the poisonous herbs of the meadow And is man less than a cow that he can not cultivate his instincts to an equal point Let me walk through the woods and I can tell you every berry and root which God designed for food though I know not its name and have never seen it before I shall make use of my time during our sojourn here to test by my purified instinct every substance animal mineral and vegetable upon which the human race subsists and to create a catalogue of the True Food of Man Our lazy life during the hot weather had become a little monotonous The Arcadian plan had worked tolerably well on the whole for there was very little for any one to do missus Shelldrake and Perkins Brown excepted Our conversation however lacked spirit and variety We were perhaps unconsciously a little tired of hearing and assenting to the same sentiments But one evening about this time Hollins struck upon a variation the consequences of which he little foresaw We had been reading one of Bulwer s works the weather was too hot for Psychology and came upon this paragraph or something like it Ah Behind the Veil We see the summer smile of the Earth enamelled meadow and limpid stream but what hides she in her sunless heart Caverns of serpents or grottoes of priceless gems Youth whose soul sits on thy countenance thyself wearing no mask strive not to lift the masks of others Be content with what thou seest and wait until Time and Experience shall teach thee to find jealousy behind the sweet smile and hatred under the honeyed word This seemed to us a dark and bitter reflection but one or another of us recalled some illustration of human hypocrisy and the evidences by the simple fact of repetition gradually led to a division of opinion Hollins Shelldrake and Miss Ringtop on the dark side and the rest of us on the bright The last however contented herself with quoting from her favorite poet Gamaliel J Gawthrop I look beyond thy brow s concealment I see thy spirit s dark revealment Thy inner self betrayed I see Thy coward craven shivering ME We think we know one another exclaimed Hollins but do we We see the faults of others their weaknesses their disagreeable qualities and we keep silent How much we should gain were candor as universal as concealment Then each one seeing himself as others see him would truly know himself How much misunderstanding might be avoided how much hidden shame be removed hopeless because unspoken love made glad honest admiration cheer its object uttered sympathy mitigate misfortune in short how much brighter and happier the world would become if each one expressed everywhere and at all times his true and entire feeling Why even Evil would lose half its power There seemed to be so much practical wisdom in these views that we were all dazzled and half convinced at the start So when Hollins turning towards me as he continued exclaimed Come why should not this candor be adopted in our Arcadia Will any one will you Enos commence at once by telling me now to my face my principal faults I answered after a moment s reflection You have a great deal of intellectual arrogance and you are physically very indolent He did not flinch from the self invited test though he looked a little surprised Well put said he though I do not say that you are entirely correct Now what are my merits You are clear sighted I answered an earnest seeker after truth and courageous in the avowal of your thoughts This restored the balance and we soon began to confess our own private faults and weaknesses Though the confessions did not go very deep no one betraying any thing we did not all know already yet they were sufficient to strengthen Hollins in his new idea and it was unanimously resolved that Candor should thenceforth be the main charm of our Arcadian life The next day Abel who had resumed his researches after the True Food came home to supper with a healthier color than I had before seen on his face Do you know said he looking shyly at Hollins that I begin to think Beer must be a natural beverage There was an auction in the village to day as I passed through and I stopped at a cake stand to get a glass of water as it was very hot There was no water only beer so I thought I would try a glass simply as an experiment Really the flavor was very agreeable And it occurred to me on the way home that all the elements contained in beer are vegetable Besides fermentation is a natural process I think the question has never been properly tested before But the alcohol exclaimed Hollins I could not distinguish any either by taste or smell I know that chemical analysis is said to show it but may not the alcohol be created somehow during the analysis Abel said Hollins in a fresh burst of candor you will never be a Reformer until you possess some of the commonest elements of knowledge The rest of us were much diverted it was a pleasant relief to our monotonous amiability Abel however had a stubborn streak in his character The next day he sent Perkins Brown to Bridgeport for a dozen bottles of Beer Perkins either intentionally or by mistake I always suspected the former brought pint bottles of Scotch ale which he placed in the coolest part of the cellar The evening happened to be exceedingly hot and sultry and as we were all fanning ourselves and talking languidly Abel bethought him of his beer In his thirst he drank the contents of the first bottle almost at a single draught The effect of beer said he depends I think on the commixture of the nourishing principle of the grain with the cooling properties of the water Perhaps hereafter a liquid food of the same character may be invented which shall save us from mastication and all the diseases of the teeth Hollins and Shelldrake at his invitation divided a bottle between them and he took a second The potent beverage was not long in acting on a brain so unaccustomed to its influence He grew unusually talkative and sentimental in a few minutes Oh sing somebody he sighed in hoarse rapture the night was made for Song Miss Ringtop nothing loath immediately commenced When stars are in the quiet skies but scarcely had she finished the first verse before Abel interrupted her Candor s the order of the day isn t it he asked Yes Yes two or three answered Well then said he candidly Pauline you ve got the darn dest squeaky voice Miss Ringtop gave a faint little scream of horror Oh never mind he continued We act according to impulse don t we And I ve the impulse to swear and it s right Let Nature have her way Listen Damn damn damn damn I never knew it was so easy Why there s a pleasure in it Try it Pauline try it on me Oh ooh was all Miss Ringtop could utter Abel Abel exclaimed Hollins the beer has got into your head No it isn t Beer it s Candor said Abel It s your own proposal Hollins Suppose it s evil to swear isn t it better I should express it and be done with it than keep it bottled up to ferment in my mind Oh you re a precious consistent old humbug you are And therewith he jumped off the stoop and went dancing awkwardly down toward the water singing in a most unmelodious voice Tis home where er the heart is We had an unusually silent breakfast the next morning Abel scarcely spoke which the others attributed to a natural feeling of shame after his display of the previous evening Hollins and Shelldrake discussed Temperance with a special view to his edification and Miss Ringtop favored us with several quotations about the maddening bowl but he paid no attention to them The forenoon was overcast with frequent showers Each one occupied his or her room until dinner time when we met again with something of the old geniality There was an evident effort to restore our former flow of good feeling Abel s experience with the beer was freely discussed He insisted strongly that he had not been laboring under its effects and proposed a mutual test He Shelldrake and Hollins were to drink it in equal measures and compare observations as to their physical sensations The others agreed quite willingly I thought but I refused There was a sound of loud voices as we approached the stoop Hollins Shelldrake and his wife and Abel Mallory were sitting together near the door Perkins Brown as usual was crouched on the lowest step with one leg over the other and rubbing the top of his boot with a vigor which betrayed to me some secret mirth He looked up at me from under his straw hat with the grin of a malicious Puck glanced toward the group and made a curious gesture with his thumb There were several empty pint bottles on the stoop Now are you sure you can bear the test we heard Hollins ask as we approached Bear it Why to be sure replied Shelldrake if I couldn t bear it or if you couldn t your theory s done for Try I can stand it as long as you can Well then said Hollins I think you are a very ordinary man I derive no intellectual benefit from my intercourse with you but your house is convenient to me I m under no obligations for your hospitality however because my company is an advantage to you Indeed if I were treated according to my deserts you couldn t do enough for me missus Shelldrake was up in arms Indeed she exclaimed I think you get as good as you deserve and more too Elvira said he with a benevolent condescension I have no doubt you think so for your mind belongs to the lowest and most material sphere You have your place in Nature and you fill it but it is not for you to judge of intelligences which move only on the upper planes Hollins said Shelldrake Elviry s a good wife and a sensible woman and I won t allow you to turn up your nose at her I am not surprised he answered that you should fail to stand the test I didn t expect it Let me try it on you cried Shelldrake You now have some intellect I don t deny that but not so much by a long shot as you think you have Besides that you re awfully selfish in your opinions You won t admit that anybody can be right who differs from you You ve sponged on me for a long time but I suppose I ve learned something from you so we ll call it even I think however that what you call acting according to impulse is simply an excuse to cover your own laziness Gosh that s it interrupted Perkins jumping up then recollecting himself he sank down on the steps again and shook with a suppressed Ho ho ho Hollins however drew himself up with an exasperated air Shelldrake said he I pity you I always knew your ignorance but I thought you honest in your human character I never suspected you of envy and malice However the true Reformer must expect to be misunderstood and misrepresented by meaner minds That love which I bear to all creatures teaches me to forgive you Without such love all plans of progress must fail Is it not so Abel Shelldrake could only ejaculate the words Pity Forgive in his most contemptuous tone while missus Shelldrake rocking violently in her chair gave utterance to the peculiar clucking ts ts ts ts whereby certain women express emotions too deep for words Abel roused by Hollins question answered with a sudden energy Love there is no love in the world Where will you find it Tell me and I ll go there Love I d like to see it If all human hearts were like mine we might have an Arcadia but most men have no hearts The world is a miserable hollow deceitful shell of vanity and hypocrisy No let us give up We were born before our time this age is not worthy of us Hollins stared at the speaker in utter amazement Shelldrake gave a long whistle and finally gasped out Well what next None of us were prepared for such a sudden and complete wreck of our Arcadian scheme The foundations had been sapped before it is true but we had not perceived it and now in two short days the whole edifice tumbled about our ears Though it was inevitable we felt a shock of sorrow and a silence fell upon us Only that scamp of a Perkins Brown chuckling and rubbing his boot really rejoiced I could have kicked him We all went to bed feeling that the charm of our Arcadian life was over In the first revulsion of feeling I was perhaps unjust to my associates I see now more clearly the causes of those vagaries which originated in a genuine aspiration and failed from an ignorance of the true nature of Man quite as much as from the egotism of the individuals Other attempts at reorganizing Society were made about the same time by men of culture and experience but in the A C we had neither Our leaders had caught a few half truths which in their minds were speedily warped

YANKEE DUDE LL DO BY S E KISER When Cholly swung his golf stick on the links Or knocked the tennis ball across the net With his bangs done up in cunning little kinks When he wore the tallest collar he could get Oh it was the fashion then To impale him on the pen To regard him as a being made of putty through and through But his racquet s laid away He is roughing it to day And heroically proving that the Yankee dude ll do When Algy as some knight of old arrayed Was the leading figure at the fawncy ball We loathed him for the silly part he played He was set down as a monkey that was all Oh we looked upon him then As unfit to class with men As one whose heart was putty and whose brains were made of glue But he s thrown his cane away And he grasps a gun to day While the world beholds him knowing that the Yankee dude ll do When Clarence cruised about upon his yacht Or drove out with his footman through the park His mamma it was generally thought Ought to have him in her keeping after

dude ll do How they hurled themselves against the angry foe In the jungle and the trenches on the hill When the word to charge was given every dude was on the go He was there to die to capture or to kill Oh he struck his level when Men were called upon again To preserve the ancient glory of the old red white and blue He has thrown his spats away He is wearing spurs to day And the world will please take notice that the Yankee dude ll do SPELLING DOWN THE MASTER BY EDWARD EGGLESTON I low said missus Means as she stuffed the tobacco into her cob pipe after supper on that eventful Wednesday evening I low they ll app int the Squire to gin out the words to night They mos always do you see kase he s the peartest ole man in this deestrick and I low some of the young fellers would have to git up and dust ef they would keep up to him And he uses sech remarkable smart words He speaks so polite too But laws don t I remember when he was poarer nor Job s turkey Twenty year ago when he come to these ere diggin s that air Squire Hawkins was a poar Yankee school master that said pail instid of bucket and that called a cow a caow and that couldn t tell to save his gizzard what we meant by low and by right smart But he s larnt our ways now an he s jest as civilized as the rest of us You would n know he d ever been a Yankee He didn t stay poar long Not he He jest married a right rich girl He he And the old woman grinned at Ralph and then at Mirandy and then at the rest until Ralph shuddered Nothing was so frightful to him as to be fawned on by this grinning ogre whose few lonesome blackish teeth seemed ready to devour him He didn t stay poar you bet a hoss and with this the coal was deposited on the pipe and the lips began to crack like parchment as each puff of smoke escaped He married rich you see and here another significant look at the young master and another fond look at Mirandy as she puffed away reflectively His wife hadn t no book larnin She d been through the spellin book wunst and had got as fur as asperity on it a second time But she couldn t read a word when she was married and never could She warn t overly smart She hadn t hardly got the sense the law allows But schools was skase in them air days and besides book larnin don t do no good to a woman Makes her stuck up I never knowed but one gal in my life as had ciphered into fractions and she was so dog on stuck up that she turned up her nose one night at a apple peelin bekase I tuck a sheet off the bed to splice out the tablecloth which was ruther short And the sheet was mos clean too Had n been slep on more n wunst or twicet But I was goin fer to say that when Squire Hawkins married Virginny Gray he got a heap o money or what s the same thing mostly a heap o good land And that s better n book larnin says I Ef a gal had gone clean through all eddication and got to the rule of three itself that would n buy a feather bed Squire Hawkins jest put eddication agin the gal s farm and traded even an ef ary one of em got swindled I never heerd no complaints And here she looked at Ralph in triumph her hard face splintering into the hideous semblance of a smile And Mirandy cast a blushing gushing all imploring and all confiding look on the young master I say ole woman broke in old Jack I say wot is all this ere spoutin about the Square fer and old Jack having bit off an ounce of pigtail returned the plug to his pocket As for Ralph he fell into a sort of terror He had a guilty feeling that this speech of the old lady s had somehow committed him beyond recall to Mirandy He did not see visions of breach of promise suits But he trembled at the thought of an avenging big brother Hanner you kin come along too ef you re a mind when you git the dishes washed said missus Means to the bound girl as she shut and latched the back door The Means family had built a new house in front of the old one as a sort of advertisement of bettered circumstances an eruption of shoddy feeling but when the new building was completed they found themselves unable to occupy it for anything else than a lumber room and so except a parlor which Mirandy had made an effort to furnish a little in hope of the blissful time when somebody should set up with her of evenings the new building was almost unoccupied and the family went in and out through the back door which indeed was the front door also for according to a curious custom the front of the house was placed toward the south though the big road Hoosier for highway ran along the northwest side or rather past the northwest corner of it When the old woman had spoken thus to Hannah and had latched the door she muttered That gal don t never show no gratitude fer favors to which Bud rejoined that he didn t think she had no great sight to be pertickler thankful fer To which missus Means made no reply thinking it best perhaps not to wake up her dutiful son on so interesting a theme as her treatment of Hannah Ralph felt glad that he was this evening to go to another boarding place He should not hear the rest of the controversy Ralph walked to the school house with Bill They were friends again For when Hank Banta s ducking and his dogged obstinacy in sitting in his wet clothes had brought on a serious fever Ralph had called together the big boys and had said We must take care of one another boys Who will volunteer to take turns sitting up with Henry He put his own name down and all the rest followed William Means and myself will sit up to night said Ralph And poor Bill had been from that moment the teacher s friend He was chosen to be Ralph s companion He was Puppy Means no longer Hank could not be conquered by kindness and the teacher was made to feel the bitterness of his resentment long after But Bill Means was for the time entirely placated and he and Ralph went to spelling school together Every family furnished a candle There were yellow dips and white dips burning smoking and flaring There was laughing and talking and giggling and simpering and ogling and flirting and courting What a full dress party is to Fifth Avenue a spelling school is to Hoopole County It is an occasion which is metaphorically inscribed with this legend Choose your partners Spelling is only a blind in Hoopole County as is dancing on Fifth Avenue But as there are some in society who love dancing for its own sake so in Flat Creek district there were those who loved spelling for its own sake and who smelling the battle from afar had come to try their skill in this tournament hoping to freshen the laurels they had won in their school days I low said mister Means speaking as the principal school trustee I low our friend the Square is jest the man to boss this ere consarn to night Ef nobody objects I ll app int him Come Square don t be bashful Walk up to the trough fodder or no fodder as the man said to his donkey There was a general giggle at this and many of the young swains took occasion to nudge the girls alongside them ostensibly for the purpose of making them see the joke but really for the pure pleasure of nudging The Greeks figured Cupid as naked probably because he wears so many disguises that they could not select a costume for him The Squire came to the front Ralph made an inventory of the agglomeration which bore the name of Squire Hawkins as follows one A swallow tail coat of indefinite age worn only on state occasions when its owner was called to figure in his public capacity Either the Squire had grown too large or the coat too small two A pair of black gloves the most phenomenal abnormal and unexpected apparition conceivable in Flat Creek district where the preachers wore no coats in the summer and where a black glove was never seen except on the hands of the Squire three A wig of that dirty waxen color so common to wigs This one showed a continual inclination to slip off the owner s smooth bald pate and the Squire had frequently to adjust it As his hair had been red the wig did not accord with his face and the hair ungrayed was doubly discordant with a countenance shriveled by age four A semicircular row of whiskers hedging the edge of the jaw and chin These were dyed a frightful dead black such a color as belonged to no natural hair or beard that ever existed At the roots there was a quarter of an inch of white giving the whiskers the appearance of having been stuck on five A pair of spectacles with tortoise shell rim Wont to slip off six A glass eye purchased of a peddler and differing in color from its natural mate perpetually getting out of focus by turning in or out seven A set of false teeth badly fitted and given to bobbing up and down eight The Squire proper to whom these patches were loosely attached It is an old story that a boy wrote home to his father begging him to come West because mighty mean men get into office out here But Ralph concluded that some Yankees had taught school in Hoopole County who would not have held a high place in the educational institutions of Massachusetts Hawkins had some New England idioms but they were well overlaid by a Western pronunciation Ladies and gentlemen he began shoving up his spectacles and sucking his lips over his white teeth to keep them in place ladies and gentlemen young men and maidens raley I m obleeged to mister Means fer this honor and the Squire took both hands and turned the top of his head round half an inch Then he adjusted his spectacles Whether he was obliged to mister Means for the honor of being compared to a donkey was not clear I feel in the inmost compartments of my animal spirits a most happifying sense of the success and futility of all my endeavors to sarve the people of Flat Creek deestrick and the people of Tomkins township in my weak way and manner This burst of eloquence was delivered with a constrained air and an apparent sense of a danger that he Squire Hawkins might fall to pieces in his weak way and manner and of the success and futility of all attempts at reconstruction For by this time the ghastly pupil of the left eye which was black was looking away round to the left while the little blue one on the right twinkled cheerfully toward the front The front teeth would drop down so that the Squire s mouth was kept nearly closed and his words whistled through I feel as if I could be grandiloquent on this interesting occasion twisting his scalp round but raley I must forego any such exertions It is spelling you want Spelling is the corner stone the grand underlying subterfuge of a good eddication I put the spellin book prepared by the great Daniel Webster alongside the Bible I do raley I think I may put it ahead of the Bible Fer if it wurn t fer spellin books and sich occasions as these where would the Bible be I should like to know The man who got up who compounded this work of inextricable valoo was a benufactor to the whole human race or any other Here the spectacles fell off The Squire replaced them in some confusion gave the top of his head another twist and felt of his glass eye while poor Shocky stared in wonder and Betsey Short rolled from side to side in the effort to suppress her giggle missus Means and the other old ladies looked the applause they could not speak I app int Larkin Lanham and Jeems Buchanan fer captings said the Squire And the two young men thus named took a stick and tossed it from hand to hand to decide which should have the first choice One tossed the stick to the other who held it fast just where he happened to catch it Then the first placed his hand above the second and so the hands were alternately changed to the top The one who held the stick last without room for the other to take hold had gained the lot This was tried three times As Larkin held the stick twice out of three times he had the choice He hesitated a moment Everybody looked toward tall Jim Phillips But Larkin was fond of a venture on unknown seas and so he said I take the master while a buzz of surprise ran round the room and the captain of the other side as if afraid his opponent would withdraw the choice retorted quickly and with a little smack of exultation and defiance in his voice And I take Jeems Phillips And soon all present except a few of the old folks found themselves ranged in opposing hosts the poor spellers lagging in with what grace they could at the foot of the two divisions The Squire opened his spelling book and began to give out the words to the two captains who stood up and spelled against each other It was not long until Larkin spelled really with one l and had to sit down in confusion while a murmur of satisfaction ran through the ranks of the opposing forces His own side bit their lips The slender figure of the young teacher took the place of the fallen leader and the excitement made the house very quiet Ralph dreaded the loss of prestige he would suffer if he should be easily spelled down And at the moment of rising he saw in the darkest corner the figure of a well dressed young man sitting in the shadow Why should his evil genius haunt him But by a strong effort he turned his attention away from doctor Small and listened carefully to the words which the Squire did not pronounce very distinctly spelling them with extreme deliberation This gave him an air of hesitation which disappointed those on his own side They wanted him to spell with a dashing assurance But he did not begin a word until he had mentally felt his way through it After ten minutes of spelling hard words Jeems Buchanan the captain on the other side spelled atrocious with an s instead of a c and subsided his first choice Jeems Phillips coming up against the teacher This brought the excitement to fever heat For though Ralph was chosen first it was entirely on trust and most of the company were disappointed The champion who now stood up against the school master was a famous speller Jim Phillips was a tall lank stoop shouldered fellow who had never distinguished himself in any other pursuit than spelling Except in this one art of spelling he was of no account He could not catch well or bat well in ball He could not throw well enough to make his mark in that famous Western game of bull pen He did not succeed well in any study but that of Webster s Elementary But in that he was to use the usual Flat Creek locution in that he was a hoss This genius for spelling is in some people a sixth sense a matter of intuition Some spellers are born and not made and their facility reminds one of the mathematical prodigies that crop out every now and then to bewilder the world Bud Means foreseeing that Ralph would be pitted against Jim Phillips had warned his friend that Jim could spell like thunder and lightning and that it took a powerful smart speller to beat him for he knew a heap of spelling book To have spelled down the master is next thing to having whipped the biggest bully in Hoopole County and Jim had spelled down the last three masters He divided the hero worship of the district with Bud Means For half an hour the Squire gave out hard words What a blessed thing our crooked orthography is Without it there could be no spelling schools As Ralph discovered his opponent s metal he became more and more cautious He was now satisfied that Jim would eventually beat him The fellow evidently knew more about the spelling book than old Noah Webster himself As he stood there with his dull face and long sharp nose his hands behind his back and his voice spelling infallibly it seemed to Hartsook that his superiority must lie in his nose Ralph s cautiousness answered a double purpose it enabled him to tread surely and it was mistaken by Jim for weakness Phillips was now confident that he should carry off the scalp of the fourth school master before the evening was over He spelled eagerly confidently brilliantly Stoop shouldered as he was he began to straighten up In the minds of all the company the odds were in his favor He saw this and became ambitious to distinguish himself by spelling without giving the matter any thought Ralph always believed that he would have been speedily defeated by Phillips had it not been for two thoughts which braced him The sinister shadow of young doctor Small sitting in the dark corner by the water bucket nerved him A victory over Phillips was a defeat to one who wished only ill to the young school master The other thought that kept his pluck alive was the recollection of Bull He approached a word as Bull approached the raccoon He did not take hold until he was sure of his game When he took hold it was with a quiet assurance of success As Ralph spelled in this dogged way for half an hour the hardest words the Squire could find the excitement steadily rose in all parts of the house and Ralph s friends even ventured to whisper that maybe Jim had cotched his match after all But Phillips never doubted of his success Theodolite said the Squire T h e the o d od theod o theodo l y t e theodolite spelled the champion Next said the Squire nearly losing his teeth in his excitement Ralph spelled the word slowly and correctly and the conquered champion sat down in confusion The excitement was so great for some minutes that the spelling was suspended Everybody in the house had shown sympathy with one or the other of the combatants except the silent shadow in the corner It had not moved during the contest and did not show any interest now in the result Gewhilliky crickets Thunder and lightning Licked him all to smash said Bud rubbing his hands on his knees That beats my time all holler And Betsey Short giggled until her tuck comb fell out though she was not on the defeated side Shocky got up and danced with pleasure But one suffocating look from the aqueous eyes of Mirandy destroyed the last spark of Ralph s pleasure in his triumph and sent that awful below zero feeling all through him He s powerful smart is the master said old Jack to mister Pete Jones He ll beat the whole kit and tuck of em afore he s through I know d he was smart That s the reason I tuck him proceeded mister Means Yaas but he don t lick enough Not nigh answered Pete Jones No lickin no larnin says I It was now not so hard The other spellers on the opposite side went down quickly under the hard words which the Squire gave out The master had mowed down all but a few his opponents had given up the battle and all had lost their keen interest in a contest to which there could be but one conclusion for there were only the poor spellers left But Ralph Hartsook ran against a stump where he was least expecting it It was the Squire s custom when one of the smaller scholars or poorer spellers rose to spell against the master to give out eight or ten easy words that they might have some breathing spell before being slaughtered and then to give a poser or two which soon settled them He let them run a little as a cat does a doomed mouse There was now but one person left on the opposite side and as she rose in her blue calico dress Ralph recognized Hannah the bound girl at old Jack Means s She had not attended school in the district and had never spelled in spelling school before and was chosen last as an uncertain quantity The Squire began with easy words of two syllables from that page of Webster so well known to all who ever thumbed it as baker from the word that stands at the top of the page She spelled these words in an absent and uninterested manner As everybody knew that she would have to go down as soon as this preliminary skirmishing was over everybody began to get ready to go home and already there was the buzz of preparation Young men were timidly asking girls if they could see them safe home which was the approved formula and were trembling in mortal fear of the mitten Presently the Squire thinking it time to close the contest pulled his scalp forward adjusted his glass eye which had been examining his nose long enough and turned over the leaves of the book to the great words at the place known to spellers as incomprehensibility and began to give out those words of eight syllables with the accent on the sixth Listless scholars now turned round and ceased to whisper in order to be in at the master s final triumph But to their surprise ole Miss Meanses white nigger as some of them called her in allusion to her slavish life spelled these great words with as perfect ease as the master Still not doubting the result the Squire turned from place to place and selected all the hard words he could find The school became utterly quiet the excitement was too great for the ordinary buzz Would Meanses Hanner beat the master beat the master that had laid out Jim Phillips Everybody s sympathy was now turned to Hannah Ralph noticed that even Shocky had deserted him and that his face grew brilliant every time Hannah spelled a word In fact Ralph deserted himself As he saw the fine timid face of the girl so long oppressed flush and shine with interest as he looked at the rather low but broad and intelligent brow and the fresh white complexion and saw the rich womanly nature coming to the surface under the influence of applause and sympathy he did not want to beat If he had not felt that a victory given would insult her he would have missed intentionally The bulldog the stern relentless setting of the will had gone he knew not whither And there had come in its place as he looked in that face a something which he did not understand You did not gentle reader the first time it came to you The Squire was puzzled He had given out all the hard words in the book He again pulled the top of his head forward Then he wiped his spectacles and put them on Then out of the depths of his pocket he fished up a list of words just coming into use in those days words not in the spelling book He regarded the paper attentively with his blue right eye His black left eye meanwhile fixed itself in such a stare on Mirandy Means that she shuddered and hid her eyes in her red silk handkerchief Daguerreotype sniffed the Squire It was Ralph s turn D a u dau Next And Hannah spelled it right Such a buzz followed that Betsey Short s giggle could not be heard but Shocky shouted Hanner beat my Hanner spelled down the master And Ralph went over and congratulated her And doctor Small sat perfectly still in the corner And then the Squire called them to order and said As our friend Hanner Thomson is the only one left on her side she will have to spell against nearly all on t other side I shall therefore take the liberty of procrastinating the completion of this interesting and exacting contest until to morrow evening I hope our friend Hanner may again carry off the cypress crown of glory There is nothing better for us than healthful and kindly simulation doctor Small who knew the road to practice escorted Mirandy and Bud went home with somebody else The others of the Means family hurried on while Hannah the champion stayed behind a minute to speak to Shocky Perhaps it was because Ralph saw that Hannah must go alone that he suddenly remembered having left something which was of no consequence and resolved to go round by mister Means s and get it

lots makes fortunes and lots gits bu sted at it but still it s on y simple jestice to acknowledge at there re absolute p ints in the game at takes scientific principles to figger out and a mighty level headed feller to dim onstrate don t you understand Checkers is a old enough game ef age is any rickommendation and it s a evident fact too at the tooth of time as the feller says which fer the last six thousand years has gained some reputation fer a eatin up things in giner l don t pear to a gnawed much of a hole in Checkers jedgin from the checker board of to day and the ones at they re uccasionally shovellin out at Pom p y i er whatever its name is Turned up a checker board there not long ago I wuz readin bout at still had the spots on as plain and fresh as the modern white pine board o our n squared off with pencil marks and pokeberry juice These is facts at history herself has dug out and of course it ain t fer me ner you to turn our nose up at Checkers whuther we ever tamper with the fool game er not Fur s that s concerned I don t p tend to be no checker player myse f but I know d a feller onc t at could play and sorto made a business of it and that man in my opinion was a geenyus Name wuz Wesley Cotterl John Wesley Cotterl jest plain Wes as us fellers round the Shoe Shop ust to call him ust to allus make the Shoe Shop his headquarters like and rain er shine wet er dry you d allus find Wes on hands ready to banter some feller fer a game er jest a settin humped up there over the checker board all alone a cipher n out some new move er nuther and whistlin low and solem to hisse f like and a payin no attention to nobody And I ll tell you Wes Cotterl wuz no man s fool as sly as you keep it He wuz a deep thinker Wes wuz and ef he d a jest turned that mind o his loose on preachin fer instunce and the terpertation o the Bible don t you know Wes ud a worked p ints out o there at no livin expounderers ever got in gunshot of But Wes he didn t pear to be cut out fer nothin much but jest Checker playin Oh of course he could knock round his own woodpile some and garden a little more er less and the neighbers ust to find Wes purty handy bout trimmin fruit trees you understand and workin in among the worms and cattapillers in the vines and shrubbery and the like And handlin bees They wuzn t no man under the heavens at knowed more bout handlin bees n Wes Cotterl Settlin the blame things when they wuz a swarmin and a robbin hives and all sich fool resks W y I ve saw Wes Cotterl fore now when a swarm of bees ud settle in a orchard like they will sometimes you know I ve saw Wes Cotterl jest roll up his shirt sleeves and bend down a apple tree limb at wuz jest kivvered with the pesky things and scrape em back into the hive with his naked hands by the quart and gallon and never git a scratch You couldn t hire a bee to sting Wes Cotterl But lazy I think that man had railly ort to a been a Injun He wuz the fust and on y man at ever I laid eyes on at wuz too lazy to drap a checker man to p int out the right road fer a feller at ast him onc t the way to Burke s Mill and Wes ithout ever a liftin eye er finger jest sorto crooked out that mouth o his n in the direction the feller wanted and says H yonder and went on with his whistlin But all this hain t Checkers and that s what I started out to tell ye Wes had a way o jest natchurly a cleanin out anybody and ever body at ud he p hold up a checker board Wes wuzn t what you d call a lively player at all ner a competiter at talked much crost the board er made much furse over a game whilse he wuz a playin He had his faults o course and would take back moves casion ly er inch up on you ef you didn t watch him mebby But as a rule Wes had the insight to grasp the idy of whoever wuz a playin ag in him and his style o game you understand and wuz on the lookout continual and under sich circumstances could play as honest a game o Checkers as the babe unborn One thing in Wes s favor allus wuz the feller s temper Nothin peared to aggervate Wes and nothin on earth could break his slow and lazy way o takin his own time fer ever thing You jest couldn t crowd Wes er git him rattled anyway Jest peared to have one fixed principle and that wuz to take plenty o time and never make no move ithout a ciphern n ahead on the prob ble consequences don t you understand Be shore you re right Wes ud say a lettin up fer a second on that low and sorry like little wind through the keyhole whistle o his and a nosin out a place whur he could swap one man fer two Be shore you re right and somep n after this style wuz Wes s way Be shore you re right whistling a long lonesome bar of Barbara Allen and then another long retarded bar go ahead and by the time the feller ud git through with his whistlin and a stoppin and a startin in ag in he d be about three men ahead to your one And then he d jest go on with his whistlin sef nothin had happened and mebby you a jest a rearin and a callin him all the mean outlandish ornry names at you could lay tongue to But Wes s good nature I reckon was the thing at he ped him out as much as any other p ints the feller had And Wes ud allus win in the long run I don t keer who played ag inst him It was on y a question o time with Wes o waxin it to the best of em Lots o players has tackled Wes and right at the start ud mebby give him trouble but in the long run now mind ye in the long run no mortal man I reckon had any business o rubbin knees with Wes Cotterl under no airthly checker board in all this vale o tears I mind onc t th come along a high toned feller from in around In i nop lus somers Wuz a lawyer er some p fessional kind o man Had a big yaller luther kivvered book under his arm and a bunch o these ere big en vel op s and a lot o suppeenies stickin out o his breastpocket Mighty slick lookin feller he wuz wore a stovepipe hat sorto set way back on his head so s to show off his Giner l Jackson forr ed don t you know Well sir this feller struck the place on some business er other and then missed the hack at ort to a tuk him out o here sooner n it did take him out And whilse he wuz a loafin round sorto lonesome like a feller allus is in a strange place you know he kindo drapped in on our crowd at the Shoe Shop ostenchably to git a boot strop stitched on but I knowed the minute he set foot in the door at that feller wanted comp ny wuss n cobblin Well as good luck would have it there set Wes as usual with the checker board in his lap a playin all by hisse f and a whistlin so low and solem like and sad it railly made the crowd seem like a religious getherun o some kind er other we wuz all so quiet and still like as the man come in Well the stranger stated his business set down tuk off his boot and set there nussin his foot and talkin weather fer ten minutes I reckon fore he ever peared to notice Wes at all We wuz all back ard anyhow bout talkin much besides we knowed long afore he come in all about how hot the weather wuz and the pore chance there wuz o rain and all that and so the subject had purty well died out when jest then the feller s eyes struck Wes and the checker board and I ll never fergit the warm salvation smile at flashed over him at the promisin discovery What says he a grinnin like a angel and a edgin his cheer to rds Wes have we a checker board and checkers here We hev says I knowin at Wes wouldn t let go o that whistle long enough to answer more n to mebby nod his head And who is your best player says the feller kindo pitiful like with another inquirin look at Wes Him says I a pokin Wes with a peg float But Wes on y spit kindo absent like and went on with his whistlin Much of a player is he says the feller with a sorto doubtful smile at Wes ag in Plays a purty good hick ry says I a pokin Wes ag in Wes says I here s a gentleman at ud mebby like to take a hand with you there and give you a few idys says I Yes says the stranger eager like a settin his plug hat keerful up in the empty shelvin and a rubbin his hands and smilin as confident like as old Hoyle hisse f Yes indeed I d be glad to give the gentleman meanin Wes a idy er two about Checkers ef he d jest as lief cause I reckon ef there re any one thing at I do know more about an another it s Checkers says he and there re no game at delights me more pervidin o course I find a competiter at kin make it anyways inte rest in Got much of a rickord on Checkers says I Well says the feller I don t like to brag but I ve never ben beat in any legitimut contest says he and I ve played more n one o them he says here and there round the country Of course your friend here he went on smilin sociable at Wes he ll take it all in good part ef I should happen to lead him a little jest as I d do he says ef it wuz possible fer him to lead me Wes says I has warmed the wax in the yeers of some mighty good checker players says I as he squared the board around still a whistlin to hisse f like as the stranger tuk his place a smilin like and roachin back his hair Move says Wes No says the feller with a polite flourish of his hand the first move shall be your n And by jucks fer all he wouldn t take even the advantage of a starter he flaxed it to Wes the fust game in less n fifteen minutes Right shore you ve give me your best player he says smilin round at the crowd as Wes set squarin the board fer another game and whistlin as onconcerned like as ef nothin had happened more n ordinary S your move says Wes a squintin out into the game bout forty foot from shore and a whistlin purt nigh in a whisper Well sir it peared like the feller railly didn t try to play and you could see too at Wes knowed he d about met his match and played accordin He didn t make no move at all at he didn t give keerful thought to whilse the feller well as I wuz sayin it jest peared like Checkers wuz child s play fer him Putt in most o the time long through the game a sayin things calkilated to kindo bore a ordinary man But Wes helt hisse f purty level and didn t show no signs and kep up his whistlin mighty well considerin Reckon you play the fiddle too as well as Checkers says the feller laughin as Wes come a whistlin out of the little end of the second game and went on a fixin fer the next round S my move says Wes thout seemin to notice the feller s tantalizin words whatsomever L this time thinks I mister Smarty from the me trolopin deestricts you re liable to git waxed shore But the feller didn t pear to think so at all and played right ahead as glib like and keerless as ever casion ly a throwin in them sircastic remarks o his n bout bein slow and shore bout things in gineral Liked to see that he said Liked to see fellers do things with plenty o deliberation and even ef a feller wuzn t much of a checker player liked to see him die slow anyhow and then tend his own funeral he says and march in the p session to his own music says he And jest then his remarks wuz brung to a close by Wes a jumpin two men and a lightin square in the king row Crown that says Wes a droppin back into his old tune And fer the rest o that game Wes helt the feller purty level but had to finally knock under but by jest the clos test kind o shave o winnin They ain t much use says the feller o keepin this thing up less I could manage some way er other to git beat onc t n a while Move says Wes a drappin back into the same old whistle and a settlin there Music has charms as the Good Book tells us says the feller kindo nervous like and a roachin his hair back as ef some sort o p tracted headache wuz a settin in Never wuz skunked wuz ye says Wes kindo suddent like with a fur off look in them big white eyes o his and then a whistlin right on sef he hadn t said nothin Not much says the feller sorto s prised like as ef such a idy as that had never struck him afore Never was skunked myse f but I ve saw fellers in my time at wuz says he But from that time on I noticed the feller peared to play more keerful and railly la nched into the game with somepin like inter saint Wes he seemed to be jest a limber in up like and sir blame me ef he didn t walk the feller s log fer him that time thout no pearent trouble at all And now says Wes all quiet like a squarin the board fer another n we re kindo gittin at things right Move And away went that little unconcerned whistle o his ag in and Mr Cityman jest gittin white and sweaty too he wuz so nervous Ner he didn t pear to find much to laugh at in the next game ner the next two games nuther Things wuz a gettin mighty inte rest in bout them times and I guess the feller wuz ser ous like a wakin up to the solem fact at it tuk bout all his spare time to keep up his end o the row and even that state o pore satisfaction wuz a creepin furder and furder away from him ever new turn he undertook Whilse Wes jest peared to git more deliber t and certain ever game and that unendin se f satisfied and comfortin little whistle o his never drapped a stitch but toed out ever game alike to rds the last and fer the most part disasterss to the feller at had started in with sich confi dence and actchul promise don t you know Well sir the feller stuck the whole forenoon out and then the afternoon and then knuckled down to it way into the night yes and plum midnight And he buckled into the thing bright and airly next morning And sir fer two long days and nights a hardly a stoppin long enough to eat the feller stuck it out and Wes a jest a warpin it to him hand over fist and leavin him furder behind ever game till finally to rds the last the feller got so blamedon worked up and excited like he jes peared actchully purt nigh plum crazy and histurical as a woman It was a gittin late into the shank of the second day and the boys hed

and home he run Sat down drank off his quart and said My work is done I ll go to bed My work is done retorted Joan My work is done your constant tone But hapless woman ne er can say My work is done till judgment day You men can sleep all night but we Must toil Whose fault is that quoth he I know your meaning Joan replied But Sir my tongue shall not be tied I will go on and let you know What work poor women have to do First in the morning though we feel As sick as drunkards when they reel Yes feel such pains in back and head As would confine you men to bed We ply the brush we wield the broom We air the beds and right the room The cows must next be milked and then We get the breakfast for the men Ere this is done with whimpering cries And bristly hair the children rise These must be dressed and dosed with rue And fed and all because of you We next Here Darby scratched his head And stole off grumbling to his bed And only said as on she run Zounds woman s clack is never done II At early dawn ere Phoebus rose Old Joan resumed her tale of woes When Darby thus I ll end the strife Be you the man and I the wife Take you the scythe and mow while I Will all your boasted cares supply Content quoth Joan give me my stint This Darby did and out she went Old Darby rose and seized the broom And whirled the dirt about the room Which having done he scarce knew how He hied to milk the brindled cow The brindled cow whisked round her tail In Darby s eyes and kicked the pail The clown perplexed with grief and pain Swore he d ne er try to milk again When turning round in sad amaze He saw his cottage in a blaze For as he chanced to brush the room In careless haste he fired the broom The fire at last subdued he swore The broom and he would meet no more Pressed by misfortune and perplexed Darby prepared for breakfast next But what to get he scarcely knew The bread was spent the butter too His hands bedaubed with paste and flour Old Darby labored full an hour But luckless wight thou couldst not make The bread take form of loaf or cake As every door wide open stood In pushed the sow in quest of food And stumbling onward with her snout O erset the churn the cream ran out As Darby turned the sow to beat The slippery cream betrayed his feet He caught the bread trough in his fall And down came Darby trough and all The children wakened by the clatter Start up and cry Oh what s the matter Old Jowler barked and Tabby mewed And hapless Darby bawled aloud Return my Joan as heretofore I ll play the housewife s part no more Since now by sad experience taught Compared to thine my work is naught Henceforth as business calls I ll take Content the plough the scythe the rake And never more transgress the line Our fates have marked while thou art mine Then Joan return as heretofore I ll vex thy honest soul no more Let s each our proper task attend Forgive the past and strive to mend WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUNKIN BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder s in the shock And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin turkey cock And the clackin of the guineys and the cluckin of the hens And the rooster s hallelooyer as he tiptoes on the fence Oh it s then s the time a feller is a feelin at his best With the risin sun to greet him from a night of gracious rest As he leaves the house bareheaded and goes out to feed the stock When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder s in the shock There s sompin kind o hearty like about the atmosphere When the heat of summer s over and the coolin fall is here Of course we miss the flowers and the blossoms on the trees And the mumble of the hummin birds and the buzzin of the bees But the air s so appetizin and the landscape through the haze Of a crisp and sunny morning of the early autumn days Is a picture that no painter has the colorin to mock When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder s in the shock The husky rusty rustle of the tassels of the corn And the raspin of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn The stubble in the furries kind o lonesome like but still A preachin sermons to us of the barns they growed to fill The straw stack in the medder and the reaper in the shed The hosses in their stalls below the clover overhead Oh it sets my heart a clickin like the tickin of a clock When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder s in the shock

present O whither and whence and where Demanded my soul as I scaled the height Of the pine clad peak in the somber night In the terebinthine air While pondering on the frailty Of happiness hope and mirth The ascending sun with derisive scoff Hurled its golden lances and smote me off From the bulge of the restless earth Through the yellowish dawn of velvet Where stars were so thickly strewn That quietly chuckled as I passed through I fell in the gardens of Grizzly Gru On the mad mysterious moon I fell on the turquoise ether Low down in the wondrous west And thence to the moon in whose yielding blue Were hidden the gardens of Grizzly Gru In the Monarchy of Unrest And there were the fairy gardens Where beautiful cherubs grew In daintiest way and on separate stalks In the listed rows by the jasper walks Near the palace of Grizzly Gru While strolling around the garden I noticed the rows were full Of every conceivable size and type Some that were buds and some nearly ripe And some that were ready to pull In gauzy and white corolla Was one who had eyes of blue A little excuse of a baby nose Little pink ears and ten little toes And a mouth that kept saying ah goo Ah gooing as I came near her She raised up her arms in glee Her little fat arms and she seemed to say I m ready to go with you right away Don t hunt any more take me I picked her off quick and kissed her And hugging her to my breast I heard a loud yelling that pierced me through Twas His Terrible Eminence Grizzly Gru Of the Monarchy of Unrest He had on a blood red turban A picturesque lot of clothes With big moustaches both fierce and black And a ghastly saber to cut and hack And shoes that turned up at the toes Out of the gate of the garden The cherub and I took flight And closely behind us the saber flew And back of the saber came Grizzly Gru And he chased us all day till night I ran down the lunar crescent And out on the silver horn I kissed the baby and held her tight And jumped down into the starry night And I lit on the earth at morn He fitfully threw his saber It missed and went round the sun He followed no further he was not rash But the baby held on to my coarse moustache And seemed to enjoy the fun In saving that blue eyed baby From the gardens of Grizzly Gru I suffered a terrible shock and fright But the doctor believes it will be all right And he thinks he can pull me through JOHN HENRY IN A STREET CAR BY HUGH McHUGH Throw me in the cellar and batten down the hatches I m a wreck in the key of G flat I side stepped in among a bunch of language heavers yesterday and ever since I ve been sitting on the ragged edge with my feet hanging over I was on my way down to Wall Street to help J Pierpont Morgan buy a couple of railroads and all the world seemed as blithe and gay as a love clinch from Laura Jean Libbey s latest When I climbed into the cable car I felt like a man who had mailed money to himself the night before I was aces And then somebody blew out my gas At the next corner two society flash lights flopped in and sat next to me They had a lot of words they wanted to use and they started in The car stopped and two more of the four hundred s leading ladies jumped the hurdles and came down the aisle They sat on the other side of me In a minute they began to bite the dictionary Their efforts aroused the energies of three women who sat opposite me and they proceeded to beat the English language black and blue In a minute the air was so full of talk that the grip germs had to pull out on the platform and chew the conductor The next one to me on my left started in Oh yes we discharged our cook day before yesterday but there s another coming this evening and so Her friend broke away and was up and back to the center with this I was coming down Broadway this morning and I saw Julia Marlowe s leading man I m sure it was him because I saw the show once in Chicago and he has the loveliest eyes I ever looked at I knew that that was my cue to walk out kick the motorman in the knuckles upset the car and send in a fire call but I passed it up I just sat there and bit my nails like the heavy villain in one of Corse Payton s ten twen thir dramas That loveliest eyes speech had me groggy Whenever I hear a woman turn on that loveliest eyes gag about an actor I always feel that a swift slap from a wet dish rag would look well on her back hair Then the bunch across the aisle got the flag Well you know says the broad lady who paid for one seat and was compelled by Nature to use three you know there s only five in our family and so I take just five slices of stale bread and have a bowl of water ready in which I ve dropped a pinch of salt Then I take a piece of butter about the size of a walnut and thoroughly grease the bottom of a frying pan then beat five eggs to a froth and I m hoping the conductor will come in and give us all a tip to take to the timber because the cops are going to pinch the room but there s nothing doing One of the dames on my right finds her voice and passes it around Oh I think it s a perfect fright I always did detest electric blue anyway It is so unbecoming and then I ve just decided that this lady ought to make up as a Swede servant girl and play the part when her friend hooks in Oh yes I think it will look perfectly sweet It is a foulard in one of those new heliotrope tints made with a crepe de chine chemisette with a second vest peeping out on either side of the front over an embroidered satin vest and cut in scallops on the edge finished with a full ruche of white chiffon and the sleeves are just too tight for any use and the skirt is too long for any good and I declare the lining is too sweet and I just hate to wear it out on the street and get it soiled and I was going to have it made with a tunic and missus Wigwag that s my brother in law s first cousin she had her s made to wear with guimpes and they are so economical and Think of a guy having to ride four miles and get his forehead fanned all the while with talk about foulard and crepe de chine and guimpes Wouldn t it lead you to a padded cell Say I was down and out no kidding I wanted to get up and fight the door tender but I couldn t One of the conversationalists was sitting on my overcoat I felt that if I got up and called my coat back to Papa she might lose the thread of her story and the jar would be something frightful So I sat still and saved her life The one on my right must have been the Lady President of The Hammer Club She was talking about some other girl and she didn t do a thing to the absent one She said she was svelte I suppose that s Dago for a shine That s the way with some women They can t come right out and call another woman a polish They have to beat around the bush and chase their friends to the swamps by throwing things like svelte at them Tush I tried to duck the foreign tattle on my right and by so doing I m next to this on my left Oh yes I think politics is just too lovely I don t know whether I d rather be a Democrat or a Republican but I think oh just look at the hat that woman has on Isn t that a fright Wonder if she trimmed it herself Of course she did you can tell by I m gasping for breath when the broad lady across the aisle gets the floor No indeed I didn t have Eliza vaccinated Why she s too small yet and don t you know my sister s husband s brother s child was vaccinated and she is younger than our Eliza but I don t just care I don t want Then the sweet girlish thing on my left gave me the corkscrew jab It was the finish Isn t that lovely Well as I was telling you Charlie came last night and brought mister Storeclose with him mister Storeclose is awfully nice He plays the mandolin just too sweet for anything and Me to the oyster beds No male impersonators garroting a mandolin not any in mine When I want to take a course in music I ll climb into a public library and read how Baldy Sloane wrote the Tiger Lily with one hand tied behind him and his feet on the piano So I fell off the car and crawled home to mother THE MUSKEETER BY JOSH BILLINGS Muskeeters are a game bug but they won t bite at a hook Thare iz millyuns ov them kaught every year but not with a hook this makes the market for them unstiddy the supply allways exceeding the demand The muskeeto iz born on the sly and cums to maturity quicker than enny other ov the domestik animiles A muskeeter at three hours old iz just az reddy and anxious to go into bizzness for himself az ever he iz and bites the fust time az sharp and natral as red pepper duz The muskeeter haz a good ear for musik and sings without notes The song ov the muskeeto iz monotonous to sum folks but in me it stirs up the memorys ov other days I hav lade awake all nite long menny a time and listened to the sweet anthems ov the muskeeter I am satisfied that thare want nothing made in vain but i kant help thinking how mighty kluss the musketoze kum to it The muskeeter haz inhabited this world since its kreashun and will probably hang around here until bizzness closes Whare the muskeeter goes to in the winter iz a standing konumdrum which all the naturalists hav giv up but we kno he dont go far for he iz on hand early each year with hiz probe fresh ground and polished Muskeeters must be one ov the luxurys ov life they certainly aint one ov the necessarys not if we kno ourselfs THE TURNINGS OF A BOOKWORM BY CAROLYN WELLS Love levels all plots Dead men sell no tales A new boom sweeps clean Circumstances alter bookcases The more haste the less read Too many books spoil the trade Many hands make light literature Epigrams cover a multitude of sins Ye can not serve Art and Mammon A little sequel is a dangerous thing It s a long page that has no turning Don t look a gift book in the binding A gilt edged volume needs no accuser In a multitude of characters there is safety Incidents will happen even in the best regulated novels One touch of Nature makes the whole book sell Where there s a will there s a detective story A book in the hand is worth two in the library An ounce of invention is worth a pound of style A good name is rather to be chosen than great characters Where there s so much puff there must be some buyer THE FEAST OF THE MONKEYS BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA In days of old So I ve been told The monkeys gave a feast They sent out cards With kind regards To every bird and beast The guests came dressed In fashion s best Unmindful of expense Except the whale Whose swallowtail Was soaked for fifty cents The guests checked wraps Canes hats and caps And when that task was done The footman he With dignitee Announced them one by one In Monkey Hall The host met all And hoped they d feel at ease I scarcely can Said the Black and Tan I m busy hunting fleas While waiting for A score or more Of guests the hostess said We ll have the Poodle Sing Yankee Doodle A standing on his head And when this through Good Parrot you Please show them how you swear Oh dear don t cuss Cried the Octopus And he walked off on his ear The Orang Outang A sea song sang About a Chimpanzee Who went abroad In a drinking gourd To the coast of Barberee Where he heard one night When the moon shone bright A school of mermaids pick Chromatic scales From off their tails And did it mighty slick All guests are here To eat the cheer And dinner s served my Lord The butler bowed And then the crowd Rushed in with one accord The fiddler crab Came in a cab And played a piece in C While on his horn The Unicorn Blew You ll Remember Me To give a touch Of early Dutch To this great feast of feasts I ll drink ten drops Of Holland s schnapps Spoke out the King of Beasts That must taste fine Said the Porcupine Did you see him smack his lip I d smack mine too Cried the Kangaroo If I didn t have the pip The Lion stood And said Be good Enough to look this way Court Etiquette Do not forget And mark well what I say My royal wish Is ev ry dish Be tasted first by me Here s where I smile Said the Crocodile And he climbed an axle tree The soup was brought And quick as thought The Lion ate it all You can t beat that Exclaimed the Cat For monumental gall The soup all cried Gone Leo replied Twas just a bit too thick When we get through Remarked the Gnu I ll hit him with a brick The Tiger stepped Or rather crept Up where the Lion sat O mighty boss I m at a loss To know where I am at I came to night With appetite To drink and also eat As a Tiger grand I now demand I get there with both feet The Lion got All fired hot And in a passion flew Get out he cried And save your hide You most offensive You I m not afraid The Tiger said I know what I m about But the Lion s paw Reached the Tiger s jaw And he was good and out The salt sea smell Of Mackerel Upon the air arose Each hungry guest Great joy expressed And sniff went every nose With glutton look The Lion took The spiced and sav ry dish Without a pause He worked his jaws And gobbled all the fish Then ate the roast The quail on toast The pork both fat and lean The jam and lamb The potted ham And drank the kerosene He raised his voice Come all rejoice You ve seen your monarch dine Never again Clucked the Hen And all sang Old Lang Syne THE BILLVILLE SPIRIT MEETING BY FRANK L STANTON We had a sperrit meetin we ll never have no more To call up all the sperrits of them that s gone before A feller

buy a panama or any other hat You learn the price has been advanced a lot because of that A glacier up in Canada has slipped a mile or two A little thing like this can boost the selling price of glue Occurrences so tragic always thrill me to the core I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more Last week the peaceful Indians went a searching after scalps And then there was an avalanche way over in the Alps These diametric happenings seem nothing much but look We had to add a dollar to the wages of the cook The bean crop down at Boston has grown measurably less And so the dealer charges more for goods to make a dress Each day there is some incident to make a man feel sore I m on my knees to ask that nothing happens any more It didn t rain in Utah and it did in old Vermont Result it costs you fifty more to take a summer s jaunt Upon the plains of Tibet some tornadoes took a roll Therefore the barons have to charge a higher price for coal A street car strike in Omaha has cumulative shocks It boosted huckleberries up to twenty cents a box No matter what is happening it always finds your door Give us a rest Let nothing ever happen any more Mosquitoes in New Jersey bite a magnate on the wing Result the poor consumer feels that fierce mosquito s sting The skeeter s song is silenced but in something like an hour The grocers understand that it requires a raise in flour A house burns down in Texas and a stove blows up in Maine Ten minutes later breakfast foods in prices show a gain Effects must follow causes which is what I most deplore I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more A DISAPPOINTMENT BY JOHN BOYLE O REILLY Her hair was a waving bronze and her eyes Deep wells that might cover a brooding soul And who till he weighed it could ever surmise That her heart was a cinder instead of a coal THE BRITISH MATRON BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE I have heard a good deal of the tenacity with which English ladies retain their personal beauty to a late period of life but not to suggest that an American eye needs use and cultivation before it can quite appreciate the charm of English beauty at any age it strikes me that an English lady of fifty is apt to become a creature less refined and delicate so far as her physique goes than anything that we Western people class under the name of woman She has an awful ponderosity of frame not pulpy like the looser development of our few fat women but massive with solid beef and streaky tallow so that though struggling manfully against the idea you inevitably think of her as made up of steaks and sirloins When she walks her advance is elephantine When she sits down it is on a great round space of her Maker s footstool where she looks as if nothing could ever move her She imposes awe and respect by the muchness of her personality to such a degree that you probably credit her with far greater moral and intellectual force than she can fairly claim Her visage is usually grim and stern seldom positively forbidding yet calmly terrible not merely by its breadth and weight of feature but because it seems to express so much well defined self reliance such acquaintance with the world its toils troubles and dangers and such sturdy capacity for trampling down a foe Without anything positively salient or actively offensive or indeed unjustly formidable to her neighbors she has the effect of a seventy four gun ship in time of peace for while you assure yourself that there is no real danger you can not help thinking how tremendous would be her onset if pugnaciously inclined and how futile the effort to inflict any counter injury She certainly looks tenfold nay a hundredfold better able to take care of herself than our slender framed and haggard womankind but I have not found reason to suppose that the English dowager of fifty has actually greater courage fortitude and strength of character than our women of similar age or even a tougher physical endurance than they Morally she is strong I suspect only in society and in the common routine of social affairs and would be found powerless and timid in any exceptional strait that might call for energy outside of the conventionalities amid which she has grown up You can meet this figure in the street and live and even smile at the recollection But conceive of her in a ball room with the bare brawny arms that she invariably displays there and all the other corresponding development such as is beautiful in the maiden blossom but a spectacle to howl at in such an over blown cabbage rose as this Yet somewhere in this enormous bulk there must be hidden the modest slender violet nature of a girl whom an alien mass of earthliness has unkindly overgrown for an English maiden in her teens though very seldom so pretty as our own damsels possesses to say the truth a certain charm of half blossom and delicately folded leaves and tender womanhood shielded by maidenly reserves with which somehow or other our American girls often fail to adorn themselves during an appreciable moment It is a pity that the English violet should grow into such an outrageously developed peony as I have attempted to describe I wonder whether a middle aged husband ought to be considered as legally married to all the accretions that have overgrown the slenderness of his bride since he led her to the altar and which make her so much more than he ever bargained for Is it not a sounder view of the case that the matrimonial bond can not be held to include the three fourths of the wife that had no existence when the ceremony was performed And as a matter of conscience and good morals ought not an English married pair to insist upon the celebration of a silver wedding at the end of twenty five years in order to legalize and mutually appropriate that corporeal growth of which both parties have individually come into possession since they were pronounced one flesh THE TRAGEDY OF IT BY ALDEN CHARLES NOBLE Alas for him alas for it Alas for you and I When this I think I raise my mitt To dry my weeping eye STAGE WHISPERS BY CAROLYN WELLS Deadheads tell no tales Stars are stubborn things All s not bold that titters Contracts make cowards of us all One good turn deserves an encore A little actress is a dangerous thing It s a long skirt that has no turning Stars rush in where angels fear to tread Managers never hear any good of themselves A manager is known by the company he keeps A plot is not without honor save in comic opera Take care of the dance and the songs will take care of themselves THE PETTIBONE LINEAGE BY JAMES T FIELDS My name is Esek Pettibone and I wish to affirm in the outset that it is a good thing to be well born In thus connecting the mention of my name with a positive statement I am not aware that a catastrophe lies coiled up in the juxtaposition But I can not help writing plainly that I am still in favor of a distinguished family tree ESTO PERPETUA To have had somebody for a great grandfather that was somebody is exciting To be able to look back on long lines of ancestry that were rich but respectable seems decorous and all right The present Earl of Warwick I think must have an idea that strict justice has been done him in the way of being launched properly into the world I saw the Duke of Newcastle once and as the farmer in Conway described Mount Washington I thought the Duke felt a propensity to hunch up some Somehow it is pleasant to look down on the crowd and have a conscious right to do so Left an orphan at the tender age of four years having no brothers or sisters to prop me round with young affections and sympathies I fell into three pairs of hands excellent in their way but peculiar Patience Eunice and Mary Ann Pettibone were my aunts on my father s side All my mother s relations kept shady when the lonely orphan looked about for protection but Patience Pettibone in her stately way said The boy belongs to a good family and he shall never want while his three aunts can support him So I went to live with my plain but benignant protectors in the state of New Hampshire During my boyhood the best drilled lesson that fell to my keeping was this Respect yourself We come of more than ordinary parentage Superior blood was probably concerned in getting up the Pettibones Hold your head erect and some day you shall have proof of your high lineage I remember once on being told that I must not share my juvenile sports with the butcher s three little beings I begged to know why not Aunt Eunice looked at Patience and Mary Ann knew what she meant My child slowly murmured the eldest sister our family no doubt came of a very old stock perhaps we belong to the nobility Our ancestors it is thought came over laden with honors and no doubt were embarrassed with riches though the latter importation has dwindled in the lapse of years Respect yourself and when you grow up you will not regret that your old and careful aunt did not wish you to play with the butcher s offspring I felt mortified that I ever had a desire to knuckle up with any but kings sons or sultans little boys I longed to be among my equals in the urchin line and fly my kite with only high born youngsters Thus I lived in a constant scene of self enchantment on the part of the sisters who assumed all the port and feeling that properly belonged to ladies of quality Patrimonial splendor to come danced before their dim eyes and handsome settlements gay equipages and a general grandeur of some sort loomed up in the future for the American branch of the House of Pettibone It was a life of opulent self delusion which my aunts were never tired of nursing and I was too young to doubt the reality of it All the members of our little household held up their heads as if each said in so many words There is no original sin in our composition whatever of that commodity there may be mixed up with the common clay of Snowborough Aunt Patience was a star and dwelt apart Aunt Eunice looked at her through a determined pair of spectacles and worshiped while she gazed The youngest sister lived in a dreamy state of honors to come and had constant zooelogical visions of lions griffins and unicorns drawn and quartered in every possible style known to the Heralds College The Reverend Hebrew Bullet who used to drop in quite often and drink several compulsory glasses of home made wine encouraged his three parishoners in their aristocratic notions and extolled them for what he called their stooping down to every day life He differed with the ladies of our house only on one point He contended that the unicorn of the Bible and the rhinoceros of to day were one and the same animal My aunts held a different opinion In the sleeping room of my Aunt Patience reposed a trunk Often during my childish years I longed to lift the lid and spy among its contents the treasures my young fancy conjured up as lying there in state I dared not ask to have the cover raised for my gratification as I had often been told I was too little to estimate aright what that armorial box contained When you grow up you shall see the inside of it Aunt Mary used to say to me and so I wondered and wished but all in vain I must have the virtue of years before I could view the treasures of past magnificence so long entombed in that wooden sarcophagus Once I saw the faded sisters bending over the trunk together and as I thought embalming something in camphor Curiosity impelled me to linger but under some pretext I was nodded out of the room Although my kinswomen s means were far from ample they determined that Swiftmouth College should have the distinction of calling me one of her sons and accordingly I was in due time sent for preparation to a neighboring academy Years of study and hard fare in country boarding houses told upon my self importance as the descendant of a great Englishman notwithstanding all my letters from the honored three came with counsel to respect myself and keep up the dignity of the family Growing up man forgets good counsel The Arcadia of respectability is apt to give place to the levity of football and other low toned accomplishments The book of life at that period opens readily at fun and frolic and the insignia of greatness give the school boy no envious pangs I was nineteen when I entered the hoary halls of Swiftmouth I call them hoary because they had been built more than fifty years To me they seemed uncommonly hoary and I snuffed antiquity in the dusty purlieus I now began to study in good earnest the wisdom of the past I saw clearly the value of dead men and mouldy precepts especially if the former had been entombed a thousand years and if the latter were well done in sounding Greek and Latin I began to reverence royal lines of deceased monarchs and longed to connect my own name now growing into college popularity with some far off mighty one who had ruled in pomp and luxury his obsequious people The trunk in Snowborough troubled my dreams In that receptacle still slept the proof of our family distinction I will go quoth I to the home of my aunts next vacation and there learn how we became mighty and discover precisely why we don t practice to day our inherited claims to glory I went to Snowborough Aunt Patience was now anxious to lay before her impatient nephew the proof he burned to behold But first she must explain All the old family documents and letters were no doubt destroyed in the great fire of ninety eight as nothing in the shape of parchment or paper implying nobility had ever been discovered in Snowborough or elsewhere But there had been preserved for many years a suit of imperial clothes that had been worn by their great grandfather in England and no doubt in the New World also These garments had been carefully watched and guarded for were they not the proof that their owner belonged to a station in life second if second at all to the royal court of King George itself Precious casket into which I was soon to have the privilege of gazing Through how many long years these fond foolish virgins had lighted their unflickering lamps of expectation and hope at this cherished old shrine I was now on my way to the family repository of all our greatness I went up stairs on the jump We all knelt down before the well preserved box and my proud Aunt Patience in a somewhat reverent manner turned the key My heart I am not ashamed to confess it now although it is forty years since the quartet in search of family honors were on their knees that summer afternoon in Snowborough my heart beat high I was about to look on that which might be a duke s or an earl s regalia And I was descended from the owner in a direct line I had lately been reading Shakespeare s Titus Andronicus and I remembered there before the trunk the lines O sacred receptacle of my joys Sweet cell of virtue and nobility The lid went up and the sisters began to unroll the precious garments which seemed all enshrined in aromatic gums and spices The odor of that interior lives with me to this day and I grow faint with the memory of that hour With pious precision the clothes were uncovered and at last the whole suit was laid before my expectant eyes Reader I am an old man now and have not long to walk this planet But whatever dreadful shock may be in reserve for my declining years I am certain I can bear it for I went through that scene at Snowborough and still live When the garments were fully displayed all the aunts looked at me I had been to college I had studied Burke s Peerage I had been once to New York Perhaps I could immediately name the exact station in noble British life to which that suit of clothes belonged I could I saw it all at a glance I grew flustered and pale I dared not look my poor deluded female relatives in the face What rank in the peerage do these gold laced garments and big buttons betoken cried all three It is a suit of servant s livery gasped I and fell back with a shudder That evening after the sun had gone down we buried those hateful garments in a ditch at the bottom of the garden Rest there perturbed body coat yellow trousers brown gaiters and all Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye WHY MOLES HAVE HANDS BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON One day the children came running to Aunt Nancy with a mole

single And things are not what they seem Married life is real earnest Single blessedness a fib Taken from man to man returnest Has been spoken of the rib Not enjoyment and not sorrow Is our destined end or way But to act that each to morrow Nearer brings the wedding day Life is long and youth is fleeting And our hearts if there we search Still like steady drums are beating Anxious marches to the Church In the world s broad field of battle In the bivouac of life Be not like dumb driven cattle Be a woman be a wife Trust no Future howe er pleasant Let the dead Past bury its dead Act act in the living Present Heart within and Man ahead Lives of married folks remind us We can live our lives as well And departing leave behind us Such examples as will tell Such examples that another Sailing far from Hymen s port A forlorn unmarried brother Seeing shall take heart and court Let us then be up and doing With the heart and head begin Still achieving still pursuing Learn to labor and to win AN ODYSSEY OF K S BY WILBUR D NESBIT I ve traveled up and down this land And crossed it in a hundred ways But somehow can not understand These towns with names chock full of K s For instance once it fell to me To pack my grip and quickly go I thought at first to Kankakee But then remembered Kokomo Oh Kankakee or Kokomo I sighed just which I do not know Then to the ticket man I went He was a snappy man and bald Behind an iron railing pent And I confessed that I was stalled A much K d town is booked for me I said I m due to morrow so I wonder if it s Kankakee Or if it can be Kokomo There s quite a difference growled he Twixt Kokomo and Kankakee He spun a yard of tickets out The folded kind that makes a strip And leaves the passenger in doubt When the conductor takes a clip He flipped the tickets out I say And asked Now which one shall it be I ll sell you tickets either way To Kokomo or Kankakee And still I really did not know I thought it might be Kokomo At any rate I took a chance He struck his stamp machine a blow And I a toy of circumstance Was ticketed for Kokomo Upon the train I wondered still If all was right as it should be Some mystic warning seemed to fill My mind with thoughts of Kankakee The car wheels clicked it out Now he Had better be for Kankakee Until at last it grew so loud At some big town I clambered out And elbowed madly through the crowd Determined on the other route The ticket agent saw my haste Where do you wish to go cried he I yelled I have no time to waste Please fix me up for Kankakee Again the wheels now fast now slow Clicked Ought to go to Kokomo Well anyhow I did not heed The message that they sent to me I went and landed wrong indeed Went all the way to Kankakee Then in a rush I doubled back Went wrong again I d have you know There was no call for me alack Within the town of Kokomo And then I learned confound the luck I should have gone to Keokuk THE DEACON S TROUT BY HENRY WARD BEECHER He was a curious trout I believe he knew Sunday just as well as Deacon Marble did At any rate the deacon thought the trout meant to aggravate him The deacon you know is a little waggish He often tells about that trout Sez he One Sunday morning just as I got along by the willows I heard an awful splash and not ten feet from shore I saw the trout as long as my arm just curving over like a bow and going down with something for breakfast Gracious says I and I almost jumped out of the wagon But my wife Polly says she What on airth are you thinkin of Deacon It s Sabbath day and you re goin to meetin It s a pretty business for a deacon That sort o cooled me off But I do say that for about a minute I wished I wasn t a deacon But t wouldn t made any difference for I came down next day to mill on purpose and I came down once or twice more and nothin was to be seen tho I tried him with the most temptin things Wal next Sunday I came along ag in and to save my life I couldn t keep off worldly and wanderin thoughts I tried to be sayin my catechism but I couldn t keep my eyes off the pond as we came up to the willows I d got along in the catechism as smooth as the road to the Fourth Commandment and was sayin it out loud for Polly and jist as I was sayin What is required in the Fourth Commandment I heard a splash and there was the trout and afore I could think I said Gracious Polly I must have that trout She almost riz right up I knew you wa n t sayin your catechism hearty Is this the way you answer the question about keepin the Lord s day I m ashamed Deacon Marble says she You d better change your road and go to meetin on the road over the hill If I was a deacon I wouldn t let a fish s tail whisk the whole catechism out of my head and I had to go to meetin on the hill road all the rest of the summer ENOUGH two BY TOM MASSON I shot a rocket in the air It fell to earth I knew not where Until next day with rage profound The man it fell on came around In less time than it takes to tell He showed me where that rocket fell And now I do not greatly care To shoot more rockets in the air Footnote two By permission of Life Publishing Company THE FIGHTING RACE BY JOSEPH I C CLARKE Read out the names and Burke sat back And Kelly drooped his head While Shea they call him Scholar Jack Went down the list of the dead Officers seamen gunners marines The crews of the gig and yawl The bearded man and the lad in his teens Carpenters coal passers all Then knocking the ashes from out his pipe Said Burke in an off hand way We re all in that dead man s list by Cripe Kelly and Burke and Shea Well here s to the Maine and I m sorry for Spain Said Kelly and Burke and Shea Wherever there s Kellys there s trouble said Burke Wherever fighting s the game Or a spice of danger in grown man s work Said Kelly you ll find my name And do we fall short said Burke getting mad When it s touch and go for life Said Shea It s thirty odd years be dad Since I charged to drum and fife Up Marye s Heights and my old canteen Stopped a Rebel ball on its way There were blossoms of blood on our sprigs of green Kelly and Burke and Shea And the dead didn t brag Well here s to the flag Said Kelly and Burke and Shea I wish twas in Ireland for there s the place Said Burke that we d die by right In the cradle of our soldier race After one good stand up fight My grandfather fell on Vinegar Hill And fighting was not his trade But his rusty pike s in the cabin still With Hessian blood on the blade Aye aye said Kelly the pikes were great When the word was Clear the way We were thick on the roll in ninety eight Kelly and Burke and Shea Well here s to the pike and the sword and the like Said Kelly and Burke and Shea And Shea the scholar with rising joy Said We were at Ramillies We left our bones at Fontenoy And up in the Pyrenees Before Dunkirk on Landen s plain Cremona Lille and Ghent We re all over Austria France and Spain Wherever they pitched a tent We ve died for England from Waterloo To Egypt and Dargai And still there s enough for a corps or crew Kelly and Burke and Shea Well here is to good honest fighting blood Said Kelly and Burke and Shea Oh the fighting races don t die out If they seldom die in bed For love is first in their hearts no doubt Said Burke Then Kelly said When Michael the Irish Archangel stands The angel with the sword And the battle dead from a hundred lands Are ranged in one big horde Our line that for Gabriel s trumpet waits Will stretch tree deep that day From Jehoshaphat to the Golden Gates Kelly and Burke and Shea Well here s thank God for the race and the sod Said Kelly and Burke and Shea THE ORGAN BY HENRY WARD BEECHER At one of his week night lectures Beecher was speaking about the building and equipping of new churches After a few satirical touches about church architects and their work he went on to ridicule the usual style of pulpit the sacred mahogany tub plastered up against some pillar like a barn swallow s nest Then he passed on to the erection of the organ and to the opening recital The organ long expected has arrived been unpacked set up and gloried over The great players of the region round about or of distant celebrity have had the grand organ exhibition and this magnificent instrument has been put through all its paces in a manner which has surprised every one and if it had had a conscious existence must have surprised the organ itself most of all It has piped fluted trumpeted brayed thundered It has played so loud that everybody was deafened and so soft that nobody could hear The pedals played for thunder the flutes languished and coquetted and the swell died away in delicious suffocation like one singing a sweet song under the bed clothes Now it leads down a stupendous waltz with full brass sounding very much as if in summer a thunderstorm should play Come Haste to the Wedding or Moneymusk Then come marches galops and hornpipes An organ playing hornpipes ought to have elephants as dancers At length a fugue is rendered to show the whole scope and power of the instrument The theme like a cautious rat peeps out to see if the coast is clear and after a few hesitations comes forth and begins to frisk a little and run up and down to see what it can find It finds just what it did not want a purring tenor lying in ambush and waiting for a spring and as the theme comes incautiously near the savage cat of a tenor springs at it misses its hold and then takes after it with terrible earnestness But the tenor has miscalculated the agility of the theme All that it could do with the most desperate effort was to keep the theme from running back into its hole again and so they ran up and down around and around dodging eluding whipping in and out of every corner and nook till the whole organ was aroused and the bass began to take part but unluckily slipped and rolled down stairs and lay at the bottom raving and growling in the most awful manner and nothing could appease it Sometimes the theme was caught by one part and dangled for a moment then with a snatch another part took it and ran off exultant until unawares the same trick was played on it and finally all the parts being greatly exercised in mind began to chase each other promiscuously in and out up and down now separating and now rushing in full tilt together until everything in the organ loses patience and all the stops are drawn and in spite of all that the brave organist could do who bobbed up and down feet hands head and all the tune broke up into a real row and every part was clubbing every other one until at length patience being no longer a virtue the organist with two or three terrible crashes put an end to the riot and brought the great organ back to silence MY GRANDMOTHER S TURKEY TAIL FAN BY SAMUEL MINTURN PECK It owned not the color that vanity dons Or slender wits choose for display Its beautiful tint was a delicate bronze A brown softly blended with gray From her waist to her chin spreading out without break Twas built on a generous plan The pride of the forest was slaughtered to make My grandmother s turkey tail fan For common occasions it never was meant In a chest between two silken cloths Twas kept safely hidden with careful intent In camphor to keep out the moths Twas famed far and wide through the whole countryside From Beersheba e en unto Dan And often at meeting with envy twas eyed My grandmother s turkey tail fan Camp meetings indeed were its chiefest delight Like a crook unto sheep gone astray It beckoned backsliders to re seek the right And exhorted the sinners to pray It always beat time when the choir went wrong In psalmody leading the van Old Hundred I know was its favorite song My grandmother s turkey tail fan A fig for the fans that are made nowadays Suited only to frivolous mirth A different thing was the fan that I praise Yet it scorned not the good things of earth At bees and at quiltings twas aye to be seen The best of the gossip began When in at the doorway had entered serene My grandmother s turkey tail fan Tradition relates of it wonderful tales Its handle of leather was buff Though shorn of its glory e en now it exhales An odor of hymn books and snuff Its primeval grace if you like you can trace Twas limned for the future to scan Just under a smiling gold spectacled face My grandmother s turkey tail fan HOW TO ENJOY THE ECSTASY THAT ACCOMPANIES
