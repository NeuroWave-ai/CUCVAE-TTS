Mother Carey s own chickens They flitted along like a flock of swallows hopping and skipping from wave to wave lifting their little feet behind them so daintily that Tom fell in love with them at once Nancy stopped reading and laid down the copy of Water Babies on the sitting room table No more just now Peter bird she said I hear mother coming It was a cold dreary day in late October with an east wind and a chill of early winter in the air The cab stood in front of Captain Carey s house with a trunk beside the driver and a general air of expectancy on the part of neighbors at the opposite windows missus Carey came down the front stairway followed by Gilbert and Kathleen Gilbert with his mother s small bag and travelling cloak Kathleen with her umbrella while little Peter flew to the foot of the stairs with a small box of sandwiches pressed to his bosom missus Carey did not wear her usual look of sweet serenity but nothing could wholly mar the gracious dignity of her face and presence As she came down the stairs with her quick firm tread her flock following her she looked the ideal mother Her fine height her splendid carriage her deep chest her bright eye and fresh color all bespoke the happy contented active woman though something in the way of transient anxiety lurked in the eyes and lips The carriage is too early she said let us come into the sitting room for five minutes I have said my good byes and kissed you all a dozen times but I shall never be done until I am out of your sight O mother mother how can we let you go wailed Kathleen Kitty how can you exclaimed Nancy What does it matter about us when mother has the long journey and father is so ill It will not be for very long it can t be said missus Carey wistfully The telegram only said symptoms of typhoid but these low fevers sometimes last a good while and are very weakening so I may not be able to bring father back for two or three weeks I ought to be in Fortress Monroe day after to morrow you must take turns in writing to me children Every single day mother Every single thing that happens A fat letter every morning they promised in chorus If there is any real trouble remember to telegraph your Uncle Allan did you write down his address eleven Broad Street New York Don t bother him about little things for he is not well you know Gilbert displayed a note book filled with memoranda and addresses And in any small difficulty send for Cousin Ann missus Carey went on The mere thought of her coming will make me toe the mark I can tell you that was Gilbert s rejoinder Better than any ogre or bug a boo Cousin Ann is even for Peter said Nancy And will my Peter bird be good and make Nancy no trouble said his mother lifting him to her lap for one last hug I ll be an angel boy pretty near all the time he asserted between mouthfuls of apple or most pretty near he added prudently as if unwilling to promise anything superhuman in the way of behavior As a matter of fact it required only a tolerable show of virtue for Peter to win encomiums at any time He would brush his curly mop of hair away from his forehead lift his eyes part his lips showing a row of tiny white teeth then a dimple would appear in each cheek and a seraphic expression wholly at variance with the facts would overspread the baby face whereupon the beholder Mother Carey his sisters the cook or the chambermaid everybody indeed but Cousin Ann who could never be wheedled would cry Angel boy and kiss him He was even kissed now though he had done nothing at all but exist and be an enchanting personage which is one of the injustices of a world where a large number of virtuous and well behaved people go unkissed to their graves I know Joanna and Ellen will take good care of the housekeeping continued missus Carey and you will be in school from nine to two so that the time won t go heavily For the rest I make Nancy responsible If she is young you must remember that you are all younger still and I trust you to her The last time you did it it didn t work very well And Gilbert gave Nancy a sly wink to recall a little matter of family history when there had been a delinquency on somebody s part Nancy s face crimsoned and her lips parted for a quick retort and none too pleasant a one apparently Her mother intervened quietly We ll never speak of last times Gilly or where would any of us be We ll always think of next times I shall trust Nancy next time and next time and next time and keep on trusting till I can trust her forever Nancy s face lighted up with a passion of love and loyalty She responded to the touch of her mother s faith as a harp to the favoring wind but she said nothing she only glowed and breathed hard and put her trembling hand about her mother s neck and under her chin Now it s time One more kiss all around Remember you are Mother Carey s own chickens There may be gales while I am away but you must ride over the crests of the billows as merry as so many flying fish Good by Good by Oh my littlest Peter bird how can mother leave you I opened the lunch box to see what Ellen gave you but I only broke off two teenty weenty corners of sandwiches and one little new moon bite out of a cookie said Peter creating a diversion according to his wont Ellen and Joanna came to the front door and the children flocked down the frozen pathway to the gate after their mother getting a touch of her wherever and whenever they could and jumping up and down between whiles to keep warm Gilbert closed the door of the carriage and it turned to go down the street One window was open and there was a last glimpse of the beloved face framed in the dark blue velvet bonnet one last wave of a hand in a brown muff Oh she is so beautiful sobbed Kathleen her bonnet is just the color of her eyes and she was crying There never was anybody like mother said Nancy leaning on the gate shivering with cold and emotion There never was and there never will be We can try and try Kathleen and we must try all of us but mother wouldn t have to try mother must have been partly born so II THE CHICKENS It was Captain Carey s favorite Admiral who was responsible for the phrase by which mother and children had been known for some years The Captain then a Lieutenant had brought his friend home one Saturday afternoon a little earlier than had been expected and they went to find the family in the garden Laughter and the sound of voices led them to the summer house and as they parted the syringa bushes they looked through them and surprised the charming group A throng of children like to flowers were sown About the grass beside or climbed her knee I looked who were that favored company That is the way a poet would have described what the Admiral saw and if you want to see anything truly and beautifully you must generally go to a poet missus Carey held Peter then a crowing baby in her lap Gilbert was tickling Peter s chin with a buttercup Nancy was putting a wreath of leaves on her mother s hair and Kathleen was swinging from an apple tree bough her yellow curls flying Might I inquire what you think of that asked the father Well the Admiral said mothers and children make a pretty good picture at any time but I should say this one couldn t be beat Two for the Navy eh All four for the Navy perhaps laughed the young man Nancy has already chosen a Rear Admiral and Kathleen a Commodore they are modest little girls They do you credit Peter I hope I ve given them something I ve tried hard enough but they are mostly the work of the lady in the chair Come on and say how d ye do Before many Saturdays the Admiral s lap had superseded all other places as a gathering ground for the little Careys whom he called the stormy petrels Mother Carey he explained to them came from the Latin mater cara this being not only his personal conviction but one that had the backing of Brewer s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable The French call them Les Oiseaux de Notre Dame That means The Birds of our Lady Kitty and they are the sailors friends Mother Carey sends them to warn seafarers of approaching storms and bids them go out all over the seas to show the good birds the way home You ll have your hands full if you re going to be Mother Carey s chickens I d love to show good birds the way home said Gilbert Can a naughty bird show a good bird the way home Addy This bland question came from Nancy who had a decided talent for sarcasm considering her years Of course the Admiral might have stopped the children from calling him Addy but they seemed to do it because Admiral was difficult and anyway they loved him so much they simply had to take some liberties with him Besides although he was the greatest disciplinarian that ever walked a deck he was so soft and flexible on land that he was perfectly ridiculous and delightful The day when the children were christened Mother Carey s chickens was Nancy s tenth birthday a time when the family was striving to give her her proper name having begun wrong with her at the outset She was the first you see and the first is something of an event take it how you will It is obvious that at the beginning they could not address a tiny thing on a pillow as Nancy because she was too young She was not even alluded to at that early date as she but always as it so they called her baby and let it go at that Then there was a long period when she was still too young to be called Nancy and though so far as age was concerned she might properly have held on to her name of baby she couldn t with propriety because there was Gilbert then and he was baby Moreover she gradually became so indescribably quaint and bewitching and comical and saucy that every one sought diminutives for her nicknames fond names little names and all sorts of words that tried to describe her charm and couldn t so there was Poppet and Smiles and Minx and Rogue and Midget and Ladybird and finally Nan and Nannie by degrees to soberer Nancy Nancy is ten to day mused the Admiral Bless my soul how time flies You were a young Ensign Carey and I well remember the letter you wrote me when this little lass came into harbor Just wait a minute I believe the scrap of newspaper verse you enclosed has been in my wallet ever since I always liked it I recall writing to you said mister Carey As you had lent me five hundred dollars to be married on I thought I ought to keep you posted Oh father did you have to borrow money cried Kathleen I did my dear There s no disgrace in borrowing if you pay back and I did Your Uncle Allan was starting in business and I had just put my little capital in with his when I met your mother If you had met your mother wouldn t you have wanted to marry her Yes cried Nancy eagerly Fifty of her At which everybody laughed And what became of the money you put in Uncle Allan s business asked Gilbert with unexpected intelligence There was a moment s embarrassment and an exchange of glances between mother and father before he replied Oh that s coming back multiplied six times over one of these days Allan has a very promising project on hand just now Admiral Glad to hear it A delightful fellow and straight as a die I only wish he could perform once in a while instead of promising He will if only he keeps his health but he s heavily handicapped there poor chap Well what s the verse The Admiral put on his glasses prettily assisted by Kathleen who was on his knee and seized the opportunity to give him a French kiss when the spectacles were safely on the bridge of his nose Whereupon he read There came to port last Sunday night The queerest little craft Without an inch of rigging on I looked and looked and laughed It seemed so curious that she Should cross the unknown water And moor herself within my room My daughter O my daughter Yet by these presents witness all She s welcome fifty times And comes consigned to Hope and Love And common metre rhymes She has no manifest but this No flag floats o er the water She s rather new for British Lloyd s My daughter O my daughter Ring out wild bells and tame ones too Ring out the lover s moon Ring in the little worsted socks Ring in the bib and spoon one Footnote one George W Cable Oh Peter how pretty said Mother Carey all in a glow You never showed it to me You were too much occupied with the aforesaid queer little craft wasn t she Nan I mean Nancy and her father pinched her ear and pulled a curly lock Nancy was a lovely creature to the eye and she came by her good looks naturally enough For three generations her father s family had been known as the handsome Careys and when Lieutenant Carey chose Margaret Gilbert for his wife he was lucky enough to win the loveliest girl in her circle Thus it was still the handsome Careys in the time of our story for all the children were well favored and the general public could never decide whether Nancy or Kathleen was the belle of the family Kathleen had fair curls skin like a rose and delicate features not a blemish to mar her exquisite prettiness All colors became her all hats suited her hair She was the Carey beauty so long as Nancy remained out of sight but the moment that young person appeared Kathleen left something to be desired Nancy piqued Nancy sparkled Nancy glowed Nancy occasionally pouted and not infrequently blazed Nancy s eyes had to be continually searched for news both of herself and of the immediate world about her If you did not keep looking at her every once in so often you couldn t keep up with the progress of events she might flash a dozen telegrams to somebody about something while your head was turned away Kathleen could be safely left unwatched for an hour or so without fear of change her moods were less variable her temper evener her interest in the passing moment less keen her absorption in the particular subject less intense Walt Whitman might have been thinking of Nancy when he wrote There was a child went forth every day And the first object he looked upon that object he became And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day Or for many years or stretching cycles of years Kathleen s nature needed to be stirred Nancy s to be controlled the impulse coming from within the only way that counts in the end though the guiding force may be applied from without Nancy was more impulsive than industrious more generous than wise more plucky than prudent she had none too much perseverance and no patience at all Gilbert was a fiery youth of twelve all for adventure He kindled quickly but did not burn long so deeds of daring would be in his line instantaneous ones quickly settled leaving the victor with a swelling chest and a feather in cap rather an obvious feather suited Gilbert best Peter Oh Peter aged four can be dismissed in very few words as a consummate charmer and heart breaker The usual elements that go to the making of a small boy were all there but mixed with white magic It is painful to think of the dozens of girl babies in long clothes who must have been feeling premonitory pangs when Peter was four to think they couldn t all marry him when they grew up III THE COMMON DENOMINATOR Three weeks had gone by since Mother Carey s departure for Fortress Monroe and the children had mounted from one moral triumph to another John Bunyan looking in at the windows might have exclaimed Who would true valor see Let him come hither It is easy to go wrong in a wicked world but there are certain circumstances under which one is pledged to virtue when like a knight of the olden time you wear your motto next your heart and fight for it Death rather than defeat We are able because we think we are able Follow honor and the like These sentiments look beautifully as class mottoes on summer graduation programmes but some of them apparently disappear from circulation before cold weather sets in It is difficult to do right we repeat but not when mother is away from us for the first time since we were born not when she who is the very sun of home is shining elsewhere and we are groping in the dim light without her only remembering her last words and our last promises Not difficult when we think of the eyes the color of the blue velvet bonnet and the tears falling from them They are hundreds of miles away but we see them looking at us a dozen times a day and the last thing at night Not difficult when we think of father gay gallant father desperately ill and mother nursing him father with the kind smile and the jolly little sparkles of fun in his eyes father tall and broad shouldered splendid as the gods in full uniform father so brave that if a naval battle ever did come his way he would demolish the foe in an instant father with a warm strong hand clasping ours on high days and holidays taking us on great expeditions where we see life at its best and taste incredible joys The most quarrelsome family if the house burns down over their heads will stop disputing until the emergency is over and they get under a new roof Somehow in times of great trial calamity sorrow the differences that separate people are forgotten Isn t it rather like the process in mathematics where we reduce fractions to a common denominator It was no time for anything but superior behavior in the Carey household that was distinctly felt from kitchen to nursery Ellen the cook was tidier Joanna the second maid more amiable Nancy who was responsible rose earlier than the rest and went to bed later after locking doors and windows that had been left unlocked since the flood I am responsible she said three or four times each day to herself and it is to be feared to others Her heavenly patience in dressing Peter every few hours without comment struck the most callous observer as admirable Peter never remembered that he had any clothes on He might have been a real stormy petrel breasting the billows in his birthday suit and expecting his feathers to be dried when and how the Lord pleased He comported himself in the presence of dust mud water liquid refreshment and sticky substances exactly as if clean white sailor suits grew on every bush and could be renewed at pleasure Even Gilbert was moved to spontaneous admiration and respect at the sight of Nancy s zeal Nobody would know you Nancy it is simply wonderful and I only wish it could last he said Even this style of encomium was received sweetly though there had been moments in her previous history when Nancy would have retorted in a very pointed manner When she was responsible not even had he gone the length of calling Nancy an unspeakable pig would she have said anything She had a blissful consciousness that had she been examined indications of angelic wings and not bristles would have been discovered under her blouse Gilbert by the way never suspected that the masters in his own school wondered whether he had experienced religion or was working on some sort of boyish wager He took his two weekly reports home cautiously for fear that they might break on the way pasted them on large pieces of paper and framed them in elaborate red white and blue stars united by strips of gold paper How Captain and missus Carey laughed and cried over this characteristic message when it reached them Oh they are darlings Mother Carey cried Of course they are the Captain murmured feebly Why shouldn t they be considering you It is really just as easy to do right as wrong Kathleen said Nancy when the girls were going to bed one night Ye es assented Kathleen with some reservations in her tone for she was more judicial and logical than her sister But you have to keep your mind on it so and never relax a single bit Then it s lots easier for a few weeks than it is for long stretches That s true agreed Nancy it would be hard to keep it up forever And you have to love somebody or something like fury every minute or you can t do it at all How do the people manage that can t love like that or haven t anybody to love I don t know said Kathleen sleepily I m so worn out with being good that every night I just say my prayers and tumble into bed exhausted Last night I fell asleep praying I honestly did Tell that to the marines remarked Nancy incredulously IV THE BROKEN CIRCLE The three weeks were running into a month now and virtue still reigned in the Carey household But things were different Everybody but Peter saw the difference Peter dwelt from morn till eve in that Land of Pure Delight which is ignorance of death The children no longer bounded to meet the postman but waited till Joanna brought in the mail Steadily daily the letters changed in tone First they tried to be cheerful later on they spoke of trusting that the worst was past then of hoping that father was holding his own Oh if he was holding all his own sobbed Nancy If we were only there with him helping mother Ellen said to Joanna one morning in the kitchen It s my belief the Captain s not going to get well and I d like to go to Newburyport to see my cousin and not be in the house when the children s told And Joanna said Shame on you not to stand by em in their hour of trouble At which Ellen quailed and confessed herself a coward Finally came a day never to be forgotten a day that swept all the former days clean out of memory as a great wave engulfs all the little ones in its path a day when Uncle Allan being too ill to travel Cousin Ann of all people in the universe Cousin Ann came to bring the terrible news that Captain Carey was dead Never think that Cousin Ann did not suffer and sympathize and do her rocky best to comfort she did indeed but she was thankful that her task was of brief duration missus Carey knew how it would be and had planned all so that she herself could arrive not long after the blow had fallen Peter by his mother s orders she had thought of everything was at a neighbor s house the centre of all interest the focus of all gayety He was too young to see the tears of his elders with any profit baby plants grow best in sunshine The others were huddled together in a sad group at the front window eyes swollen handkerchiefs rolled into drenched pathetic little wads Cousin Ann came in from the dining room with a tumbler and spoon in her hand See here children she said bracingly you ve been crying for the last twelve hours without stopping and I don t blame you a mite If I was the crying kind I d do the same thing Now do you think you ve got grit enough all three of you to bear up for your mother s sake when she first comes in I ve mixed you each a good dose of aromatic spirits of ammonia and it s splendid for the nerves Your mother must get a night s sleep somehow and when she gets back a little of her strength you ll be the greatest comfort she has in the world The way you re carrying on now you ll be the death of her It was a good idea and the dose had courage in it Gilbert took the first sip Kathleen the second and Nancy the third and hardly had the last swallow disappeared down the poor aching throats before a carriage drove up to the gate Some one got out and handed out missus Carey whose step used to be lighter than Nancy s A strange gentleman oh not a stranger it was the dear Admiral helping mother up the path They had been unconsciously expecting the brown muff and blue velvet bonnet but these had vanished like father and all the beautiful things of the past years and in their place was black raiment that chilled their hearts But the black figure had flung back the veil that hid her from the longing eyes of the children and when she raised her face it was full of the old love She was grief stricken and she was pale but she was mother and the three young things tore open the door and clasped her in their arms sobbing choking whispering all sorts of tender comfort their childish tears falling like healing dew on her poor heart The Admiral soothed and quieted them each in turn all but Nancy Cousin Ann s medicine was of no avail and strangling with sobs Nancy fled to the attic until she was strong enough to say for mother s sake without a quiver in her voice Then she crept down and as she passed her mother s room on tiptoe she looked in and saw that the chair by the window the chair that had been vacant for a month was filled and that the black clad figure was what was left to them a strange sad quiet mother who had lost part of herself somewhere the gay part the cheerful part the part that made her so piquantly and entrancingly different from other women Nancy stole in softly and put her young smooth cheek against her mother s quietly stroking her hair There are four of us to love you and take care of you she said It isn t quite so bad as if there was nobody missus Carey clasped her close Oh my Nancy my first my oldest God will help me I know that but just now I need somebody close and warm and soft somebody with arms to hold and breath to speak and lips to kiss I ought not to sadden you nor lean on you you are too young but I must a little just at the first You see dear you come next to father Next to father Nancy s life was set to a new tune from that moment Here was her spur her creed the incentive the inspiration she had lacked She did not suddenly grow older than her years but simply in the twinkling of an eye came to a realization of herself her opportunity her privilege her duty the face of life had changed and Nancy changed with it Do you love me next to mother the Admiral had asked coaxingly once when Nancy was eight and on his lap as usual Oh dear no said Nancy thoughtfully shaking her head Why that s rather a blow to me the Admiral exclaimed pinching an ear and pulling a curl I flattered myself that when I was on my best behavior I came next to mother It s this way Addy dear said Nancy cuddling up to his waistcoat and giving a sigh of delight that there were so many nice people in the world It s just this way First there s mother and then all round mother there s a wide wide space and then father and you come next the space The Admiral smiled a grave lovely smile that often crept into his eyes when he held Mother Carey s chickens on his knee He kissed Nancy on the little white spot behind the ear where the brown hair curled in tiny rings like grape tendrils soft as silk and delicate as pencil strokes He said nothing but his boyish dreams were in the kiss and certain hopes of manhood that had never been realized He was thinking that Margaret Gilbert was a fortunate and happy woman to have become Mother Carey such a mother too that all about her was a wide wide space and next the space the rest of the world nearer or farther according to their merits He wondered if motherhood ought not to be like that and he thought if it were it would be a great help to God V HOW ABOUT JULIA We often speak of a family circle but there are none too many of them Parallel lines never meeting squares triangles oblongs and particularly those oblongs pulled askew known as rhomboids these and other geometrical figures abound but circles are comparatively few In a true family circle a father and a mother first clasp each other s hands liking well to be thus clasped then they stretch out a hand on either side and these are speedily grasped by children who hold one another firmly and complete the ring One child is better than nothing a great deal better than nothing it is at least an effort in the right direction but the circle that ensues is not even then a truly nice shape You can stand as handsomely as ever you like but it simply won t come round The minute that two three four five join in the roundness grows and the merriment too and the laughter and the power to do things Responsibility and care also but what is the use of discouraging circles when there are not enough of them anyway The Carey family circle had been round and complete with love and harmony between all its component parts In family rhomboids for instance mother loves the children and father does not or father does but does not love mother or father and mother love each other and the children do not get their share it is impossible to enumerate all the little geometrical peculiarities which keep a rhomboid from being a circle but one person can just stand out enough to spoil the shape or put hands behind back and refuse to join at all About the ugliest thing in the universe is that non joining habit You would think that anybody however dull might consider his hands and guess by the look of them that they must be made to work and help and take hold of somebody else s hands Miserable useless flabby paws those of the non joiner that he feeds and dresses himself with and then hangs to his selfish sides or puts behind his beastly back When Captain Carey went on his long journey into the unknown and uncharted land the rest of the Careys tried in vain for a few months to be still a family and did not succeed at all They clung as closely to one another as ever they could but there was always a gap in the circle where father had been Some men silent unresponsive absent minded and especially absorbed in business might drop out and not be missed but Captain Carey was full of vitality warmth and high spirits It is strange so many men think that the possession of a child makes them a father it does not but it is a curious and very general misapprehension Captain Carey was a boy with his boys and a gallant lover with his girls to his wife oh we will not even touch upon that ground she never did to any one or anything but her own heart Such an one could never disappear from memory such a loss could never be made wholly good The only thing to do was to remember father s pride and justify it to recall his care for mother and take his place so far as might be the only thing for all as the months went on was to be what mother called the three b s brave bright and busy To be the last was by far the easiest for the earliest effort at economy had been the reluctant dismissal of Joanna the chambermaid In old fashioned novels the devoted servant always insisted on remaining without wages but this story concerns itself with life at a later date Joanna wept at the thought of leaving but she never thought of the romantic and illogical expedient of staying on without compensation Captain Carey s salary had been five thousand dollars or rather was to have been for he had only attained his promotion three months before his death There would have been an extra five hundred dollars a year when he was at sea and on the strength of this addition to their former income he intended to increase the amount of his life insurance but it had not yet been done when the sudden illness seized him an illness that began so gently and innocently and terminated with such sudden and unexpected fatality The life insurance such as it was must be put into the bank for emergencies missus Carey realized that that was the only proper thing to do when there were four children under fifteen to be considered The pressing question however was how to keep it in the bank and subsist on a captain s pension of thirty dollars a month There was the ten thousand hers and the Captain s in Allan Carey s business but Allan was seriously ill with nervous prostration and no money put into his business ever had come out even in a modified form The Admiral was at the other end of the world and even had he been near at hand missus Carey would never have confided the family difficulties to him She could hardly have allowed him even to tide her over her immediate pressing anxieties remembering his invalid sister and his many responsibilities No the years until Gilbert was able to help or Nancy old enough to use her talents or the years before the money invested with Allan would bring dividends those must be years of self sacrifice on everybody s part and more even than that they must be fruitful years in which not mere saving and economizing but earning would be necessary It was only lately that missus Carey had talked over matters with the three eldest children but the present house was too expensive to be longer possible as a home and the question of moving was a matter of general concern Joanna had been up to the present moment the only economy but alas Joanna was but a drop in the necessary bucket On a certain morning in March missus Carey sat in her room with a letter in her lap the children surrounding her It was from mister Manson Allan Carey s younger partner the sort of letter that dazed her opening up as it did so many questions of expediency duty and responsibility The gist of it was this that Allan Carey was a broken man in mind and body that both for the climate and for treatment he was to be sent to a rest cure in the Adirondacks that sometime or other in mister Manson s opinion the firm s investments might be profitable if kept long enough and there was no difficulty in keeping them for nobody in the universe wanted them at the present moment that Allan s little daughter Julia had no source of income whatever after her father s monthly bills were paid and that her only relative outside of the Careys a certain Miss Ann Chadwick had refused to admit her into her house mister Carey only asked Miss Chadwick as a last resort wrote mister Manson for his very soul quailed at the thought of letting you his brother s widow suffer any more by his losses than was necessary and he studiously refused to let you know the nature and extent of his need Miss Chadwick s only response to his request was that she believed in every tub standing on its own bottom and if he had harbored the same convictions he would not have been in his present extremity I am telling you this my dear missus Carey the writer went on just to get your advice about the child I well know that your income will not support your own children what therefore shall we do with Julia I am a poor young bachelor with two sisters to support I shall find a position of course and I shall never cease nursing Carey s various affairs and projects during the time of his exile but I cannot assume an ounce more of financial responsibility There had been quite a council over the letter and parts of it had been read more than once by missus Carey but the children though very sympathetic with Uncle Allan and loud in their exclamations of Poor Julia had not suggested any remedy for the situation Well said missus Carey folding the letter there seems to be but one thing for us to do Do you mean that you are going to have Julia come and live with us be one of the family exclaimed Gilbert That is what I want to discuss she replied You three are the family as well as I Come in she called for she heard the swift feet of the youngest petrel ascending the stairs Come in Where is there a sweeter Peter a fleeter Peter a neater Peter than ours I should like to know and where a better adviser for the council Neater mother How can you inquired Kathleen I meant neater when he is just washed and dressed retorted Peter s mother Are you coming to the family council sweet Pete Peter climbed on his mother s knee and answered by a vague affirmative nod his whole mind being on the extraction of a slippery marble from a long necked bottle Then be quiet and speak only when we ask your advice continued missus Carey Unless I were obliged to children I should be sorry to go against all your wishes I might be willing to bear my share of a burden but more is needed than that I think said Nancy suddenly aware now of the trend of her mother s secret convictions I think Julia is a smug conceited vain affected little pea Here she caught her mother s eye and suddenly she heard inside of her head or heart or conscience a chime of words Next to father Making a magnificent oratorical leap she finished her sentence with only a second s break peacock but if mother thinks Julia is a duty a duty she is and we must brace up and do her Must we love her mother or can we just be good and polite to her giving her the breast and taking the drumstick She won t ever say Don t let me rob you like Cousin Ann when she takes the breast Kathleen looked distinctly unresigned She hated drumsticks and all that they stood for in life She disliked the wall side of the bed the middle seat in the carriage the heel of the loaf the underdone biscuit the tail part of the fish the scorched end of the omelet It will make more difference to me than anybody she said gloomily Everything makes more difference to you Kitty remarked Gilbert I mean I m always fourth when the cake plate s passed in everything Now Julia ll be fourth and I shall be fifth it s lucky people can t tumble off the floor Poor abused Kathleen cried Gilbert Well mother you re always right but I can t see why you take another one into the family when we ve been saying for a week there isn t even enough for us five to live on It looks mighty queer to put me in the public school and spend the money you save that way on Julia Way down deep in her heart Mother Carey felt a pang There was a little seed of hard self love in Gilbert that she wanted him to dig up from the soil and get rid of before it sprouted and waxed too strong Julia is a Carey chicken after all Gilbert she said But she s Uncle Allan s chicken and I m Captain Carey s eldest son That s the very note I should strike if I were you his mother responded only with a little different accent What would Captain Carey s eldest son like to do for his only cousin a little girl younger than himself a girl who had a very silly unwise unhappy mother for the first five years of her life and who is now practically fatherless for a time at least Gilbert wriggled as if in great moral discomfort as indeed he was Well he said I don t want to be selfish and if the girls say yes I ll have to fall in but it isn t logic all the same to ask a sixth to share what isn t enough for five I agree with you there Gilly smiled his mother The only question before the council is does logic belong at the top in the scale of reasons why we do certain things If we ask Julia to come she will have to fall into line as you say and share the family misfortunes as best she can She s a regular shirk and always was This from Kathleen She would never come at all if she guessed her cousins opinion of her that is very certain remarked missus Carey pointedly Now mother look me in the eye and speak the whole truth asked Nancy Do you like Julia Carey missus Carey laughed as she answered Frankly then I do not But she continued I do not like several of the remarks that have been made at this council yet I manage to bear them Of course I shan t call Julia smug and conceited to her face asserted Nancy encouragingly I hope that her bosom friend Gladys Ferguson has disappeared from view The last time Julia visited us Kitty and I got so tired of Gladys Ferguson s dresses her French maid her bedroom furniture and her travels abroad that we wrote her name on a piece of paper put it in a box and buried it in the back yard the minute Julia left the house When you write mother tell Julia there s a piece of breast for her but not a mouthful of my drumstick goes to Gladys Ferguson The more the hungrier better invite Gladys too suggested Gilbert then we can say like that simple little kid in Wordsworth Sisters and brother little maid How many may you be How many Seven in all she said And wondering looked at me Then it goes on thus laughed Nancy And who are they I pray you tell She answered Seven are we Mother with us makes five and then There s Gladys and Julee Everybody joined in the laugh then including Peter who was especially uproarious and who had an idea he had made the joke himself else why did they all kiss him How about Julia What do you say Peter asked his mother I want her She played horse once said Peter The opinion that the earth revolved around his one small person was natural at the age of four but the same idea of the universe still existed in Gilbert s mind A boy of thirteen ought perhaps to have a clearer idea of the relative sizes of world and individual at least that was the conviction in Mother Carey s mind VI NANCY S IDEA Nancy had a great many ideas first and last They were generally unique and interesting at least though it is to be feared that few of them were practical However it was Nancy s idea to build Peter a playhouse in the plot of ground at the back of the Charlestown house and it was she who was the architect and head carpenter That plan had brought much happiness to Peter and much comfort to the family It was Nancy s idea that she Gilbert and Kathleen should all be so equally polite to Cousin Ann Chadwick that there should be no favorite to receive an undue share of invitations to the Chadwick house Nancy had made two visits in succession both offered in the nature of tributes to her charms and virtues and she did not wish a third If you two can t be more attractive then I ll be less that s all was her edict Turn and turn about has got to be the rule in this matter I m not going to wear the martyr s crown alone it will adorn your young brows every now and then or I ll know the reason why It was Nancy s idea to let Joanna go and divide her work among the various members of the family It was also Nancy s idea that there being no strictly masculine bit of martyrdom to give to Gilbert he should polish the silver for his share This was an idea that proved so unpopular with Gilbert that it was speedily relinquished Gilbert was wonderful with tools so wonderful that Mother Carey feared he would be a carpenter instead of the commander of a great war ship but there seemed to be no odd jobs to offer him There came a day when even Peter realized that life was real and life was earnest When the floor was strewn with playthings his habit had been to stand amid the wreckage and smile whereupon Joanna would fly and restore everything to its accustomed place After the passing of Joanna Mother Carey sat placidly in her chair in the nursery and Peter stood ankle deep among his toys smiling Now put everything where it belongs sweet Pete said mother You do it smiled Peter I am very busy darning your stockings Peter I don t like to pick up Muddy No it isn t much fun but it has to be done Peter went over to the window and gazed at the landscape I dess I ll go play with Ellen he remarked in honeyed tones That would be nice after you clear away your toys and blocks I dess I ll play with Ellen first suggested Peter starting slowly towards the door No we always work first and play afterwards said mother going on darning Peter felt caught in a net of irresistible and pitiless logic Come and help me Muddy he coaxed and as she looked up he suddenly let fly all his armory of weapons at once two dimples tossing back of curls parted lips tiny white teeth sweet voice Mother Carey s impulse was to cast herself on the floor and request him simply to smile on her and she would do his lightest bidding but controlling her secret desires she answered I would help if you needed me but you don t You re a great big boy now I m not a great big boy cried Peter I m only a great big little boy Don t waste time sweet Pete go to work I want Joanna roared Peter with the voice of an infant bull So we all do It s because she had to go that I m darning stockings The net tightened round Peter s defenceless body and he hurled himself against his rocking horse and dragged it brutally to a corner Having disposed of most of his strength and temper in this operation he put away the rest of his goods and chattels more quietly but with streaming eyes and heaving bosom Splendid commented Mother Carey Joanna couldn t have done it better and it won t be half so much work next time Peter heard the words next time distinctly and knew the grim face of Duty at last though he was less than five The second and far more tragic time was when he was requested to make himself ready for luncheon Kathleen to stand near and help a little if really necessary Now Peter au fond was absolutely clean French phrases are detestable where there is any English equivalent but in this case there is none so I will explain to the youngest reader who may speak only one language that the base of Peter was always clean He received one full bath and several partial ones in every twenty four hours but su per im posed on this base were evidences of his eternal activities and indeed of other people s They were divided into three classes those contracted in the society of Joanna when she took him out of doors such as sand water mud grass stains paint lime putty or varnish those derived from visits to his sisters at their occupations such as ink paints lead pencils paste glue and mucilage those amassed in his stays with Ellen in the kitchen sugar molasses spice pudding sauce black currants raisins dough berry stains assorted according to season chocolate jelly jam and preserves these deposits were not deep but were simply dabs on the facade of Peter and through them the eyes and soul of him shone delicious and radiant They could be rubbed off with a moist handkerchief if water were handy and otherwise if it were not and the person who rubbed always wanted for some mysterious reason to kiss him immediately afterwards for Peter had the largest kissing acquaintance in Charlestown When Peter had scrubbed the parts of him that showed most and had performed what he considered his whole duty to his hair he appeared for the first time at the family table in such a guise that if the children had not been warned they would have gone into hysterics but he gradually grew to be proud of his toilets and careful that they should not occur too often in the same day since it appeared to be the family opinion that he should make them himself There was a tacit feeling not always expressed that Nancy after mother held the reins of authority and also that she was a person of infinite resource The Gloom Dispeller had been her father s name for her but he had never thought of her as a Path Finder a gallant adventurer into unknown and untried regions because there had been small opportunity to test her courage or her ingenuity missus Carey often found herself leaning on Nancy nowadays not as a dead weight but with just the hint of need just the suggestion of confidence that youth and strength and buoyancy respond to so gladly It had been decided that the house should be vacated as soon as a tenant could be found but the what next had not been settled Julia had confirmed Nancy s worst fears by accepting her aunt s offer of a home but had requested time to make Gladys Ferguson a short visit at Palm Beach all expenses being borne by the Parents of Gladys This estimable lady and gentleman had no other names or titles and were never spoken of as if they had any separate existence They had lived and loved and married and accumulated vast wealth and borne Gladys After that they had sunk into the background and Gladys had taken the stage I m sure I m glad she is going to the Fergusons exclaimed Kathleen One month less of her Yes Nancy replied but she ll be much worse more spoiled more vain more luxurious than before She ll want a gold chicken breast now We ve just packed away the finger bowls but out they ll have to come again Let her wash her own finger bowl a few days and she ll clamor for the simple life said Kathleen shrewdly Oh what a relief if the Fergusons would adopt Julia just to keep Gladys company Nobody would ever adopt Julia returned Nancy If she was yours you couldn t help it you d just take her to the Lord in prayer as the Sunday school hymn says but you d never go out and adopt her Matters were in this uncertain and unsettled state when Nancy came into her mother s room one evening when the rest of the house was asleep I saw your light so I knew you were reading Muddy I ve had such a bright idea I couldn t rest Muddy is not an attractive name unless you happen to know its true derivation and significance First there was mother dear and as persons under fifteen are always pressed for time and uniformly breathless this appellation was shortened to Motherdy and Peter being unable to struggle with that term had abbreviated it into Muddy Muddy in itself is undistinguished and even unpleasant but when accompanied by a close strangling hug pats on the cheek and ardent if somewhat sticky kisses grows by degrees to possess delightful associations Mother Carey enjoyed it so much from Peter that she even permitted it to be taken up by the elder children You mustn t have ideas after nine P M Nancy chided her mother Wrap the blue blanket around you and sit down with me near the fire You re not to say I m romantic or unpractical insisted Nancy leaning against her mother s knees and looking up into her face indeed you re not to say anything of any importance till I m all finished I m going to tell it in a long story too so as to work on your feelings and make you say yes Very well I m all ears Now put on your thinking cap Do you remember once years and years ago before Peter it was that father took us on a driving trip through some dear little villages in Maine The Careys never dated their happenings eighteen hundred and anything It was always Just before Peter Immediately after Peter or A Long Time after Peter which answered all purposes I remember It was one of Gilbert s thirsty days and we stopped at nearly every convenient pump to give him drinks of water and at noon we came to the loveliest wayside well with a real moss covered bucket do you remember I remember And we all clambered out and father said it was time for luncheon and we unpacked the baskets on the greensward near a beautiful tree and father said Don t spread the table too near the house dears or they ll cry when they see our doughnuts and Kitty who had been running about came up and cried It s an empty house come and look I remember And we all went in the gate and loved every bit of it the stone steps the hollyhocks growing under the windows the yellow paint and the green blinds and father looked in the windows and the rooms were large and sunny and we wanted to drive the horse into the barn and stay there forever I remember And Gilbert tore his trousers climbing on the gate and father laid him upside down on your lap and I ran and got your work bag and you mended the seat of his little trousers And father looked and looked at the house and said Bless its heart and said if he were rich he would buy the dear thing that afternoon and sleep in it that night and asked you if you didn t wish you d married the other man and you said there never was another man and you asked father if he thought on the whole that he was the poorest man in the world and father said no the very richest and he kissed us all round do you remember Do I remember O Nancy Nancy What do you think I am made of that I could ever forget Don t cry Muddy darling don t It was so beautiful and we have so many things like that to remember Yes said missus Carey I know it Part of my tears are grateful ones that none of you can ever recall an unloving word between your father and mother The idea said Nancy suddenly and briefly is to go and live in that darling house Nancy What for We ve got to leave this place and where could we live on less than in that tiny village It had a beautiful white painted academy don t you remember so we could go to school there Kathleen and I anyway if you could get enough money to keep Gilly at Eastover Of course I ve thought of the country but that far away spot never occurred to me What was its quaint little name Mizpah or Shiloh or Deborah or something like that It was Beulah said Nancy and father thought it exactly matched the place We even named the house recalled Mother Carey with a tearful smile There were vegetables growing behind it and flowers in front and your father suggested Garden Fore and Aft and I chose Happy Half Acre but father thought the fields that stretched back of the vegetable garden might belong to the place and if so there would be far more than a half acre of land And do you remember father said he wished we could do something to thank the house for our happy hour and I thought of the little box of plants we had bought at a wayside nursery Oh I do indeed I hadn t thought of it for years Father and you planted a tiny crimson rambler at the corner of the piazza at the side Do you suppose it ever rambled Muddy Because it would be ever so high now and full of roses in summer I wonder mused Mother Carey Oh it was a sweet tranquil restful place I wonder how we could find out about it It seems impossible that it should not have been rented or sold before this Let me see that was five years ago There was a nice old gentleman farther down the street quite in the village somebody who had known father when he was a boy So there was he had a quaint little law office not much larger than Peter s playhouse Perhaps we could find him He was very very old He may not be alive and I cannot remember his name Father called him Colonel I know that Oh how I wish dear Addy was here to help us If he were he would want to help us too much We must learn to bear our own burdens They won t seem so strange and heavy when we are more used to them Now go to bed dear We ll think of Beulah you and I and perhaps as we have been all adrift waiting for a wind to stir our sails Nancy s idea will be the thing to start us on our new voyage Beulah means land of promise that s a good omen And father found Beulah and father found the house and father blessed it and loved it and named it that makes ever so many more good omens more than enough to start housekeeping on Nancy answered kissing her mother goodnight VII OLD BEASTS INTO NEW Mother Carey went to sleep that night in greater peace than she had felt for months It had seemed to her all these last sad weeks as though she and her brood had been breasting stormy waters with no harbor in sight There were friends in plenty here and there but no kith and kin and the problems to be settled were graver and more complex than ordinary friendship could untangle vexed as it always was by its own problems She had but one keen desire to go to some quiet place where temptations for spending money would be as few as possible and there live for three or four years putting her heart and mind and soul on fitting the children for life If she could keep strength enough to guide and guard train and develop them into happy useful agreeable human beings masters of their own powers wise and discreet enough when years of discretion were reached to choose right paths that she conceived was her chief task in life and no easy one Happy I must contrive that they shall be she thought for unhappiness and discontent are among the foxes that spoil the vines Stupid they shall not be while I can think of any force to stir their brains they have ordinary intelligence all of them and they shall learn to use it dull and sleepy children I can t abide Fairly good they will be if they are busy and happy and clever enough to see the folly of being anything but good And so month after month for many years to come I must be helping Nancy and Kathleen to be the right sort of women and wives and mothers and Gilbert and Peter the proper kind of men and husbands and fathers Mother Carey s chickens must be able to show the good birds the way home as the Admiral said and I should think they ought to be able to set a few bad birds on the right track now and then Well all this would be a task to frighten and stagger many a person but it only kindled missus Carey s love and courage to a white heat Do you remember where Kingsley s redoubtable Tom the Water Baby swims past Shiny Wall and reaches at last Peacepool Peacepool where the good whales lie waiting till Mother Carey shall send for them to make them out of old beasts into new Tom swims up to the nearest whale and asks the way to Mother Carey There she is in the middle says the whale though Tom sees nothing but a glittering white peak like an iceberg That s Mother Carey spouts the whale as you will find if you get to her There she sits making old beasts into new all the year round How does she do that asks Tom That s her concern not mine the whale remarks discreetly And when Tom came nearer to the white glittering peak it took the form of something like a lovely woman sitting on a white marble throne And from the foot of the throne you remember there swam away out and out into the sea millions of new born creatures of more shapes and colors than man ever dreamed And they were Mother Carey s children whom she makes all day long Tom expected I am still telling you what happened to the famous water baby Tom expected like some grown people who ought to know better that he would find Mother Carey snipping piecing fitting stitching cobbling basting filing planing hammering turning polishing moulding measuring chiselling clipping and so forth as men do when they go to work to make anything But instead of that she sat quite still with her chin upon her hand looking down into the sea with two great blue eyes as blue as the sea itself As blue as our own mother s blue velvet bonnet Kitty would have said Was Beulah the right place wondered missus Carey as she dropped asleep And all night long she heard in dreams the voice of that shining little river that ran under the bridge near Beulah village and all night long she walked in fields of buttercups and daisies and saw the June breeze blow the tall grasses She entered the yellow painted house and put the children to bed in the different rooms and the instant she saw them sleeping there it became home and her heart put out little roots that were like tendrils but they grew so fast that by morning they held the yellow house fast and refused to let it go She looked from its windows onto the gardens fore and aft and they seemed like the rest of little Beulah village full of sweet promise In the back were all sorts of good things to eat growing in profusion but modestly out of sight and in front where passers by could see their beauty and sniff their fragrance old fashioned posies bloomed and rioted and tossed gay perfumed heads in the sunshine She awoke refreshed and strong and brave not the same woman who took Nancy s idea to bed with her for this woman s heart and hope had somehow flown from the brick house in Charlestown and had built itself a new nest in Beulah s green trees the elms and willows that overhung the shining river An idea of her own ran out and met Nancy s half way Instead of going herself to spy out the land of Beulah why not send Gilbert It was a short inexpensive railway journey with no change of cars Gilbert was nearly fourteen and thus far seemed to have no notion of life as a difficult enterprise No mother who respects her boy or respects herself can ask him flatly Do you intend to grow up with the idea of taking care of me of having an eye to your sisters or do you consider that since I brought you into the world I must provide both for myself and you until you are a man or forever and a day after if you feel inclined to shirk your part in the affair Gilbert talked of his college course as confidently as he had before his father s death It was Nancy who as the eldest seemed the head of the family but Gilbert only a year or so her junior ought to grow into the head somehow or other The way to begin would be to give him a few delightful responsibilities such as would appeal to his pride and sense of importance and gradually to mingle with them certain duties of headship neither so simple nor so agreeable Beulah would be a delightful beginning Nancy the Pathfinder would have packed a bag and gone to Beulah on an hour s notice found the real estate dealer in case there was such a metropolitan article in the village looked up her father s old friend the Colonel with the forgotten surname discovered the owner of the charming house rented it and brought back the key in triumph But Nancy was a girl rich in courage and enterprise while Gilbert s manliness and leadership and discretion and consideration for others needed a vigorous decisive continued push If Nancy s idea was good Mother Carey s idea matched it To see Gilbert valise in hand eight dollars in pocket leaving Charlestown on a Friday noon after school was equal to watching Columbus depart for an unknown land Thrilling is the only word that will properly describe it and the group that followed his departure from the upper windows used it freely and generously He had gone gayly downstairs and Nancy flung after him a small packet in an envelope just as he reached the door There s a photograph of your mother and sisters she called In case the owner refuses to rent the house to you just show him the rest of the family And don t forget to say that the rent is exorbitant whatever it is They watched him go jauntily down the street Mother Carey with special pride in her eyes He had on his second best suit and it looked well on his straight slim figure He had a gallant air had Gilbert and one could not truly say it was surface gallantry either it simply did not at present go very deep No one could call him anything but a fine boy thought the mother and surely the outside is a key to what is within His firm chin his erect head his bright eye his quick tread his air of alert self reliance surely here is enough for any mother to build on VIII THE KNIGHT OF BEULAH CASTLE Nancy s flushed face was glued to the window pane until Gilbert turned the corner He looked back took off his cap threw a kiss to them and was out of sight Oh how I wish I could have gone cried Nancy I hope he won t forget what he went for I hope he won t take No for an answer Oh why wasn t I a boy missus Carey laughed as she turned from the window It will be a great adventure for the man of the house Nancy so never mind What would the Pathfinder have done if she had gone instead of her brother I Oh Millions of things said Nancy pacing the sitting room floor her head bent a little her hands behind her back I should be going to the new railway station in Boston now and presently I should be at the little grated window asking for a return ticket to Greentown station Four ten the man would say and I would fling my whole eight dollars in front of the wicket to show him what manner of person I was Then I would pick up the naught from naught is naught one from ten is nine five from eight is three three dollars and ninety cents or thereabouts and turn away Parlor car seat Miss the young man would say a warm worried young man in a seersucker coat and I would answer No thank you I always go in the common car to study human nature That s what the Admiral says but of course the ticket man couldn t know that the Admiral is an intimate friend of mine and would think I said it myself Then I would go down the platform and take the common car for Greentown Soon we would be off and I would ask the conductor if Greentown was the station where one could change and drive to Beulah darling little Beulah shiny rivered Beulah not breathing a word about the yellow house for fear he would jump off the train and rent it first Then he would say he never heard of Beulah I would look pityingly at him but make no reply because it would be no use and anyway I know Greentown is the changing place because I ve asked three men before but Cousin Ann always likes to make conductors acknowledge they don t know as much as she does Then I present a few peanuts or peppermints to a small boy and hold an infant for a tired mother because this is what good children do in the Sunday school books but I do not mingle much with the passengers because my brow is furrowed with thought and I am travelling on important business You can well imagine that by this time Mother Carey has taken out her darning and Kathleen her oversewing to which she pays little attention because she so adores Nancy s tales Peter has sat like a small statue ever since his quick ear caught the sound of a story His eyes follow Nancy as she walks up and down improvising and the only interruption she ever receives from her audience is Kathleen s or Mother Carey s occasional laugh at some especially ridiculous sentence The hours fly by like minutes continues Nancy stopping by the side window and twirling the curtain tassel absently I scan the surrounding country to see if anything compares with Beulah and nothing does No such river no such trees no such well no such old oaken bucket and above all no such Yellow House All the other houses I see are but as huts compared with the Yellow House of Beulah Soon the car door opens a brakeman looks in and calls in a rich baritone voice Greentown Greentown Do not leave any passles in the car And if you know beforehand what he is going to say you can understand him quite nicely so I take up my bag and go down the aisle with dignity Step lively Miss cries the brakeman but I do not heed him it is not likely that a person renting country houses will move save with majesty Alighting I inquire if there is any conveyance for Beulah and there is a wagon and a white horse I ask the driver boldly to drive me to the Colonel s office He does not ask which Colonel or what Colonel he simply says Colonel Foster I s pose and I say Certainly We arrive at the office and when I introduce myself as Captain Carey s daughter I receive a glad welcome The Colonel rings a bell and an aged beldame approaches making a deep curtsy and offering me a beaker of milk a crusty loaf a few venison pasties and a cold goose stuffed with humming birds When I have reduced these to nothingness I ask if the yellow house on the outskirts of the village is still vacant and the Colonel replies that it is at which unexpected but hoped for answer I fall into a deep swoon When I awake the aged Colonel is bending over me his long white goat s beard tickling my chin Mother Carey stops her darning now and Kathleen makes no pretence of sewing the story is fast approaching its climax everybody feels that including Peter who hopes that he will be in it in some guise or other before it ends Art thou married lady the aged one asks courteously and if not wilt thou be mine I tremble because he does not seem to notice that he is eighty or ninety and I but fifteen yet I fear if I reject him too scornfully and speedily the Yellow House will never be mine Grant me a little time in which to fit myself for this great honor I say modestly and a mighty good idea too that I got out of a book the other day when suddenly as I gaze upward my suitor s white hair turns to brown his beard drops off his wrinkles disappear and he stands before me a young Knight in full armor Wilt go to the yellow castle with me sweet lady he asks Wilt I I cry in ecstasy and we leap on the back of a charger hitched to the Colonel s horseblock We dash down the avenue of elms and maples that line the village street and we are at our journey s end before the Knight has had time to explain to me that he was changed into the guise of an old man by an evil sorcerer some years before and could never return to his own person until some one appeared who wished to live in the yellow house which is Beulah Castle We approach the well known spot and the little picket gate and the Knight lifts me from the charger s back Here are house and lands and all are yours sweet lady if you have a younger brother There is treasure hidden in the ground behind the castle and no one ever finds such things save younger brothers I have a younger brother I cry and his name is Peter At this point in Nancy s chronicle Peter is nearly beside himself with excitement He has been sitting on his hassock his hands outspread upon his fat knees his lips parted his eyes shining Somewhere sometime in Nancy s stories there is always a Peter He lives for that moment Nancy stifling her laughter goes on rapidly And so the Knight summons Younger Brother Peter to come and he flies in a great air ship from Charlestown to Beulah And when he arrives the Knight asks him to dig for the buried treasure Peter here turns up his sleeves to his dimpled elbows and seizes an imaginary implement Peter goes to the back of the castle and there is a beautiful garden filled with corn and beans and peas and lettuce and potatoes and beets and onions and turnips and carrots and parsnips and tomatoes and cabbages He takes his magic spade and it leads him to the cabbages He digs and digs and in a moment the spade strikes metal He has found the gold cries the Knight and Peter speedily lifts from the ground pots and pots of ducats and florins and gulden and doubloons Peter nods his head at the mention of each precious coin and then claps his hands and hugs himself with joy and rocks himself to and fro on the hassock in his ecstasy at being the little god in the machine Then down the village street there is the sound of hurrying horses feet and in a twinkling a gayly painted chariot comes into view and in it are sitting the Queen Mother and the Crown Prince and Princess of the House of Carey They alight Peter meets them at the gate a pot of gold in each hand They enter the castle and put their umbrellas in one corner of the front hall and their rubbers in the other one behind the door Lady Nancibel trips up the steps after them and turning says graciously to her Knight Would you just as soon marry somebody else I am very much attached to my family and they will need me dreadfully while they are getting settled I did not recall the fact that I had asked you to be mine courteously answers the youth You did she responds very much embarrassed as she supposed of course he would remember his offer made when he was an old man with a goat s beard but gladly will I forget all if you will relinquish my hand As you please answers the Knight generously I can deny you nothing when I remember you have brought me back my youth Prithee is the other lady bespoke she of the golden hair Many have asked but I have chosen none answers the Crown Princess Kitty modestly as is her wont Then you will do nicely says the Knight since all I wish is to be son in law to the Queen Mother Right you are my hearty cries Prince Gilbert de Carey and as we much do need a hand at the silver polishing I will gladly give my sister in marriage So they all went into Beulah Castle and locked the door behind them and there they lived in great happiness and comfort all the days of their lives and there they died when it came their time and they were all buried by the shores of the shining river of Beulah Oh it is perfectly splendid cried Kathleen About the best one you ever told But do change the end a bit Nancy dear It s dreadful for him to marry Kitty when he chose Nancibel first I d like him awfully but I don t want to take him that way Well how would this do and Nancy pondered a moment before going on Right you are my hearty cries Prince Gilbert de Carey and as we do need a hand at the silver polishing I will gladly give my sister in marriage Hold cries the Queen Mother All is not as it should be in this coil How can you tell she says turning to the knightly stranger that memory will not awake one day and you recall the adoration you felt when you first beheld the Lady Nancibel in a deep swoon The Young Knight s eyes took on a far away look and he put his hand to his forehead It comes back to me now he sighed I did love the Lady Nancibel passionately and I cannot think how it slipped my mind I release you willingly exclaimed the Crown Princess Kitty haughtily for a million suitors await my nod and thou wert never really mine But the other lady rejects me also responds the luckless youth the tears flowing from his eagle eyes onto his crimson mantle Wilt delay the nuptials until I am eighteen and the castle is set in order asks the Lady Nancibel relentingly Since it must be I do pledge thee my vow to wait says the Knight And I do beg the fair one with the golden locks to consider the claims of my brother not my equal perhaps but still a gallant youth I will enter him on my waiting list as number Three Hundred and Seventeen responds the Crown Princess Kitty than whom no violet could be more shy Tis all he can expect and more than I should promise So they all lived in the yellow castle in great happiness forever after and were buried by the shores of the shining river of Beulah Does that suit you better Simply lovely cried Kitty and the bit about my modesty is too funny for words Oh if some of it would only happen But I am afraid Gilbert will not stir up any fairy stories and set them going Some of it will happen exclaimed Peter I shall dig every single day till I find the gold pots You are a pot of gold yourself filled full and running over Now Nancy run and write down your fairy tale while you remember it said Mother Carey It is as good an exercise as any other and you still tell a story far better than you write it Nancy did this sort of improvising every now and then and had done it from earliest childhood and sometimes of late Mother Carey looked at her eldest chicken and wondered if after all she had hatched in her a bird of brighter plumage or rarer song than the rest or a young eagle whose strong wings would bear her to a higher flight IX GILBERT S EMBASSY The new station had just been built in Boston and it seemed a great enterprise to Gilbert to be threading his way through the enormous spaces getting his information by his own wits and not asking questions like a stupid schoolboy Like all children of naval officers the Careys had travelled ever since their birth still this was Gilbert s first journey alone and nobody was ever more conscious of the situation nor more anxious to carry it off effectively He entered the car opened his bag took out his travelling cap and his copy of Ben Hur then threw the bag in a lordly way into the brass rack above the seat He opened his book but immediately became interested in a young couple just in front of him They were carefully dressed even to details of hats and gloves and they had an unmistakable air of wedding journey about them that interested the curious boy Presently the conductor came in Pausing in front of the groom he said Tickets please then You re on the wrong train Wrong train Of course I m not on the wrong train You must be mistaken The ticket agent told me to take this train Can t help that sir this train don t go to Lawrence It s very curious I asked the brakeman and two porters Ain t this the three point five This is the three point five Where does it go then Goes to Lowell Lowell the first stop But I don t want to go to Lowell What s the matter with Lowell It s a good place all right But I have an appointment in Lawrence at four o clock I m dretful sorry but you ll have to keep it in Lowell I guess Tickets please this to a pretty girl on the opposite side from Gilbert a pink and white unsophisticated maiden very much interested in the woes of the bride and groom and entirely sympathetic with the groom s helpless wrath On the wrong train Miss said the conductor On the wrong train She spoke in a tone of anguish getting up and catching her valise frantically It can t be the wrong train Isn t it the White Mountain train Yes Miss but it don t go to North Conway it goes to Fabyan s But my father put me on this train and everybody said it was the White Mountain train So it is Miss but if you wanted to stop at North Conway you d ought to have taken the three point fifty five platform eight Put me off then please and let me wait for the three point fifty five Can t do it Miss this is an express train only stops at Lowell where this gentleman is going Here the conductor gave a sportive wink at the bridegroom who had an appointment in Lawrence The pretty girl burst into a flood of tears and turned her face despairingly to the window while the bride talked to the groom excitedly about what they ought to have done and what they would have done had she been consulted Gilbert could hardly conceal his enjoyment of the situation and indeed everybody within hearing that is anybody who chanced to be on the right train looked at the bride and groom and the pretty girl and tittered audibly Why don t people make inquiries thought Gilbert superciliously Perhaps they have never been anywhere before but even that s no excuse He handed his ticket to the conductor with a broad smile saying in an undertone What kind of passengers are we carrying this afternoon The usual kind I guess You re on the wrong train sonny Gilbert almost leaped into the air and committed himself by making a motion to reach down his valise I on the wrong train he asked haughtily That can t be so the ticket agent told me the three point five was the only fast train to Greentown Mebbe he thought you said Greenville this train goes to Greenville if that ll do you Folks ain t used to the new station yet and the ticket agents are all bran new too guess you got hold of a tenderfoot But Greenville will not do for me exclaimed Gilbert I want to go to Greentown Well get off at Lowell the first stop you ll know when you come to it because this gentleman that wanted to go to Lawrence will get off there and this young lady that was intendin to go to North Conway There ll be four of you jest a nice party Gilbert choked with wrath as he saw the mirth of the other passengers What train shall I be able to take to Greentown he managed to call after the conductor Don t know sonny Ask the ticket agent in the Lowell deepot he s an old hand and he ll know Gilbert s pride was terribly wounded but his spirits rose a little later when he found that he would only have to wait twenty minutes in the Lowell station before a slow train for Greentown would pick him up and that he should still reach his destination before bedtime and need never disclose his stupidity After all this proved to be his only error for everything moved smoothly from that moment and he was as prudent and successful an ambassador as Mother Carey could have chosen He found the Colonel whose name was not Foster by the way but Wheeler and the Colonel would not allow him to go to the Mansion House Beulah s one small hotel but insisted that he should be his guest That evening he heard from the Colonel the history of the yellow house and the next morning the Colonel drove him to the store of the man who had charge of it during the owner s absence in Europe after which Gilbert was conducted in due form to the premises for a critical examination The Yellow House as Garden Fore and Aft seemed destined to be chiefly called was indeed the only house of that color for ten miles square It had belonged to the various branches of a certain family of Hamiltons for fifty years or more but in course of time when it fell into the hands of the Lemuel Hamiltons it had no sort of relation to their mode of existence One summer a year or two before the Careys had seen it the sons and daughters had come on from Boston and begged their father to let them put it in such order that they could take house parties of young people there for the week end mister Hamilton indulgently allowed them a certain amount to be expended as they wished and with the help of a local carpenter they succeeded in doing several things to their own complete satisfaction though it could not be said that they added to the value of the property The house they regarded merely as a camping out place and after they had painted some bedroom floors set up some cots bought a kitchen stove and some pine tables and chairs they regarded that part of the difficulty as solved expending the rest of the money in turning the dilapidated barn into a place where they could hold high revels of various innocent sorts The two freshman sons two boarding school daughters and a married sister barely old enough to chaperon her own baby brought parties of gay young friends with them several weeks in succession These excursions were a great delight to the villagers who thus enjoyed all the pleasures and excitements of a circus with none of its attendant expenses They were of short duration however for Lemuel Hamilton was appointed consul to a foreign port and took his wife and daughters with him The married sister died and in course of time one of the sons went to China to learn tea planting and the other established himself on a ranch in Texas Thus the Lemuel Hamiltons were scattered far and wide and as the Yellow House in Beulah had small value as real estate and had never played any part in their lives it was almost forgotten as the busy years went by mister Hamilton told me four years ago when I went up to Boston to meet him that if I could get any rent from respectable parties I might let the house though he wouldn t lay out a cent on repairs in order to get a tenant But land there ain t no call for houses in Beulah nor hain t been for twenty years so Bill Harmon the storekeeper told Gilbert The house has got a tight roof and good underpinnin and if your folks feel like payin out a little money for paint n paper you can fix it up neat s a pin The Hamilton boys jest raised Cain out in the barn so t you can t keep no critters there We couldn t have a horse or a cow anyway said Gilbert Well it s lucky you can t I could a rented the house twice over if there d been any barn room but them confounded young scalawags ripped out the horse and cow stalls cleared away the pig pen and laid a floor they could dance on The barn chamber s full o their stuff so t no hay can go in altogether there ain t any nameable kind of a fool trick them young varmints didn t play on these premises When a farmer s lookin for a home for his family and stock t ain t no use to show him a dance hall The only dancin a Maine farmer ever does is dancin round to git his livin out o the earth that keeps his feet flyin fast enough Well said Gilbert I think if you can put the rent cheap enough so that we could make the necessary repairs I think my mother would consider it Would you want it for more n this summer asked mister Harmon Oh yes we want to live here Want to live here exclaimed the astonished Harmon Well it s been a long time sence we heard anybody say that eh Colonel Well now sonny Gilbert did wish that respect for budding manhood could be stretched a little further in this locality I tell you what I ain t goin to stick no fancy price on these premises It wouldn t be any use said Gilbert boldly My father has died within a year there are four of us beside my mother and there s a cousin too who is dependent on us We have nothing but a small pension and the interest on five thousand dollars life insurance Mother says we must go away from all our friends live cheaply and do our own work until Nancy Kitty and I grow old enough to earn something Colonel Wheeler and mister Harmon both liked Gilbert Carey at sight and as he stood there uttering his boyish confidences with great friendliness and complete candor both men would have been glad to meet him halfway Well Harmon it seems to me we shall get some good neighbors if we can make terms with missus Carey said the Colonel If you ll fix a reasonable figure I ll undertake to write to Hamilton and interest him in the affair All right Now Colonel I d like to make a proposition right on the spot before you and you can advise sonny here You see Lem has got his taxes to pay they re small of course but they re an expense and he d ought to carry a little insurance on his buildings tho he ain t had any up to now On the other hand if he can get a tenant that ll put on a few shingles and clapboards now and then or a coat o paint n a roll o wall paper his premises won t go to rack n ruin same s they re in danger o doin at the present time Now sonny would your mother feel like keepin up things a little mite if we should say sixty dollars a year rent payable monthly or quarterly as is convenient Gilbert s head swam and his eyes beheld such myriads of stars that he felt it must be night instead of day The rent of the Charlestown house was seven hundred dollars a year and the last words of his mother had been to the effect that two hundred was the limit he must offer for the yellow house as she did not see clearly at the moment how they could afford even that sum What would be your advice Colonel stammered the boy I think sixty dollars is not exorbitant the Colonel answered calmly he had seen Beulah real estate fall a peg a year for twenty successive years though naturally you cannot pay that sum and make any extravagant repairs Then I will take the house Gilbert remarked largely My mother left the matter of rent to my judgment and we will pay promptly in advance Shall I sign any papers Land o Goshen the marks your little fist would make on a paper wouldn t cut much of a figure in a court o law chuckled old Harmon You jest let the Colonel fix up matters with your ma Can I walk back Colonel asked Gilbert trying to preserve some dignity under the storekeeper s attacks I d like to take some measurements and make some sketches of the rooms for my mother All right the Colonel responded Your train doesn t go till two o clock I ll give you a bite of lunch and take you to the station If Mother Carey had watched Gilbert during the next half hour she would have been gratified for every moment of the time he grew more and more into the likeness of the head of a family He looked at the cellar at the shed at the closets and cupboards all over the house and at the fireplaces He paced off all the rooms and set down their proportions in his note book he even decided as to who should occupy each room and for what purposes they should be used his judgment in every case being thought ridiculous by the feminine portion of his family when they looked at his plans Then he locked the doors carefully with a fine sense of ownership and strolled away with many a backward look and thought at the yellow house At the station he sent a telegram to his mother Nancy had secretly given him thirty five cents when he left home I am hoarding for the Admiral s Christmas present she whispered but it s no use I cannot endure the suspense about the house a moment longer than is necessary Just telegraph us yes or no and we shall get the news four hours before your train arrives One can die several times in four hours and I m going to commit one last extravagance at the Admiral s expense At three o clock on Saturday afternoon a telegraph boy came through the gate and rang the front door bell You go Kitty I haven t the courage said Nancy sitting down on the sofa heavily A moment later the two girls and Peter who for once didn t count gazed at their mother breathlessly as she opened the envelope Her face lighted as she read aloud Victory perches on my banners Have accomplished all I went for GILBERT Hurrah cried both girls The yellow house is the House of Carey forevermore Will Peter go too asked the youngest Carey eagerly his nose quivering as it always did in excitement when it became an animated question point I should think he would exclaimed Kitty clasping him in her arms What would the yellow house be without Peter I wish Gilbert wouldn t talk about his banners said Nancy critically as she looked at the telegram over her mother s shoulder They re not his banners at all they re ours Carey banners that s what they are Mother Carey had wished the same thing but hoped that Nancy had not noticed the Gilbertian flaw in the telegram X THE CAREYS FLITTING The Charlestown house was now put immediately into the hands of several agents for missus Carey s lease had still four years to run and she was naturally anxious to escape from this financial responsibility as soon as possible As a matter of fact only three days elapsed before she obtained a tenant and the agent had easily secured an advance of a hundred dollars a year to the good as Captain Carey had obtained a very favorable figure when he took the house It was the beginning of April and letters from Colonel Wheeler had already asked instructions about having the vegetable garden ploughed It was finally decided that the girls should leave their spring term of school unfinished and that the family should move to Beulah during Gilbert s Easter vacation Mother Carey gave due reflection to the interrupted studies but concluded that for two girls like Nancy and Kathleen the making of a new home would be more instructive and inspiring and more fruitful in its results than weeks of book learning Youth delights in change in the prospect of new scenes and fresh adventures and as it is never troubled by any doubts as to the wisdom of its plans the Carey children were full of vigor and energy just now Charlestown the old house the daily life all had grown sad and dreary to them since father had gone Everything spoke of him Even mother longed for something to lift her thought out of the past and give it wings so that it might fly into the future and find some hope and comfort there There was a continual bustle from morning till night and a spirit of merriment that had long been absent The Scotch have a much prettier word than we for all this and what we term moving they call flitting The word is not only prettier but in this instance more appropriate It was such a buoyant youthful affair this Carey flitting Light forms darted up and down the stairs and past the windows appearing now at the back now at the front of the house with a picture or a postage stamp or a dish or a penwiper or a pillow or a basket or a spool The chorus of Where shall we put this Muddy Where will this go May we throw this away would have distracted a less patient parent When Gilbert returned from school at four the air was filled with sounds of hammering and sawing and filing screwing and unscrewing and it was joy unspeakable to be obliged or at least almost obliged to call in clarion tones to one another across the din and fanfare and to compel answers in a high key Peter took a constant succession of articles to the shed where packing was going on but his chief treasures were deposited in a basket at the front gate with the idea that they would be transported as his personal baggage The pile grew and grew a woolly lamb two Noah s arks bottles and marbles innumerable a bag of pebbles a broken steam engine two china nest eggs an orange a banana and some walnuts a fishing line a trowel a ball of string These give an idea of the quality of Peter s effects but not of the quantity Ellen the cook labored loyally for it was her last week s work with the family She would be left behind like Charlestown and all the old life when Mother Carey and the stormy petrels flitted across unknown waters from one haven to another Joanna having earlier proved utterly unromantic in her attitude Nancy went further with Ellen and gave her an English novel called The Merriweathers in which an old family servant had not only followed her employers from castle to hovel remaining there without Wages for years but had insisted on lending all her savings to the Mistress of the Manor Ellen the cook had loved The Merriweathers saying it was about the best book that ever she had read and Miss Nancy would like to know always being so interested that she Ellen had found a place near Joanna in Salem where she was offered five dollars a month more than she had received with the Careys Nancy congratulated her warmly and then tearing The Merriweathers to shreds she put them in the kitchen stove in Ellen s temporary absence If ever I write a book she ejaculated as she stoked the fire with Gwendolen and Reginald Merriweather with the Mistress of the Manor and especially with the romantic family servitor if ever I write a book she repeated with emphatic gestures it won t have any fibs in it and I suppose it will be dull she reflected as she remembered how she had wept when the Merriweathers Bridget brought her savings of a hundred pounds to her mistress in a handkerchief During these preparations for the flitting Nancy had a fresh idea every minute or two and gained immense prestige in the family Inspired by her eldest daughter missus Carey sold her grand piano getting an old fashioned square one and a hundred and fifty dollars in exchange It had been a wedding present from a good old uncle who if he had been still alive would have been glad to serve his niece now that she was in difficulties Nancy her sleeves rolled up her curly hair flecked with dust and cobwebs flew down from the attic into Kathleen s room just after supper I have an idea she said in a loud whisper You mustn t have too many or we shan t take any interest in them Kitty answered provokingly This is for your ears alone Kitty Oh that s different Tell me quickly It s an idea to get rid of the Curse of the House of Carey It can t be done Nancy you know it can t Even if you could think out a way mother couldn t be made to agree She must never know I would not think of mixing up a good lovely woman like mother in such an affair This was said so mysteriously that Kathleen almost suspected that bloodshed was included in Nancy s plan It must be explained that when young Ensign Carey and Margaret Gilbert had been married Cousin Ann Chadwick had presented them with four tall black and white marble mantel ornaments shaped like funeral urns and then feeling that she had not yet shown her approval of the match sufficiently she purchased a large group of clay statuary entitled You Dirty Boy The Careys had moved often like all naval families but even when their other goods and chattels were stored Cousin Ann generously managed to defray the expense of sending on to them the mantel ornaments and the Dirty Boy I know what your home is to you she used to say to them and how you must miss your ornaments If I have chanced to give you things as unwieldy as they are handsome I ought to see that you have them around you without trouble or expense and I will So for sixteen years save for a brief respite when the family was in the Philippines their existence was blighted by these hated objects Once when they had given an especially beautiful party for the Admiral Captain Carey had carried the whole lot to the attic but Cousin Ann arrived unexpectedly in the middle of the afternoon and Nancy with the aid of Gilbert and Joanna had brought them down the back way and put them in the dining room You ve taken the ornaments out of the parlor I see Cousin Ann said at the dinner table It s rather nice for a change and after all perhaps you spend as much time in this room as in any and entertain as much company here Cousin Ann always had been always would be a frequent visitor for she was devoted to the family in her own peculiar way what therefore could Nancy be proposing to do with the Carey Curse Listen my good girl Nancy now said to Kathleen after she had closed the door Thou dost know that the china packer comes early to morrow morn and that e en now the barrels and boxes and excelsior are bestrewing the dining room Yes Then you and I who have been brought up under the shadow of those funeral urns and have seen that tidy mother scrubbing the ears of that unwilling boy ever since we were born you and I or thou and I perhaps I should say will do a little private packing before the true packer arriveth Still do I not see the point wench said the puzzled Kathleen trying to model her conversation on Nancy s though she was never thoroughly successful Don t call me wench because I am the mistress and you my tiring woman but when you Watch and assist me at the packing a great light will break upon you Nancy answered In the removal of cherished articles from Charlestown to Beulah certain tragedies will occur certain accidents will happen although Cousin Ann knows that the Carey family is a well regulated one But if there are accidents and there will be my good girl then the authors of them will be forever unknown to all but thou and I Wouldst prefer to pack this midnight or at cock crow for packing is our task I simply hate cock crow and you know it said Kathleen testily Why not now Ellen and Gilbert are out and mother is rocking Peter to sleep Very well come on and step softly It won t take long because I have planned all in secret well and thoroughly Don t puff and blow like that Mother will hear you I m excited whispered Kathleen as they stole down the back stairs and went into the parlor for the funeral urns which they carried silently to the dining room These safely deposited they took You Dirty Boy from its abominable pedestal of Mexican onyx also Cousin Ann s gift and staggered under its heavyweight their natural strength being considerably sapped by suppressed laughter Nancy chose an especially large and stout barrel They put a little very little excelsior in the bottom then a pair of dumb bells then a funeral urn then a little hay and another funeral urn crosswise The spaces between were carelessly filled in with Indian clubs On these they painfully dropped You Dirty Boy and on top of him the other pair of funeral urns more dumbbells and another Indian club They had packed the barrel in the corner where it stood so they simply laid the cover on top and threw a piece of sacking carelessly over it The whole performance had been punctuated with such hysterical laughter from Kathleen that she was too weak to be of any real use she simply aided and abetted the chief conspirator The night was not as other nights The girls kept waking up to laugh a little then they went to sleep and waked again and laughed again and so on Nancy composed several letters to her Cousin Ann dated from Beulah and explaining the sad accident that had occurred As she concocted these documents between her naps she could never remember in her whole life any such night of mirth and minstrelsy and not one pang of conscience interfered to cloud the present joy nor dim that anticipation which is even greater Nancy was downstairs early next morning and managed to be the one to greet the china packers We filled one barrel last evening she explained to them Will you please head that up before you begin work which one of the men obligingly did We ll mark all this stuff and take it down to the station this afternoon said the head packer to missus Carey Be careful with it won t you she begged We are very fond of our glass and china our clocks and all our little treasures You won t have any breakage so long as you deal with James Perkins company said the packer Nancy went back into the room for a moment to speak with the skilful virtuous J P company There s no need to use any care with that corner barrel she said carelessly It has nothing of value in it James Perkins went home in the middle of the afternoon and left his son to finish the work and the son tagged and labelled and painted with all his might The Dirty Boy barrel in the corner being separated from the others looked to him especially important so he gave particular attention to that pasted on it one label marked Fragile one This Side Up two Glass with Care and finding several Perishables in his pocket tied on a few of those and removed the entire lot of boxes crates and barrels to the freight depot The man who put the articles in the car was much interested in the Dirty Boy barrel You d ought to have walked to Greentown and carried that one in your arms he jeered What is the precious thing anyway Don t you mind what it is responded young Perkins Jest you keep everybody n everything from teching it Does this lot o stuff have to be shifted tween here and Greentown No not unless we git kind o dull and turn it upside down jest for fun I guess you re dull consid able often by the way things look when you git through carryin em on this line said Perkins who had no opinion of the freight department of the A B The answer though not proper to record in this place was worthy of Perkins s opponent who had a standing grudge against the entire race of expressmen and carters who brought him boxes and barrels to handle It always seemed to him that if they were all out of the country or dead he would have no work to do XI 
5636-41790-0000	train-other-500	THE SERVICE ON THE THRESHOLD From this point on the flitting went easily and smoothly enough and the transportation of the Carey family itself to Greentown on a mild budding day in April was nothing compared to the heavy labor that had preceded it
none	none	 All the goods and chattels had been despatched a week before so that they would be on the spot well in advance and the actual flitting took place on a Friday so that Gilbert would have every hour of his vacation to assist in the settling process 
5636-41790-0001	train-other-500	He had accepted an invitation to visit a school friend at Easter saying to his mother magisterially I didn t suppose you d want me round the house when you were getting things to rights men are always in the way so I told Fred Bascom I d go home with him
5636-41790-0002	train-other-500	Home with Fred Our only man Sole prop of the House of Carey exclaimed his mother with consummate tact Why Gilly dear I shall want your advice every hour
5636-41790-0003	train-other-500	And who will know about the planting for we are only women folks and who will do all the hammering and carpenter work
none	none	 You are so wonderful with tools that you ll be worth all the rest of us put together 
5636-41790-0004	train-other-500	Oh well if you need me so much as that I ll go along of course said Gilbert but Fred said his mother and sisters always did this kind of thing by themselves By themselves in Fred s family remarked missus Carey
5636-41790-0005	train-other-500	means a butler footman and plenty of money for help of every sort And though no wonder you re fond of Fred who is so jolly and such good company you must have noticed how selfish he is Now mother
none	none	 you ve never seen Fred Bascom more than half a dozen times 
5636-41790-0006	train-other-500	No and I don t remember at all what I saw in him the last five of them for I found out everything needful the first time he came to visit us returned missus Carey quietly Still he s a likable agreeable sort of boy
5636-41790-0007	train-other-500	And no doubt he ll succeed in destroying the pig in him before he grows up said Nancy passing through the room I thought it gobbled and snuffled a good deal when we last met Colonel Wheeler was at Greentown station when the family arrived
5636-41790-0008	train-other-500	and drove missus Carey and Peter to the Yellow House himself while the rest followed in the depot carryall
none	none	 with a trail of trunks and packages following on behind in an express wagon 
5636-41790-0009	train-other-500	It was a very early season the roads were free from mud
none	none	 the trees were budding and the young grass showed green on all the sunny slopes 
5636-41790-0010	train-other-500	When the Careys had first seen their future home they had entered the village from the west the Yellow House being the last one on the elm shaded street and quite on the outskirts of Beulah itself Now they crossed the river below the station and drove through East Beulah
5636-41790-0011	train-other-500	over a road unknown to any of them but Gilbert who was the hero and instructor of the party Soon the well remembered house came into view and as the two vehicles had kept one behind the other there was a general cheer
5636-41790-0012	train-other-500	It was more beautiful even than they had remembered it and more commodious and more delightfully situated The barn door was open showing crates of furniture
none	none	 and the piazza was piled high with boxes 
5636-41790-0013	train-other-500	Bill Harmon stood in the front doorway smiling
none	none	 He hoped for trade and he was a good sort anyway I d about given you up to night he called as he came to the gate Your train s half an hour late I got tired o waitin so I made free to open up some o your things for you to start housekeepin with I guess there won t be no supper here for you to night 
5636-41790-0014	train-other-500	We ve got it with us said Nancy joyously making acquaintance in an instant You are forehanded ain t you That s right jump
none	none	 you little pint o cider 
5636-41790-0015	train-other-500	Bill said holding out his arms to Peter Peter carrying many small things too valuable to trust to others jumped as suggested
none	none	 and gave his new friend an unexpected shower of bumps from hard substances concealed about his person 
5636-41790-0016	train-other-500	Land o Goshen you re loaded hain t you he inquired jocosely as he set Peter down on the ground The dazzling smile with which Peter greeted this supposed tribute converted Bill Harmon at once into a victim and slave
5636-41790-0017	train-other-500	Little did he know as he carelessly stood there at the wagon wheel that he was destined to bestow upon that small boy offerings from his stock for years to come He and Colonel Wheeler were speedily lifting things from the carryall
5636-41790-0018	train-other-500	while the Careys walked up the pathway together thrilling with the excitement of the moment Nancy breathed hard flushed and caught her mother s hand
none	none	 O Motherdy she said under her breath it s all happening just as we dreamed it and now that it s really here it s like it s like a dedication somehow Gilbert don t dear Let mother step over the sill first and call us into the Yellow House 
5636-41790-0019	train-other-500	I ll lock the door again and give the key to her
none	none	 Mother Carey her heart in her throat felt anew the solemn nature of the undertaking It broke over her in waves fresher stronger now that the actual moment had arrived than it ever had done in prospect 
5636-41790-0020	train-other-500	She took the last step upward and standing in the doorway trembling said softly as she turned the key Come home children Nancy Gilbert Kathleen Peter bird
none	none	 They flocked in all their laughter hushed by the new tone in her voice Nancy s and Kitty s arms encircled their mother s waist Gilbert with sudden instinct took off his hat and Peter looking at his elder brother wonderingly did the same 
5636-41790-0021	train-other-500	There was a moment of silence the kind of golden silence that is full to the brim of thoughts and prayers and memories and hopes and desires so full of all these and other beautiful quiet things that it makes speech seem poor and shabby
none	none	 then Mother Carey turned and the Yellow House was blessed Colonel Wheeler and Bill Harmon at the gate never even suspected that there had been a little service on the threshold when they came up the pathway to see if there was anything more needed I set up all the bedsteads and got the mattresses on em 
5636-41790-0022	train-other-500	said Bill Harmon thinkin the sandman would come early to night I never heard of anything so kind and neighborly cried missus Carey gratefully I thought we should have to go somewhere else to sleep Is it you who keeps the village store
none	none	 That s me 
5636-41790-0023	train-other-500	said Bill Well if you ll be good enough to come back once more to night with a little of everything we ll be very much obliged We have an oil stove tea and coffee tinned meats bread and fruit
5636-41790-0024	train-other-500	what we need most is butter eggs milk and flour Gilbert open the box of eatables please and Nancy unlock the trunk that has the bed linen in it We little thought we should find such friends here did we
5636-41790-0025	train-other-500	I got your extension table into the dining room said Bill and tried my best to find your dishes but I didn t make out up to the time you got here Mebbe you marked em someway so t you know which to unpack first
5636-41790-0026	train-other-500	I was only findin things that wan t no present use as I guess you ll say when you see em on the dining table They all followed him as he threw open the door
none	none	 Nancy well in the front 
5636-41790-0027	train-other-500	as I fear was generally the case There on the centre of the table stood You Dirty Boy rearing his crested head in triumph and round him like the gate posts of a mausoleum stood the four black and white marble funeral urns
5636-41790-0028	train-other-500	Perfect and entire without a flaw they stood there confronting Nancy It is like them to be the first to greet us exclaimed missus Carey with an attempt at a smile but there was not a sound from Kathleen or Nancy
5636-41790-0029	train-other-500	They stood rooted to the floor gazing at the Curse of the House of Carey as if their eyes must deceive them
none	none	 You look as though you didn t expect to see them girls 
5636-41790-0030	train-other-500	said their mother but when did they ever fail us
none	none	 Do you know I have a courage at this moment that I never felt before Beulah is so far from Buffalo that Cousin Ann cannot visit us often and never without warning I should not like to offend her or hurt her feelings but I think we ll keep You Dirty Boy and the mantel ornaments in the attic for the present or the barn chamber What do you say Colonel Wheeler and mister Harmon had departed 
5636-41790-0031	train-other-500	so a shout of agreement went up from the young Careys Nancy approached You Dirty Boy with a bloodthirsty glare in her eye Come along you evil uncanny thing she said Take hold of his other end Gilly and start for the barn
5636-41790-0032	train-other-500	that s farthest away but it s no use he s just like that bloodstain on Lady Macbeth s hand he will not out Kathleen open the linen trunk while we re gone We can t set the table till these curses are removed
5636-41790-0033	train-other-500	When you ve got the linen out take a marble urn in each hand and trail them along to where we are You can track us by a line of my tears
none	none	 They found the stairs to the barn chamber and lifted You Dirty Boy up step by step with slow painful effort 
5636-41790-0034	train-other-500	Kathleen ran out and put two vases on the lowest step and ran back to the house for the other pair Gilbert and Nancy stood at the top of the stairs with You Dirty Boy between them settling where he could be easiest reached if he had to be brought down for any occasion
5636-41790-0035	train-other-500	an unwelcome occasion that was certain to occur sometime in the coming years Suddenly they heard their names called in a tragic whisper Gilbert Nancy
none	none	 Quick Cousin Ann s at the front gate There was a crash 
5636-41790-0036	train-other-500	No human being however self contained could have withstood the shock of that surprise coming as it did so swiftly so unexpectedly and with such awful inappropriateness Gilbert and Nancy let go of You Dirty Boy simultaneously
5636-41790-0037	train-other-500	and he fell to the floor in two large fragments the break occurring so happily that the mother and the washcloth were on one half and the boy on the other a situation long desired by the boy to whom the parting was most welcome She got off at the wrong station
5636-41790-0038	train-other-500	panted Kathleen at the foot of the stairs and had to be driven five miles
none	none	 or she would have got here as she planned 
5636-41790-0039	train-other-500	an hour before we did She s come to help us settle
none	none	 and says she was afraid mother would overdo Did you drop anything Hurry down and I ll leave the vases here in among the furniture or shall I take back two of them to show that they were our first thought 
5636-41790-0040	train-other-500	And oh I forgot She s brought Julia Two more to feed and not enough beds Nancy and Gilbert confronted each other Hide the body in the corner Gilly said Nancy and say Gilly Yes what
5636-41790-0041	train-other-500	You see he s in two pieces Yes
none	none	 What do you say to making him four or more I say you go downstairs ahead of me and into the house and I follow you a moment later Close the barn door carefully behind you Am I understood You are Gilly understood and gloried in and reverenced My spirit will be with you when you do it Gilly dear though I myself will be greeting Cousin Ann and Julia XII 
5480-41791-0000	train-other-500	COUSIN ANN Mother Carey not wishing to make any larger number of persons uncomfortable than necessary had asked Julia not to come to them until after the house in Beulah had been put to rights but the Fergusons went abroad rather unexpectedly
5480-41791-0001	train-other-500	and mister Ferguson tore Julia from the arms of Gladys and put her on the train with very little formality Her meeting Cousin Ann on the way was merely one of those unpleasant coincidences with which life is filled although it is hardly possible usually
5480-41791-0002	train-other-500	for two such disagreeable persons to be on the same small spot at the same precise moment On the third morning after the Careys arrival however matters assumed a more hopeful attitude for Cousin Ann became discontented with Beulah
5480-41791-0003	train-other-500	The weather had turned cold and the fireplaces so long unused were uniformly smoky Cousin Ann s stomach always delicate turned from tinned meats eggs three times a day and soda biscuits made by Bill Harmon s wife
none	none	 likewise did it turn from nuts apples oranges and bananas 
5480-41791-0004	train-other-500	on which the children thrived so she went to the so called hotel for her meals Her remarks to the landlady after two dinners and one supper were of a character not to be endured by any outspoken
none	none	 free born New England woman I keep a hotel and I ll give you your meals for twenty five cents apiece so long as you eat what s set before you and hold your tongue 
5480-41791-0005	train-other-500	was the irate missus Buck s ultimatum I ll feed you she continued passionately because it s my business to put up and take in anything that s respectable but I won t take none o your sass Well Cousin Ann s temper was up too by this time
5480-41791-0006	train-other-500	and she declined on her part to take any of the landlady s sass so they parted rather to missus Carey s embarrassment as she did not wish to make enemies at the outset That night Cousin Ann
5480-41791-0007	train-other-500	still smarting under the memory of missus Buck s snapping eyes high color and unbridled tongue complained after supper that her bedstead rocked whenever she moved and asked Gilbert if he could readjust it in some way so that it should be as stationary as beds usually are in a normal state
5480-41791-0008	train-other-500	He took his tool basket and went upstairs obediently spending fifteen or twenty minutes with the much criticised article of furniture which he suspected of rocking merely because it couldn t bear Cousin Ann
5480-41791-0009	train-other-500	This idea so delighted Nancy that she was obliged to retire from Gilbert s proximity lest the family should observe her mirth and Gilbert s and impute undue importance to it I ve done everything to the bedstead I can think of Gilbert said on coming downstairs
5480-41791-0010	train-other-500	You can see how it works to night Cousin Ann As a matter of fact it did work instead of remaining in perfect quiet as a well bred bedstead should When the family was sound asleep at midnight a loud crash was heard and Cousin Ann
5480-41791-0011	train-other-500	throwing open the door of her room speedily informed everybody in the house that her bed had come down with her giving her nerves a shock from which they probably would never recover Gilbert is far too young for the responsibilities you put upon him Margaret Cousin Ann exclaimed
5480-41791-0012	train-other-500	drawing her wrapper more closely over her tall spare figure and if he was as old as Methuselah he would still be careless for he was born so All this talk about his being skilful with tools has only swollen his vanity A boy of his age should be able to make a bedstead stay together
5480-41791-0013	train-other-500	The whole family including the crestfallen Gilbert proposed various plans of relief all except Nancy who did not wish to meet Gilbert s glance for fear that she should have to suspect him of a new crime Having embarked on a career of villainy under her direct instigation
none	none	 he might go on of his own accord indefinitely 
5480-41791-0014	train-other-500	She did not believe him guilty but she preferred not to look into the matter more closely Mother Carey s eyes searched Gilbert s but found there no confirmation of her fears You needn t look at me like that mother said the boy
none	none	 I wouldn t be so mean as to rig up an accident for Cousin Ann 
5480-41791-0015	train-other-500	though I d like her to have a little one every night just for the fun of it Cousin Ann refused to let Gilbert try again on the bedstead and refused part of missus Carey s bed preferring to sleep on two hair mattresses laid on her bedroom floor They may not be comfortable
5480-41791-0016	train-other-500	she said tersely but at least they will not endanger my life The next morning s post brought business letters and Cousin Ann feared she would have to leave Beulah although there was work for a fortnight to come right there and Margaret had not strength enough to get through it alone
none	none	 She thought the chimneys were full of soot 
5480-41791-0017	train-other-500	and didn t believe the kitchen stove would ever draw she was sure that there were dead toads and frogs in the well the house was inconvenient and always would be till water was brought into the kitchen sink
none	none	 Julia seemed to have no leaning towards housework and had an appetite that she could only describe as a crime inasmuch as the wherewithal to satisfy it had to be purchased by others the climate was damp because of the river and there was no proper market within eight miles Kathleen was too delicate to live in such a place and the move from Charlestown was an utter and absolute and entire mistake from A to Z 
5480-41791-0018	train-other-500	Then she packed her small trunk and Gilbert ran to the village on glad and winged feet to get some one to take his depressing relative to the noon train to Boston As for Nancy she stood in front of the parlor fireplace
5480-41791-0019	train-other-500	and when she heard the hoot of the engine in the distance she removed the four mortuary vases from the mantelpiece and took them to the attic while Gilbert from the upper hall was chanting a favorite old rhyme She called us names till she was tired She called us names till we perspired
5480-41791-0020	train-other-500	She called us names we never could spell She called us names we never may tell She called us names that made us laugh She called us names for a day and a half She called us names till her memory failed But finally out of our sight she sailed
5480-41791-0021	train-other-500	It must have been written about Cousin Ann in the first place said Nancy joining Kathleen in the kitchen Well she s gone at last Now every prospect pleases And only Julia s vile she paraphrased from the old hymn into Kathleen s private ear
5480-41791-0022	train-other-500	You oughtn t to say such things Nancy rebuked Kathleen Mother wouldn t like it I know it confessed Nancy remorsefully I have been wicked since the moment I tried to get rid of You Dirty Boy I don t know what s the matter with me
5480-41791-0023	train-other-500	My blood seems to be too red and it courses wildly through my veins as the books say I am going to turn over a new leaf now that Cousin Ann s gone and our only cross is Julia Oh but it is rather dreadful to think how one person can spoil the world
5480-41791-0024	train-other-500	If only you could have seen the Yellow House after Cousin Ana went If only you could have heard the hotel landlady exclaim as she drove past Well Good riddance to bad rubbish The weather grew warmer outside almost at once
5480-41791-0025	train-other-500	and Bill Harmon s son planted the garden The fireplaces ceased to smoke and the kitchen stove drew Colonel Wheeler suggested a new chain pump instead of the old wooden one after which the water took a turn for the better and before the month was ended the Yellow House began to look like home
5480-41791-0026	train-other-500	notwithstanding Julia As for Beulah village after its sleep of months under deep snow drifts it had waked into the adorable beauty of an early New England summer It had no snow capped mountains in the distance
5480-41791-0027	train-other-500	no amethyst foothills to enchain the eye no wonderful canyons and splendid rocky passes to make the tourist marvel no length of yellow sea sands nor plash of ocean surf no trade no amusements no summer visitors
5480-41791-0028	train-other-500	it was just a quiet little sunny verdant leafy piece of heart s content that s what Beulah was and Julia couldn t spoil it indeed the odds were that it would sweeten Julia
none	none	 That was what Mother Carey hoped when her heart had an hour s leisure to drift beyond Shiny Wall into Peacepool and consider the needs of her five children It was generally at twilight when she was getting Peter to sleep that she was busiest making old beasts into new 
5480-41791-0029	train-other-500	People fancy that I make things my little dear says Mother Carey to Tom the Water Baby but I sit here and make them make themselves There was once a fairy so the tale goes who was so clever that she found out how to make butterflies
5480-41791-0030	train-other-500	and she was so proud that she flew straight off to Peacepool to boast to Mother Carey of her skill But Mother Carey laughed Know silly child she said that any one can make things if he will take time and trouble enough
5480-41791-0031	train-other-500	but it is not every one who can make things make themselves Make things make themselves Mother Carey used to think in the twilight I suppose that is what mothers are for Nancy was making herself busily these days
5480-41791-0032	train-other-500	and the offending Julia was directly responsible for such self control and gains in general virtue as poor impetuous Nancy achieved Kathleen was growing stronger and steadier and less self conscious Gilbert was doing better at school
5480-41791-0033	train-other-500	and his letters showed more consideration and thought for the family than they had done heretofore Even the Peter bird was a little sweeter and more self helpful just now thought Mother Carey fondly as she rocked him to sleep He was worn out with following Natty Harmon at the plough
5480-41791-0034	train-other-500	and succumbed quickly to the music of her good night song and the comfort of her sheltering arms Mother Carey had arms to carry arms to enfold arms to comfort and caress She also had a fine handsome strong hand admirable for spanking
none	none	 but she had so many invisible methods of discipline at her command that she never needed a visible spanker for Peter Spanking is all very well in its poor way she used to say but a woman who has to fall back on it very often is sadly lacking in ingenuity 
5480-41791-0035	train-other-500	As she lifted Peter into his crib Nancy came softly in at the door with a slip of paper in her hand She drew her mother out to the window over the front door Listen she said
none	none	 Do you hear the frogs I ve been listening to them for the last half hour 
5480-41791-0036	train-other-500	her mother said Isn t everything sweet to night with the soft air and the elms all feathered out and the new moon Was it ever so green before Nancy wondered leaning over the window sill by her mother s side
none	none	 Were the trees ever so lace y 
5480-41791-0037	train-other-500	Was any river ever so clear or any moon so yellow I am so sorry for the city people tonight Sometimes I think it can t be so beautiful here as it looks mother Sometimes I wonder if part of the beauty isn t inside of us said Nancy
5480-41791-0038	train-other-500	Part of all beauty is in the eyes that look at it her mother answered And I ve been reading missus Harmon s new reference Bible Nancy continued and here is what it says about Beulah She held the paper to the waning light and read
5480-41791-0039	train-other-500	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate but it shall be called Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee I think father would be comforted if he could see us all in the Yellow House at Beulah
5480-41791-0040	train-other-500	Nancy went on softly as the two leaned out of the window together He was so loving so careful of us so afraid that anything should trouble us that for months I couldn t think of him even in heaven as anything but worried
none	none	 But now it seems just as if we were over the hardest time and could learn to live here in Beulah and so he must be comforted if he can see us or think about us at all don t you feel like that mother Yes her mother agreed gently and her heart was grateful and full of hope She had lost the father of her children and the dear companion of her life and that loss could never be made good Still her mind acknowledged the riches she possessed in her children so she confessed herself neither desolate nor forsaken but something in a humble human way that the Lord could take delight in XIII THE PINK OF PERFECTION 
5636-41792-0000	train-other-500	That was the only trouble with Allan Carey s little daughter Julia aged thirteen she was and always had been the pink of perfection As a baby she had always been exemplary
5636-41792-0001	train-other-500	eating heartily and sleeping soundly When she felt a pin in her flannel petticoat she deemed it discourteous to cry because she knew that her nurse had at least tried to dress her properly
none	none	 When awake her mental machinery moved slowly and without any jerks As to her moral machinery the angels must have set it going at birth and planned it in such a way that it could neither stop 
5636-41792-0002	train-other-500	nor go wrong It was well meant of course but probably the angels who had the matter in charge were new young inexperienced angels with vague ideas of human nature and inexact knowledge of God s intentions
5636-41792-0003	train-other-500	because a child that has no capability of doing the wrong thing will hardly be able to manage a right one not one of the big sort anyway At four or five years old Julia was always spoken of as such a good little girl
none	none	 Many a time had Nancy in early youth stamped her foot and cried Don t talk about Julia I will not hear about Julia for she was always held up as a pattern of excellence Truth to tell she bored her own mother terribly but that is not strange for by a curious freak of nature 
5636-41792-0004	train-other-500	missus Allan Carey was as flighty and capricious and irresponsible and gay and naughty as Julia was steady limited narrow conventional and dull
5636-41792-0005	train-other-500	but the flighty mother passed out of the Carey family life and Julia from the age of five onward fell into the charge of a pious unimaginative governess instead of being turned out to pasture with a lot of frolicsome young human creatures
5636-41792-0006	train-other-500	so at thirteen she had apparently settled hard solid and firm into a mould She had smooth fair hair pale blue eyes thin lips and a somewhat too plump shape for her years
5636-41792-0007	train-other-500	She was always tidy and wore her clothes well laying enormous stress upon their material and style this trait in her character having been added under the fostering influence of the wealthy and fashionable
5636-41792-0008	train-other-500	Gladys Ferguson At thirteen when Julia joined the flock of Carey chickens she had the air of belonging to quite another order of beings They had been through a discipline seldom suffered by only children
5636-41792-0009	train-other-500	They had had to divide apples and toys
none	none	 take turns at reading books and learn generally to trot in double harness 
5636-41792-0010	train-other-500	If Nancy had a new dress at Christmas Kathleen had a new hat in the spring
none	none	 Gilbert heard the cry of Low bridge very often after Kathleen appeared on the scene 
5636-41792-0011	train-other-500	and Kathleen s ears too grew well accustomed to the same phrase after Peter was born Julia never did a naughty thing in her life nor spoke a wrong word said her father once proudly
none	none	 Never mind she s only ten and there s hope for her yet Captain Carey had replied cheerfully though if he had known her a little later in her first Beulah days he might not have been so sanguine 
5636-41792-0012	train-other-500	She seemed to have no instinct of adapting herself to the family life
none	none	 standing just a little aloof and in an attitude of silent criticism She was a trig smug prig Nancy said delighting in her accidental muster of three short hard descriptive words She hadn t a bit of humor no fun no gayety 
5636-41792-0013	train-other-500	no generous enthusiasms that carried her too far for safety or propriety She brought with her to Beulah sheaves of school certificates and when she showed them to Gilbert with their
none	none	 hundred per cent 
5636-41792-0014	train-other-500	deportment and ninety eight and seven eighths per cent scholarship every month for years he went out behind the barn and kicked its foundations savagely for several minutes She was a sort of continual Sunday child
5636-41792-0015	train-other-500	with an air of church and cold dinner and sermon reading and hymn singing and early bed Nobody could fear as for some impulsive reckless little creature that she would come to a bad end
5636-41792-0016	train-other-500	Nancy said no one could imagine her as coming to anything not even an end
none	none	 You never let mother hear you say these things Nancy 
5636-41792-0017	train-other-500	Kathleen remarked once but really and truly
none	none	 it s just as bad to say them at all when you know she wouldn t approve My present object is to be as good as gold in mother s eyes but there I stop retorted Nancy cheerfully Pretty soon I shall get virtuous enough to go a step further 
5636-41792-0018	train-other-500	and endeavor to please the angels not Julia s cast iron angels but the other angels who understand and are patient because they remember our frames and know that being dust we are likely to be dusty once in a while
5636-41792-0019	train-other-500	Julia wasn t made of dust She was made of let me see
none	none	 of skim milk and baked custard 
5636-41792-0020	train-other-500	the watery kind and rice flour and gelatine with a very little piece of overripe banana not enough to flavor just enough to sicken Stir this up with weak barley water
5636-41792-0021	train-other-500	without putting In a trace of salt sugar spice or pepper set it in a cool oven
none	none	 take it out before it is done 
5636-41792-0022	train-other-500	and you will get Julia Nancy was triumphant over this recipe for making Julias only regretting that she could never show it to her mother who if critical was always most appreciative
5636-41792-0023	train-other-500	She did send it in a letter to the Admiral off in China and he being none too good for human nature s daily food enjoyed it hugely and never scolded her at all Julia s only conversation at this time
none	none	 was on matters concerning Gladys Ferguson and the Ferguson family When you are washing dishes in the sink of the Yellow House in Beulah it is very irritating to hear of Gladys Ferguson s mother of pearl opera glasses her French maid 
5636-41792-0024	train-other-500	her breakfast on a tray in bed her diamond ring her photograph in the Sunday Times her travels abroad her proficiency in French and German Don t trot Gladys into the kitchen for goodness sake Julia
5636-41792-0025	train-other-500	grumbled Nancy on a warm day I don t want her diamond ring in my dishwater Wait till Sunday when we go to the hotel for dinner in our best clothes if you must talk about her
none	none	 You don t wipe the tumblers dry nor put them in the proper place when your mind is full of Gladys 
5636-41792-0026	train-other-500	All right said Julia gently Only I hope I shall always be able to wipe dishes and keep my mind on better things at the same time That s what Miss Tewksbury told me
none	none	 when she knew I had got to give up my home luxuries for a long time 
5636-41792-0027	train-other-500	Don t let poverty drag you down Julia she said keep your high thoughts and don t let them get soiled with the grime of daily living It is only just to say
5636-41792-0028	train-other-500	that Nancy was not absolutely destitute of self control and politeness because at this moment she had a really vicious desire to wash Julia s supercilious face and neat nose with the dishcloth fresh from the frying pan
none	none	 She knew that she could not grasp those irritating high thoughts and apply the grime of daily living to them concretely and actually 
5636-41792-0029	train-other-500	but Julia s face was within her reach and Nancy s fingers tingled with desire No trace of this savage impulse appeared in her behavior however she rinsed the dishpan turned it upside down in the sink and gave the wiping towels to Julia
none	none	 asking her to wring them out in hot water and hang them on the barberry bushes according to missus Carey s instructions It doesn t seem as if I could whimpered Julia I have always been so sensitive and dish towels 
5636-41792-0030	train-other-500	are so disgusting They do smell Nancy They do said Nancy sternly
none	none	 but they will smell worse if they are not washed I give you the dish wiping and take the washing just to save your hands but you must turn and turn about with Kathleen and me with some of the ugly hateful things If you were company of course we couldn t let you but you are a member of the family 
5636-41792-0031	train-other-500	Our principal concern must be to keep mother s high thoughts from grime
none	none	 ours must just take their chance 
5636-41792-0032	train-other-500	Oh how Julia disliked Nancy at this epoch in their common history and how cordially and vigorously the dislike was returned Many an unhappy moment did Mother Carey have over the feud mostly deep and silent
5636-41792-0033	train-other-500	that went on between these two and Gilbert s attitude was not much more hopeful He had found a timetable or syllabus for the day s doings over Julia s washstand It had been framed under Miss Tewksbury s guidance
5636-41792-0034	train-other-500	who knew Julia s unpunctuality and lack of system and read as follows Syllabus
none	none	 Rise at six point forty five 
5636-41792-0035	train-other-500	Bathe and dress Devotional Exercises
none	none	 seven point fifteen Breakfast seven point forty five Household tasks till nine Exercise out of doors 
5636-41792-0036	train-other-500	nine to ten Study ten to twelve Preparations for dinner twelve to one Recreation two to four Study four to five
5636-41792-0037	train-other-500	Preparation for supper five to six Wholesome reading walking or conversation seven to eight Devotional exercises nine Bed
none	none	 nine point thirty There was nothing wrong about this 
5636-41792-0038	train-other-500	indeed it was excellently conceived still it appeared to Gilbert as excessively funny and with Nancy s help he wrote another syllabus and tacked it over Julia s bureau Time Card
5636-41792-0039	train-other-500	On waking I can Pray for Gilly and Nan Eat breakfast at seven Or ten or eleven Nor think when it s noon That luncheon s too soon From twelve until one I can munch on a bun At one or at two
5636-41792-0040	train-other-500	My dinner ll be due At three say or four I ll eat a bit more When the clock s striking five Some mild exercise Very brief would be wise Lest I lack appetite For my supper at night
5636-41792-0041	train-other-500	Don t go to bed late Eat a light lunch at eight Nor forget to say prayers For my cousins downstairs Then with conscience like mine I ll be sleeping at nine missus Carey had a sense of humor
5636-41792-0042	train-other-500	and when the weeping Julia brought the two documents to her for consideration she had great difficulty in adjusting the matter gravely and with due sympathy for her niece
none	none	 The F f f fergusons never mentioned my appetite 
5636-41792-0043	train-other-500	Julia wailed They were always trying
none	none	 to g g get me to eat Gilbert and Nancy are a little too fond of fun and a little too prone to chaffing 
5636-41792-0044	train-other-500	said missus Carey They forget that you are not used to it but I will try to make them more considerate
none	none	 And don t forget my dear that in a large family like ours we must learn to live and let live XIV WAYS AND MEANS It was late June and Gilbert had returned from school so the work of making the Yellow House attractive and convenient was to move forward at once Up to now the unpacking and distribution of the furniture with the daily housework and cooking had been all that missus Carey and the girls could manage A village Jack of all trades mister Ossian Popham generally and familiarly called Osh Popham had been called in to whitewash existing closets and put hooks in them also with Bill Harmon s consent to make new ones here and there in handy corners Dozens of shelves in odd spaces helped much in the tidy stowing away of household articles bed clothing and stores In the midst of this delightful and cheery setting to rights a letter arrived from Cousin Ann The family was all sitting together in missus Carey s room the announced intention being to hold an important meeting of the Ways and Means Committee the Careys being strong on ways and uniformly short on means The arrival of the letters by the hand of Bill Harmon s boy occurred before the meeting was called to order May I read Cousin Ann s aloud asked Nancy who had her private reasons for making the offer Certainly said missus Carey unsuspectingly as she took up the inevitable stocking I almost wish you had all been storks instead of chickens then you would always have held up one foot and perhaps that stocking at least wouldn t have had holes in it Poor Muddy I m learning to darn cried Kathleen kissing her LONGHAMPTON NEW JERSEY June twenty seventh MY DEAR MARGARET so Nancy read The climate of this seaside place suits me so badly that I have concluded to spend the rest of the summer with you lightening those household tasks which will fall so heavily on your shoulders Groans from the whole family greeted this opening passage and Gilbert cast himself face down on his mother s lounge It is always foggy here when it does not rain and the cooking is very bad The manager of the hotel is uncivil and the office clerks very rude so that Beulah unfortunate place of residence as I consider it will be much preferable I hope you are getting on well with the work on the house although I regard your treating it as if it were your own as the height of extravagance You will never get back a penny you spend on it and probably when you get it in good order mister Hamilton will come back from Europe and live in it himself or take it away from you and sell it to some one else Gilbert will be home by now but I should not allow him to touch the woodwork as he is too careless and unreliable She ll never forget that the bed came down with her exclaimed Gilbert his voice muffled by the sofa cushions Remember me to Julia I hope she enjoys her food better than when I was with you Children must eat if they would grow Mother Carey pricked up her ears at this point and Gilbert raised himself on one elbow but Nancy went on gravely Tell Kathleen to keep out of the sun or wear a hat as her complexion is not at all what it used to be Without color and with freckles she will be an unusually plain child Kathleen flushed angrily and laid down her work Give my love to darling Nancy What a treasure you have in your eldest Margaret I hope you are properly grateful for her Such talent such beauty such grace such discretion But here the family rose en masse and descended on the reader of the spurious letter just as she had turned the first page In the amiable scuffle that ensued a blue slip fell from Cousin Ann s envelope and Gilbert handed it to his mother with the letter missus Carey wiping the tears of merriment that came to her eyes in spite of her so exactly had Nancy caught Cousin Ann s epistolary style read the real communication which ran as follows DEAR MARGARET I have had you much in mind since I left you always with great anxiety lest your strength should fail under the unexpected strain you put upon it I had intended to give each of you a check for thirty five dollars at Christmas to spend as you liked but I must say I have not entire confidence in your judgment You will be likelier far to decorate the walls of the house than to bring water into the kitchen sink I therefore enclose you three hundred dollars and beg that you will have the well piped at once and if there is any way to carry the water to the bedroom floor do it and let me send the extra amount involved You will naturally have the well cleaned out anyway but I should prefer never to know what you found in it My only other large gift to you in the past was one of ornaments sent you remember at the time of your wedding We remember groaned the children in chorus I do not regret this though my view of life of its sorrows and perplexities has changed somewhat and I am more practical than I used to be The general opinion is that in giving for a present an object of permanent beauty your friends think of you whenever they look upon it That s so remarked Gilbert to Nancy This is true no doubt but there are other ways of making yourself remembered and I am willing that you should think kindly of Cousin Ann whenever you use the new pump The second improvement I wish made with the money is the instalment of a large furnace like stove in the cellar which will send up a little heat at least into the hall and lower rooms in winter You will probably have to get the owner s consent and I should certainly ask for a five years lease before expending any considerable amount of money on the premises If there is any money left I should suggest new sills to the back doors and those in the shed I noticed that the present ones are very rotten and I dare say by this time you have processions of red and black ants coming into your house It seemed to me that I never saw so much insect life as in Beulah Moths caterpillars brown tails slugs spiders June bugs horseflies and mosquitoes were among the pests I specially noted The mister Popham who drove me to the station said that snakes also abounded in the tall grass but I should not lay any stress on his remarks as I never saw such manners in my life in any Christian civilized community He asked me my age and when I naturally made no reply he inquired after a few minutes silence whether I was unmarried from choice or necessity When I refused to carry on any conversation with him he sang jovial songs so audibly that persons going along the street smiled and waved their hands to him I tell you this because you appear to have false ideas of the people in Beulah most of whom seemed to me either eccentric or absolutely insane Hoping that you can endure your life there when the water smells better and you do not have to carry it from the well I am Yours affectionately ANN CHADWICH Children said missus Carey folding the letter and slipping the check into the envelope for safety your Cousin Ann is really a very good woman I wish her bed hadn t come down with her said Gilbert We could never have afforded to get that water into the house or had the little furnace and I suppose though no one of us ever thought of it that you would have had a hard time doing the work in the winter in a cold house and it would have been dreadful going to the pump Dreadful for you too Gilly replied Kathleen pointedly I shall be at school where I can t help said Gilbert missus Carey made no remark as she intended the fact that there was no money for Gilbert s tuition at Eastover to sink gradually into his mind so that he might make the painful discovery himself His fees had fortunately been paid in advance up to the end of the summer term so the strain on their resources had not been felt up to now Nancy had disappeared from the room and now stood in the doorway I wish to remark that having said a good many disagreeable things about Cousin Ann and regretting them very much I have placed the four black and white marble ornaments on my bedroom mantelpiece there to be a perpetual reminder of my sins You Dirty Boy is in a hundred pieces in the barn chamber but if Cousin Ann ever comes to visit us again I ll be the one to confess that Gilly and I were the cause of the accident Now take your pencil Nancy and see where we are in point of income at the present moment her mother suggested with an approving smile Put down the pension of thirty dollars a month Down Three hundred and sixty dollars Now the hundred dollars over and above the rent of the Charlestown house Down but it lasts only four years We may all be dead by that time This cheerfully from Gilbert Then the interest on our insurance money Four per cent on five thousand dollars is two hundred I have multiplied it twenty times Down Two hundred Of course if anything serious happens or any great need comes we have the five thousand to draw upon interpolated Gilbert I will draw upon that to save one of us in illness or to bury one of us said missus Carey with determination but I will never live out of it myself nor permit you to We are five six while Julia is with us she added hastily and six persons will surely have rainy days coming to them What if I should die and leave you Don t mother they cried in chorus so passionately that missus Carey changed the subject quickly How much a year does it make Nancy Three hundred and sixty plus one hundred plus two hundred equals six hundred and sixty read Nancy And I call it a splendid big lump of money Oh my dear sighed her mother with a shake of the head if you knew the difficulty your father and I have had to take care of ourselves and of you on five and six times that sum We may have been a little extravagant sometimes following him about he was always so anxious to have us with him but that has been our only luxury We saved enough out of exchanging the grand piano to pay all the expenses down here and all our railway fares and everything so far in the way of boards and nails and Osh Popham s labor recalled Gilbert Yes and we are still eating the grand piano at the end of two months but it s about gone isn t it Muddy Nancy asked About gone but it has been a great help and our dear little old fashioned square is just as much of a comfort Of course there s the tapestry and the Van Twiller landscape Uncle gave me they may yet be sold Somebody ll buy the tapestry but the Van Twiller ll go hard and Gilbert winked at Nancy A picture that looks just the same upside down as the right way about won t find many buyers was Nancy s idea Still it is a Van Twiller and has a certain authentic value for all time The landscapes Van Twiller painted in the dark or when he had his blinders on can t be worth very much insisted Gilbert You remember the Admiral thought it was partridges nesting in the underbrush at twilight and then we found Joanna had cleaned the dining room and hung the thing upside down When it was hung the other end up neither father nor the Admiral could tell what it was they d lost the partridges and couldn t find anything else We shall get something for it because it is a Van Twiller said missus Carey hopefully and the tapestry is lovely Now we have been doing all our own work to save money enough to make the house beautiful yet as Cousin Ann says it does not belong to us and may be taken away at any moment after the year is up We have never even seen our landlord though mister Harmon has written to him Are we foolish What do you think Julia XV BELONGING TO BEULAH The Person without a Fault had been quietly working at her embroidery raising her head now and then to look at some extraordinary Carey when he or she made some unusually silly or fantastic remark I m not so old as Gilbert and Nancy and I m only a niece she said modestly so I ought not to have an opinion But I should get a maid of all work at once so that we shouldn t all be drudges as we are now then I should not spend a single cent on the house but just live here in hiding as it were till better times come and till we are old enough to go into society You could scrimp and save for Nancy s coming out and then for Kathleen s Father would certainly be well long before then and Kathleen and I could debut together Who wants to debut together or any other way sniffed Nancy scornfully I m coming out right here in Beulah indeed I m not sure but I m out already mister Bill Harmon has asked me to come to the church sociable and mister Popham has invited me to the Red Men s picnic at Greentown Beulah s good for something better than a place to hide in We ll have to save every penny at first of course but in three or four years Gilly and I ought to be earning something The trouble is I can t earn anything in college objected Gilbert though I d like to That will be the only way a college course can come to you now Gilbert his mother said quietly You know nothing of the expenses involved They would have taxed our resources to the utmost if father had lived and we had had our more than five thousand a year You and I together must think out your problem this summer Gilbert looked blank and walked to the window with his hands in his pockets I should lose all my friends and it s hard for a fellow to make his way in the world if he has nothing to recommend him but his graduation from some God forsaken little hole like Beulah Academy Nancy looked as if she could scalp her brother when he alluded to her beloved village in these terms but her mother s warning look stopped any comment Julia took up arms for her cousin We ought to go without everything for the sake of sending Gilbert to college she said Gladys Ferguson doesn t know a single boy who isn t going to Harvard or Yale If a boy of good family and good breeding cannot make friends by his own personality and his own qualities of mind and character I should think he would better go without them said Gilbert s mother casually Don t you believe in a college education mother inquired Gilbert in an astonished tone Certainly Why else should we have made sacrifices to send you To begin with it is much simpler and easier to be educated in college You have a thousand helps and encouragements that other fellows have to get as they may The paths are all made straight for the students A stupid boy or one with small industry or little originality must have something drummed into him in four years with all the splendid teaching energy that the colleges employ It requires a very high grade of mental and moral power to do without such helps and it may be that you are not strong enough to succeed without them I do not know your possibilities yet Gilbert and neither do you know them yourself Gilbert looked rather nonplussed Pretty stiff I call it he grumbled to say that if you ve got brains enough you can do without college It is true nevertheless If you have brains enough and will enough and heart enough you can stay here in Beulah and make the universe search you out and drag you into the open where men have need of you missus Carey s eyes shone and her cheeks glowed What we all want as a family is to keep well and strong and good in body and mind and soul to conquer our weaknesses to train our gifts to harness our powers to some wished for end and then pull with all our might Can t my girls be fine women fit for New York or Washington London or Paris because their young days were passed in Beulah Can t my boys be anything that their brains and courage fit them for whether they make their own associations or have them made for them Father would never have flung the burden on your shoulders Gilbert but he is no longer here You can t have the help of Yale or Harvard or Bowdoin to make a man of you my son you will have to fight your own battles and win your own spurs Oh mother but you re splendid cried Nancy the quick tears in her eyes Brace up old Gilly and show what the Careys can do without advantages Brace up Kitty and Julia We three will make Beulah Academy ring next year And I don t want you to look upon Beulah as a place of hiding while adversity lasts said Mother Carey We must make it home as beautiful and complete as we can afford One real home always makes others I am sure of that We will ask mister Harmon to write mister Hamilton and see if he will promise to leave us undisturbed We cannot be happy or prosperous or useful or successful unless we can contrive to make the Yellow House a home The river is our river the village is our village the people are our neighbors Beulah belongs to us and we belong to Beulah don t we Peter Mother Carey always turned to Peter with some nonsensical appeal when her heart was full and her voice a trifle unsteady You could bury your head in Peter s little white sailor jacket just under his chin at which he would dimple and gurgle and chuckle and wriggle and when you withdrew your flushed face and presented it to the public gaze all the tears would have been wiped off on Peter So on this occasion did missus Carey repeat as she set Peter down Don t we belong to Beulah dear Yes we does he lisped and I m going to work myself pretty soon bimebye just after a while when I m a little more grown up and then I ll buy the Yellow House quick So you shall precious cried Kathleen I was measured on Muddy this morning wasn t I Muddy and I was half way to her belt and in Charlestown I was only a little farder up than her knees All the time I m growing up she s ungrowing down She s smallering and I m biggering Are you afraid your mother ll be too small sweet Pete asked missus Carey No this very stoutly Danny Harmon s mother s more n up to the mantelpiece and I d hate to have my mother so far away said Peter as he embraced missus Carey s knees Julia had said little during this long conversation though her mind was fairly bristling with objections and negatives and different points of view but she was always more or less awed by her Aunt Margaret and never dared defy her opinion She had a real admiration for her aunt s beauty and dignity and radiant presence though it is to be feared she cared less for the qualities of character that made her personality so luminous with charm for everybody She saw people look at her listen to her follow her with their eyes comment on her appearance her elegance and her distinction and all this impressed her deeply As to Cousin Ann s present her most prominent feeling was that it would have been much better if that lady had followed her original plan of sending individual thirty five dollar checks In that event she Julia was quite certain that hers never would have gone into a water pipe or a door sill Oh Kathleen sighed Nancy as the two went into the kitchen together Isn t mother the most interesting scolder you ever listened to I love to hear her do it especially when somebody else is getting it When it s I I grow smaller and smaller curling myself up like a little worm Then when she has finished I squirm to the door and wriggle out Other mothers say If you don t I shall tell your father Do as I tell you and ask no questions I never heard of such behavior in my life Haven t you any sense of propriety If this happens again I shall have to do something desperate Leave the room at once and so on but mother sets you to thinking Mother doesn t really scold Kathleen objected No but she shows you how wrong you are just the same Did you notice how Julia withered when mother said we were not to look upon Beulah as a place of hiding She didn t stay withered long Kathleen remarked And she said just the right thing to dear old Gilly for Fred Bascom is filling his head with foolish notions He needs father to set him right We all need father sighed Kitty tearfully but somehow mother grows a little more splendid every day I believe she s trying to fill father s place and be herself too XVI THE POST BAG Letter from mister William Harmon

none	none	 June twenty seventh DEAR mister HAMILTON 
5636-41795-0007	train-other-500	I am Nancy the oldest of the Carey children who live in your house When father was alive he took us on a driving trip
none	none	 and we stopped and had luncheon under your big maple and fell in love with your empty house 
5636-41795-0008	train-other-500	Father he was a Captain in the Navy and there was never anybody like him in the world Father leaned over the gate and said if he was only rich he would drive the horse into the barn and buy the place that very day
5636-41795-0009	train-other-500	and mother said it would be a beautiful spot to bring up a family We children had wriggled under the fence and were climbing the apple trees by that time and we wanted to be brought up there that very minute
5636-41795-0010	train-other-500	We all of us look back to that day as the happiest one that we can remember Mother laughs when I talk of looking back
none	none	 because I am not sixteen yet but I think although we did not know it God knew that father was going to die and we were going to live in that very spot afterwards Father asked us what we could do for the place that had been so hospitable to us 
5636-41795-0011	train-other-500	and I remembered a box of plants in the carryall that we had bought at a wayside nursery for the flower beds in Charlestown Plant something I said and father thought it was a good idea and took a little crimson rambler rose bush from the box Each of us helped make the place for it
5636-41795-0012	train-other-500	by taking a turn with the luncheon knives and spoons then I planted the rose and father took off his hat and said Three cheers for the Yellow House and mother added God bless it and the children who come to live in it
5636-41795-0013	train-other-500	There is surely something strange in that don t you think so Then when father died last year we had to find a cheap and quiet place to live and I remembered the Yellow House in Beulah and told mother my idea
none	none	 She does not say Bosh like some mothers but if our ideas sound like anything she tries them so she sent Gilbert to see if the house was still vacant and when we found it was we took it The rent is sixty dollars a year 
5636-41795-0014	train-other-500	as I suppose Bill Harmon told you when he sent you mother s check for fifteen dollars for the first quarter We think it is very reasonable and do not wonder you don t like to spend anything on repairs or improvements for us as you have to pay taxes and insurance
5636-41795-0015	train-other-500	We hope you will have a good deal over for your own use out of our rent as we shouldn t like to feel under obligation If we had a million we d spend it all on the Yellow House
none	none	 because we are fond of it in the way you are fond of a person 
5636-41795-0016	train-other-500	it s not only that we want to paint it and paper it but we would like to pat it and squeeze it If you can t live in it yourself even in the summer
none	none	 perhaps you will be glad to know we love it so much 
5636-41795-0017	train-other-500	and want to take good care of it always What troubles us is the fear that you will take it away
none	none	 or sell it to somebody before Gilbert and I are grown up and have earned money enough to buy it It was Cousin Ann that put the idea into our heads but everybody says it is quite likely and sensible Cousin Ann has made us a splendid present of enough money to bring the water from the well into the kitchen sink and to put a large stove like a furnace into the cellar We would cut two registers behind the doors in the dining room and sitting room floors and two little round holes in the ceilings to let the heat up into two bedrooms if you are willing to let us do it Mother says that Cousin Ann is a good and generous person It is true and it makes us very unhappy that we cannot really love her on account of her being so fault finding but you being an American Consul and 
5636-41795-0018	train-other-500	travelling all over the world must have seen somebody like her mister Harmon is writing to you but I thought he wouldn t know so much about us as I do We have father s pension that is three hundred and sixty dollars a year
none	none	 and one hundred dollars a year from the Charlestown house 
5636-41795-0019	train-other-500	but that only lasts for four years
none	none	 and two hundred dollars a year 
5636-41795-0020	train-other-500	from the interest on father s insurance That makes six hundred and sixty dollars which is a great deal if you haven t been used to three thousand
none	none	 but does not seem to be enough for a family of six There is the insurance money itself too but mother says nothing but a very dreadful need must make us touch that You see there are four of us children which with mother makes five and now there is Julia which makes six 
5636-41795-0021	train-other-500	She is Uncle Allan s only child Uncle Allan has nervous prostration and all of mother s money We are not poor at all just now
none	none	 on account of having exchanged the grand piano 
5636-41795-0022	train-other-500	for an old fashioned square and eating up the extra money It is great fun and whenever we have anything very good for supper Kathleen says Here goes a piano leg and Gilbert says Let s have an octave of white notes for Sunday supper mother
5636-41795-0023	train-other-500	I send you a little photograph of the family taken together on your side piazza we call it our piazza and I hope you don t mind I am the tallest girl with the curly hair
none	none	 Julia is sitting down in front hemming 
5636-41795-0024	train-other-500	She said we should look so idle if somebody didn t do something but she never really hems and Kathleen is leaning over mother s shoulder We all wanted to lean over mother s shoulder but Kitty got there first The big boy is Gilbert
5636-41795-0025	train-other-500	He can t go to college now as father intended and he is very sad and depressed but mother says he has a splendid chance to show what father s son can do without any help but his own industry and pluck Please look carefully at the lady sitting in the chair
5636-41795-0026	train-other-500	for it is our mother It is only a snap shot
none	none	 but you can see how beautiful she is 
5636-41795-0027	train-other-500	Her hair is very long and the wave in it is natural The little boy is Peter
none	none	 He is the loveliest and the dearest of all of us The second picture 
5636-41795-0028	train-other-500	is of me tying up the crimson rambler I thought you would like to see what a wonderful rose it is
none	none	 I was standing in a chair training the long branches and tacking them against the house 
5636-41795-0029	train-other-500	when a gentleman drove by with a camera in his wagon He stopped and took the picture and sent us one explaining that every one admired it I happened to be wearing my yellow muslin and I am sending you the one the gentleman colored
none	none	 because it is the beautiful crimson of the rose against the yellow house that makes people admire it so 
5636-41795-0030	train-other-500	If you come to America please don t forget Beulah because if you once saw mother you could never bear to disturb her seeing how brave she is living without father Admiral Southwick who is in China calls us Mother Carey s chickens
5636-41795-0031	train-other-500	They are stormy petrels and are supposed to go out over the seas and show good birds the way home We haven t done anything splendid yet but we mean to when the chance comes I haven t told anybody that I am writing this
none	none	 but I wanted you to know everything about us as you are our landlord We could be so happy if Cousin Ann wouldn t always say we are spending money on another person s house and such a silly performance never came to any good 
5636-41795-0032	train-other-500	I enclose you a little picture cut from the wall paper we want to put on the front hall hoping you will like it The old paper is hanging in shreds and some of the plaster is loose but mister Popham will make it all right
5636-41795-0033	train-other-500	Mother says she feels as if he had pasted laughter and good nature on all the walls as he papered them When you open the front door and we hope you will sometime and walk right in how lovely it will be to look into yellow hayfields
none	none	 And isn t the boatful of people coming to the haymaking nice 
5636-41795-0034	train-other-500	with the bright shirts of the men and the women s scarlet aprons Don t you love the white horse in the haycart and the jolly party picnicking under the tree Mother says just think of buying so much joy and color for twenty cents a double roll
none	none	 and we children think we shall never get tired of sitting on the stairs in cold weather and making believe it is haying time Gilbert says we are putting another grand piano leg on the walls but we are not for we are doing all our own cooking and dishwashing and saving the money that a cook would cost to do lovely things for the Yellow House Thank you dearest mister Hamilton for letting us live in it We are very proud of the circular steps 
5636-41795-0035	train-other-500	and very proud of your being an American consul Yours affectionately NANCY CAREY P S It is June and Beulah is so beautiful you feel like eating it with sugar and cream
5636-41795-0036	train-other-500	We do hope that you and your children are living in as sweet a place so that you will not miss this one so much We know you have five older than we are but if there are any the right size for me to send my love to please do it
5636-41795-0037	train-other-500	Mother would wish to be remembered to missus Hamilton but she will never know I am writing to you
none	none	 It is my first business letter N C XVII JACK OF ALL TRADES mister Ossian otherwise Osh Popham was covering the hall of the Yellow House with the hayfield paper Bill Harmon s father had left considerable stock of one sort and another in the great unfinished attic over the store and though much of it was worthless and all of it was out of date it seemed probable that it would eventually be sold to the Careys who had the most unlimited ingenuity in making bricks without straw when it came to house decoration They had always moved from post to pillar and Dan to Beersheba and had always inside of a week had the prettiest and most delightful habitation in the naval colony where they found themselves Beulah itself as well as all the surrounding country had looked upon the golden hayfield paper and scorned it as ugly and countrified never suspecting that in its day it had been made in France and cost a dollar and a half a roll It had been imported for a governor s house and only half of it used so for thirty years the other half had waited for the Careys There always are Careys and their like and plenty of them in every generation so old things if they are good need never be discouraged mister Popham never worked at his bricklaying or carpentering or cabinet making or papering by the hour but by the job and a kind Providence intent on the welfare of the community must have guided him in this choice of business methods for he talked so much more than he worked that unless householders were well to do the rights of employer and employee could never have been adjusted If they were rich no one of them would have stopped Ossian s conversation for a second In the first place it was even better than his work which was always good and in the second place he would never consent to go to any one unless he could talk as much as he liked The Careys loved him all but Julia who pronounced him common and said Miss Tewksbury told her never to listen to anyone who said I done it or I seen it To this Nancy replied her mother being in the garden and she herself not yet started on a line of conduct arranged to please the angels that Miss Tewksbury and Julia ought to have a little corner of heaven finished off for themselves and Julia made a rude distinct hideous face at Nancy I have always dated the beginning of Julia s final transformation from this critical moment when the old Adam in her began to work It was good for Nancy too who would have trodden on Julia so long as she was an irritating but patient well behaved worm but who would have to use a little care if the worm showed signs of turning Your tongue is like a bread knife Nancy Carey Julia exclaimed passionately after twisting her nose and mouth into terrifying and dreadful shapes If it wasn t that Miss Tewksbury told me ladies never were telltales I could soon make trouble between you and your blessed mother No you couldn t said Nancy curtly for I d reform sooner than let you do that Perhaps I did say too much Julia only I can t bear to have you make game of mister Popham when he s so funny and nice Think of his living with nagging missus Popham and his stupid daughter and son in that tiny house and being happy as a king If there wasn t something wrong with him he wouldn t be happy there insisted Julia mister Popham himself accounted for his contentment without insulting his intelligence The way I look at it he said this world s all the world we ll git till we git to the next one an we might s well smile on it s frown You git your piece o life an you make what you can of it that s the idee Now the other day I got some nice soft wood that was prime for whittlin jest the right color an grain an all an I started in to make a little statue o the Duke o Wellington Well when I got to shapin him out I found my piece o wood wouldn t be long enough to give him his height so I says Well I don t care I ll cut the Duke right down and make Napoleon Bonaparte I d a been all right if I d cal lated better but I cut my block off too short and I couldn t make Napoleon nohow so I says Well Isaac Watts was an awful short man so I guess I ll make him But this time my wood split right in two Some men would a been discouraged but I wasn t not a mite I jest said I never did fancy Ike Watts an there s one thing this blamed chip will make an that s a button for the barn door Osh not only whittled and papered and painted but did anything whatsoever that needed to be done on the premises If the pump refused to draw water or the sink drain was stopped or the gutters needed cleaning or the grass had to be mowed he was the man ordained by Providence and his own versatility to do the work While he was papering the front hall the entire Carey family lived on the stairs between meals fearful lest they should lose any incident any anecdote any story any reminiscence that might fall from his lips missus Carey took her mending basket and sat in the doorway within ear shot while Peter had all the scraps of paper and a small pasting board on the steps where he conducted his private enterprises Osh would cut his length of paper lay it flat on the board and apply the wide brush up and down neatly while he began his story Sometimes if the tale were long and interesting the paste would dry but in that case he went over the surface again At the precise moment of hanging the flow of his eloquence stopped abruptly and his hearers had to wait until the piece was finished before they learned what finally became of Lyddy Brown after she drove her husband ou doors or of Bill Harmon s bull terrier who set an entire community quarreling among themselves His racy accounts of missus Popham s pessimism which had grown prodigiously from living in the house with his optimism his anecdotes of Lallie Joy Popham who was given to moods having inherited portions of her father s incurable hopefulness and fragments of her mother s ineradicable gloom these were of a character that made the finishing of the hall a matter of profound unimportance I ain t one to hurry he would say genially that s the reason I won t work by the hour or by the day We ve got one hurrier in the family and that s enough for Lallie Joy n me Mis Popham does everything right on the dot an Lallie Joy n me git turrible sick o seein that dot n hevin our tention drawed to it if we don t see it Mis Bill Harmon s another hurrier well you jest ask Bill that s all She an Mis Popham hev been at it for fifteen years but the village ain t ready to give out the blue ribbon yet Last week my wife went over to Harmon s and Mis Harmon said she was goin to make some molasses candy that mornin Well my wife hurried home put on her molasses made her candy cooled it and worked it and took some over to treat Mis Harmon who was jest gittin her kittle out from under the sink The Careys laughed heartily at this evidence of missus Popham s celerity while Osh as pleased as possible gave one dab with his paste brush and went on Maria s blood was up one while cause Mis Bill Harmon always contrives to git her wash out the earliest of a Monday morning Yesterday Maria got up bout daybreak I allers tell her if she was real forehanded she d eat her breakfast overnight and by half past five she hed her clothes in the boiler Jest as she was lookin out the kitchen winder for signs o Mis Bill Harmon she seen her start for her side door with a big basket Maria was so mad then that she vowed she wouldn t be beat so she dug for the bedroom and slat some clean sheets and piller cases out of a bureau drawer run into the yard and I m blamed if she didn t get em over the line afore Mis Harmon found her clothespins Good old Osh He hadn t had such an audience for years for Beulah knew all its own stories thoroughly and although it valued them highly it did not care to hear them too often but the Careys were absolutely fresh material and such good appreciative listeners missus Carey looked so handsome when she wiped the tears of enjoyment from her eyes that Osh told Bill Harmon if t wa n t agin the law you would want to kiss her every time she laughed Well the hall papering was luckily to be paid for not by the hour but by an incredibly small price per roll and everybody was pleased Nancy Kathleen and Julia sat on the stairs preparing a whiteweed and buttercup border for the spare bedroom according to a plan of Mother Carey s It was an affair of time as it involved the delicate cutting out of daisy garlands from a wider bordering filled with flowers of other colors and proved a fascinating occupation Gilbert hovered on the outskirts of the hall doing odd jobs of one sort and another and learning bits of every trade at which mister Popham was expert If we hadn t been in such a sweat to git settled remarked Osh with a clip of his big shears I really d ought to have plastered this front entry all over T wa n t callin for paper half s loud as t was for plaster Old Parson Bradley hed been a farmer afore he turned minister and one Sunday mornin his parish was thornin him to pray for rain so he says Thou knowest O Lord it s manure this land wants n not water but in Thy mercy send rain plenteously upon us mister Popham said Gilbert who had been patiently awaiting his opportunity the pieces of paper are cut for those narrow places each side of the front door Can t I paste those on while you talk to us Course you can handy as you be with tools There ain t no trick to it Most anybody can be a paperer As Parson Bradley said when he was talkin to a Sunday school during a presidential campaign One of you boys perhaps can be a George Washington and another may rise to be a Thomas Jefferson any of you the Lord knows can be a James K Polk I don t know much about Polk said Gilbert P raps nobody did very much but the parson hated him like p ison See here Peter I ain t made o paste You ve used up bout a quart a ready What are you doin out there anyway I ve heerd o paintin the town I guess you re paperin it ain t you Peter was too busy and too eager for paste to reply the facts of the case being that while mister Popham held the family spellbound by his conversation he himself was papering the outside of the house with scraps of assorted paper as high up as his short arms could reach There s another thing you can do Gilbert continued mister Popham I ve mixed a pail o that green paint same as your mother wanted an I ve brought you a tip top brush The settin room has a good nice floor matched boards no hummocks nor hollers all as flat s one of my wife s pancakes an not a knot hole in it anywheres You jest put your first coat on brushin lengthways o the boards and let it dry good Don t let your folks go stepping on it neither The minute a floor s painted women folks are crazy to git int the room They want their black alpacky that s in the closet an the lookin glass that s on the mantelpiece or the feather duster that s hangin on the winder an will you jest pass out the broom that s behind the door The next mornin you ll find lots o little spots where they ve tiptoed in to see if the paint s dry an how it s goin to look Where I work they most allers say it s the cat well that answer may deceive some folks but t wouldn t me Don t slop your paint Gilbert work quick an neat an even then paintin ain t no trick t all Any fool the Lord knows can pick up that trade Now I guess it s about noon time an I ll have to be diggin for home Maria sets down an looks at the clock from half past eleven on She ll git a meal o cold pork n greens cold string beans gingerbread n custard pie on t the table then she ll stan in the front door an holler Hurry up Ossian it s struck twelve more n two minutes ago n everything s gittin overdone So saying he took off his overalls seized his hat and with a parting salute was off down the road singing his favorite song I can give you the words and the time but alas I cannot print Osh Popham s dauntless spirit and serene content nor his cheery voice as he travelled with tolerable swiftness to meet his waiting Maria Here comes a maid en full of woe Hi dum di dum did dy i o Here comes a maid en full of woe Hi der ry O Here comes a maid en full of woe As full of woe as she can go Hi dum did dy i O Hi der ry O XVIII THE HOUSE OF LORDS The Carey children had only found it by accident All their errands took them down the main street to the village to the Popham s cottage at the foot of a little lane turning towards the river or on to the post office and Bill Harmon s store or to Colonel Wheeler s house and then to the railway station One afternoon Nancy and Kathleen had walked up the road in search of pastures new and had spied down in a distant hollow a gloomy grey house almost surrounded by cedars A grove of poplars to the left of it only made the prospect more depressing and if it had not been for a great sheet of water near by floating with cow lilies and pond lilies the whole aspect of the place would have been unspeakably dreary Nancy asked mister Popham who lived in the grey house behind the cedars and when he told them a certain mister Henry Lord his two children and housekeeper they fell into the habit of speaking of the place as the House of Lords You won t never see nothin of em said mister Popham Henry Lord ain t never darkened the village for years I guess and the young ones ain t never been to school so far they have a teacher out from Portland Tuesdays and Fridays and the rest o the week they study up for him Henry s bout as much of a hermit s if he lived in a hut on a mounting an he s bringing up the children so they ll be jest as odd s he is Is the mother dead missus Carey asked Yes dead these four years an a good job for her too It s an awful queer world Not that I could make a better one I allers say when folks grumble Now if you was given the materials could you turn out a better world than this is And when it come to that what if you hed to furnish your own materials same as the Lord did I guess you d be put to it Well as I say it s an awful queer world they clap all the burglars into jail and the murderers and the wife beaters I ve allers thought a gentle reproof would be enough punishment for a wife beater cause he probably has a lot o provocation that nobody knows and the firebugs can t think o the right name something like cendenaries an the breakers o the peace an what not an yet the law has nothin to say to a man like Hen Lord He s been a college professor but I went to school with him darn his picter an I ll call him Hen whenever I git a chance though he does declare he s a doctor Doctor of what asked missus Carey Blamed if I know I wouldn t trust him to doctor a sick cat People don t have to be doctors of medicine interrupted Gilbert Grandfather was Alexander Carey LL D Doctor of Laws that is mister Popham laid down his brush I swan to man he ejaculated If you don t work hard you can t keep up with the times Doctor of Laws Well all I can say is they need doctorin an I m glad they ve got round to em only Hen Lord ain t the man to do em any good What has he done to make him so unpopular queried missus Carey Done He ain t done a thing he d oughter sence he was born He keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate Hen Lord does He neglected his wife and froze her blood and frightened her to death poor little shadder He give up his position and shut the family up in that tomb of a house so t he could study his books My boy knows his boy an I tell you the life he leads them children is enough to make your flesh creep When I git roun to it I cal late to set the house on fire some night Mebbe I d be lucky enough to ketch Hen too an if so nobody in the village d wear mournin So fur I can t get Maria s consent to be a cendenary She says she can t spare me long enough to go to jail she needs me to work durin the summer an in the winter time she d hev nobody to jaw if I was in the lockup This information was delivered in the intervals of covering the guest chamber walls with a delightful white moire paper which Osh always alluded to as the white maria whether in memory of his wife s Christian name or because his French accent was not up to the mark no one could say mister Popham exaggerated nothing but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the House of Lords Henry Lord with the degree of Ph D to his credit had been Professor of Zoology at a New England college but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific text books Always irritable cold indifferent he had grown rapidly more so as years went on Had his pale timid wife been a rosy plucky tyrant things might have gone otherwise but the only memories the two children possessed were of bitter words and reproaches on their father s side and of tears and sad looks on their mother s part Then the poor little shadow of a woman dropped wearily into her grave and a certain elderly missus Bangs with grey hair and firm chin came to keep house and do the work A lonelier creature than Olive Lord at sixteen could hardly be imagined She was a tiny thing for her years with a little white oval face and peaked chin pronounced eyebrows beautifully arched and a mass of tangled untidy dark hair Her only interests in life were her younger brother Cyril delicate and timid and in continual terror of his father and a passion for drawing and sketching that was fairly devouring in its intensity When she was ten she drew the cat and the dog the hens and chickens and colored the sketches with the paints her mother provided Whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas Then for the three years before her mother s death there had been surreptitious lessons from a Portland teacher paid for out of mister Lord s house allowance for one of his chief faults was an incredible parsimony amounting almost to miserliness Something terrible will happen to Olive if she isn t taught to use her talent missus Lord pleaded to her husband She is wild to know how to do things She makes effort after effort trembling with eagerness and when she fails to reproduce what she sees she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment You d better give her lessons in self control mister Lord answered They are cheaper than instruction in drawing and much more practical So Olive lived and struggled and grew and luckily her talent was such a passion that no circumstances could crush or extinguish it She worked discovering laws and making rules for herself since she had no helpers When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper she searched in her father s books for pictures of its bones If I could only know what it is like inside Cyril she said perhaps its outside wouldn t look so flat O Cyril there must be some better way of doing I just draw the outline of an animal and then I put hairs or feathers on it They have no bodies They couldn t run nor move they re just pasteboard Why don t you do flowers and houses Olive inquired Cyril solicitously And people paint fruit and dead fish on platters and pitchers of lemonade with ice in why don t you try things like those I suppose they re easier Olive returned with a sigh but who could bear to do them when there are living breathing moving things things that puzzle you by looking different every minute No I ll keep on trying and when you get a little older we ll run away together and live and learn things by ourselves in some place where father can never find us He wouldn t search so don t worry replied Cyril quietly and the two looked at each other and knew that it was so There in the cedar hollow then lived Olive Lord an angry resentful little creature weighed down by a fierce sense of injury Her gloomy young heart was visited by frequent storms and she looked as unlovable as she was unloved But Nancy Carey never shy and as eager to give herself as people always are who are born and bred in joy and love Nancy hopped out of Mother Carey s warm nest one day and fixing her bright eyes and sunny hopeful glance on the lonely frowning little neighbor stretched out her hand in friendship Olive s mournful black eyes met Nancy s sparkling brown ones Her hand so marvellously full of skill had never held another s and she was desperately self conscious but magnetism flowed from Nancy as electric currents from a battery She drew Olive to her by some unknown force and held her fast not realizing at the moment that she was getting as much as she gave The first interview purely a casual one took place on the edge of the lily pond where Olive was sketching frogs and where Nancy went for cat o nine tails It proved to be a long and intimate talk and when missus Carey looked out of her bedroom window just before supper she saw at the pasture bars the two girls with their arms round each other and their cheeks close together Nancy s curly chestnut crop shone in the sun and Olive s thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast Suddenly she flung her arms round Nancy s neck and with a sob darted under the bars and across the fields without a backward glance A few moments later Nancy entered her mother s room her arms filled with treasures from the woods and fields Oh Motherdy she cried laying down her flowers and taking off her hat I ve found such a friend a real understanding friend and it s the girl from the House of Lords She s wonderful More wonderful than anybody we ve ever seen anywhere and she draws better than the teacher in Charlestown She s older than I am but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child Oh mother there s always so much spare room in your heart for you took in Julia and yet we never felt the difference won t you make a place for Olive There never was anybody needed you so much as she does never Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale yellow stunted shoots of grass under it And have you gone next day and next and watched the little blades shoot upward spread themselves with delight grow green and wax strong and finally warm with the sun cool with the dew vigorous with the flow of sap in their veins seen them wave their green tips in the breeze That was what happened to Olive Lord when she and Cyril were drawn into a different family circle and ran in and out of the Yellow House with the busy eager group of Mother Carey s chickens XIX 
5480-41798-0001	train-other-500	OLD AND NEW The Yellow House had not always belonged to the Hamiltons but had been built by a governor of the state when he retired from public office He lived only a few years
none	none	 and it then passed into the hands of Lemuel Hamilton s grandfather who had done little or nothing in the way of remodelling the buildings Governor Weatherby had harbored no extraordinary ambition regarding architectural excellence for he was not a rich man 
5480-41798-0002	train-other-500	he had simply built a large comfortable Colonial house He desired no gardens no luxurious stables no fountains nor grottoes no bathroom for it was only the year eighteen ten
5480-41798-0003	train-other-500	while the old oaken bucket left nothing to be desired as a means of dispensing water to the household He had one weakness however and that was a wish to make the front of the house as impressive as possible
5480-41798-0004	train-other-500	The window over the front door was as beautiful a window as any in the county and the doorway itself was celebrated throughout the state It had a wonderful fan light and side lights green blind doors outside of the white painted one with its massive brass knocker
5480-41798-0005	train-other-500	and still more unique and impressive it had for its approach semi circular stone steps instead of the usual oblong ones The large blocks of granite had been cut so that each of the four steps should be smaller than the one below it and when
5480-41798-0006	train-other-500	after months of gossip and suspense they were finally laid in place their straight edges towards the house and their expensive curved sides to the road a procession of curious persons in wagons carryalls buggies and gigs wound their way past the premises
5480-41798-0007	train-other-500	The governor s circ lar steps brought many pilgrims down the main street of Beulah first and last and the original Hamiltons had been very proud of them Pride of such simple things as stone steps had died out of the Hamilton stock in the course of years
5480-41798-0008	train-other-500	and the house had been so long vacant that no one but Lemuel the Consul remembered any of its charming features but Ossian Popham when he pried up and straightened the ancient landmarks had much to say of the wonderful steps
5480-41798-0009	train-other-500	There s so much goin on now a days he complained as he puffed and pried and strained and rested in between that young ones won t amount to nothin fust thing you know My boy Digby says to me this mornin
none	none	 when I asked him if he was goin to the County Fair 
5480-41798-0010	train-other-500	No Pop I ain t goin he says it s the same old fair every year Land sakes when I was a boy bout once a month in warm weather
none	none	 I used to ask father if I could walk to the other end o the village and look at the governor s circ lar steps 
5480-41798-0011	train-other-500	that used to be the liveliest entertainment parents could think up for their young ones an it was a heap livelier than two sermons of a Sunday each of em an hour and fifteen minutes long Digby a lad of eighteen and master of only one trade instead of a dozen
none	none	 like his father had been deputed to paper Mother Carey s bedroom while she moved for a few days into the newly fitted guest room which was almost too beautiful to sleep in with its white satiny walls its yellow and green garlands hanging from the ceiling its yellow floor 
5480-41798-0012	train-other-500	and its old white chamber set repainted by the faithful and clever Popham The chintz parlor once Governor Weatherby s study was finished too and the whole family looked in at the doors a dozen times a day with admiring exclamations
5480-41798-0013	train-other-500	It had six doors opening into two entries one small bedroom one sitting room one cellar and one china closet a passion for entrances and exits having been the whim of that generation If the truth were known
5480-41798-0014	train-other-500	Nancy had once lighted her candle and slipped downstairs at midnight to sit on the parlor sofa and feast her eyes on the room s loveliness Gilbert had painted the white matting the color of a ripe cherry
5480-41798-0015	train-other-500	missus Popham had washed and ironed and fluted the old white ruffled muslin curtains from the Charlestown home and they adorned the four windows It was the north room on the left as you entered the house and would be closed during the cold winter months
none	none	 so it was fitted entirely for summer use and comfort 
5480-41798-0016	train-other-500	The old fashioned square piano looked in its element placed across one corner with the four tall silver candlesticks and snuffer tray on the shining mahogany All the shabbiest furniture and the Carey furniture was mostly shabby
5480-41798-0017	train-other-500	was covered with a cheap gay chintz and crimson Jacqueminot roses clambered all over the wall paper
none	none	 so that the room was a cool bower of beauty 
5480-41798-0018	train-other-500	On the other side of the hall were the double parlors of the governor s time made into a great living room Here was Gilbert s green painted floor smooth and glossy
none	none	 with braided rugs bought from neighbors in East Beulah 
5480-41798-0019	train-other-500	here all the old fashioned Gilbert furniture that the Careys had kept during their many wanderings here all the quaint chairs that mister Bill Harmon could pick up at a small price here were two noble fireplaces one with a crane and iron pot filled with flowers
5480-41798-0020	train-other-500	the other filled sometimes with sprays of green asparagus and sometimes with fragrant hemlock boughs The paper was one in which green rushes and cat o nine tails grew on a fawn colored ground and anything that the Careys did not possess for the family sitting room
5480-41798-0021	train-other-500	Ossian Popham went straight home and made in his barn He could make a barrel chair or an hour glass table a box lounge and the mattress to put on top of it
none	none	 or a low table for games and puzzles or a window seat 
5480-41798-0022	train-other-500	He could polish the piano and then sit down to it and play Those Tassels on Her Boots or Marching through Georgia with great skill He could paint bunches of gold grapes and leaves on the old fashioned high backed rocker and as soon as it was dry
5480-41798-0023	train-other-500	could sit down in it and entertain the whole family without charging them a penny The housewarming could not be until the later autumn missus Carey had decided for although most of the living rooms could be finished
5480-41798-0024	train-other-500	Cousin Ann s expensive improvements were not to be set in motion until Bill Harmon heard from mister Hamilton that his tenants were not to be disturbed for at least three years The house which was daily growing into a home
5480-41798-0025	train-other-500	was full of the busy hum of labor from top to bottom and from morning till night and there was hardly a moment when Mother Carey and the girls were not transporting articles of furniture through the rooms and up and down the staircases to see how they would look somewhere else
5480-41798-0026	train-other-500	This indeed had been the diversion of their simple life for many years and was just as delightful in their opinion as buying new things Any Carey from mother down to Peter
5480-41798-0027	train-other-500	would spring from his chair at any moment and assist any other Carey to move a sofa a bureau a piano a kitchen stove if necessary with the view of determining if it would add a new zest to life in a different position
5480-41798-0028	train-other-500	Not a word has been said thus far about the Yellow House barn the barn that the fool Hamilton boys according to Bill Harmon s theories
none	none	 had converted from a place of practical usefulness and possible gain 
5480-41798-0029	train-other-500	into something that would make a cat laugh but it really needs a chapter to itself You remember that doctor Holmes says of certain majestic and dignified trees that they ought to have a Christian name like other folks The barn in the same way
5480-41798-0030	train-other-500	deserves more distinction than a paragraph but at this moment it was being used as a storeroom and was merely awaiting its splendid destiny quite unconscious of the future The Hamilton boys were no doubt as extravagant and thriftless as they were insane
5480-41798-0031	train-other-500	but the Careys sympathized with their extravagance and thriftlessness and insanity so heartily in this particular that they could hardly conceal their real feelings from Bill Harmon Nothing could so have accorded with their secret desires as the fool changes made by the
5480-41798-0032	train-other-500	crazy Hamilton boys light hearted irresponsible and frivolous changes that could never have been compassed by the Careys slender income They had no money to purchase horse or cow or pig and no man in the family to take care of them if purchased
5480-41798-0033	train-other-500	so the removal of stalls and all the necessary appurtenances for the care of cattle was no source of grief or loss to them A good floor had been laid over the old one and stained to a dark color the ceiling with its heavy hand hewn beams
5480-41798-0034	train-other-500	was almost as fine as some old oak counterpart in an English hall Not a new board met the eye old weathered lumber everywhere even to the quaint settle shaped benches that lined the room There was a place like an old fashioned tie up for musicians to play for a country dance
none	none	 or for tableaux and charades 
5480-41798-0035	train-other-500	in fine there would be with the addition of Carey ideas here and there provision for frolics and diversions of any sort You no sooner opened the door and peeped in though few of the Beulah villagers had ever been invited to do so by the gay young Hamiltons
5480-41798-0036	train-other-500	than your tongue spontaneously exclaimed What a place for good times I shall come out here Nancy announced as the three girls stood in the centre of the floor surrounded by bedsteads tables bureaus and stoves
none	none	 Julia you can debut where you like 
5480-41798-0037	train-other-500	but I shall come out here next summer
none	none	 You ll be only seventeen you can t come out 
5480-41798-0038	train-other-500	objected Julia conventionally Not in a drawing room perhaps but perfectly well in a barn Even you and Kitty youthful as you will still be can attend my coming out party in a barn
5480-41798-0039	train-other-500	It doesn t seem proper to think of giving entertainments when everybody knows our circumstances how poor we are Julia said rebukingly We are talking of next summer my child Who can say how rich we shall be next summer
5480-41798-0040	train-other-500	A party could be given in this barn with mother to play the piano and mister Popham the fiddle The refreshments would be incredibly weak lemonade and I think we might solicit the cake as they do for church sociables
none	none	 Julia s pride was wounded beyond concealment at this humorously intended suggestion of Nancy s Of course if Aunt Margaret approves I have nothing to say she remarked but I myself would never come to any private party where refreshments were solicited 
5480-41798-0041	train-other-500	The very idea is horrible I m coming out in the barn next summer Muddy Nancy called to her mother who just then entered the door If we are poorer than ever we can take up a collection to defray the expenses
5480-41798-0042	train-other-500	Julia and Kitty would look so attractive going about with tambourines I want to do what I can quickly because I see plainly I shall have to marry young in order to help the family The heroine always does that in books she makes a worldly marriage with a rich nobleman
5480-41798-0043	train-other-500	in order that her sister Kitty and her cousin Julia may have a good education I don t know where you get your ideas Nancy said her mother smiling at her nonsense You certainly never read half a dozen novels in your life
none	none	 No but Joanna used to read them by the hundred and tell me the stories and I ve heard father read aloud to you and the older girls and the younger teachers used to discuss them at school oh I know a lot about life as it is in books and I m just waiting to see if any of it really happens 
5480-41798-0044	train-other-500	Digby Popham is the only rich nobleman in sight for you Nancy Kitty said teasingly
none	none	 Or freckled Cyril Lord 
5480-41798-0045	train-other-500	interpolated Julia He looks like an unbaked pie This from Kitty Nancy flushed He s shy and unhappy and pale and no wonder but he s as nice and interesting as he can be I can t see it
5480-41798-0046	train-other-500	Julia said but he never looks at anybody or talks to anybody but you so it s well you like him though you like all boys for that matter The boys return the compliment asserted Kitty mischievously while poor you and I sit in corners
5480-41798-0047	train-other-500	Come come dears and missus Carey joined in the conversation as she picked up a pillow before returning to the house It s a little early for you to be talking about rich noblemen isn t it Nancy followed her out of the door saying as she thoughtfully chewed a straw
none	none	 Muddy I do believe that when you re getting on to sixteen the rich nobleman or the fairy prince or the wonderful youngest son does cross your mind now and then XX THE PAINTED CHAMBER Matters were in this state of forwardness when Nancy and Kathleen looked out of the window one morning and saw Lallie Joy Popham coming down the street She lugged butter and milk regularly to the Careys lugging is her own word for the act and helped them in many ways for she was fairly good at any kind of housework not demanding brains Nobody could say why some of Ossian Popham s gifts of mind and conversation had not descended to his children but though the son was not really stupid at practical work Lallie Joy was in a perpetual state of coma Nancy as has been intimated before had a kind of tendency to reform things that appeared to her lacking in any way and she had early seized upon the stolid Lallie Joy as a worthy object There she comes said Nancy She carries two quarts of milk in one hand and two pounds of butter in the other exactly as if she was bending under the weight of a load of hay I ll run down into the kitchen and capture her for a half hour at five cents She can peel the potatoes first and while they re boiling she can slice apples for sauce Have her chop the hash do coaxed Julia for that was her special work The knife is dull beyond words Why don t you get mister Popham to sharpen it It s a poor workman that complains of his tools Columbus discovered America in an open boat quoted Nancy with an irritating air of wisdom That may be so Julia retorted but Columbus would never have discovered America with that chopping knife I m sure of that Is Lallie Joy about our age I don t know She must have been at least forty when she was born and that would make her fifty five now What do you suppose would wake her up If I could only get her to stand straight or hold her head up or let her hair down or close her mouth I believe I ll stay in the kitchen and appeal to her better feelings a little this morning I can seed the raisins for the bread pudding Nancy sat in the Shaker rocker by the sink window with the yellow bowl in her lap Her cheeks were pink her eyes were bright her lips were red her hair was goldy brown her fingers flew and a high necked gingham apron was as becoming to her as it is to all nice girls She was thoroughly awake was Nancy and there could not have been a greater contrast than that between her and the comatose Lallie Joy who sat on a wooden chair with her feet on the side rounds She had taken off her Turkey red sunbonnet and hung it on the chair back where its color violently assaulted her flaming locks She sat wrong she held the potato pan wrong and the potatoes and the knife wrong There seemed to be no sort of connection between her mind and her body As she peeled potatoes and Nancy seeded raisins the conversation was something like this How did you chance to bring the butter to day instead of to morrow Lallie Joy Had to dress me up to go to the store and get a new hat What colored trimming did you get Same as old Don t they keep anything but magenta Yes blue Why didn t you try blue for a change Dunno didn t want any change I guess Do you like magenta against your hair Never thought o my hair jest thought o my hat Well you see Lallie Joy you can t change your hair but you needn t wear magenta hats nor red sunbonnets Your hair is handsome enough if you d only brush it right I guess I know all bout my hair and how red t is The boys ask me if Pop painted it Why do you strain it back so tight Keep it out o my eyes Nonsense you needn t drag it out by the roots Why do you tie the braids with strings Cause they hold an I hain t got no ribbons Why don t you buy some with the money you earn here Savin up for the Fourth Well I have yards of old Christmas ribbons that I ll give you if you ll use them All right What do you scrub your face with that makes those shiny knobs stick right out on your forehead and cheek bones Sink soap Well you shouldn t haven t you any other It s upstairs Aren t your legs in good working order Uncomprehending silence on Lallie Joy s part and then Nancy returned to the onslaught Don t you like to look at pretty things Dunno but I do an dunno as I do Don t you love the rooms your father has finished here Kind of Not any more than that Pop thinks some of em s queer an so does Bill Harmon Long silence Nancy being utterly daunted How did you come by your name Lallie Joy Lallie s out of a book named Lallie Rook an I was born on the Joy steamboat line going to Boston Oh I thought Joy was Joy Joy Line s the only joy I ever heard of There is no knowing how long this depressing conversation would have continued if the two girls had not heard loud calls from Gilbert upstairs Lallie Joy evinced no surprise and went on peeling potatoes she might have been a sister of the famous Casabianca and she certainly could have been trusted not to flee from any burning deck whatever the provocation Come and see what we ve found Digby and I Gilbert cried Come girls come mother We were stripping off the paper because mister Popham said there d been so many layers on the walls it would be a good time to get to the bottom of it and have it all fresh and clean So just now as I was working over the mantel piece and Digby on the long wall look in and see what we uncovered missus Carey had come from the nursery Kitty and Julia from the garden and Osh Popham from the shed and they all gazed with joy and surprise at the quaint landscapes that had been painted in water colors before the day of wall paper had come mister Popham quickly took one of his tools and began on another side of the room They worked slowly and carefully and in an hour or two the pictures stood revealed a little faded in color but beautifully drawn with almost nothing of any moment missing from the scenes Je roosh y ain t they handsome exclaimed Osh standing in the middle of the room with the family surrounding him in various attitudes of ecstasy But they re too faced out to leave s they be ain t they Mis Carey You ll have to cover em up with new paper won t you or shall you let me put a coat of varnish on em missus Carey shuddered internally No mister Popham we mustn t have any shine on the landscapes Yes they are dreadfully dim and faded but I simply cannot have them covered up It would be wicked to hide them said Nancy Oh Muddy is it our duty to write to mister Hamilton and tell him about them He would certainly take the house away from us if he could see how beautiful we have made it and now here is another lovely thing to tempt him Could anybody give up this painted chamber if it belonged to him Well you see said mister Popham assuringly if you want to use this painted chamber much you ve got to live in Beulah an Lem Hamilton ain t goin to stop consullin at the age o fifty to come here an rust out with the rest of us no siree Nor Mis Lem Hamilton wouldn t stop over night in this village if you give her the town drinkin trough for a premium Is she fashionable asked Julia You bet she is She s tall an slim an so chuck full of airs she d blow away if you give her a puff o the bellers The only time she come here she stayed just twenty four hours but she nearly died we was all so vulgar She wore a white dress ruffled up to the waist and a white Alpine hat an she looked exactly like the picture of Pike s Peak in my stereopticon Mis Popham overheard her say Beulah was full o savages if not cannibals Well I says to Maria no matter where she goes nobody ll ever want to eat her alive Look at that meetin house over the mantel shelf an that grassy Common an elm trees T wa n t no house painter done these walls And look at this space between the two front windows cried Kathleen See the hens and chickens and the Plymouth Rock rooster And the white calf lying down under the maple he s about the prettiest thing in the room said Gilbert We must just let it be and think it out said Mother Carey Don t put any new paper on now there s plenty to do downstairs I don t know s I should particularly like to lay abed in this room said Osh his eyes roving about the chamber judicially I shouldn t hev no comfort ondressin here nohow not with this mess o live stock lookin at me every minute whatever I happened to be takin off I s pose that rooster d be right on to his job at sun up Well he couldn t git ahead of Mis Popham that s one thing so t I shouldn t be any worse off n I be now I don t get any too much good sleep as t is Mis Popham makes me go to bed long afore I m ready so t she can git the house shut up in good season then bout s soon s I ve settled down an bed one short nap she says It s time you was up Ossian Mother I have an idea cried Nancy suddenly as mister Popham took his leave and the family went out into the hall Do you know who could make the walls look as they used to My dear Olive Lord She s only sixteen objected missus Carey But she s a natural born genius You wait and see the things she does Perhaps I could take her into town and get some suggestions or some instruction with the proper materials said missus Carey and I suppose she could experiment on some small space behind the door first Nothing that Olive does would ever be put behind anybody s door Nancy answered decisively I m not old enough to know anything about painting of course except that good landscapes ought not to be reversible like our Van Twiller but there s something about Olive s pictures that makes you want to touch them and love them So began the happiest most wonderful most fruitful autumn of Olive Lord s life when she spent morning after morning in the painted chamber refreshing its faded tints Whoever had done the original work had done it lovingly and well and Olive learned many a lesson while she was following the lines of the quaint houses like those on old china renewing the green of the feathery elms or retracing and coloring the curious sampler trees that stood straight and stiff like sentinels in the corners of the room XXI A FAMILY RHOMBOID The Honorable Lemuel Hamilton sat in the private office of the American Consulate in Breslau Germany one warm day in July The post had been brought in half an hour before and he had two open letters on the desk in front of him It was only ten o clock of a bright morning but he looked tired and worn He was about fifty with slightly grey hair and smoothly shaven face He must have been merry at one time in his life for there were many nice little laughing wrinkles around his eyes but somehow these seemed to have faded out as if they had not been used for years and the corners of his mouth turned down to increase the look of weariness and discontent A smile had crept over his face at his old friend Bill Harmon s spelling and penmanship for a missive of that kind seldom came to the American Consulate When the second letter postmarked Beulah first struck his eye he could not imagine why he should have another correspondent in the quaintly named little village He had read Nancy s letter twice now and still he sat smoking and dreaming with an occasional glance at the girlish handwriting or a twinkle of the eye at the re reading of some particular passage His own girls were not ready writers and their mother generally sent their messages for them Nancy and Kitty did not yet write nearly as well as they talked but they contrived to express something of their own individuality in their communications which were free and fluent though childlike and crude What a nice girl this Nancy Carey must be thought the American Consul This is such a jolly confidential gossipy winsome little letter Her first business letter she calls it Alas when she learns how a few years later there will be no charming little confidences no details of family income and expenditures no tell tale glimpses of mother and Julia I believe I should know the whole family even without this photograph The lady sitting in the chair to whom the photographer s snapshot has not done justice is worthy of Nancy s praise and Bill Harmon s What a pretty piquant curly head Nancy has What a gay vivacious alert spirited expression The boy is handsome and gentlemanly but he ll have to wake up or Nancy will be the man of the family The girl sitting down is less attractive She s Uncle Allan s daughter and consulting the letter Uncle Allan has nervous prostration and all of mother s money Here mister Hamilton gave vent to audible laughter for the third time in a quarter of an hour Nancy doesn t realize with what perfection her somewhat imperfect English states the case he thought I know Uncle Allan like a book from his resemblance to certain other unfortunate gentlemen who have nervous prostration in combination with other people s money Let s see I know Nancy friendly little Nancy about fifteen or sixteen I should judge I know Uncle Allan s Julia who hems in photographs but not otherwise I know Gilbert who is depressed at having to make his own way the small boy who is the nicest of us all Kitty who beat all the others in getting to mother s shoulder and the mother herself who is beautiful and doesn t say Bosh to her children s ideas and refuses to touch the insurance money and wants Gilbert to show what father s son can do without anybody s help and who revels in the color and joy of a yellow wall paper at twenty cents a roll Bless their simple hearts They mustn t pay any rent while they are bringing water into the kitchen and making expensive improvements And what Hamilton could be persuaded to live in the yellow house To think of any one s wanting to settle down in that little deserted spot Beulah where the only sound that ever strikes one s ear is Osh Popham s laugh or the tinkle of a cow bell Oh if my own girls would write me letters like this letting me see how their minds are growing how they are taking hold of life above all what is in their hearts Well little Miss Nancy Carey honest outspoken confidential clever little Nancy who calls me her dearest mister Hamilton and thanks me for letting her live in my yellow house you shall never be disturbed and if you and Gilbert ever earn enough money to buy it it shall go to you cheap There s not one of my brood that would live in it except Tom perhaps for after spending three hundred dollars they even got tired of dancing in the barn on Saturday nights so if it can fall into the hands of some one who will bring a blessing on it good old Granny Hamilton will rest peacefully in her grave We have discoursed in another place of family circles but it cannot be truthfully said that at any moment the Lemuel Hamiltons had ever assumed that symmetrical and harmonious shape Still during the first eight or ten years of their married life when the children were young they had at least appeared to the casual eye as say a rectangular parallelogram A little later the cares and jolts of life wrenched the right angles a trifle out of plumb and a rhomboid was the result missus Hamilton had money of her own but wished Lemuel to amass enough fame and position to match it She liked a diplomatic life if her husband could be an ambassador but she thought him strangely slow in achieving this dignity No pleasure or pride in her husband s ability to serve his country even in a modest position ever crossed her mind She had no desire to spend her valuable time in various poky Continental towns and she had many excuses for not doing so the proper education of her children being the chief among them Luckily for her good and desirable schools were generally at an easy distance from the jewellers shops and the dressmakers and milliners establishments her soul loved so while mister Hamilton did his daily task in Antwerp missus Hamilton resided mostly in Brussels or Paris when he was in Zittau in Saxony she was in Dresden If he were appointed to some business city she remained with him several months each year and spent the others in a more artistic and fashionable locality The situation was growing difficult because the children were gradually getting beyond school age although there still remained to her the sacred duty of settling them properly in life Agnes her mother s favorite was still at school and was devoted to foreign languages foreign manners and foreign modes of life Edith had grown restless and developed an uncomfortable fondness for her native land so that she spent most of her time with her mother s relatives in New York or in visiting school friends here or there The boys had gone far away Jack the elder to Texas where he had lost what money his father and mother had put into his first business venture Thomas the younger to China where he was woefully lonely but doing well in business A really good diplomatic appointment in a large and important city would have enabled mister Hamilton to collect some of his scattered sons and daughters and provide them with the background for which his wife had yearned without ceasing and very audibly for years But mister Hamilton did not get the coveted appointment and missus Hamilton did not specially care for mister Hamilton when he failed in securing the things she wanted This was the time when the laughing wrinkles began to fade away from mister Hamilton s eyes just for lack of daily use and it was then that the corners of his mouth began to turn down and his shoulders to stoop and his eye to grow less keen and brave and his step less vigorous It may be a commonplace remark but it is not at these precise moments in life that tired depressed men in modest positions are wafted by Uncle Sam to great and desirable heights but to missus Hamilton it appeared that her husband was simply indolent unambitious and unlucky not at all that he needed to be believed in or loved or comforted or helped or braced It might have startled her and hurt her wifely pride if she had seen her lonely husband drinking in little Nancy Carey s letter as if it were dew to a thirsty spirit to see him set the photograph of the Carey group on his desk and look at it from time to time affectionately as if he had found some new friends It was the contentment the hope the unity the pluck the mutual love the confidence the ambition of the group that touched his imagination and made his heart run out to them Airs from the Eden of youth awoke and stirred in his soul as he took his pen to answer Nancy s first business communication Having completed his letter he lighted another cigar and leaning back in his revolving chair clasped his hands behind his head and fell into a reverie The various diplomatic posts that might be opened to him crossed his mind in procession If A or B or C were possible his wife would be content and their combined incomes might be sufficient to bring the children together if not quite under one roof then to points not so far separated from each other but that a speaking acquaintance might be developed Tom was the farthest away and he was the dearest the only Hamilton of the lot the only one who loved his father mister Hamilton leaned forward abstractedly and fumbling through one drawer of his desk after another succeeded in bringing out a photograph of Tom taken at seventeen or eighteen Then by a little extra search he found his wife in her presentation dress at a foreign court There was no comfort or companionship in that it was too furbelowed to be anybody s wife but underneath it in the same frame was one taken just after their marriage That was too full of memories to hold much joy but it stirred his heart and made it beat a little enough at any rate to show it was not dead In the letter case in his vest pocket was an almost forgotten picture of the girls when they were children This with the others he stood in a row in front of him reminding himself that he did not know the subjects much more intimately than the photographers who had made their likenesses He glanced from one family to the other and back again several times The Careys were handsomer there was no doubt of that but there was a deeper difference that eluded him The Hamiltons were far more stylishly dressed but they all looked a little conscious and a little discontented That was it the Careys were happier There were six of them living in the forgotten Hamilton house in a half deserted village on five or six hundred dollars a year and doing their own housework and they were happier than his own brood spending forty or fifty times that sum Well they were grown up his sons and daughters and the only change in their lives now would come from wise or unwise marriages No poverty stricken sons in law would ever come into the family with missus Hamilton standing at the bars he was sure of that As for the boys they might choose their mates in Texas or China they might even have chosen them now for aught he knew though Jack was only twenty six and Tom twenty two He must write to them oftener all of them no matter how busy and anxious he might be especially to Tom who was so far away He drew a sheet of paper towards him and having filled it another and yet another Having folded and slipped it into an envelope and addressed it to Thomas Hamilton esquire Hong Kong China he was about to seal it when he stopped a moment I ll enclose the little Carey girl s letter he thought Tom s the only one who cares a penny for the old house and I ve told him I have rented it He s a generous boy and he won t grudge a few dollars lost to a good cause Besides these Careys will increase the value of the property every year they live in it and without them the buildings would gradually have fallen into ruins He added a postscript to his letter saying I ve sent you little Miss Nancy s letter the photograph of her tying up the rambler rose and the family group so that you can see exactly what influenced me to write her and Bill Harmon that they should be undisturbed in their tenancy and that their repairs and improvements should be taken in lieu of rent This done and the letters stamped he put the photographs of his wife and children here and there on his desk and left the office Oh it is quite certain that Mother Carey s own chickens go out over the seas and show good birds the way home and it is quite true as she said One real home always makes another I am sure of that It can even send a vision of a home across fields and forests and lakes and oceans from Beulah village to Breslau Germany and on to Hong Kong China XXII CRADLE GIFTS missus Henry Lord sent out a good many invitations to the fairies for Cyril s birthday party but mister Lord was at his critical point in the first volume of his text book and forgot that he had a son Where both parents are not interested in these little affairs something is sure to be forgotten Cyril s mother was weak and ill at the time and the upshot of it was that the anger of The Fairy Who Wasn t Invited was visited on the baby Cyril in his cradle In the revengeful spirit of that fairy who is omitted from these functions she sent a threat instead of a blessing and decreed that Cyril should walk in fear all the days of his life Of course being a fairy she knew very well that if Cyril or anybody very much interested in Cyril went to declare that there was no power whatever behind her curse she would not be able to gratify her spite but she knew also being a fairy that if Cyril got into the habit of believing himself a coward he would end by being one so she stood a good chance of winning after all Cyril when he came into the world had come with only half a welcome No mother and father ever met over his cradle and looked at him together wondering if it were well with the child When he was old enough to have his red gold hair curled and a sash tied around his baby waist he was sometimes taken downstairs but he always fled to his mother s or his nurse s knee when his father approached How many times he and his little sister Olive had hidden under the stairs when father had called mother down to the study to scold her about the grocer s bill And there was a nightmare of a memory concerning a certain birthday of father s when mother had determined to be gay It was just before supper Cyril clad in his first brief trousers was to knock at the study door with a little purple nosegay in his hand to show his father that the lilac had bloomed Olive in crimson cashmere was to stand near and when the door opened present him with her own picture of the cat and her new kittens while mother looking so pretty with her own gift all ready in her hand was palpitating on the staircase to see how the plans would work Nothing could have been worse however in the way of a small domestic tragedy than the event itself when it finally came off Cyril knocked What do you want came from within in tones that breathed vexation at being interrupted Knock again whispered missus Lord Father doesn t remember that it s his birthday and he doesn t know that it s you knocking Cyril knocked again timidly but at the first sound of his father s irritable voice as he rose hurriedly from his desk the boy turned and fled through the kitchen to the shed Olive held the fort picture in hand It s your birthday father she said There s a cake for supper and here s my present There was no love in the child s voice Her heart filled with passionate sympathy for Cyril had lost all zest for its task and she handed her gift to her father with tightly closed lips and heaving breast All right I m much obliged but I wish you would not knock at this door when I am writing I ve told you that before Tell your mother I can t come to supper to night but to send me a tray please As he closed the door Olive saw him lay the picture on a table never looking at it as he crossed the room to one of the great book cases that lined the walls missus Lord had by this time disappeared forlornly from the upper hall Olive aged ten talked up the stairs in a state of mind ferocious in its anger Entering her mother s room she tore the crimson ribbon from her hair and began to unbutton her dress I hate him I hate him she cried stamping her foot I will never knock at his door again I d like to take Cyril and run away I ll get the birthday cake and fling it into the pond nothing shall stop me Then seeing her mother s white face she wailed as she flung herself on the bed Oh mother mother why did you ever let him come to live with us Did we have to have him for a father Couldn t you help it mother missus Lord grew paler put her hand to her heart wavered caught herself wavered again and fell into the great chair by the window Her eyes closed and Olive frightened by the apparent effect of her words ran down the back stairs and summoned the cook When she returned panting and breathless her mother was sitting quite quietly by the window looking out at the cedars It was only a sudden pain dear I am all well again Nothing is really the matter Bridget mister Lord will not be down to supper spread a tray for him please I d like to spread a tray for him at the bottom of the Red Sea that s where he belongs muttered Bridget as she descended to the kitchen to comfort Cyril Was it my fault mother asked Olive bending over her anxiously Her mother drew the child s head down and leaned her own against it feebly No dear she sighed It s nobody s fault unless it s mine Is the pain gone Quite gone dear Nevertheless the pain was to prove the final wrench to a heart that had been on the verge of breaking for many a year and it was not long before Olive and Cyril were motherless mister Lord did not have the slightest objection to the growing intimacy between his children and the new family in the Yellow House so long as he was not disturbed by it and so long as it cost him nothing They had strict orders not to play with certain of their village acquaintances mister Lord believing himself to be an aristocrat the fact being that he was almost destitute of human sympathy and to make a neighbor of him you would have had to begin with his grandfather and work for three generations He had seen Nancy and Gilbert at the gates of his place and he had passed missus Carey in one of his infrequent walks to the post office She was not a person to pass without mental comment and mister Lord instantly felt himself in the presence of an equal an unusual fact in his experience he would not have known a superior if he had met one ever so often A very fine unusual woman he thought She accounts for that handsome manly boy I wish he could knock some spirit into Cyril The process of knocking spirit into a boy would seem to be inconsistent with educational logic but by very different methods Gilbert had certainly given Cyril a trifling belief in himself and Mother Carey was gradually winning him to some sort of self expression by the warmth of her frequent welcomes and the delightful faculty she possessed of making him feel at ease Come come said the petrels to the molly mocks in Water Babies This young gentleman is going to Shiny Wall He is a plucky one to have gone so far Give the little chap a cast over the ice pack for Mother Carey s sake Gilbert was delighted in a new place to find a boy friend of his own age and Cyril s speedy attachment gratified his pride Gilbert was doing well these summer months The unceasing activity the authority given him by his mother and sisters his growing proficiency in all kinds of skilled labor as he puttered about with Osh Popham or Bill Harmon in house and barn and garden all this pleased his enterprising nature Only one anxiety troubled his mother his unresigned and mutinous attitude about exchanging popular and fashionable Eastover for Beulah Academy which seat of learning he regarded with unutterable scorn He knew that there was apparently no money to pay Eastover fees but he was still child enough to feel that it could be found somewhere if properly searched for He even considered the education of Captain Carey s eldest son an emergency vital enough to make it proper to dip into the precious five thousand dollars which was yielding them a part of their slender annual income Once when Gilbert was a little boy he had put his shoulder out of joint and to save time his mother took him at once to the doctor s He was suffering but still strong enough to walk They had to climb a hilly street the child moaning with pain his mother soothing and encouraging him as they went on Suddenly he whimpered Oh if this had only happened to Ellen or Joanna or Addy or Nancy I could have borne it so much better There was a good deal of that small boy left in Gilbert still and he endured best the economies that fell on the feminine members of the family It was the very end of August and although school opened the first Monday in September missus Carey was not certain whether Gilbert would walk into the old fashioned white painted academy with the despised Beulah hayseeds or whether he would make a scene and authority would have to be used I declare Gilly exclaimed Mother Carey one night after an argument on the subject one would imagine the only course in life open to a boy was to prepare at Eastover and go to college afterwards Yet you may take a list of the most famous men in America and I dare say you will find half of them came from schools like Beulah Academy or infinitely poorer ones I don t mean the millionaires alone I mean the merchants and engineers and surgeons and poets and authors and statesmen Go ahead and try to stamp your school in some way Gilly don t sit down feebly and wait for it to stamp you This was all very well as an exhibition of spirit on Mother Carey s part but it had been a very hard week Gilbert was sulky Peter had had a touch of tonsillitis Nancy was faltering at the dishwashing and wishing she were a boy Julia was a perfect barnacle Kathleen had an aching tooth and there being no dentist in the village Was applying Popham remedies clove chewing roasted raisins and disfiguring bread poultices Bill Harmon had received no reply from mister Hamilton and when Mother Carey went to her room that evening she felt conscious of a lassitude and a sense of anxiety deeper than for months As Gilbert went by to his own room he glanced in at her door finding it slightly ajar She sat before her dressing table her long hair flowing over her shoulders her head bent over her two hands His father s picture was in its accustomed place and he heard her say as she looked at it Oh my dear my dear I am so careworn so troubled so discouraged Gilbert needs you and so do I more than tongue can tell The voice was so low that it was almost a whisper but it reached Gilbert s ears and there was a sob strangled in it that touched his heart The boy tiptoed softly into his room and sat down on his bed in the moonlight Dear old Mater he thought It s no go I ve got to give up Eastover and college and all and settle down into a country bumpkin No fellow could see his mother look like that and speak like that and go his own gait he s just got to go hers Meantime missus Carey had put out the lamp and lay quietly thinking The last words that floated through her mind as she sank to sleep were those of a half forgotten verse learned she could not say how many years before You can glad your child or grieve it You can trust it or deceive it When all s done Beneath God s sun You can only love and leave it XXIII NEARING SHINY WALL Another person presumably on the way to Shiny Wall and Peacepool but putting small energy into the journey was that mass of positively glaring virtues Julia Carey More than one fairy must have been forgotten when Julia s christening party came off No heart to heart talk in the twilight had thus far produced any obvious effect She had never even when very young experienced a desire to sit at the feet of superior wisdom always greatly preferring a chair of her own She seldom did wrong in her own opinion because the moment she entertained an idea it at once became right her vanity serving as a pair of blinders to keep her from seeing the truth The doctors did not permit any one to write to poor Allan Carey so that Julia s heart could not be softened by continual communication with her invalid father who with Gladys Ferguson constituted the only tribunal she was willing to recognize Her consciousness of superiority to the conditions that surrounded her her love of luxury the silken selfishness with which she squirmed out of unpleasant duties these made her an unlikable and undesirable housemate and that these faults could exist with what Nancy called her everlasting stained glass attitude made it difficult for Mother Carey to maintain a harmonious family circle It was an outburst of Nancy s impetuous temper that missus Carey had always secretly dreaded but after all it was poor Kathleen who precipitated an unforgettable scene which left an influence behind it for many months The morning after Mother Carey s interview with Gilbert she looked up as her door was pushed open and beheld Julia white and rigid with temper standing on the threshold What is the matter child exclaimed her aunt laying down her work in alarm Close behind Julia came Kathleen her face swollen with tears her expression full of unutterable woe Julia s lips opened almost automatically as she said slowly and with bitter emphasis Aunt Margaret is it true as Kathleen says that my father has all your money and some of Uncle Peter s Something snapped in Mother Carey One glance at Kathleen showed only too well that she had committed the almost unpardonable sin of telling Julia what had been carefully and tenderly kept from her Before she could answer Kathleen had swept past Julia and flung herself on the floor near her mother Oh mother I can t say anything that will ever make you understand Julia knows she knows in her heart what she said that provoked me She does nothing but grumble about the work and how few dresses we have and what a drudge she is and what common neighbors we have and how Miss Tewksbury would pity her if she knew all and how Uncle Allan would suffer if he could see his daughter living such a life And this morning my head ached and my tooth ached and I was cross and all at once something leaped out of my mouth Tell her what you said urged Julia inexorably Sobs choked Kathleen s voice I said I said oh how can I tell it I said if her father hadn t lost so much of my father s and my mother s money we shouldn t have been so poor any of us Kathleen how could you cried her mother If Julia wished to precipitate a tempest she had succeeded and her face showed a certain sedate triumph Oh mother don t give me up don t give me up wailed Kathleen It wasn t me that said it it was somebody else that I didn t know lived inside of me I don t expect you to forgive it or forget it Julia but if you ll only try just a little bit I ll show you how sorry I feel I d cut myself and make it bleed I d go to prison if I could get back to where I was before I said it Oh what shall I do mother if you look at me like that again or say How could you There was no doubting Kathleen s remorse even Julia saw that Did she tell the truth Aunt Margaret she repeated Come here Julia and sit by me It is true that your Uncle Peter and I have both put money into your father s business and it is true that he has not been able to give it back to us and perhaps may never do so There is just enough left to pay your poor father s living expenses but we trust his honor we are as sorry for him as we can be and we love him dearly Kathleen meant nothing but that your father has been unfortunate and we all have to abide by the consequences but I am amazed that my daughter should have so forgotten herself as to speak of it to you Renewed sobs from the prostrate Kathleen Especially said Julia when as Gladys Ferguson says I haven t anybody in the world but you to turn to in my trouble I am a fatherless girl her voice quivered here and I am a guest in your house missus Carey s blood rose a little as she looked at poor Kitty s shaken body and streaming eyes and Julia s unforgiving face You are wrong there Julia I fail to see why you should not take your full share of our misfortunes and suffer as much as we from our too small income It is not our fault it is not yours You are not a privileged guest you are one of the family If you are fatherless just now my children are fatherless forever yet you have not made one single burden lighter by joining our forces You have been an outsider instead of putting yourself loyally into the breach and working with us heart to heart I welcomed you with open arms and you have made my life harder much harder than it was before your coming To protect you I have had to discipline my own children continually and all the time you were putting their tempers to quite unnecessary tests I am not extenuating Kathleen but I merely say you have no right to behave as you do You are thirteen years old quite old enough to make up your mind whether you wish to be loved by anybody or not at present you are not Never had the ears of the Paragon heard such disagreeably plain speech She was not inclined to tears but moisture began to appear in her eyes and she looked as though a shower were imminent Aunt Margaret was magnificent in her wrath and though Julia feared she admired her Not to be loved if that really were to be her lot rather terrified Julia She secretly envied Nancy s unconscious gift of drawing people to her instantly men women children dogs and horses for that matter She never noticed that Nancy s heart ran out to meet everybody and that she was overflowing with vitality and joy and sympathy on the contrary she considered the tribute of affection paid to Nancy as a part of Nancy s luck Virtuous conscientious intelligent and well dressed as she felt herself to be she emphatically did not wish to be disliked and it was a complete surprise to her that she had not been a successful Carey chicken Gladys Ferguson always loved me she expostulated after a brief silence and there was a quiver in her voice Then either Gladys has a remarkable gift of loving or else you are a different Julia in her company remarked Mother Carey quietly raising Julia s astonishment and perturbation to an immeasurable height Now Kathleen continued Mother Carey missus Godfrey has often asked you to spend a week with Elsie and you can go to Charlestown on the afternoon train Go away from Julia and forget everything but that you have done wrong and you must find a way to repair it I hope Julia will learn while you are away to make it easier for you to be courteous and amiable There is a good deal in the Bible Julia about the sin of causing your brother to offend Between that sin and Kathleen s offence there is little in my mind to choose Yes there is cried Kathleen I am much much worse than Julia Father couldn t bear to know that I had hurt Julia s feelings and hurt yours too I was false to father and you and Uncle Allan and Julia Nothing can be said for me nothing I am so ashamed of myself that I shall never get over it in the world Oh Julia could you shake hands with me just to show me you know how I despise myself Julia shook hands considerably less like a slug or a limpet than usual and something very queer and unexpected happened when her hand met poor Kitty s wet feverish little paw and she heard the quiver in her voice She suddenly stooped and kissed her cousin quite without intention Kathleen returned the salute with grateful pathetic warmth and then the two fell on Mother Carey s neck to be kissed and cried over for a full minute I ll go to the doctor and have my ugly tooth pulled out exclaimed Kathleen wiping her eyes If it hadn t been for that I never could have been so horrible That would be all very well for once answered her mother with a tired smile but if you pluck out a supposed offending member every time you do something wrong I fear you will not have many left when you are an old lady Mother said Kathleen almost under her breath and not daring to look up couldn t I stay at home from Charlestown and show you and Julia here how sorry I am Yes let her Aunt Margaret and then I can have a chance to try too pleaded Julia Had the heavens fallen Had the Paragon the Pink of Propriety and Perfection confessed a fault Had the heart of the smug one the prig melted and did she feel at last her kinship to the Carey chickens Had she suffered a real grievance the first amongst numberless deeds of tenderness and having resented it like an old beast forgiven it like a new one It certainly seemed as if Mother Carey that week were at her old trade of making things make themselves Gilbert Kathleen and Julia had all fought their way under the ice pack and were getting a glimpse of Shiny Wall XXIV A LETTER PROM GERMANY Mother Carey walked down the village street one morning late in August while Peter milk pail in hand was running by her side and making frequent excursions off the main line of travel Beulah looked enchanting after a night of rain and the fields were greener than they had been since haying time Unless mister Hamilton were away from his consular post on a vacation somewhere on the Continent he should have received and answered Bill Harmon s letter before this she was thinking as she looked at the quiet beauty of the scene that had so endeared itself to her in a few short months missus Popham had finished her morning s work and was already sitting at her drawing in frame in the open doorway making a very purple rose with a very scarlet centre Will you come inside Mis Carey she asked hospitably or do you want Lallie Joy to set you a chair on the grass same as you had last time I always prefer the grass missus Popham smiled missus Carey As it s the day for the fishman to come I thought we d like an extra quart of milk for chowder I only hope he ll make out to come was missus Popham s curt response If I set out to be a fishman I vow I d be one mister Tubbs stays to home whenever he s hayin or his wife s sick or it s stormy or the children want to go to the circus missus Carey laughed That s true but as your husband reminded me last week when mister Tubbs disappointed us his fish is always fresh caught and good Oh of course mister Popham would speak up for him returned his wife I don t see myself as it makes much diff rence whether his fish is good or bad if he stays to home with it Mebbe I look on the dark side a little mite I can t hardly help it livin with mister Popham and he so hopeful He keeps us all very merry at the Yellow House missus Carey ventured Yes he would remarked missus Popham drily but you don t git it stiddy hopefulness at meals hopefulness evenin s an hopefulness nights one everlastin stiddy stream of hopefulness He was jest so as a boy always lookin on the bright side whether there was any or not His mother n father got turrible sick of it so much sunshine in the house made a continual drouth so old Mis Popham used to say For her part she said she liked to think that once in a while there was a cloud that was a first class cloud a thick black cloud clean through to the back She was tired to death lookin for Ossian s silver linin s Lallie Joy s real moody like me I s pose it s only natural livin with a father who never sees anything but good no matter which way he looks There s two things I trust I shan t hear any more when I git to heaven that s Cheer up Maria an It s all for the best As for mister Popham he says any place ll be heaven to him so long as I ain t there callin Hurry up Ossian so we have it back an forth It s a wonderful faculty seeing the good in everything sighed missus Carey Wonderful tiresome returned missus Popham though I will own up it s Ossian s only fault and he can t see his own misfortunes any clearer than he can see those of other folks His new colt run away with him last week and stove the mowin machine all to pieces Never mind Maria he says it ll make fust rate gear for a windmill He s out in the barn now fussin over it you can hear him singin They was all here practicin for the Methodist concert last night an I didn t sleep a wink the tunes kep a runnin in my head so They always git Ossian to sing Fly like a youthful hart or roe over the hills where spices grow an I tell him he s too old youthful harts an roes don t fly over the hills wearin spectacles I tell him but he ll go right on singin it till they have to carry him up on the platform in a wheeled chair You go to the Congregational church don t you missus Popham asked missus Carey I ve seen Lallie and Digby at Sunday school Yes mister Popham is a Methodist and I m a Congregationalist but I say let the children go where they like so I always take them with me missus Carey was just struggling to conceal her amusement at this religious flexibility on missus Popham s part when she espied Nancy flying down the street bareheaded waving a bit of paper in the air Are you most ready to come home Muddy she called without coming any nearer Yes quite ready now Lallie has brought the milk Good morning missus Popham the children want me for some new enterprise You give yourself most too much to em expostulated missus Popham you don t take no vacations Ah well you see myself is all I have to give them answered missus Carey taking Peter and going to meet Nancy Mother said that young person breathlessly I must tell you what I didn t tell at the time for fear of troubling you I wrote to mister Hamilton by the same post that mister Harmon did Bill is so busy and such a poor writer I thought he wouldn t put the matter nicely at all and I didn t want you with all your worries brought into it so I wrote to the Consul myself and kept a copy to show you exactly what I said I have been waiting at the gate for the letters every day for a week but this morning Gilbert happened to be there and shouted A letter from Germany for you Nancy So all of them are wild with curiosity Olive and Cyril too but I wanted you to open and read it first because it may be full of awful blows missus Carey sat down on the side of a green bank between the Pophams corner and the Yellow House and opened the letter with some misgivings it must be confessed Nancy sat close beside her and held one edge of the wide sheets closely filled Why he has written you a volume Nancy exclaimed missus Carey It must be the complete story of his life How long was yours to him I don t remember pretty long because there seemed to be so much to tell to show him how we loved the house and why we couldn t spend Cousin Ann s money and move out in a year or two and a lot about ourselves to let him see we were nice and agreeable and respectable I m not sure all that was strictly necessary commented missus Carey with some trepidation This was Lemuel Hamilton s letter dated from the office of the American Consul in Breslau Germany MY DEAR MISS NANCY As your letter to me was a purely business communication I suppose I ought to begin my reply Dear Madam Your esteemed favor was received on the sixth inst and contents noted but I shall do nothing of the sort I think you must have guessed that I have two girls of my own for you wrote to me just as if we were sitting together side by side like two friends not a bit as landlord and tenant Mother Carey s eyes twinkled She well knew Nancy s informal epistolary style and her facile instantaneous friendliness Every word in your letter interested me pleased me touched me I feel that I know you all from the dear mother who sits in the centre What does he mean by that I sent him a snap shot of the family Nancy What for So that he could see what we were like so that he d know we were fit to be lifelong tenants missus Carey turned resignedly to the letter again From the dear mother who sits in the centre to the lovable little Peter who looks as if he were all that you describe him I was about his age when I went to the Yellow House to spend a few years Old Granny Hamilton had lived there all her life and when my mother who was a widow was seized with a serious illness she took me home with her for a long visit She was never well enough to go away so my early childhood was passed in Beulah and I only left the village when I was ten years old and an orphan Oh dear interpolated Nancy It seems lately as if nobody had both father and mother Granny Hamilton died soon after my mother and I hardly know who lived in the house for the next thirty years It was my brother s property and a succession of families occupied it until it fell to me in my turn I have no happy memories connected with it so you can go ahead and make them for yourselves My only remembrance is of the west bedroom where my mother lived and died The west bedroom that isn t the painted one no of course it is the one where I sleep said missus Carey The painted one must always have been the guest chamber She could only move from bed to chair and her greatest pleasure was to sit by the sunset window and look at the daisies and buttercups waving in that beautiful sloping stretch of field with the pine woods beyond After the grass was mown and that field was always left till the last for her sake she used to sit there and wait for Queen Anne s lace to come up its tall stems and delicate white wheels nodding among the grasses Oh I do like him exclaimed Nancy impetuously Can t you see him mother It s so nice of him to remember that they always mowed the hayfield last for his mother s sake and so nice of him to think of Queen Anne s lace all these years Now as to business your Cousin Ann is quite right when she tells you that you ought not to put expensive improvements on another person s property lest you be disturbed in your tenancy That sort of cousin is always right whatever she says Mine was not named Ann she was Emma but the principle is the same Nancy asked missus Carey looking away from the letter again did you say anything about your Cousin Ann Yes some little thing or other for it was her money that we couldn t spend until we knew we could stay in the house I didn t describe her of course to mister Hamilton I just told him she was very businesslike and yes I remember now I told him you said she was a very fine person that s about all But you see how clever he is he just has instinks as mister Popham says and you don t have to tell him much about anything If you are intending to bring the water from the well into the house and put a large stove in the cellar to warm some of the upper rooms if you are papering and painting inside and keeping the place in good condition you are preserving my property and even adding to its value so under the circumstances I could not think of accepting any rent in money No rent Not even the sixty dollars exclaimed Nancy Look that is precisely what he says There never was such a dear since the world began cried Nancy joyously Oh do read on there s a lot more and the last may contradict the first Shall I tell you what more the Careys may do for me they who have done so much already So much quoted Nancy with dramatic emphasis Oh he is a dear My son Tom when he went down to Beulah before starting for China visited the house and at my request put away my mother s picture safely He is a clever boy and instead of placing the thing in an attic where it might be injured he tucked it away where do you think in the old brick oven of the room that is now I suppose your dining room It is a capital hiding place for there had been no fire there for fifty years nor ever will be again I have other portraits of her with me on this side of the water Please remove the one I speak of from its wrappings and hang it over the mantel shelf in the west bedroom My bedroom I shall love to have it there said Mother Carey Then once a year on my mother s birthday it is the fourth of July and an easy date to remember will my little friend Miss Nancy or any of the other Careys if she is absent pick a little nosegay of daisies and buttercups perhaps there will even be a bit of early Queen Anne s lace and put it in a vase under my mother s picture That shall be the annual rent paid for the Yellow House to Lemuel Hamilton by the Careys Tears of joy sprang to the eyes of emotional Nancy She rose to her feet and paced the greensward excitedly Oh mother I didn t think there could be another such man after knowing father and the Admiral Isn t it all as wonderful as a fairy story There s a little more listen dear As to the term of your occupancy the Careys may have the Yellow House until the day of my death unless by some extraordinary chance my son Tom should ever want it as a summer home Oh dear there comes the dreadful unless My son Tom is our only enemy then said Nancy darkly He is in China at all events her mother remarked cheerfully Tom is the only one who ever had a bit of sentiment about Beulah and he was always unwilling that the old place should be occupied by strangers The curious thing about the matter is that you and yours do not seem to be strangers to me and mine Do you know dear little Miss Nancy what brought the tears to my eyes in your letter The incident of your father s asking what you could do to thank the Yellow House for the happy hour it had given you on that summer day long ago and the planting of the crimson rambler by the side of the portico I have sent your picture tying up the rose and it was so charming I was loath to let it go with your letter and the snap shot of the family group all out to my son Tom in China He will know then why I have let the house to whom and all the attendant circumstances Trust him never to disturb you when he sees how you love the old place The planting of that crimson rambler will fix Tom for he s a romantic boy The planting of the rose was a heavenly inspiration if it does fix Tom We ll call Tom the Chinese Enemy No we ll call him the Yellow Peril laughed Nancy in triumph I am delighted with the sample of paper you have chosen for the front hall I don t see why you didn t go over to Germany yourself Nancy and take a trunk of samples cried missus Carey wiping the tears of merriment from her eyes I can t think what the postage on your letter must have been Ten cents Nancy confessed but wasn t it worth it Muddy Come read the last few lines and then we ll run all the way home to tell the others Send me anything more at any time to give me an idea of the delightful things you are doing I shall be proud if you honor me with an occasional letter Pray give my regards to your mother whom I envy and all the stormy petrels whom I envy too Believe me dear Miss Nancy Yours sincerely LEMUEL HAMILTON I can t remember why I told him about Mother Carey s chickens said Nancy reflectively It just seemed to come in naturally The Yellow Peril must be rather nice as well as his father even if he is our enemy That was clever of him putting his grandmother in the brick oven And here Nancy laughed and laughed again thinking how her last remark would sound if overheard by a person unacquainted with the circumstances A delightful warm kind friendly letter said Mother Carey folding it with a caressing hand I wish your father could have read it He doesn t say a word about his children and Nancy took the sheets and scanned them again You evidently gave him the history of your whole family but he confines himself to his own life He mentions my son Tom frequently enough but there s not a word of missus Hamilton No but there s no reason there should be especially If he loved her he couldn t keep her out said Nancy shrewdly She just isn t in the story at all Could any of us write a chronicle of any house we ever lived in and leave you out missus Carey took Nancy s outstretched hands and was pulled up from the greensward You have a few instinks yourself little daughter she said with a swift pat on the rosy cheek Now Peter put your marbles in the pocket of your blue jeans and take the milk pail from under the bushes we must hurry or there ll be no chowder As they neared Garden Fore and Aft the group of children rushed out to meet them Kitty in advance The fish man didn t come she said and it s long past his time so there s no hope but Julia and I have the dinner all planned There wasn t enough of it to go round anyway so we ve asked Olive and Cyril to stay and we ve set the table under the great maple do you care Not a bit we ll have a real jollification because Nancy has some good news to tell you The dinner isn t quite appropriate for a jollification Kitty observed anxiously Is the news good enough to warrant opening a jar or a can of anything Open all that doth hap to be closed cried Nancy embracing Olive excitedly Light the bonfires on the encroaching hills Set casks a tilt and so forth It s the German letter said Gilbert at a venture What is the dinner Kitty Mother Carey asked New potatoes and string beans from the aft garden Stale bread made into milk toast to be served as a course Then not that it has anything to do with the case but just to give a style to the meal Julia has made a salad out of the newspaper Nancy created a diversion by swooning on the grass a feat which had given her great fame in charades It was only the memory of Julia s last newspaper salad she murmured when the usual restoratives had been applied Prithee poppet what hast dropped into the dish to day Julia was laughing too much to be wholly intelligible but read from a scrap in her apron pocket Any fruit in season cold beans or peas minced cucumber English walnuts a few cubes of cold meat left from dinner hard boiled eggs in slices flecks of ripe tomatoes and radishes to perfect the color scheme a dash of onion juice dash of paprika dash of rich cream I have left out the okra the shallot the estragon the tarragon the endive the hearts of artichoke the Hungarian peppers and the haricot beans because we hadn t any do you think it will make any difference Aunt Margaret It will said Nancy oracularly but all to the good Rather a dull salad I call it commented Gilbert Lacks the snap of the last one No mention of boned sprats or snails in aspic calves foot jelly iced humming birds pickled edelweiss or any of those things kept habitually in the cellars of families like ours No dash of Jamaica ginger or Pain killer or sloe gin or sarsaparilla to give it piquancy Unless Julia can find a paper that gives more up to date advice to its country subscribers we ll have to transfer her from the kitchen department to the woodshed Julia s whole attitude during this discussion of her recent culinary experiments was indicative of the change that was slowly taking place in her point of view The Careys had a large sense of humor from mother down as far as Peter who was still in the tadpole stage of it They chaffed one another on all occasions for the most part courteously and with entire good nature Leigh Hunt speaks of the anxiety of certain persons to keep their minds quiet lest any motion be clumsy and Julia s concern had been of this variety but four or five months spent in a household where mental operations if not deep were incredibly quick had made her a little more elastic Mother Carey had always said that if Julia had any sense of humor she would discover for herself what a solemn prig she was and mend her ways and it seemed as if this might be true in course of time What ll we do with all the milk now demanded Peter who had carried it all the way from the Pophams and to whom it appeared therefore of exaggerated importance Angel boy cried Nancy embracing him The only practical member of the family What wouldst thou suggest Drink it was the terse reply And so t shall be my liege Fetch the beaker lackey identifying Cyril with a royal gesture Also crystal water from the well which by the command of our Cousin Ann will speedily flow in a pipe within the castle walls There are healths to be drunk this day when we assemble under the Hamilton maple and first and most loyally the health of our American Consul at Breslau Germany XXV FOLLOWING THE GLEAM If the summer months had brought many changes to the dwellers in the Yellow House and the House of Lords the autumn was responsible for many more Cousin Ann s improvements were set in motion and were promised to be in full force before cold weather set in and the fall term at Beulah Academy had opened with six new unexpected and interesting students Happily for the Careys and happily for Beulah the old principal a faithful but uninspired teacher had been called to Massachusetts to fill a higher position and only a few days before the beginning of the term a young college man Ralph Thurston fresh from Bowdoin and needing experience applied for and received the appointment The thrill of rapture that ran like an electric current through the persons of the feminine students when they beheld Ralph Thurston for the first time dignified scholarly unmistakably the gentleman beheld him mount the platform in the assembly room and knew him for their own this can better be imagined than described He was handsome he was young he had enough hair which their principals seldom had possessed he did not wear spectacles he had a pleasing voice and a manner of speaking that sent tremors of delight up and down a thirteen year old spine He had a merry wit and a hearty laugh but one had only to look at him closely to feel that he had borne burdens and that his attainments had been bought with a price He was going to be difficult to please and the girls of all ages drew deep breaths of anticipation and knew that they should study as never before The vice principal a lady of fine attainments was temporarily in eclipse and such an astounding love for the classics swept through young Beulah that nobody could understand it Ralph Thurston taught Latin and Greek himself but parents did not at first observe the mysterious connection between cause and effect It was all very young and artless and innocent helpful and stimulating too for Thurston was no budding ladies man but a thoroughly good fellow manly enough to attract the boys and hold their interest The entrance of the four Careys and two Lords into the list of students had an inspiring effect upon the whole school So far as scholarship was concerned they were often outstripped by their country neighbors but the Careys had seen so much of the world that they had a great deal of general culture and the academy atmosphere was affected by it Olive Nancy and Gilbert went into the highest class Kathleen Julia and Cyril into the one below The intimacy of Nancy and Olive was a romantic and ardent one Olive had never had a real companion in her life Nancy s friends dotted the universe wherever she had chanced to live Olive was uncommunicative shy and stiff with all but a chosen few Nancy was at ease in all assemblies It was Nancy s sympathy and enthusiasm and warmth that attracted Olive Lord and it was the combination of Olive s genius and her need of love that held Nancy Never were two human creatures more unlike in their ways of thought Olive had lived in Beulah seven years and knew scarcely any one because of her father s eccentricities and his indifference to the world but had you immured Nancy in a convent she would have made a large circle of acquaintances from the window of her cell before a month passed over her head She had an ardent interest in her fellow creatures and whenever they strayed from the strict path of rectitude she was consumed with a desire to set them straight If Olive had seen a drunken man lying in a ditch she would scarcely have looked at him much less inquired his name Nancy would have sat by until he recovered himself if possible or found somebody to take him to his destination As for the delightful opportunity of persuading him of his folly she would have jumped at the chance when she was fifteen or sixteen but as she grew older she observed a little more reticence in these delicate matters at least when she was endeavoring to reform her elders She had succeeded in making young Nat Harmon stop cigarette smoking but he was privately less convinced of the error of his ways than he was bewitched by Nancy She promised readily to wear a blue ribbon and sit on the platform in the Baptist Chapel at the Annual Meeting of the Junior Temperance League On the eve of the affair she even would gladly have made a speech when the president begged her to do so but the horror stricken Olive succeeded in stopping her and her mother firmly stood by Olive Oh all right I don t care a bit about it Muddy she answered nonchalantly Only there is something splendid about rising from a band of blue ribboned girls and boys and addressing the multitude for a great cause What do you know about this great cause Nancy dear at your age Oh not much but you don t have to know much if you say it loud and clear to the back settees I ve watched how it goes It was thrilling when we gave Esther the Beautiful Queen in the Town Hall when we waved our hands and sang Haman Haman Long live Haman I almost fainted with joy It was very good I liked it too but perhaps if you faint with joy whenever your feet touch a platform it will be more prudent for you to keep away and Mother Carey laughed Very well madam your will is my law When you see the youth of Beulah treading the broad road that leadeth to destruction and looking on the wine when it is red in the cup remember that you withheld my hand and voice Gilbert and Cyril were much together particularly after Cyril s standing had been increased in Beulah by the news that mister Thurston thought him a remarkable mathematician and perhaps the leading student in his class Cyril himself too pale for a country boy of fourteen narrow shouldered silent and timid took this unexpected fame with absolute terror but Olive s pride delighted in it and she positively bloomed in the knowledge that her brother was appreciated She herself secretly thought books were rather a mistake when paints and brushes were at hand and it was no wonder that she did not take high rank seeing that she painted an hour before school and all day Saturday alternating her work on the guest chamber of the Yellow House with her portrait of Nancy for Mother Carey s Christmas present Kathleen and Julia had fallen into step and were good companions Kathleen had never forgotten her own breach of good manners and family loyalty Julia always remembered the passion of remorse that Kathleen felt a remorse that had colored her conduct to Julia ever since Julia was a good plodder and mister Thurston complimented her on the excellence of her Latin recitations when he had his wits about him and could remember that she existed He never had any difficulty in remembering Nancy She was not it must be confessed especially admirable as a verbatim et literatim reciter Sometimes she forgot entirely what the book had said on a certain topic but she usually had some original observation of her own to offer by way of compromise At first mister Thurston thought that she was trying to conceal her lack of real knowledge and dazzle her instructor at the same time so that he should never discover her ignorance Later on he found where her weakness and her strength lay She adapted invented modified things naturally embroidered all over her task so to speak and delivered it in somewhat different shape from the other girls When she was twelve she pricked her finger in sewing and made a blood stain on the little white mull apron that she was making The stuff was so delicate that she did not dare to attempt any cleansing process and she was in a great hurry too so she embroidered a green four leaf clover over the bloodstain and all the family exclaimed How like Nancy Grammar teased Nancy algebra and geometry routed her horse foot and dragoons No room for embroidery there Languages delighted her map drawing bored her and composition intoxicated her although she was better at improvising than at the real task of setting down her thoughts in black and white The class chronicles and prophecies and songs and poems would flow to her inevitably but Kathleen would be the one who would give new grace and charm to them if she were to read them to an audience How Beulah Academy beamed and applauded and wagged its head in pride on a certain day before Thanksgiving when there were exercises in the assembly room Olive had drawn The Landing of the Pilgrims on the largest of the blackboards and Nancy had written a merry little story that caused great laughter and applause in the youthful audience Gilbert had taken part in a debate and covered himself with glory and Kathleen closed the impromptu programme by reciting Tennyson s O young Mariner You from the haven Under the sea cliff You that are watching The gray Magician With eyes of wonder follow the Gleam Great the Master And sweet the Magic When over the valley In early summers Over the mountain On human faces And all around me Moving to melody Floated the Gleam O young Mariner Down to the haven Call your companion Launch your vessel And crowd your canvas And ere it vanishes Over the margin After it follow it Follow the Gleam Kathleen s last year s brown velveteen disclosed bronze slippers and stockings a novelty in Beulah her hair fell in such curls as Beulah had rarely beheld and her voice was as sweet as a thrush s note so perhaps it is not strange that the poem set a kind of fashion at the academy and following the gleam became a sort of text by which to study and grow and live Thanksgiving Day approached and everybody was praying for a flurry of snow just enough to give a zest to turkey and cranberry sauce On the twentieth it suddenly occurred to Mother Carey that this typical New England feast day would be just the proper time for the housewarming so the Lord children the Pophams and the Harmons were all bidden to come at seven o clock in the evening Great preparations ensued Rows of Jack o Lanterns decorated the piazza and the Careys had fewer pumpkin pies in November than their neighbors in consequence of their extravagant inroads upon the golden treasures of the aft garden Inside were a few late asters and branches of evergreen and the illumination suggested that somebody had been lending additional lamps and candles for the occasion The original equipment of clothes possessed by the Careys on their arrival in Beulah still held good and looked well by lamplight so that the toilettes were fully worthy of so important a function Olive s picture of Nancy was finished and she announced the absolute impossibility of keeping it until Christmas so it reached the Yellow House on Thanksgiving morning When it was unwrapped by Nancy and displayed for the first time to the family Mother Carey s lips parted her eyes opened in wonder but no words came for an instant in the bewilderment of her mind Olive had written the title Young April under the picture Nancy stood on a bit of dandelion dotted turf a budding tree in the background her arm flung over the neck of a Jersey calf The calf had sat for his portrait long before but Nancy had been added since May Olive by a clever inspiration had turned Nancy s face away and painted her with the April breeze blowing her hair across her cheek She was not good at painting features her art was too crude but somehow the real thing was there and the likeness to Nancy in figure pose and hair was so unmistakable that her mother caught her breath As for the calf he at least was distinctly in Olive s line and he was painted with a touch of genius It is better of the calf than it is of you Nancy said Gilbert critically Isn t mister Bossy lovely his sister responded amiably Wouldn t he put any professional beauty out of countenance I am proud to be painted beside him Do you like it Muddy dear Like it she exclaimed it is wonderful It must be sent to Boston for criticism and we must invent some way of persuading mister Lord to give Olive the best instruction to be had This picture is even better than anything she has done in the painted chamber I shouldn t wonder a bit Nancy if little Beulah were to be very proud of Olive in the years to come Nancy was transported at her mother s praise I felt it I knew it I always said Olive was a genius she cried clapping her hands Olive is following the gleam Can t you feel the wind blowing my hair and dress Don t you see that the calf is chewing his cud and is going to move in just a minute Olive s animals are always just going to move Oh Muddy dear when you see Olive nowadays smiling and busy and happy aren t you glad you stretched your wings and took her under them with the rest of us And don t you think you could make a new beast out of mister Henry Lord or is he too old a beast even for Mother Carey XXVI A ZOOLOGICAL FATHER That was just what Mother Carey was wondering when Nancy spoke and as the result of several hours reflection she went out for a walk just before dusk and made her way towards The Cedars with a package under her cloak She followed the long lane that led to the house and knocked at the front door rather timidly In her own good time missus Bangs answered the knock and admitted missus Carey into the dreariest sitting room she had ever entered I am missus Carey from the Hamilton house she said to missus Bangs Will you ask mister Lord if he will see me for a moment missus Bangs was stupefied at the request for in her time scarcely a single caller from the village had crossed the threshold although there had been occasional visitors from Portland or Boston missus Carey waited a few moments silently regarding the unequalled bareness ugliness and cheerlessness of the room Olive has a sense of beauty she thought and Olive is sixteen it is Olive who ought to make this place different from what it is and she can unless her father is the stumbling block in the way At this moment the possible stumbling block Henry Lord Ph D came in and greeted her civilly His manner was never genial for there was neither love in his heart nor warm blood in his veins but he was courteous for he was an educated fossil of good birth and up bringing He had been dissecting specimens in his workroom and he looked capable of dismembering Mother Carey but bless your heart she had weapons in her unseen armory that were capable of bringing confusion to his paltry apparatus among others a delicate slender little sword that pierced deep on occasion Henry Lord was of medium height spare clean shaven thin lipped with scanty auburn hair high forehead and small keen eyes especially adapted to the microscope though ill fitted to use in friendly conversation We are neighbors Professor Lord though we have never met said missus Carey rising and giving him her hand My children know you better than I he answered and I feel it very kind in you to allow them to call on you so frequently They had lived at the Yellow House for four months save at meal times but as their father was unaware of the number and extent of their visits missus Carey thought it useless to speak of them so she merely said It is a great pleasure to have them with us My children have left many friends behind them in Massachusetts and elsewhere and might have been lonely in Beulah besides I often think the larger the group within certain limits the better chance children have of learning how to live I should certainly not have permitted Olive and Cyril to attend the local academy but for your family said Professor Lord These country schools never have any atmosphere of true scholarliness and the speech and manners of both teachers and pupils are execrable I dare say that is often the case If the academies could furnish such teachers as existed fifty years ago and alas if we parents could furnish such vigorous determined ambitious self denying pupils as used to be sent out from country homes we should have less to complain of Of course we are peculiarly fortunate here in Beulah mister Lord looked faintly amused and infinitely superior I am afraid my dear lady he remarked that you have not had long enough experience to comprehend the slenderness of mister Philpot s mental equipment Oh mister Philpot resigned nearly three months ago said missus Carey easily giving Henry Lord Ph D her first stab and a look of amusement on her own behalf Ralph Thurston the present principal is a fine unusual fellow Really The children have never mentioned any change but I regret to say I am absent minded at meals The death of my wife left many gaps in the life of the household So that you have to be mother and father in one Stab two very delicately delivered I fear I am too much of a student to be called a good family man So I gathered Stab three She wanted to provoke curiosity mister Lord looked annoyed He knew his unpopularity and did not wish any village gossip to reach the ears of strangers You my dear madam are capable of appreciating my devotion to my life work which the neighbors naturally wholly misunderstand he said I gathered nothing from the neighbors responded missus Carey but a woman has only to know children well to see at a glance what they need You are so absorbed in authorship just now that naturally it is a little hard for the young people but I suppose there are breathing places between books There are no breathing places between mine there will be six volumes and I am scarcely half through the third although I have given seven years to the work Still I have an excellent housekeeper who attends to all our simple needs My children are not fitted for society No not quite Stab four That is the reason they ought to see a good deal of it but they are very fine children and very clever I am glad you think so but they certainly write bad English and have no general knowledge whatsoever Oh well that will come doubtless when you have more time with them Stab five I often think such mysterious things as good speech and culture can never be learned in school I shouldn t wonder if that were our department doctor Lord Stab six However you will agree modest parent as you are that your Olive is a genius I have never observed it replied her father I cannot of course allow her to practice on any musical instrument because my studies demand quiet but I don t think she cares for music She draws and paints however in the most astonishing way and she has a passionate energy and concentration and devotion to her work that I have never seen coupled with anything but an extraordinary talent She is destined to go very far in my opinion Not too far I hope remarked mister Lord with an icy smile Olive can paint on plush and china as much as she likes but I am not partial to careers for young women Nor am I save when the gift is so commanding so obvious that it has to be reckoned with but I must not delay my business any longer nor keep you from your work We are having a housewarming this evening at seven Olive and Cyril are there now helping in the preparations and I want to know if they may stay to supper and if you can send for them at half past nine or ten Certainly they may stay though I should think your supper table could hardly stand the strain Where there are five already two more make no difference save in better appetite for all said Mother Carey smiling and rising If you will allow me to get my hat and coat I will accompany you to the main road said mister Lord going to the front hall and then opening the door for missus Carey Let me take your parcel please He did not know in the least why he said it and why he did it The lady had interfered with his family affairs to a considerable extent and had made several remarks that would have appeared impertinent had they not issued from a very winsome beautiful mouth missus Ossian Popham or missus Bill Harmon would have been shown the door for saying less yet here was Henry Lord Ph D ambling down the lane by Mother Carey s side thinking to himself what a burden she lifted from his shoulders by her unaccountable interest in his unattractive children He was also thinking how springy was the lady s step in her short black dress how brilliant the chestnut hair looked under the black felt hat and how white the skin gleamed above the glossy lynx boa A kind of mucilaginous fluid ran in his veins instead of blood but Henry Lord Ph D had his assailable side nevertheless and he felt extraordinarily good natured almost as if the third volume were finished with public and publishers clamoring for its appearance I don t know where Olive could have got any such talent as you describe he said as they were walking along the lane She had some lessons long ago I remember and her mother used to talk of her amusing herself with pencil and paint but I have heard nothing of it for years Ask to see her sketches when you are talking with her about her work some day suggested Mother Carey Stab seven As a matter of fact she probably gets her talent from you From me Printed letters fail to register the amazement in Professor Lord s tone Why not when you consider her specialty What specialty Really a slender sword was of no use with this man a bludgeon was the only instrument yet it might wound and she only wanted to prick Had the creature never seen Olive sketching nor noted her choice of subjects She paints animals paints nothing else if she can help it though she does fairly well with other things Is it impossible that your study of zoology your thought your absorption for years and years in the classification the structure the habits of animals may have been stamped on your child s mind She has an ardor equal to your own only showing itself in a different manner You may have passed on in some mysterious way your knowledge to Olive She may have unconsciously blended it with some instinct for expression of her own and it comes out in pictures Look at this Professor Lord Olive gave it to me to day They stood together at the gate leading out into the road and missus Carey unwrapped the painting and poised it against the top of the gate Olive s father looked at it for a moment and then said I am no judge of these things technically or otherwise but it certainly seems very creditable work for a girl of Olive s age Oh it is surely more than that My girl Nancy stands there in the flesh though her face is hidden Look at the wind blowing look at the delightful the enchanting calf above all look at the title Who in the world but a little genius could have composed that sketch breathing youth in every inch of it and called it Young April Oh Professor Lord I am very bold because your wife is not living and it is women who oftenest see these budding tendencies in children forgive me but do cherish and develop this talent of Olive s The eyes the color of the blue velvet bonnet were turned full upon Henry Lord Ph D They swam in tears and the color came and went in her cheek she was forty but it was a lovely cheek still I will think it over he replied with some embarrassment as he wrapped the picture again and handed it to her Meantime I am certainly very much obliged to you You seem to have an uncommon knowledge of young people May I ask if you are or have been a teacher Oh no missus Carey remarked with a smile I am just a mother that s all Good night XXVII THE CAREY HOUSEWARMING The housewarming was at its height and everybody agreed once in every ten minutes that it was probably the most beautiful party that had ever happened in the history of the world Water flowed freely through Cousin Ann s expensive pipes that had been buried so deep in their trenches that the winter frosts could not affect them Natty Harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might give out at any moment The stove in the cellar always alluded to by Gilbert as the young furnace had not yet been used save by way of experiment but it was believed to be a perfect success To night there was no need of extra heat and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones They began with the one in the family sitting room Colonel Wheeler Ralph Thurston mister and missus Bill Harmon with Natty and Rufus mister and missus Popham with Digby and Lallie Joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events Mother Carey sat by the fireplace little Peter fairly radiant with excitement leaning against her knee and waiting for his own great moment now close at hand When ye come into a house salute it and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it To all those who may dwell therein from generation to generation may it be a house of God a gate of heaven For every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is God seeing that he giveth to every one of us life and breath and all good things Mother Carey spoke these words so simply and naturally as she looked towards her neighbors one after another with her hand resting on Peter s curly head that they hardly knew whether to keep quiet or say Amen Was that the Bible Osh whispered Bill Harmon Don t know most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me In the hush that followed Mother Carey s salutation Gilbert approached with a basket over his arm and quickly and neatly laid a little fire behind the brass andirons on the hearth Then Nancy handed Peter a loosely bound sheaf saying To light this fire I give you a torch In it are herbs of the field for health of the body a fern leaf for grace a sprig of elm for peace one of oak for strength with evergreen to show that we live forever in the deeds we have done To these we have added rosemary for remembrance and pansies for thoughts Peter crouched on the hearth and lighted the fire in three places then handed the torch to Kathleen as he crept again into his mother s lap awed into complete silence by the influence of his own mystic rite Kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night Burn fire burn Flicker flicker flame Whose hand above this blaze is lifted Shall be with touch of magic gifted To warm the hearts of chilly mortals Who stand without these open portals The touch shall draw them to this fire Nigher nigher By desire Whoso shall stand on this hearth stone Flame fanned Shall never never stand alone Whose home is dark and drear and old Whose hearth is cold This is his own Flicker flicker flicker flame Burn fire burn one Footnote one Florence Converse Next came Olive s turn to help in the ceremonies Ralph Thurston had found a line of Latin for them in his beloved Horace Tibi splendet focus For you the hearth fire shines Olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas and giving it to mister Popham stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it The family had feared that he would tell a good story when he found himself the centre of attraction but he was as dumb as Peter and for the same reason Olive has another lovely gift for the Yellow House said Mother Carey rising and to carry out the next part of the programme we shall have to go in procession upstairs to my bedroom Guess there wan t many idees to give round to other folks after the Lord made her exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall Gilbert at the head of the procession held Mother Hamilton s picture which had been taken from the old brick oven where my son Tom had hidden it Mother Carey s bedroom with its bouquets of field flowers on the wall paper was gaily lighted and ready to receive the gift Nancy stood on a chair and hung the portrait over the fireplace saying We place this picture here in memory of Agatha mother of Lemuel Hamilton owner of the Yellow House Underneath it we lay a posy of pressed daisies buttercups and Queen Anne s lace the wild flowers she loved best Now Olive took away a green garland covering the words Mater Cara that she had painted in brown letters just over the bricks of the fireplace The letters were in old English text and a riot of buttercups and grasses twined their way amongst them Mater Cara stands for mother dear said Nancy and thus this room will be full of memories of two dear mothers an absent and a present one Then Kathleen and Gilbert and Julia Mother Carey and Peter bowed their heads and said in chorus O Thou who dwellest in so many homes possess thyself of this Thou who settest the solitary in families bless the life that is sheltered here Grant that trust and peace and comfort may abide within and that love and light and usefulness may go out from this house forever Amen There was a moment s silence and then all the party descended the stairs to the dining room Ain t they the greatest murmured Lallie Joy turning to her father but he had disappeared from the group The dining room was a blaze of glory and great merriment ensued as they took their places at the table Mother Carey poured coffee Nancy chocolate and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake doughnuts and tarts Where is mister Popham asked Nancy at the foot of the table We cannot be happy without mister Popham At that moment the gentleman entered bearing a huge object concealed by a piece of green felt Approaching the dining table he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth It was the Dirty Boy carefully mended The guests naturally had no associations with the Carey Curse and the Careys themselves were dumb with amazement and despair I ve seen this thing layin in the barn chamber in a thousand pieces all summer explained mister Popham radiantly It wan t none o my business if the family throwed it away thinkin it wan t no more good Thinks I to myself I never seen anything Osh Popham couldn t mend if he took time enough and glue enough so I carried this little feller home in a bushel basket one night last month an I ve spent eleven evenin s puttin him together I don t claim he s good s new cause he ain t but he s consid able better n he was when I found him layin in the barn chamber Thank you mister Popham said missus Carey her eyes twinkling as she looked at the laughing children It was kind of you to spend so much time in our behalf Well I says to myself there s nothin too good for em an when it comes Thanksgivin I ll give em one thing more to be thankful for Quit talkin Pop will yer whispered Digby nudging his father You ve kep us from startin to eat bout five minutes a ready an I m as holler as a horn It was as cheery gay festive neighborly and friendly a supper as ever took place in the dining room of the Yellow House although Governor Weatherby may have had some handsomer banquets in his time When it was over all made their way into the rosy bowery summer parlor Soon another fire sparkled and snapped on the hearth and there were songs and poems and choruses and Osh Popham s fiddle to say nothing of the supreme event of the evening his rendition of Fly like a youthful hart or roe over the hills where spices grow to Mother Carey s accompaniment He always slipped up his glasses during this performance and closed his eyes but neither grey hairs nor specs could dim the radiant smile that made him seem about fifteen years old and the junior of both his children missus Harmon thought he sang too much and told her husband privately that if he was a canary bird she should want to keep a table cover over his head most of the time but he was immensely popular with the rest of his audience Last of all the entire company gathered round the old fashioned piano for a parting hymn The face of the mahogany shone with delight and why not when it was doing everything almost everything within the scope of a piano and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions Also what rational family could mourn the loss of an irregularly shaped instrument standing on three legs and played on one corner The tall silver candle sticks gleamed in the firelight the silver dish of polished Baldwins blushed rosier in the glow Mother Carey played the dear old common metre tune and the voices rang out in Whittier s hymn The Careys all sang like thrushes and even Peter holding his hymn book upside down put in little bird notes always on the key whenever he caught a familiar strain Once more the liberal year laughs out O er richer stores than gems or gold Once more with harvest song and shout Is Nature s bloodless triumph told We shut our eyes the flowers bloom on We murmur but the corn ears fill We choose the shadow but the sun That casts it shines behind us still O favors every year made new O gifts with rain and sunshine sent The bounty overruns our due The fulness shames our discontent XXVIII TIBI SPLENDET FOCUS There was one watcher of all this and one listener outside of the Yellow House that none of the party suspected and that was Henry Lord Ph D When he left missus Carey at the gate at five o clock he went back to his own house and ordered his supper to be brought him on a tray in his study He particularly liked this always as it freed him from all responsibility of serving his children and making an occasional remark and as a matter of fact everybody was as pleased as he when he ate alone the occasional meals Olive and Cyril had by themselves being the only ones they ever enjoyed or digested He studied and wrote and consulted heavy tomes and walked up and down the room and pulled out colored plates from portfolios all with great satisfaction until he chanced to look at the clock when it struck ten He had forgotten to send for the children as he had promised Mother Carey He went out into the hall and called missus Bangs in a stentorian voice No answer Irritated as he always was when crossed in the slightest degree he went downstairs and found the kitchen empty Her cub of a nephew has been staying to supper with her guzzling and cramming himself at my expense he thought and now she has walked home with him It s perfect nonsense to go after a girl of sixteen and a boy of thirteen As if they couldn t walk along a country road at ten o clock Still it may look odd if some one doesn t go and I can t lock the house till they come anyway He drew on his great coat put on his cap and started down the lane in no good humor It was a crisp starlight night and the ground was freezing fast He walked along his hands in his pockets his head bent As he went through the gate to the main road he glanced up The Yellow House a third of a mile distant was a blaze of light There must have been a candle or a lamp in every one of its windows he thought The ground rose a little where the house stood and although it could not be seen in summer because of the dense foliage everywhere the trees were nearly bare now My handsome neighbor is extravagant he said to himself with a grim smile Is the illumination for Thanksgiving I wonder Oh no I remember she said the party was in the nature of a housewarming As he went up the pathway he saw that the shades were up and no curtains drawn anywhere The Yellow House had no intention of hiding its lights under bushels that evening of all others besides there were no neighbors within a long distance Standing on the lowest of the governor s circ lar steps he could see the corner where the group stood singing with shining faces Once more the liberal year laughs out O er richer stores than gems or gold Mother Carey s fine head rose nobly from her simple black dress and her throat was as white as the deep lace collar that was her only ornament Nancy he knew by sight and Nancy in a crimson dress was singing her thankful heart out Who was the dark haired girl standing by her side the two with arms round each other s waists his own Olive He had always thought her unattractive but her hair was smoothly braided and her eyes all aglow Cyril stood between Gilbert and Mother Carey Cyril he knew could not carry a tune to save his life but he seemed to be opening his lips and uttering words all the same Where was the timid eye the hangdog look the shrinking manner he so disliked in his son Great Heavens the boy laid his hand on missus Carey s shoulder and beat time there gently with a finger as if a mother s shoulder could be used for any nice necessary sort of purpose If he knocked at the door now he thought he should interrupt the party which was seemingly at its height He Henry Lord Ph D certainly had no intention of going in to join it not with Ossian Popham and Bill Harmon as fellow guests He made his way curiously around the outside of the house looking in at all the windows and by choosing various positions seeing as much as he could of the different rooms Finally he went up on the little back piazza attracted by the firelight in the family sitting room There was a noble fire and once while he was looking Digby Popham stole quietly in braced up the logs with a proprietary air swept up the hearth replaced the brass wire screen and stole out again as quickly as possible so that he might not miss too much of the party They seem to feel pretty much at home thought mister Lord The fire blazed higher and brighter It lighted up certain words painted in dark green and gold on the white panel under the mantelpiece He pressed his face quite close to the window thinking that he must be mistaken in seeing such unconnected letters as T i b i but gradually they looked clearer to him and he read distinctly Tibi splendet focus Somebody knows his Horace thought Henry Lord Ph D as he stumbled off the piazza For you the hearth fire glows I shan t go in not with that crew let them wait and if it gets too late somebody else will walk home with the children For you the hearth fire glows He picked his way along the side of the house to the front every window sending out its candle gleam For you the hearth fire glows From dozens of windows the welcome shone Its gleams and sparkles positively pursued him as he turned his face towards the road and his own dark cheerless house Perhaps he had better on the whole keep one lamp burning in the lower part after this to show that the place was inhabited For you the hearth fire glows He had bricked up the fireplace in his study and put an air tight stove in because it was simply impossible to feed an open fire and write a book at the same time He didn t know that you could write twice as good a book in half the time with an open fire to help you He didn t know any single one of the myriad aids that can come to you from such cheery unexpected sources of grace and inspiration For you the hearth fire glows Would the words never stop ringing in his ears Perhaps after all it would look queer to missus Carey he cared nothing for Popham or Harmon opinion if he left the children to get home by themselves Perhaps FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRE GLOWS Henry Lord Ph D ascended the steps and plied the knocker Digby Popham came out of the parlor and opened the front door Everybody listened to see who was the late comer at the party Will you kindly tell Miss Olive and Master Cyril Lord that their father has called for them mister Lord s cold severe voice sounded clearly in the parlor and every word could be distinctly heard Gilbert and Nancy were standing together and Gilbert whispered instantly to his sister The old beast has actually called for Olive and Cyril Hush Gilly He must be a new beast or he wouldn t have come at all answered Nancy XXIX TH ACTION FINE December January and February passed with a speed that had something of magic in it The Careys had known nothing heretofore of the rigors of a State o Maine winter but as yet they counted it all joy They were young and hearty and merry and the air seemed to give them all new energy Kathleen s delicate throat gave no trouble for the first time in years Nancy s cheeks bloomed more like roses than ever Gilbert growing broader shouldered and deeper chested daily simply revelled in skating and coasting even Julia was forced into an activity wholly alien to her nature because it was impossible for her to keep warm unless she kept busy Mother Carey and Peter used to look from a bedroom window of a clear cold morning and see the gay little procession start for the academy Over the dazzling snow crust Olive and Cyril Lord would be skimming to meet the Careys always at the same point at the same hour There were rough red coats and capes red mittens squirrel caps pulled well down over curly and smooth heads glimpses of red woolen stockings thick shoes with rubbers over them great parcels of books in straps They looked like a flock of cardinal birds Mother Carey thought as the upturned faces all aglow with ruddy color smiled their morning good bye Gilbert had stoked the great stove in the cellar full of hard wood logs before he left and missus Carey and Peter had a busy morning before them with the housework The family had risen at seven Julia had swept and dusted Kathleen had opened the bedroom windows made the washstands tidy filled the water pitchers and changed the towels Gilbert had carried wood and Peter kindlings for the fires that had to be laid on the hearths here and there Mother had cooked the plain breakfast while Nancy put the dining room in order and set the table and at eight o clock when they sat down to plates piled high with slices of brown and white bread to dishes of eggs or picked up cod fish or beans warmed over in the pot with baked potatoes sometimes and sometimes milk toast or Nancy s famous corn muffins no family of young bears ever displayed such appetites On Saturday mornings there were griddle cakes and maple syrup from their own trees for Osh Popham had shown them in the spring how to tap their maples and collect the great pails of sap to boil down into syrup Mother Carey and Peter made the beds after the departure of the others for school and it was pretty to see the sturdy Peter bird sometimes in his coat and mittens standing on the easiest side of the beds and helping his mother to spread the blankets and comforters smooth His fat legs carried him up and downstairs a dozen times on errands while his sweet piping voice was lifted in a never ending stream of genial conversation as he told his mother what he had just done what he was doing at the present moment how he was doing it and what he proposed to do in a minute or two Then there was a lull from half past ten to half past eleven shortened sometimes on baking days when the Peter bird had his lessons The old fashioned kitchen was clean and shining by that time The stove glistened and the fire snapped and crackled The sun beamed in at the sink window doing all he could for the climate in the few hours he was permitted to be on duty in a short New England winter day Peter sat on a cricket beside his mother s chair and clasped his Reading without Tears earnestly and rigidly believing it to be the key to the universe Oh what an hour of happiness to Mother Carey when the boy would lift the very copy of his father s face to her own when the well remembered smile and the dear twinkle of the eyes in Peter s face would give her heart a stab of pain that was half joy after all it was so full to the brim of sweet memories In that warm still hour when she was filling the Peter bird s mind and soul with heavenly learning how much she learned herself Love poured from her through voice and lips and eyes and in return she drank it in thirstily from the little creature who sat there at her knee a twig growing just as her bending hand inclined it all the buds of his nature opening out in the mother sunshine that surrounded him Eleven thirty came all too soon Then before long the kettle would begin to sing the potatoes to bubble in the saucepan and Mother Carey s spoon to stir the good things that had long been sizzling quietly in an iron pot Sometimes it was bits of beef sometimes mutton but the result was mostly a toothsome mixture of turnips and carrots and onions in a sea of delicious gravy with surprises of meat here and there to vary any possible monotony Once or twice a week dumplings appeared giving an air of excitement to the meal and there was a delectable poor man s stew learned from missus Popham the ingredients being strips of parsnip potatoes cut in quarters a slice or two of sweet browned pork for a flavor and a quart of rich milk mixed with the parsnip juices into an appetizing sauce The after part of the dinner would be a dish of baked apples with warm gingerbread or sometimes a deep apple pandowdy or the baked Indian pudding that was a syrupy fragrant concoction made of corn meal and butter and molasses baked patiently in the oven for hours Mother had the dishes to wash after she had tucked the Peter bird under the afghan on the sitting room sofa for his daily nap but there was never any grumbling in her heart over the weary days and the unaccustomed tasks she was too busy making things make themselves If only there were a little more money That was her chief anxiety for the unexpected the outside sources of income were growing fewer and in a year s time the little hoard would be woefully small Was she doing all that she could she wondered as her steps flew over the Yellow House from attic to cellar She could play the piano and sing she could speak three languages and read four she had made her curtsy at two foreign courts admiration and love had followed her ever since she could remember and here she was a widow at forty living in a half deserted New England village making parsnip stews for her children s dinner Well it was a time of preparation and its rigors and self denials must be cheer fully faced She ought to be thankful that she was able to get a simple dinner that her children could eat she ought to be thankful that her beef and parsnip stews and cracker puddings and corn bread were being transmuted into blood and brawn and brain tissue to help the world along somewhere a little later She ought to be grateful that it was her blessed fortune to be sending four rosy laughing vigorous young people down the snowy street to the white painted academy that it was her good luck to see four heads bending eagerly over their books around the evening lamp and have them all turn to her for help and encouragement in the hard places Why should she complain so long as the stormy petrels were all working and playing in Mother Carey s water garden where they ought to be gathering strength to fly over or dive under the ice pack and climb Shiny Wall There is never any gate in the wall Tom the Water Baby had found that out for himself so it is only the plucky ones who are able to surmount the thousand difficulties they encounter on their hazardous journey to Peacepool How else if they had not learned themselves could Mother Carey s chickens go out over the seas and show good birds the way home At such moments missus Carey would look at her image in the glass and say No whimpering madam You can t have the joys of motherhood without some of its pangs Think of your blessings and don t be a coward Who sweeps a room as by God s laws Makes that and th action fine Then her eyes would turn from blue velvet to blue steel and strength would flow into her from some divine benignant source and transmute her into father as well as mother Was the hearth fire kindled in the Yellow House sending its glow through the village as well as warming those who sat beside it There were Christmas and New Year s and saint Valentine parties and by that time Bill Harmon saw the woodpile in the Carey shed grow beautifully less He knew the price per cord no man better but he and Osh Popham winked at each other one windy February day and delivered three cords for two knowing that measurement of wood had not been included in Mother Carey s education Natty Harmon and Digby Popham following examples a million per cent better than parental lectures asked one afternoon if they shouldn t saw and chop some big logs for the fireplaces missus Carey looked at them searchingly wondering if they could possibly guess the state of her finances concluded they couldn t and said smilingly Indeed I will gladly let you saw for an hour or two if you ll come and sit by the fire on Saturday night when we are going to play spelling games and have doughnuts and root beer The Widow Berry who kept academy boarders sent in a luscious mince pie now and then and missus Popham and missus Harmon brought dried apples or pumpkins winter beets and Baldwin apples It was little enough they thought when the Yellow House so long vacant was like a beacon light to the dull village sending out its beams on every side She ain t no kind of a manager I m fraid said Bill Harmon I give her bout four quarts and a half of kerosene for a gallon every time she sends her can to be filled but bless you she ain t any the wiser I try to give her as good measure in everything as she gives my children but you can t keep up with her She s like the sun that shines on the just n on the unjust Hen Lord s young ones eat their lunch or their supper there once or twice a week though the old skinflint s got fifty thousand dollars in the bank Never mind Bill said Osh Popham there s goin to be an everlastin evenupness somewheres Probably God A mighty hez his eye on that woman and He ll see her through The young ones are growin up and the teacher at the academy says they beat the devil on book learnin The boy ll make a smart man pretty soon and bring good wages home to his mother The girls are handsome enough to pick up husbands as soon as they ve fully feathered out so it won t be long afore they re all on the up grade I ve set great store by that family from the outset and I m turrible glad they re goin to fix up the house some more when it comes spring I m willin to work cheap for such folks as them You owe em somethin for listenin to you Osh Seems if they moved here jest in time to hear your stories when you d bout tuckered out the rest o the village It s a pity you didn t know a few more stories yourself Bill retorted mister Popham then you d be asked up oftener to put on the back log for em and pop corn and roast apples and pass the evenin I ain t hed sech a gay winter sence I begun settin up with Maria twenty years ago She s kept you settin up ever since Osh chuckled Bill Harmon She has so agreed Osh cheerfully but you ain t hardly the one to twit me of it bein as how you ve never took a long breath yourself sence you was married But you don t ketch me complainin It s a poor rule that won t work both ways Maria hurried me into poppin the question and hurried me into marryin her an she ain t let up on me a minute sence then but she ll railroad me into heaven the same way you see if she don t She ll arrive head o time as usual and stan right there at the bars till she gits Dig n Lallie Joy n me under cover She s a good woman an so s my wife remarked Bill sententiously an Colonel Wheeler says good women are so rigged inside that they can t be agreeable all the time The couple of em are workin their fingers to the bone for the school teacher to day fixin him up for all the world as if he was a bride He s got the women folks o this village kind o mesmerized Thurston has He s a first rate teacher nobody that ain t hed experience in the school room is fitted to jedge jest how good a teacher Ralph Thurston is but I have an I know what I m talkin about I never heard nothin about your teachin school Osh There s a good deal about me you never heard specially about the time afore I come to Beulah cause you ain t a good hearer Bill I taught the most notorious school in Digby once and taught it to a finish I named my boy Digby after that school You see my father an mother was determined to give me an education an I wa n t intended for it I was a great big strong clumsy lunkhead an the only thing I could do even in a one horse college was to play base ball so they kep me along jest for that I never got further than the second class an I wouldn t a got there if the Faculty hadn t a promoted me jest for the looks o the thing Well Prof Millard was off in the country lecturin somewheres near Bangor an he met a school superintendent who told him they was awful hard up for a teacher in Digby He said they d hed three in three weeks an had lost two stoves besides for the boys had fired out the teachers and broke up the stoves an pitched em out the door after em When Prof Millard heard the story he says I ve got a young man that could teach that school a feller named Ossian Popham The superintendent hed an interview with me an I says I ll agree to teach out your nine weeks o school for a hundred dollars an if I leave afore the last day I won t claim a cent That s the right sperit says the Supe an we struck a bargain then an there I was glad it was Saturday so t I could start right off while my blood was up I got to Digby on Sunday an found a good boardin place The trustees didn t examine me an t was lucky for me they didn t The last three teachers hed been splendid scholars but that didn t save the stoves any so they just looked at my six feet o height an the muscle in my arms an said they d drop in sometime durin the month Look in any time you like after the first day I says I shall be turrible busy the first day I went into the school house early Monday mornin an built a good fire in the new stove When it was safe to leave it I went into the next house an watched the scholars arrive The lady was a widder with one great unruly boy in the school an she was glad to give me a winder to look out of It was a turrible cold day an when t was ten minutes to nine an the school room was full I walked in as big as Cuffy There was five rows of big boys an girls in the back all lookin as if they was loaded for bear an they graded down to little ones down in front all of em hitchin to an fro in their seats an snickerin I give em a surprise to begin with for I locked the door when I come in an put the key in my pocket cool as a cucumber I never said a word an they never moved their eyes away from me I took off my fur cap then my mittens then my overcoat an laid em in the chair behind my desk Then my undercoat come off then my necktie an collar an by that time the big girls begun to look nervous they d been used to addressin but not undressin in the school room Then I wound my galluses round my waist an tied em then I says clear an loud I m your new teacher I m goin to have a hundred dollars for teachin out this school an I intend to teach it out an git my money It s five minutes to nine I give you just that long to tell me what you re goin to do about it Come on now I says all o you big boys if you re comin an we ll settle this thing here an now We can t hev fights an lessons mixed up together every day more n s necessary better decide right now who s boss o this school The stove s new an I m new an we call ate to stay here till the end o the term Well sir not one o that gang stirred in their seats an not one of em yipped I taught school in my shirt sleeves consid able the first week but I never hed to afterwards I was a little mite weak on mathematics an the older boys an girls hed to depend on their study books for their information they never got any from me but every scholar in that Digby school got a hundred per cent in deportment the nine weeks I taught there XXX THE INGLENOOK It was a wild Friday night in March after days of blustering storms and drifting snow Beulah was clad in royal ermine not only clad indeed but nearly buried in it The timbers of the Yellow House creaked and the wreaths of snow blew against the windows and lodged there King Frost was abroad nipping toes and ears hanging icicles on the eaves of houses and decorating the forest trees with glittering pendants The wind howled in the sitting room chimney but in front of the great back log the bed of live coals glowed red and the flames danced high casting flickering shadows on the children s faces It is possible to bring up a family by steam heat and it is often necessary but nobody can claim that it is either so simple or so delightful as by an open fire The three cats were all nestled cosily in Nancy s lap or snuggled by her side Mother Carey had demurred at two and when Nancy appeared one day after school with a third she spoke with some firmness of refusing it a home If we must economize on cats cried Nancy passionately don t let s begin on this one She doesn t look it but she is a heroine When the Rideout s house burned down her kittens were in a basket by the kitchen stove Three times she ran in through the flames and brought out a kitten in her mouth The tip of her tail is gone and part of an ear and she s blind in one eye mister Harmon says she s too homely to live now what do you think I think nobody pretending to be a mother could turn her back on another mother like that said missus Carey promptly We ll take a pint more milk and I think you children will have to leave something in your plates now and then you polish them until it really is indecent To night an impromptu meeting of the Ways and Means Committee was taking place by the sitting room fire perhaps because the family plates had been polished to a terrifying degree that week Children said Mother Carey we have been as economical as we knew how to be we have worked to the limit of our strength we have spent almost nothing on clothing but the fact remains that we have scarcely money enough in our reserve fund to last another six months What shall we do Nancy leaped to her feet scattering cats in every direction Mother Carey she exclaimed remorsefully You haven t mentioned money since New Year s and I thought we were rubbing along as usual The bills are all paid what s the matter That is the matter answered missus Carey with the suspicion of a tear in her laughing voice The bills are paid and there s too little left We eat so much and we burn so much wood and so many gallons of oil The back of the winter s broken mother dear said Gilbert as a terrific blast shook the blinds as a terrier would a rat Don t listen to that wind it s only a March bluff Osh Popham says snow is the poor man s manure he says it s going to be an early season and a grand hay crop We ll get fifty dollars for our field That will be in July and this is March said his mother Still the small reversible Van Twiller will carry us through May with our other income But the saving days are over and the earning days have come dears I am the oldest and the biggest I must begin Never cried Nancy You slave enough for us as it is but you shall never slave for anybody else shall she Gilly Not if I know it answered Gilbert with good ringing emphasis Another winter I fear we must close the Yellow House and The rest of Mother Carey s remark was never heard for at Nancy s given signal the four younger Careys all swooned on the floor Nancy had secretly trained Peter so that he was the best swooner of the family and his comical imitation of Nancy was so mirth compelling that Mother Carey laughed and declared there was no such thing as talking seriously to children like hers But Muddy dear you weren t in earnest coaxed Nancy bending her bright head over her mother s shoulder and cuddling up to her side whereupon Gilbert gave his imitation of a jealous puppy barking snarling and pushing his frowzly pate under his mother s arm to crowd Nancy from her point of vantage to which she clung valiantly Of course Kitty found a small vacant space on which she could festoon herself and Peter promptly climbed on his mother s lap so that she was covered with fairly submerged in children A year ago Julia used to creep away and look at such exhibitions of family affection with a curling lip but to night at Mother Carey s outstretched hand and smothered cry of Help Judy she felt herself gathered into the heart of the laughing boisterous group That hand had she but known it was stretched out to her because only that day a letter had come saying that Allan Carey was much worse and that his mental condition admitted of no cure He was bright and hopeful and happy so said mister Manson forever sounding the praises of the labor saving device in which he had sunk his last thousands We can manufacture it at ten cents and sell it for ten dollars he would say rubbing his hands excitedly We can pay fifty dollars a month office rent and do a business of fifty thousand dollars a year And I almost believe we could added mister Manson if we had faith enough and capital enough Of course you know darlings I would never leave Beulah save for the coldest months or only to earn a little money said missus Carey smoothing her dress flattening her collar and pinning up the braids that Nancy s hugs had loosened I must put my mind on the problem at once said Nancy pacing the floor I ve been so interested in my Virgil so wrapped up in my rhetoric and composition that I haven t thought of ways and means for a month but of course we will never leave the Yellow House and of course we must contrive to earn money enough to live in it We must think about it every spare minute till vacation comes then we ll have nearly four months to amass a fortune big enough to carry us through the next year I have an idea for myself already I was going to wait till my seventeenth birthday but that s four months away and it s too long I m old enough to begin any time I feel old enough to write my Reminiscences this minute You might publish your letters to the American Consul in Breslau they d make a book teased Gilbert Very likely I shall silly Gilly retorted Nancy swinging her mane haughtily It isn t every girl who has a monthly letter from an Admiral in China and a Consul in Germany You wouldn t catch me answering the Queen of Sheba s letters or the Empress of India s exclaimed Gilbert whose pen was emphatically less mighty than his sword Hullo you two what are you whispering about he called to Kathleen and Julia who were huddled together in a far corner of the long room gesticulating eloquently We ve an idea We ve an idea We ve found a way to help sang the two girls pirouetting back into the circle of firelight We won t tell till it s all started but it s perfectly splendid and practical too And so ladylike added Julia triumphantly How much asked Gilbert succinctly The girls whispered a minute or two and appeared to be multiplying twenty five first by fifteen and then again by twenty From three dollars and seventy five cents to four dollars and a half a week according to circumstances answered Kathleen proudly Will it take both of you Yes All your time More nods and whispers and calculation No indeed only three hours a day Any of my time Just a little I thought so said Gilbert loftily You always want me and my hammer or my saw but I ll be busy on my own account you ll have to paddle your own canoe You ll be paid for what you do for us said Julia slyly giving Kathleen a poke at which they both fell into laughter only possible to the very young Then suddenly there came a knock at the front door a stamping of feet on the circular steps and a noise of shaking off snow Go to the door Gilbert who can that be on a night like this although it is only eight o clock after all Why it s mister Thurston Ralph Thurston came in blushing and smiling glad to be welcomed fearful of intruding afraid of showing how much he liked to be there Good evening all he said You see I couldn t wait to thank you missus Carey No storm could keep me away to night What has mother been doing now asked Nancy Her right hand is forever busy and she never tells her left hand a thing so we children are always in the dark It was nothing much said missus Carey pushing the young man gently into the high backed rocker missus Harmon missus Popham and I simply tried to show our gratitude to mister Thurston for teaching our troublesome children How did you know it was my birthday asked Thurston Didn t you write the date in Lallie Joy s book True I did and forgot it long ago but I have never had my birthday noticed before and I am twenty four It was high time then said Mother Carey with her bright smile But what did mother do clamored Nancy Kathleen and Gilbert in chorus She took my forlorn cheerless room and made it into a home for me said Thurston Perhaps she wanted me to stay in it a little more and bother her less At any rate she has created an almost possible rival to the Yellow House Ralph Thurston had a large rather dreary room over Bill Harmon s store and took his meals at the Widow Berry s near by He was an orphan and had no money to spend on luxuries because all his earnings went to pay the inevitable debts incurred when a fellow is working his way through college missus Carey with the help of the other two women had seized upon this stormy Friday when the teacher always took his luncheon with him to the academy to convert Ralph s room into something comfortable and cheerful The old cracked air tight stove had been removed and Bill Harmon had contributed a second hand Franklin left with him for a bad debt It was of soapstone and had sliding doors in front so that the blaze could be disclosed when life was very dull or discouraging The straw matting on the floor had done very well in the autumn but missus Carey now covered the centre of the room with a bright red drugget left from the Charlestown house furnishings and hung the two windows with curtains of printed muslin Ossian Popham had taken a clotheshorse and covered it with red felting so that the screen so evolved could be made to hide the bed and washstand Ralph s small rickety table had been changed for a big roomy one of pine hidden by the half of an old crimson piano cloth When Osh had seen the effect of this he hurried back to his barn chamber and returned with some book shelves that he had hastily glued and riveted into shape These he nailed to the wall and filled with books that he found in the closet on the floor on the foot of the bed and standing on the long old fashioned mantel shelf Do you care partic larly where you set nights Ossian inquired missus Popham who was now in a state of uncontrolled energy bordering on delirium Because your rockin chair has a Turkey red cushion and it would look splendid in mister Thurston s room You know you fiddle bout half the time evenin s and you always go to bed early Don t mind me exclaimed Ossian facetiously starting immediately for the required chair and bringing back with it two huge yellow sea shells which he deposited on the floor at each end of the hearth rug How do you like em he inquired of missus Carey Not at all she replied promptly You don t he asked incredulously Well it takes all kinds o folks to make a world I ve been keepin em fifteen years hopin I d get enough more to make a border for our parlor fireplace and now you don t take to em Back they go to the barn chamber Maria Mis Carey s bossin this job and she ain t got no taste for sea shells Would you like an old student lamp I found one that I can bronze up in about two minutes if Mis Harmon can hook a shade and chimbly out of Bill s stock They all stayed in the room until this last feat was accomplished stayed indeed until the fire in the open stove had died down to ruddy coals Then they pulled down the shades lighted the lamp gave one last admiring look and went home It had meant only a few hours thought and labor with scarcely a penny of expense but you can judge what Ralph Thurston felt when he entered the door out of the storm outside To him it looked like a room conjured up by some magician in a fairy tale He fell into the rocking chair and looked at his own fire gazed about at the cheerful crimson glow that radiated from the dazzling drugget in a state of puzzled ecstasy till he caught sight of a card lying near the lamp A birthday present from three mothers who value your work for their boys and girls He knew missus Carey s handwriting so he sped to the Yellow House as soon as his supper was over and now in the presence of the whole family he felt tongue tied and wholly unable to express his gratitude It was bed time and the young people melted away from the fireside Kiss your mother good night sweet Pete said Nancy taking the reluctant cherub by the hand Hoc opus hic labor est mister Thurston to get the Peter bird upstairs when once he is down Shake hands with your future teacher Peter no you mustn t kiss him little boys don t kiss great Latin scholars unless they are asked Thurston laughed and lifted the gurgling Peter high in the air Good night old chap he said Hurry up and come to school I m bout ready now piped Peter I can read Up up my boy day is not the time for sleep the dew will soon be gone with the book upside down can t I Muddy You can my son trot along with sister Thurston opened the door for Nancy and his eye followed her for a second as she mounted the stairs She glowed like a ruby to night in her old red cashmere The sparkle of her eye the gloss of her hair the soft red of her lips the curve and bend of her graceful young body struck even her mother anew though she was used to her daughter s beauty She is growing thought missus Carey wistfully I see it all at once and soon others will be seeing it Alas young Ralph Thurston had seen it for weeks past He was not perhaps so much in love with Nancy the girl as he was with Nancy the potential woman Some of the glamour that surrounded the mother had fallen upon the daughter One felt the influences that had rained upon Nancy ever since she had come into the world One could not look at her nor talk with her without feeling that her mother like a vine in the blood as the old proverb says was breathing growing budding blossoming in her day by day The young teacher came back to the fireplace where Mother Carey was standing in a momentary brown study I ve never had you alone before he stammered and now is my chance to tell you what you ve been to me ever since I came to Beulah You have helped me in my problems more than I can possibly have aided you missus Carey replied quietly Gilbert was so rebellious about country schools so patronizing so scornful of their merits that I fully expected he would never stay at the academy of his own free will You have converted him and I am very grateful Meantime I am making a record there said Ralph and I have this family to thank for it Your children with Olive and Cyril Lord have set the pace for the school and the rest are following to the best of their ability There is not a shirk nor a dunce in the whole roll of sixty pupils Beulah has not been so proud of its academy for thirty years and I shall come in for the chief share in the praise I am trying to do for Gilbert and Cyril what an elder brother would do but I should have been powerless if I had not had this home and this fireside to inspire me Tibi splendet focus quoted missus Carey pointing to Olive s inscription under the mantelpiece For you the hearth fire glows Have I not felt it from the beginning asked Ralph I never knew my mother missus Carey and few women have come into my life I have been too poor and too busy to cultivate their friendship Then I came to Beulah and you drew me into your circle admitted an unknown friendless fellow into your little group It was beautiful it was wonderful What are mothers for but to do just that and more than all for the motherless boys Well I may never again have the courage to say it so just believe me when I say your influence will be the turning point in my life I will never so help me God do anything to make me unworthy to sit in this fireglow So long as I have brains and hands to work with I will keep striving to create another home like this when my time comes Any girl that takes me will get a better husband because of you any children I may be blessed with will have a better father because I have known you Don t make any mistake dear missus Carey your hearth fire glows a long long distance Mother Carey was moved to the very heart She leaned forward and took Ralph Thurston s young face thin with privation and study in her two hands He bent his head instinctively partly to hide the tears that had sprung to his eyes and she kissed his forehead simply and tenderly He was at her knees on the hearth rug in an instant all his boyish affection laid at her feet all his youthful chivalry kindled at the honor of her touch And there are women in the world who do not care about being mothers XXXI GROOVES OF CHANGE The winter passed The snow gradually melted in the meadows and the fields which first grew brown and then displayed patches of green here and there where the sun fell strongest There was deep sticky mud in the roads and the discouraged farmers urged their horses along with the wheels of their wagons sunk to the hub in ooze Then there were wet days the wind ruffling the leaden surface of the river the sound of the rain dripping from the bare tree boughs the smell of the wet grass and the clean thirsty soil Milder weather came then blustery days then chill damp ones but steadily life grew here there everywhere and the ever new miracle of the awakening earth took place once again Sap mounted in the trees blood coursed in the children s veins mothers began giving herb tea and sulphur and molasses young human nature was restless the whole creation throbbed and sighed and was tremulous and had growing pains April passed with all its varying moods of sun and shower and settled weather came All the earth was gay Land and sea Gave themselves up to jollity And with the heart of May Did every Beast keep holiday The Carey girls had never heard of the joy of living as a phrase but oh they knew a deal about it in these first two heavenly springs in little Beulah village The sunrise was so wonderful the trees and grass so marvellously green the wild flowers so beautiful Then the river on clear days the glimpse of the sea from Beulah s hill tops the walks in the pine woods could Paradise show anything to compare And how good the food tasted and the books they read how fresh how moving how glorious Then when the happy day was over sleep came without pause or effort the moment the flushed cheek touched the cool pillow These Nancy reflected quoting from her favorite Wordsworth as she dressed beside her open window These must be The gifts of morn Ere life grows noisy and slower footed thought Can overtake the rapture of the sense I was fifteen and a half last spring and now though it is only a year ago everything is different she mused When did it get to be different I wonder It never was all at once so it must have been a little every day so little that I hardly noticed it until just now A young girl s heart is ever yearning for and trembling at the future In its innocent depths the things that are to be are sometimes rustling and whispering secrets and sometimes keeping an exquisite haunting silence In the midst of the mystery the solemn young creature is sighing to herself What am I meant for Am I everything Am I nothing Must I wait till my future comes to me or must I seek it This was all like the sound of a still small voice in Nancy s mind but it meant that she was growing up taking hold on life at more points than before seeing new visions dreaming new dreams Kathleen and Julia seemed ridiculously young to her She longed to advise them but her sense of humor luckily kept her silent Gilbert appeared crude raw promising but undeveloped she hated to think how much experience he would have to pass through before he could see existence as it really was and as she herself saw it Olive s older view of things her sad strange outlook upon life her dislike of anything in the shape of man her melancholy aversion to her father all this fascinated and puzzled Nancy whose impetuous nature ran out to every living thing revelling in the very act of loving so long as she did not meet rebuff Cyril perplexed her Silent unresponsive shy she would sometimes raise her eyes from her book in school and find him gazing steadily at her like a timid deer drinking thirstily at a spring Nancy did not like Cyril but she pitied him and was as friendly with him in her offhand boyish fashion as she was with every one The last days of the academy term were close at hand and the air was full of graduation exercises and white muslin and ribbon sashes June brought two surprises to the Yellow House One morning Kathleen burst into Nancy s room with the news Nancy The Fergusons offer to adopt Judy and she doesn t want to go Think of that But she s afraid to ask mother if she can stay Let s us do it shall we I will but of course there is not enough money to go around Kitty even if we all succeed in our vacation plans Julia will never have any pretty dresses if she stays with us and she loves pretty dresses Why didn t the Fergusons adopt her before mother had made her over Yes chimed in Kathleen Then everybody would have been glad but now we shall miss her Think of missing Judy We would never have believed it It s like seeing how a book turns out to watch her priggishness and smuggishness all melting away Nancy said I shouldn t like to see her slip back into the old Judyisms and neither would mother Mother ll probably keep her for I know mister Manson thinks it s only a matter of a few months before Uncle Allan dies And mother wouldn t want a Carey to grow up into an imitation Gladys Ferguson but that s what Judy would be in course of time Julia took missus Ferguson s letter herself to her Aunt Margaret showing many signs of perturbation in her usually tranquil face missus Carey read it through carefully It is a very kind generous offer Julia Your father cannot be consulted about it so you must decide You would have every luxury and your life would be full of change and pleasure while with us it must be in the nature of things busy and frugal for a long time to come But I am one more to feed and clothe Aunt Margaret and there is so little money I know but you are one more to help after all The days are soon coming when Nancy and Gilbert will be out in the world helping themselves You and Kathleen could stay with Peter and me awaiting your turn It doesn t look attractive in comparison with what the Fergusons offer you Then the gentle little rivers that had been swelling all the past year in Julia s heart rivers of tenderness and gratitude and sympathy suddenly overflowed their banks and running hither and thither softened everything with which they came in contact Rocky places melted barren spots waked into life and under the impulse of a new mood that she scarcely understood Julia cried Oh dear Aunt Margaret keep me keep me This is home I never want to leave it I want to be one of Mother Carey s chickens The child had flung herself into the arms that never failed anybody and with tears streaming down her cheeks made her plea There there Judy dear you are one of us and we could not let you go unless you were to gain something by it If you really want to stay we shall love you all the better and you will belong to us more than you ever did so dry your eyes or you will be somebody s duckling instead of my chicken The next surprise was a visit from Cousin Ann Chadwick who drove up to the door one morning quite unannounced and asked the driver of the depot wagon to bring over her two trunks immediately Two trunks groaned Gilbert That means the whole season But it meant nothing of the kind it meant pretty white dresses for the three girls two pairs of stockings and two of gloves for the whole family a pattern of black silk for missus Carey and numberless small things to which the Carey wardrobe had long been a stranger Having bestowed these offerings rather grimly as was her wont and having received the family s grateful acknowledgments with her usual lack of grace she proceeded in the course of a few days to make herself far more disagreeable than had been the case on any previous visit of her life She had never seen such dusty roads as in Beulah so many mosquitoes and flies such tough meat such a lack of fruit such talkative over familiar neighbors such a dull minister such an inattentive doctor such extortionate tradesmen What shall we do with Cousin Ann exclaimed missus Carey to Nancy in despair She makes us these generous presents yet she cannot possibly have any affection for us We accept them without any affection for her because we hardly know how to avoid it The whole situation is positively degrading I have borne it for years because she was good to your father when he was a boy but now that she has grown so much more difficult I really think I must talk openly with her She talked openly enough with me when I confessed that Gilbert and I had dropped and broken the Dirty Boy said Nancy and she has been very cross with me ever since Cousin Ann said missus Carey that afternoon on the piazza it is very easy to see that you do not approve of the way we live or the way we think about things in general Feeling as you do I really wish you would not spend your money on us and give us these beautiful and expensive presents It puts me under an obligation that chafes me and makes me unhappy I don t disapprove of you particularly said Miss Chadwick Do I act as if I did Your manner seems to suggest it You can t tell much by manners replied Cousin Ann I think you re entirely too soft and sentimental but we all have our faults I don t think you have any right to feed the neighbors and burn up fuel and oil in their behalf when you haven t got enough for your own family I think you oughtn t to have had four children and having had them you needn t have taken another one in though she s turned out better than I expected But all that is none of my business I suppose and wrong headed as you are I like you better than most folks which isn t saying much But if you don t share my way of thinking why do you keep fretting yourself to come and see us It only annoys you It annoys me but I can t help coming somehow I guess I hate other places and other ways worse than I do yours You don t grudge me bed and board I suppose How could I grudge you anything when you give us so much so much more than we ought to accept so much more than we can ever thank you for I don t want to be thanked you know that well enough but there s so much demonstration in your family you can t understand anybody s keeping themselves exclusive I don t like to fuss over people or have them fuss over me Kissing comes as easy to you as eating but I never could abide it A nasty common habit I call it I want to give what I like and where and when I like and act as I m a mind to afterwards I don t give because I see things are needed but because I can t spend my income unless I do give If I could have my way I d buy you a good house in Buffalo right side of mine take your beggarly little income and manage it for you build a six foot barbed wire fence round the lot so t the neighbors couldn t get in and eat you out of house and home and in a couple of years I could make something out of your family missus Carey put down her sewing leaned her head back against the crimson rambler and laughed till the welkin rang I suppose you think I m crazy Cousin Ann remarked after a moment s pause I don t know Cousin Ann said missus Carey taking up her work again Whatever it is you can t help it If you ll give up trying to understand my point of view I won t meddle with yours I suppose you won t come to Buffalo No indeed thank you Cousin Ann You ll stay here in this benighted village and grow old you that are a handsome woman of forty and might have a millionaire husband to take care of you My husband had money enough to please me and when I meet him again and show him the four children he will be the richest man in Paradise Cousin Ann rose I m going to morrow and I shan t be back this year I ve taken passage on a steamer that s leaving for Liverpool next week Going abroad Alone Cousin Ann No with a party of Cook s tourists What a strange idea exclaimed missus Carey I don t see why most everybody s been abroad I don t expect to like the way they live over there but if other folks can stand it I guess I can It ll amuse me for a spell maybe and if it don t I ve got money enough to break away and do as I m a mind to The last evening was a pleasant friendly one every Carey doing his or her best to avoid risky subjects and to be as agreeable as possible Cousin Ann Chadwick left next day and missus Carey bidding the strange creature good bye was almost sorry that she had ever had any arguments with her It will be so long before I see you again Cousin Ann I was on the point of kissing you till I remembered she said with a smile as she stood at the gate I don t know as I mind for once said Miss Chadwick If anybody s got to kiss me I d rather it would be you than anybody She drove away her two empty trunks in the back of the wagon She sailed for Liverpool the next week and accompanied her chosen party to the cathedral towns of England There in a quiet corner of York Minster as the boy choir was chanting its anthems her heart an organ she had never been conscious of possessing gave one brief sudden physical pang and she passed out of what she had called life Neither her family affairs nor the names of her relations were known and the news of her death did not reach far away Beulah till more than two months afterward and with it came the knowledge that Cousin Ann Chadwick had left the income of five thousand dollars to each of the five Carey children with five thousand to be paid in cash to Mother Carey on the settlement of the estate XXXII DOORS OF DARING Little the Careys suspected how their fortunes were mending during those last days of June Had they known they might almost have been disappointed for the spur of need was already pricking them and their valiant young spirits longed to be in the thick of the fray Plans had been formed for the past week many of them in secret and the very next day after the close of the academy various business projects would burst upon a waiting world One Sunday night Mother Carey had read to the little group a poem in which there was a verse that struck on their ears with a fine spirit And all the bars at which we fret That seem to prison and control Are but the doors of daring set Ajar before the soul They recited it over and over to themselves afterwards and two or three of them wrote it down and pinned it to the wall or tucked it in the frame of the looking glass Olive Lord knocked at her father s study door the morning of the twenty first of June Walking in quietly she said Father yesterday was my seventeenth birthday Mother left me a letter to read on that day telling me that I should have fifty dollars a month of my own when I was seventeen Cyril to have as much when he is the same age If you had waited courteously and patiently for a few days you would have heard this from me her father answered I couldn t be sure Olive replied You never did notice a birthday why should you begin now I have more important matters to take up my mind than the consideration of trivial dates her father answered You know that very well and you know too that notwithstanding my absorbing labors I have endeavored for the last few months to give more of my time to you and Cyril I realize that or I should not speak to you at all said Olive It is because you have shown a little interest in us lately that I consult you I want to go at once to Boston to study painting I will deny myself everything else if necessary but I will go and I will study It is the only life I care for the only life I am likely to have and I am determined to lead it You must see that you are too young to start out for yourself anywhere it is simply impossible I shall not be alone missus Carey will find me a good home in Charlestown with friends of hers You trust her judgment if no one else s If she is charitable enough to conduct your foolish enterprises as well as those of her own children I have nothing to say I have talked with her frequently and she knows that as soon as I have finished my last volume I shall be able to take a more active interest in your affairs and Cyril s Then may I go When I hear from the person in Charlestown yes There is an expedition starting for South America in a few months and I have been asked to accompany the party If you are determined to leave home I shall be free to accept the invitation Perhaps missus Carey would allow Cyril to stay with her during my absence I dare say and I advise you to go to South America by all means you will be no farther away from your family than you have always been With this parting shot Olive Lord closed the study door behind her That girl has the most unpleasant disposition and the sharpest tongue I ever met in the course of my life said Henry Lord to himself as he turned to his task Mother Carey s magic was working very slowly in his blood It had roused him a little from the bottomless pit of his selfishness but much mischief had been done on all sides and it would be a work of time before matters could be materially mended Olive s nature was already warped and embittered and it would require a deal of sunshine to make a plant bloom that had been so dwarfed by neglect and indifference Nancy s door of daring opened into an editorial office An hour here an hour there when the Yellow House was asleep had brought about a story that was on its way to a distant city It was written with incredible care on one side of the paper only it enclosed a fully stamped envelope for a reply or a return of the manuscript and all day long Nancy trembling between hope and despair went about hugging her first secret to her heart Gilbert had opened his own particular door and if it entailed no more daring than that of Nancy s effort it required twice the amount of self sacrifice He was to be from June twenty seventh till August twenty seventh Bill Harmon s post office clerk and delivery boy and the first that the family would know about it would be his arrival at the back door in a linen jacket with an order book in his hand Bravo Gilly One can see your heels disappearing over the top of Shiny Wall The door of daring just ready to be opened by Kathleen and Julia was of a truly dramatic and unexpected character Printed in plain letters twenty five circulars reposed in the folds of Julia s nightdresses in her lower bureau drawer The last thing to be done at night and the first in the morning was the stealthy whispered reading of one of these documents lest even after the hundredth time something wrong should suddenly appear to the eye or ear They were addressed they were stamped and they would be posted to twenty five families in the neighborhood on the closing day of the academy SUMMER VACATION SCHOOL The Misses Kathleen and Julia Carey announce the opening of classes for private instruction on July first from two to four o clock daily in the Hamilton Barn Faculty Miss Kathleen Carey Reading Elocution two P M Miss Julia Carey Dancing Embroidery two thirty P M missus Peter Carey Vocal Music Part Singing three P M Miss Nancy Carey Composition four P M mister Gilbert Carey Wood carving Jig Sawing Manual Training from four to five Fridays only Terms cash twenty five cents a week N B Children prepared for entrance to the academy at special prices Meantime the Honorable Lemuel Hamilton had come to America and was opening doors of daring at such a rate of speed that he hardly realized the extent of his own courage and what it involved He accepted an official position of considerable honor and distinction in Washington rented a house there and cabled his wife and younger daughter to come over in September He wrote his elder daughter that she might go with some friends to Honolulu if she would return for Christmas It s eleven years since we had a Christmas tree he added and the first thing you know we shall have lost the habit To his son Jack in Texas he expressed himself as so encouraged by the last business statement which showed a decided turn for the better that he was willing to add a thousand dollars to the capital and irrigate some more of the unimproved land on the ranch If Jack has really got hold out there he can come home every two or three years he thought Well perhaps I shall succeed in getting part of them together part of the time if I work hard enough all but Tom whom I care most about Now that everything is in train I ll take a little vacation myself and go down to Beulah to make the acquaintance of those Careys If I had ever contemplated returning to America I suppose I shouldn t have allowed them to settle down in the old house still Eleanor would never have been content to pass her summers there so perhaps it is just as well The Peter bird was too young to greatly dare still it ought perhaps to be set down that he sold three dozen marbles and a new kite to Billy Harmon that summer and bought his mother a birthday present with the money All Peter s doors of daring had hitherto opened into places from which he issued weeping with sprained ankles bruised hands skinned knees or burned eyelashes XXXIII MOTHER HAMILTON S BIRTHDAY It was the Fourth of July a hot still day when one could fairly see the green peas swelling in their pods and the string beans climbing their poles like acrobats Young Beulah had rung the church bell at midnight cast its torpedoes to earth in the early morning flung its fire crackers under the horses feet and felt somewhat relieved of its superfluous patriotism by breakfast time Then there was a parade of Antiques and Horribles accompanied by the Beulah Band which though not as antique was fully as horrible as anything in the procession From that time on the day had been somnolent enlivened in the Carey household only by the solemn rite of paying the annual rent of the Yellow House The votive nosegay had been carefully made up and laid lovingly by Nancy under Mother Hamilton s portrait in the presence not only of the entire family but also of Osh Popham who had called to present early radishes and peppergrass I d like to go upstairs with you when you get your boquet tied up he said because it s an awful hot day an the queer kind o things you do t this house allers makes my backbone cold I never suspicioned that Lena Hamilton hed the same kind o fantasmic notions that you folks have but I guess it s like tenant like landlord in this case Anyhow I want to see the rent paid if you don t mind I wish t you d asked that mean old sculpin of a Hen Lord over he owns my house an it might put a few idees into his head In the afternoon Nancy took her writing pad and sat on the circular steps where it was cool The five o clock train from Boston whistled at the station a mile away as she gathered her white skirts daintily up and settled herself in the shadiest corner She was unconscious of the passing time and scarcely looked up until the rattling of wheels caught her ear It was the station wagon stopping at the Yellow House gate and a strange gentleman was alighting He had an unmistakable air of the town His clothes were not as Beulah clothes and his hat was not as Beulah hats for it was a fine Panama with a broad sweeping brim Nancy rose from the steps surprise dawning first in her eyes then wonder then suspicion then conviction then two dimples appeared in her cheeks The stranger lifted the foreign looking hat with a smile and said My little friend and correspondent Nancy Carey I think My American Consul I do believe cried Nancy joyously as she ran down the path with both hands outstretched Where did you come from Why didn t you tell us beforehand We never even heard that you were in this country Oh I know why you chose the Fourth of July It s pay day and you thought we shouldn t be ready with the rent but it s all attended to beautifully this morning May I send my bag to the Mansion House and stay a while with you asked mister Hamilton Are the rest of you at home How are Gilbert and Kathleen and Julia and Peter How especially is Mother Carey What a memory you have exclaimed Nancy Take mister Hamilton s bag please mister Bennett and tell them at the hotel that he won t be there until after supper It was a pleasant hour that ensued for Nancy had broken the ice and there was plenty of conversation Then too the whole house had to be shown room by room even to Cousin Ann s stove in the cellar and the pump in the kitchen sink I never saw anything like it exclaimed Hamilton It is like magic I ought to pay you a thousand dollars on the spot I ought to try and buy the place of you for five thousand Why don t you go into the business of recreating houses and selling them to poor benighted creatures like me who never realize their possibilities If we show you the painted chamber will you promise not to be too unhappy asked Nancy You can t help crying with rage and grief that it is our painted chamber not yours but try to bear up until you get to the hotel because mother is so soft hearted she will be giving it back to you unless I interfere You must have spent money lavishly when you restored this room said the Consul it is a real work of art Not a penny said missus Carey It is the work of a great friend of Nancy s a seventeen year old girl who we expect will make Beulah famous some day Now will you go into your mother s room and find your way downstairs by yourself Julia will you show mister Hamilton the barn a little later while Nancy and I get supper Kitty must go to the Pophams for Peter he is spending the afternoon with them Nancy had enough presence of mind to intercept Kitty and hiss into her ear Borrow a loaf of bread from missus Popham we are short and see if you can find any way to get strawberries from Bill Harmon s it was to have been a bread and milk supper on the piazza to night and it must be hurriedly changed into a Consular banquet Verb sap Fly Gilbert turned up a little before six o clock and was introduced proudly by his mother as a son who had just gone into business I m Bill Harmon s summer clerk and delivery boy he explained It s great fun and I get two dollars and a half a week Nancy and her mother worked like Trojans in the kitchen for they agreed it was no time for economy even if they had less to eat for a week to come mister Hamilton is just as nice as I guessed he was when his first letter came said Nancy I went upstairs to get a card for the supper menu and he was standing by your mantelpiece with his head bent over his arms He had the little bunch of field flowers in his hand and I know he had been smelling them and looking at his mother s picture and remembering things What a merry supper it was with a jug of black eyed Susans in the centre of the table and a written bill of fare for mister Hamilton because he was a Consul so Nancy said Gilbert sat at the head of the table and mister Hamilton thought he had never seen anything so beautiful as missus Carey in her lavender challie sitting behind the tea cups unless it was Nancy flushed like a rose changing the plates and waiting on the table between courses He had never exerted himself so much at any diplomatic dinner and he won the hearts of the entire family before the meal was finished By the way I have a letter of introduction to you all but especially to Miss Nancy here and I have never thought to deliver it he said Who do you think sent it all the way from China My son Tom exclaimed Nancy irrepressibly but no he couldn t because he doesn t know us The Admiral of course cried Gilbert You are both right mister Hamilton answered drawing a letter from his coat pocket It is a Round Robin from the Admiral and my son Tom who have been making acquaintance in Hong Kong It is addressed FROM THE YELLOW PERIL IN CHINA to THE YELLOW HOUSE IN BEULAH Greeting Nancy crimsoned Did the Admiral tell your son Tom I called him the Yellow Peril It was wicked of him I did it you know because you wrote me that the only Hamilton who cared anything for the old house or would ever want to live in it was your son Tom After that I always called him the Yellow Peril and I suppose I mentioned it in a letter to the Admiral I am convinced that Nancy s mind is always empty at bedtime said her mother because she tells everything in it to somebody during the day I hope age will bring discretion but I doubt it My son Tom is coming home said his father with unmistakable delight in his voice Nancy who was passing the cake sat down so heavily in her chair that everybody laughed Come come Miss Nancy I can t let you make an ogre of the boy urged mister Hamilton He is a fine fellow and if he comes down here to look at the old place you are sure to be good friends Is he going back to China after his visit asked missus Carey who felt a fear of the young man something akin to her daughter s No I am glad to say Our family has been too widely separated for the last ten years At first it seemed necessary or at least convenient and desirable and I did not think much about it But lately it has been continually on my mind that we were leading a cheerless existence and I am determined to arrange matters differently missus Carey remembered Ossian Popham s description of missus Lemuel Hamilton and forebore to ask any questions with regard to her whereabouts since her husband did not mention her You will all be in Washington then she said and your son Tom with you of course Not quite so near as that his father replied Tom s firm is opening a Boston office and he will be in charge of that When do you expect the Admiral back Tom talks of their coming together on the Bedouin if it can be arranged We haven t heard lately said missus Carey but he should return within a month or two should he not Nancy My daughter writes all the letters for the family mister Hamilton as you know by this time I do to my great delight and satisfaction Now there is one thing I have not seen yet something about which I have a great deal of sentiment May I smoke my cigar under the famous crimson rambler The sun set flaming red behind the Beulah hills The frogs sang in the pond by the House of Lords and the grasshoppers chirped in the long grass of Mother Hamilton s favorite hayfield Then the moon round and deep hued as a great Mandarin orange came up into the sky from which the sun had faded and the little group still sat on the side piazza talking Nothing but their age and size kept the Carey chickens out of mister Hamilton s lap and Peter finally went to sleep with his head against the consul s knee He was a lappy man Nancy said next morning and indeed there had been no one like him in the family circle for many a long month He was tender he was gay he was fatherly he was interested in all that concerned them so no wonder that he heard all about Gilbert s plans for earning money and Nancy s accepted story No wonder he exclaimed at the check for ten dollars proudly exhibited in payment and no wonder he marvelled at the Summer Vacation School in the barn where fourteen little scholars were already enrolled under the tutelage of the Carey Faculty I never wanted to go to anything in my life as much as I want to go to that school he asserted If I could write a circular as enticing as that I should be a rich man I wish you d let me have some new ones printed girls and put me down for three evening lectures I d do almost anything to get into that Faculty I wish you d give the lectures for the benefit of the Faculty that would be better still said Kitty Nancy s coming out party was to be in the barn this summer that s one of the things we re earning money for or at least we make believe that it is because it s so much more fun to work for a party than for coal or flour or meat A look from missus Carey prevented the children from making any further allusions to economy and Gilbert skillfully turned the subject by giving a dramatic description of the rise and fall of The Dirty Boy from its first appearance at his mother s wedding breakfast to its last at the house warming supper After Lemuel Hamilton had gone back to the little country hotel he sat by the open window for another hour watching the moonbeams shimmering on the river and bathing the tip of the white meeting house steeple in a flood of light The air was still and the fireflies were rising above the thick grass and carrying their fairy lamps into the lower branches of the feathery elms Haying would begin next morning and he would be wakened by the sharpening of scythes and the click of mowing machines He would like to work in the Hamilton fields he thought knee deep in daisies fields on whose grass he had not stepped since he was a boy just big enough to go behind the cart and rake after What an evening it had been None of them had known it but as a matter of fact they had all scaled Shiny Wall and had been sitting with Mother Carey in Peacepool that was what had made everything so beautiful mister Hamilton s last glimpse of the Careys had been the group at the Yellow House gate missus Carey with her brown hair shining in the moonlight leaned against Gilbert the girls stood beside her their arms locked in hers while Peter clung sleepily to her hand I believe they are having hard times he thought and I can t think of anything I can safely do to make things easier Still one cannot pity one can only envy them That is the sort of mother I would have made had I been Nature and given a free hand I would have put a label on missus Carey saying This is what I meant a woman to be XXXIV NANCY COMES OUT Nancy s seventeenth birthday was past and it was on the full of the August moon that she finally came out in the Hamilton barn It was the barn s first public appearance too for the villagers had not been invited to the private Saturday night dances that took place during the brief reign of the Hamilton boys and girls Beulah was more excited about the barn than it was about Nancy and she was quite in sympathy with this view of things as the entire Carey family from mother to Peter was fairly bewitched with its new toy Day by day it had grown more enchanting as fresh ideas occurred to one or another and especially to Osh Popham who lived breathed and had his being in the barn and who had lavished his ingenuity and skill upon its fittings Not a word did he vouchsafe to the general public of the extraordinary nature of these fittings nor of the many bewildering features of the entertainment which was to take place within the almost sacred precincts All the Carey festivities had heretofore been in the house save the one in honor of the hanging of the weather vane which had been an out of door function attended by the whole village Now the community was all agog to disport itself in pastures new its curiosity being further piqued by the reception of written invitations a convention not often indulged in by Beulah The eventful day dawned clear and cool a day with an air like liquid amber that properly belonged to September the weather prophet really shifting it into August from pure kindness having taken a sticky dogday out and pitchforked it into the next month The afternoon passed in various stages of plotting planning and palpitation and every girl in Beulah of dancing age was in her bedroom trying her hair a new way The excitement increased a thousand fold when it was rumored that an Admiral whatever that might be had arrived at the hotel and would appear at the barn in full uniform After that nobody s braids or puffs would go right Nancy never needed to study Paris plates for her hair dressed itself after a fashion set by all the Venuses and Cupids and little Loves since the world began It curled whether she would or no so the only method was to part the curls and give them a twist into a coil from which vagrant spirals fell to the white nape of her neck Or if she felt gay and coquettish as she did tonight the curls were pinned high to the crown of her head and the runaways rioted here and there touching her cheek her ear her neck never ugly wherever they ran Nancy had a new yellow organdy made almost to touch and a twist of yellow ribbon in her hair Kathleen and Julia were in the white dresses brought them by Cousin Ann and missus Carey wore her new black silk made with a sweeping little train Her wedding necklace of seed pearls was around her neck and a tall comb of tortoise shell and pearls rose from the low coiled knot of her shining hair The family received in the old carriage house and when everybody had assembled to the number of seventy five or eighty the door into the barn was thrown open majestically by Gilbert in his character as head of the house of Carey Words fail to describe the impression made by the barn as it was introduced to the company Nancy s debut sinking into positive insignificance beside it Dozens of brown japanned candle lanterns hung from the beamed ceiling dispensing little twinkles of light here and there while larger ones swung from harness pegs driven into the sides of the walls The soft gray brown of the old weathered lumber everywhere made a lovely background for the birch bark brackets and the white birch bark vases that were filled with early golden rod mixed with tall Queen Anne s lace and golden glow The quaint settles surrounding the sides of the room were speedily filled by the admiring guests Colonel Wheeler s tiny upright piano graced the platform in the tie up Miss Susie Bennett the church organist was to play it aided now and then by missus Carey or Julia Osh Popham was to take turns on the violin with a cousin from Warren s Mills who was reported to be the master fiddler of the county When all was ready missus Carey stood between the master fiddler and Susie Bennett and there was a sudden hush in the room Friends and neighbors she said we now declare the Hall of Happy Hours open for the general good of the village If it had not been for the generosity of our landlord mister Lemuel Hamilton we could never have given you this pleasure and had not our helpers been so many we could never have made the place so beautiful Before the general dancing begins there will be a double quadrille of honor in which all those will take part who have driven a nail papered or painted a wall dug a spadeful of earth or done any work in or about the Yellow House Three cheers for missus Carey called Bill Harmon and everybody complied lustily Three cheers for Lemuel Hamilton and the rafters of the barn rang with the response Just then the Admiral changed his position to conceal the moisture that was beginning to gather in his eyes and the sight of a personage so unspeakably magnificent in a naval uniform induced Osh Popham to cry spontaneously Three cheers for the Admiral I don t know what he ever done but he looks as if he could all right at which everybody cheered and roared and the Admiral to his great surprise made a speech during which the telltale tears appeared so often in his eyes and in his voice that Osh Popham concluded privately that if the naval hero ever did meet an opposing battleship he would be likelier to drown the enemy than fire into them The double quadrille of honor passed off with much elegance everybody not participating in it being green with envy because he was not missus Carey and the Admiral were partners Nancy danced with mister Popham Kathleen with Digby Julia with Bill Harmon The other couples were missus Popham and Gilbert Lallie Joy and Cyril Lord Olive and Nat Harmon while missus Bill led out a very shy and uncomfortable gentleman who had dug the ditches for Cousin Ann s expensive pipes Then the fun and the frolic began in earnest The girls had been practising the old fashioned contra dances all summer and training the younger generation in them at the Vacation School The old folks needed no rehearsal If you had waked any of them in the night suddenly they could have called the changes for Speed the Plough The Soldier s Joy The Maid in the Pump Room or Hull s Victory Money Musk brought Nancy and mister Henry Lord on to the floor as head couple a result attained by that young lady by every means fair or foul known to woman at least a rudimentary budding woman of seventeen summers His coming to the party at all was regarded by Mother Carey who had spent the whole force of her being in managing it as nothing short of a miracle He had accepted partly from secret admiration of his handsome neighbor partly to show the village that he did not choose always to be a hermit crab partly out of curiosity to see the unusual gathering Having crawled out of his selfish shell far enough to grace the occasion he took another step when Nancy asked him to dance It was pretty to see her curtsey when she put the question pretty to see the air of triumph with which she led him to the head of the line and positively delightful to the onlookers to see Hen Lord doing right and left ladies chain balance to opposite and cast off at a girl s beck and call He was not a bad dancer when his sluggish blood once got into circulation and he was considerably more limber at the end of Money Musk considerably less like a wooden image than at the beginning of it In the interval between this astounding exhibition and the Rochester Schottisch which followed it Henry Lord went up to missus Carey who was sitting in a corner a little apart from her guests for the moment Shall I go to South America or shall I not he asked her in an undertone Olive seems pleasantly settled and Cyril tells me you will consent to take him into your family for six months still I would like a woman s advice Mother Carey neither responded I should prefer not to take the responsibility of advising you nor Pray do as you think best she simply said in a tone she might have used to a fractious boy I wouldn t go mister Lord Wait till Olive and Cyril are a little older Cyril will grow into my family instead of into his own Olive will learn to do without you worse yet you will learn to do without your children Stay at home and have Olive come back to you and her brother every week end South America is a long distance when there are only three of you Prof Lord was not satisfied with missus Carey s tone It was so maternal that he expected at any moment she might brush his hair straighten his necktie and beg him not to sit up too late but his instinct told him it was the only tone he was ever likely to hear from her and so he said reluctantly Very well I confess that I really rely on your judgment and I will decline the invitation I think you are right missus Carey answered wondering if the man would ever see his duty with his own eyes or whether he had deliberately blinded himself for life XXXV THE CRIMSON RAMBLER While missus Carey was talking with mister Lord Nancy skimmed across the barn floor intent on some suddenly remembered duty went out into the garden and met face to face a strange young man standing by the rose trellis and looking in at the dance through the open door He had on a conventional black dinner coat something never seen in Beulah and wore a soft travelling cap At first Nancy thought he was a friend of the visiting fiddler but a closer look at his merry dark eyes gave her the feeling that she had seen him before or somebody very like him He did not wait for her to speak but taking off his cap put out his hand and said By your resemblance to a photograph in my possession I think you are the girl who planted the crimson rambler Are you my son Tom asked Nancy open astonishment in her tone I mean my mister Hamilton s son Tom I am my mister Hamilton s son Tom or shall we say our mister Hamilton s Do two mys make one our Upon my word wonders will never cease exclaimed Nancy The Admiral said you were in Boston but he never told us you would visit Beulah so soon No I wanted it to be a secret I wanted to appear when the ball was at its height the ghost of the old regime confronting the new so to speak Beulah will soon be a summer resort everybody seems to be coming here It s partly your fault isn t it Why pray The Water Babies is one of my favorite books and I know all about Mother Carey s chickens They go out over the seas and show good birds the way home Are you a good bird asked Nancy saucily I m home at all events said Tom with an emphasis that made Nancy shiver lest the young man had come to Beulah with a view of taking up his residence in the paternal mansion The two young people sat down on the piazza steps while the music of The Sultan s Polka floated out of the barn door Old missus Jenks was dancing with Peter her eighty year old steps as fleet as his her white side curls bobbing to the tune Her withered hands clasped his dimpled ones and the two seemed to be of the same age for in the atmosphere of laughter and goodwill there would have been no place for the old in heart and certainly missus Jenks was as young as any one at the party I can t help dreading you nice and amiable as you look said Nancy candidly to Tom Hamilton I am so afraid you ll fall in love with the Yellow House and want it back again Are you engaged to be married to a little footed China doll or anything like that she asked with a teasing upward look and a disarming smile that robbed the question of any rudeness No not engaged to anything or anybody but I ve a notion I shall be soon if all goes well I m getting along in years now I might have known it sighed Nancy It was a prophetic instinct my calling you the Yellow Peril It isn t a bit nice of you to dislike me before you know me I didn t do that way with you What do you mean Why in the first letter you ever wrote father you sent your love to any of his children that should happen to be of the right size I chanced to be just the right size so I accepted it gratefully I ve got it here with me to night no I left it in my other coat he said merrily making a fictitious search through his pockets Nancy laughed at his nonsense she could not help it Will you promise to get over your foolish and wicked prejudices if I on my part promise never to take the Yellow House away from you unless you wish continued Tom Willingly exclaimed Nancy joyously That s the safest promise I could make for I would never give up living in it unless I had to First it was father s choice then it was mother s now all of us seem to have built ourselves into it as it were I am almost afraid to care so much about anything and I shall be so relieved if you do not turn out to be really a Yellow Peril after all You are much more of a Yellow Peril yourself said Tom with that dress and that ribbon in your hair Will you dance the next dance with me please It s The Tempest do you know it No but I m not so old but I may learn I ll form myself on that wonderful person who makes jokes about the Admiral and plays the fiddle That s Ossian Popham principal prop of the House of Carey Lucky dog Have you got all the props you need Nancy s hand was not old or strong or experienced enough to keep this strange young man in order and just as she was meditating some blighting retort he went on Who is that altogether adorable that unspeakably beautiful lady in black the one with the pearl comb that looks like a crown That s mother said Nancy glowing I thought so At least I didn t know any other way to account for her Why does she have to be accounted for asked Nancy a little bewildered For the same reason that you do said the audacious youth You explain your mother and your mother explains you a little at any rate Where is the celebrated crimson rambler please You are sitting on it Nancy answered tranquilly Tom sprang away from the trellis on which he had been half reclining Bless my soul he exclaimed Why didn t you tell me I have a great affection for that rambler it was your planting it that first made me think favorably of you Has it any roses on it I can t see in this light It is almost out of bloom there may be a few at the top somewhere I ll look out my window to morrow morning and see At about what hour How should I know laughed Nancy Oh you re not to be depended on said Tom rebukingly Just give me your hand a moment step on that lowest rung of the trellis now one step higher please now stretch up your right hand and pick that little cluster do you see it That s right now down be careful there you are thank you A rose in the hand is worth two in the morning Put it in your button hole said Nancy It is the last I gave your father one of the first a month ago I shall put this in my pocket book and send it to my mother in a letter Tom replied And tell her it looks just like the girl who planted it he thought sweet fragrant spicy graceful vigorous full of color Now come in and meet mother said Nancy The polka is over and soon they will be forming on for The Tempest Tom Hamilton s entrance and introduction proved so interesting that it delayed the dance for a few moments Then Osh Popham and the master fiddler tuned their violins and missus Carey assisted Susie Bennett at the piano so that there were four musicians to give fresh stimulus to the impatient feet Tom Hamilton hardly knew whether he would rather dance with Nancy or stand at the open door and watch her as he had been doing earlier in the evening He could not really see her now although he was her partner his mind was so occupied with the intricate figures but he could feel her in every fibre of his body the touch of her light hand was so charged with magnetism Somebody swung the back doors of the barn wide open The fields lately mown sloped gently up to a fringe of pines darkly green against the sky The cool night air stirred the elms and the brilliant moon appeared in the very centre of the doorway The beauty of the whole scene went to Tom Hamilton s head a little but he kept his thoughts steadily on the changes as Osh Popham called them To watch Nancy Carey dance The Tempest was a sight to stir the blood The two head couples joined hands and came down the length of the barn four abreast back they went in a whirl then they balanced to the next couple then came four hands round and ladies chain and presently they came down again flying with another four behind them The first four were Nancy and Tom Ralph Thurston and Kathleen the last two among the best dancers in Beulah but while Kitty was slim and straight and graceful as a young fawn Nancy swept down the middle of the barn floor like a flower borne by the breeze She was Youth Hope Joy incarnate She had washed the dishes that night would wash them again in the morning but what of that What mattered it that the years just ahead for aught she knew to the contrary were full of self denial and economy Was she not seventeen Anything was possible at seventeen What if the world was to be a work a day world There was music and laughter in it as well as work and there was love in it too oceans of love so why not trip and be merry and guide one s young partner safely through the difficult mazes of the dance and bring him out flushed and triumphant to receive mother s laughing compliments Everybody was dancing The Tempest in his or her own fashion thought the Admiral looking on missus Popham was grave even gloomy from the waist up but incredibly lively from the waist down moving with the precision of machinery while her partner a bricklayer from Beulah Centre engaged the attention of the entire company by his wonderful steps She was fully up to time too you may be sure as her rival missus Bill Harmon was opposite her in the set Lallie Joy clad in one of Kathleen s dresses her hair dressed by Julia was a daily attendant at the Vacation School but five weeks of steady instruction had not sufficed to make her sure of ladies grand chain Olive moved like a shy little wild thing with a bending head and a grace all her own while Gilbert had great ease and distinction There was a brief interval for ice cream accompanied by marble cake gold cake silver cake election cake sponge cake cup cake citron cake and White Mountain cake and while it was being eaten Susie Bennett played The Sliding Waltz The Maiden s Prayer and Listen to the Mocking Bird with variations variations requiring almost supernatural celerity I guess there ain t many that can touch Sutey at the piano said Osh Popham who sat beside the Admiral Have you seen anybody in the cities that could play any faster n she can And Jo you ever ketch her landin on a black note when she started for a white one I guess not You are right replied the Admiral and now there seems to be a general demand for you What are they requesting you to do fly That s it said Osh Mis Carey will you play for me Maria you can go into the carriage house if you don t want to be disgraced Come my beloved haste away Cut short the hours of thy delay Fly like a youthful hart or roe Over the hills where spices grow At length the strains of the favorite old tune faded on the ears of the delighted audience Then they had The Portland Fancy and The Irish Washerwoman and The College Hornpipe and at last the clock in the carriage house struck midnight and the guests departed in groups of twos and threes and fours their cheerful voices sounding far down the village street Osh Popham stayed behind to cover the piano put out the lanterns close the doors and windows and lock the barn while missus Carey and the Admiral strolled slowly along the greensward to the side door of the house Good night Osh called happily as he passed them a few minutes later I guess Beulah never see a party such as ourn was this evenin I guess if the truth was known the State o Maine never did neither Good night all Mebbe if I hurry along I can ketch up with Maria His quick steps brushing the grassy pathway could be heard for some minutes in the clear still air and presently the sound of his mellow tenor came floating back Come my beloved haste away Cut short the hours of thy delay Fly like a youthful hart or roe Over the hills where spices grow Julia had gone upstairs with the sleepy Peter bird who had been enjoying his first experience of late hours on the occasion of Nancy s coming out the rest of the young folks were gathered in a group under the elms chatting in couples Olive and Ralph Thurston Kathleen and Cyril Lord Nancy and Tom Hamilton Then they parted Tom Hamilton strolling to the country hotel with the young school teacher for companion while Olive and Cyril walked across the fields to the House of Lords It was a night in a thousand The air was warm clear and breathlessly still so still that not a leaf stirred on the trees The sky was cloudless and the moon brilliant and luminous shone as it seldom shines in a northern clime The water was low in Beulah s shining river and it ran almost noiselessly under the bridge While Kathleen and Julia were still unbraiding their hair exclaiming at every twist of the hand as to the loveliness of the party Nancy had kissed her mother and crept silently into bed All night long the strains of The Tempest ran through her dreams There was the touch of a strange hand on hers an altogether new touch warm and compelling There was the gay trooping down the centre of the barn in fours some one by her side who had never been there before and a sensation entirely new and intoxicating that whenever she met the glance of her partner s merry dark eyes she found herself at the bottom of them Was she a child when she heard Osh Popham cry Take your partners for The Tempest and was she a woman when he called All promenade to seats She hardly knew Beulah was a dream the Yellow House was a dream the dance was a dream the partner was a dream At one moment she was a child helping her father to plant the crimson rambler at another she was a woman pulling a rose from the topmost branch and giving it to some one who steadied her hand on the trellis some one who said Thank you and Good night differently from the rest of the world Who was the young stranger Was he the Knight of Beulah Castle the Overlord of the Yellow House was he the Yellow Peril was he a good bird to whom Mother Carey s chicken had shown the way home Still the dream went on in bewildering circles and Nancy kept hearing mysterious phrases spoken with a new meaning Will you dance with me Doesn t the House of Carey need another prop Won t you give me a rose and above all You sent your love to any one of the Hamilton children who should be of the right size I was just the right size and I took it Love couldn t be sent in a letter expostulated Nancy in the dream and somebody in the dream always answered Don t be so sure Very strange things happen when Mother Carey s messengers go out over the seas Don t you remember how they spoke to Tom in The Water Babies Among all the songs that came across the water one was more sweet and clear than all for it was the song of a young girl s voice And what was the song that she sung Have patience keep your eye single and your hands clean and you

confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web
