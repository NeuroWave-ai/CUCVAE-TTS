3088-5436-0000	train-other-500	They were dressed in many different styles of clothes
none	none	 the loose flowing robes of the lads from the Martian deserts 
3088-5436-0001	train-other-500	the knee length shorts and high stockings of the boys from the Venusian jungles the vari colored jacket and trouser combinations of the boys from the magnificent Earth cities But they all had one thing in common a dream
none	none	 All had visions of becoming Space Cadets and later officers in the Solar Guard Each dreamed of the day when he would command rocket ships that patrolled the space lanes from the outer edges of Pluto to the twilight zone of Mercury They were all the same All right now Let s get squared away His voice was a little more friendly now My name s McKenny Mike McKenny Warrant Officer Solar Guard See these hash marks He suddenly held out a thick arm that bulged against the tight red sleeve From the wrists to the elbow the lines of boys could see a solid corrugation of white 
3088-5436-0003	train-other-500	V shaped stripes Each one of these marks represents four years in space he continued There s ten marks here
none	none	 and I intend making it an even dozen And no bunch of Earthworms is going to make me lose the chance to get those last two by trying to make a space monkey out of me McKenny sauntered along the line of boys with that same strange catlike step 
3088-5436-0004	train-other-500	and looked squarely into the eyes of each boy in turn
none	none	 Just to keep the record straight I m your cadet supervisor 
3088-5436-0005	train-other-500	I handle you until you either wash out and go home or you finally blast off and become spacemen If you stub your toe or cut your finger come to me If you get homesick come to me
none	none	 And if you get into trouble he paused momentarily don t bother because I ll be looking for you with a fist full of demerits McKenny continued his slow inspection of the ranks then suddenly stopped short At the far end of the line a tall ruggedly built boy of about eighteen with curly brown hair and a pleasant open face was stirring uncomfortably He slowly reached down toward his right boot and held it while he wriggled his foot into it McKenny quickly strode over and planted himself firmly in front of the boy When I say stand to I mean stand to he roared The boy jerked himself erect and snapped to attention I I m sorry sir he stammered But my boot it was coming off and I don t care if your pants are falling down an order s an order The boy gulped and reddened as a nervous titter rippled through the ranks McKenny spun around and glared There was immediate silence What s your name He turned back to the boy Corbett sir Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett answered the boy Wanta be a spaceman do ya 
3088-5436-0006	train-other-500	asked Mike pushing his jaw out another inch Yes sir Been studying long hard hours in primary school eh
none	none	 Talked your mother and father deaf in the ears to let you come to Space Academy and be a spaceman You want to feel those rockets bucking in your back out in the stars EH Yes sir replied Tom wondering how this man he didn t even know could know so much about him Well you won t make it if I ever catch you disobeying orders again McKenny turned quickly to see what effect he had created on the others 
3088-5436-0008	train-other-500	The lines of bewildered faces satisfied him that his old trick of using one of the cadets as an example was a success
none	none	 He turned back to Corbett The only reason I m not logging you now is because you re not a Space Cadet yet and won t be until you ve taken the Academy oath Yes sir McKenny walked down the line and across the platform to an open teleceiver booth The ranks were quiet and motionless and as he made his call McKenny smiled Finally when the tension seemed unbearable he roared At ease and closed the door of the booth 
3088-5436-0010	train-other-500	The ranks melted immediately and the boys fell into chattering clusters their voices low and they occasionally peered over their shoulders at Corbett as if he had suddenly been stricken with a horrible plague
none	none	 Brooding over the seeming ill fortune that had called McKenny s attention to him at the wrong time Tom sat down on his suitcase to adjust his boot He shook his head slowly He had heard Space Academy was tough tougher than any other school in the world 
3088-5436-0011	train-other-500	but he didn t expect the stern discipline to begin so soon
none	none	 This could be the beginning of the end drawled a lazy voice in back of Tom 
3088-5436-0012	train-other-500	for some of the more enthusiastic cadets Someone laughed
none	none	 Tom turned to see a boy about his own age weight and height with close cropped blond hair that stood up brushlike all over his head 
3088-5436-0013	train-other-500	He was lounging idly against a pillar luggage piled high around his feet Tom recognized him immediately as Roger Manning and his pleasant features twisted into a scowl About what I d expect from that character he thought after the trick he pulled on Astro that big fellow from Venus
none	none	 Tom s thoughts were of the night before when the connecting links of transportation from all over the Solar Alliance had deposited the boys in the Central Station at Atom City where they were to board the monorail express for the final lap to Space Academy 
3088-5436-0014	train-other-500	Manning as Tom remembered it had taken advantage of the huge Venusian by tricking him into carrying his luggage
none	none	 Reasoning that since the gravity of Venus was considerably less than that of Earth 
3088-5436-0015	train-other-500	he convinced Astro that he needed the extra weight to maintain his balance
none	none	 It had been a cheap trick but no one had wanted to challenge the sharpness of Manning s tongue and come to Astro s rescue 
3088-5436-0016	train-other-500	Tom had wanted to but refrained when he saw that Astro didn t mind
none	none	 Finishing his conversation on the teleceiver McKenny stepped out of the booth and faced the boys again 
3088-5436-0017	train-other-500	All right he bawled They re all set for you at the Academy Pick up your gear and follow me With a quick light step
none	none	 he hopped on the rolling slidewalk at the edge of the platform and started moving away Hey Astro Roger Manning stopped the huge boy about to step over 
3088-5436-0018	train-other-500	Going to carry my bags The Venusian a full head taller hesitated and looked doubtfully at the four suitcases at Roger s feet
none	none	 Come on prodded Roger in a tone of mock good nature 
3088-5436-0019	train-other-500	The gravity around here is the same as in Atom City
none	none	 It s the same all over the face of the Earth Wouldn t want you to just 
3088-5436-0020	train-other-500	fly away He snickered and looked around winking broadly Astro still hesitated I don t know Manning
none	none	 I uhh 
3088-5436-0021	train-other-500	By the rings of Saturn What s going on here
none	none	 Suddenly from outside the ring of boys that had gathered around McKenny came roaring in bulling his way to the center of the group to face Roger and Astro 
3088-5436-0022	train-other-500	I have a strained wrist sir began Roger smoothly And this cadet candidate he nodded casually toward Astro
none	none	 offered to carry my luggage Now he refuses Mike glared at Astro 
3088-5436-0023	train-other-500	Did you agree to carry this man s luggage
none	none	 Well I ah 
3088-5436-0024	train-other-500	fumbled Astro Well Did you or didn t you I guess I sorta did sir replied Astro his face turning a slow red I don t hold with anyone doing another man s work
none	none	 but if a Solar Guard officer a Space Cadet or even a cadet candidate gives his word he ll do something he does it McKenny shook a finger in Astro s face reaching up to do it Is that clear Yes sir was the embarrassed reply McKenny turned to Manning who stood listening a faint smile playing on his lips What s your name Mister Manning Roger Manning 
3088-5436-0026	train-other-500	he answered easily So you ve got a strained wrist have you asked Mike mockingly
none	none	 while sending a sweeping glance from top to bottom of the gaudy colored clothes 
3088-5436-0027	train-other-500	Yes sir Can t carry your own luggage eh Yes answered Roger evenly I could carry my own luggage I thought the candidate from Venus might give me a helping hand Nothing more
none	none	 I certainly didn t intend for him to become a marked man for a simple gesture of comradeship He glanced past McKenny toward the other boys and added softly And comradeship is the spirit of Space Academy isn t it sir His face suddenly crimson McKenny spluttered searching for a ready answer then turned away abruptly What are you all standing around for he roared Get your gear and yourselves over on that slidewalk 
3088-5436-0029	train-other-500	Blast He turned once again to the rolling platform
none	none	 Manning smiled at Astro and hopped nimbly onto the slidewalk after McKenny leaving his luggage in a heap in front of Astro 
3088-5436-0030	train-other-500	And be careful with that small case Astro he called as he drifted away
none	none	 Here Astro said Tom I ll give you a hand 
3088-5436-0031	train-other-500	Never mind replied Astro grimly
none	none	 I can carry em No let me help 
3088-5436-0032	train-other-500	Tom bent over then suddenly straightened By the way we haven t introduced ourselves My name s Corbett Tom Corbett He stuck out his hand Astro hesitated sizing up the curly headed boy in front of him who stood smiling and offering friendship
3088-5436-0033	train-other-500	Finally he pushed out his own hand and smiled back at Tom Astro but you know that by now That sure was a dirty deal Manning gave you
none	none	 Ah I don t mind carrying his bags It s just that I wanted to tell him he s going to have to send it all back They don t allow a candidate to keep more than a toothbrush at the Academy Guess he ll find out the hard way Carrying Manning s luggage as well as their own they finally stepped on the slidewalk and began the smooth easy ride from the monorail station to the Academy Both having felt the sharpness of Manning s tongue and both having been dressed down by Warrant Officer McKenny they seemed to be linked by a bond of trouble and they stood close together for mutual comfort As the slidewalk whisked them silently past the few remaining buildings and credit exchanges that nestled around the monorail station Tom gave thought to his new life 
3088-5436-0035	train-other-500	Ever since Jon Builker the space explorer
none	none	 returning from the first successful flight to a distant galaxy came through his home town near New Chicago twelve years before Tom had wanted to be a spaceman Through high school and the New Chicago Primary Space School where he had taken his first flight above Earth s atmosphere he had waited for the day when he would pass his entrance exams and be accepted as a cadet candidate in Space Academy 
3088-5436-0036	train-other-500	For no reason at all a lump rose in his throat as the slidewalk rounded a curve and he saw for the first time the gleaming white magnificence of the Tower of Galileo He recognized it immediately from the hundreds of books he had read about the Academy and stared wordlessly
3088-5436-0037	train-other-500	Sure is pretty isn t it asked Astro his voice strangely husky Yeah breathed Tom in reply It sure is
none	none	 He could only stare at the shimmering tower ahead It s all I ve ever wanted to do said Tom at length 
3088-5436-0038	train-other-500	Just get out there and be free
none	none	 I know what you mean It s the greatest feeling in the world 
3088-5436-0039	train-other-500	You say that as if you ve already been up there Astro grinned Yup
none	none	 Used to be an enlisted space sailor Bucked rockets in an old freighter on the Luna City Venusport run Well what are you doing here Tom was amazed and impressed Simple I want to be an officer I want to get into the Solar Guard and handle the power push in one of those cruisers 
3088-5436-0040	train-other-500	Tom s eyes glowed with renewed admiration for his new friend I ve been out four or five times but only in jet boats five hundred miles out Nothing like a jump to Luna City or Venusport
none	none	 By now the slidewalk had carried them past the base of the Tower of Galileo to a large building facing the Academy quadrangle and the spell was broken by McKenny s bull throated roar Haul off you blasted polliwogs As the boys jumped off the slidewalk a cadet dressed in the vivid blue that Tom recognized as the official dress of the Senior Cadet Corps walked up to McKenny and spoke to him quietly The warrant officer turned back to the waiting group and gave rapid orders By twos follow Cadet Herbert inside and he ll assign you to your quarters Shower shave if you have to and can find anything to shave and dress in the uniform that ll be supplied you 
3088-5436-0042	train-other-500	Be ready to take the Academy oath at
none	none	 he paused and glanced at the senior cadet who held up three fingers 
3088-5436-0043	train-other-500	fifteen hundred hours That s three o clock All clear Blast off Just as the boys began to move there was a sudden blasting roar in the distance The noise expanded and rolled across the hills surrounding Space Academy
none	none	 It thundered over the grassy quadrangle vibrating waves of sound one on top of the other until the very air quivered under the impact 
3088-5436-0044	train-other-500	Mouths open eyes popping the cadet candidates stood rooted in their tracks and stared as in the distance a long thin needlelike ship seemed to balance delicately on a column of flame then suddenly shoot skyward and disappear
none	none	 Pull in your eyeballs McKenny s voice crackled over the receding thunder You ll fly one of those firecrackers some day But right now you re Earthworms the lowest form of animal life in the Academy As the boys snapped to attention again Tom thought he caught a faint smile on Cadet Herbert s face as he stood to one side waiting for McKenny to finish his tirade Suddenly he snapped his back straight turned sharply and stepped through the wide doors of the building 
3088-5436-0045	train-other-500	Quickly the double line of boys followed Did you see that Astro asked Tom excitedly That was a Solar Guard patrol ship Yeah I know replied Astro The big candidate from Venus scratched his chin and eyed Tom bashfully Say Tom
none	none	 ah since we sort of know each other how about us trying to get in the same quarters O K by me Astro if we can said Tom grinning back at his friend The line pressed forward to Cadet Herbert who was now waiting at the bottom of the slidestairs a mesh belt that spiraled upward in a narrow well to the upper stories of the building 
3088-5436-0046	train-other-500	Speaking into an audioscriber
none	none	 a machine that transmitted his spoken words into typescript 
3088-5436-0047	train-other-500	he repeated the names of the candidates as they passed Cadet Candidate Tom Corbett announced Tom and Herbert repeated it into the audioscriber Cadet Candidate Astro The big Venusian stepped forward
none	none	 What s the rest of it Mister inquired Herbert 
3088-5436-0048	train-other-500	That s all Just Astro No other names No sir replied Astro You see You don t say sir to a senior cadet Mister And we re not interested in why you have only one name Herbert snapped
none	none	 Yes sir uhh Mister 
3088-5436-0049	train-other-500	Astro flushed and joined Tom Cadet Candidate Philip Morgan
none	none	 announced the next boy 
3088-5436-0050	train-other-500	Herbert repeated the name into the machine then announced Cadet Candidates Tom Corbett Astro and Philip Morgan assigned to Section forty two D
none	none	 Turning to the three boys he indicated the spiraling slidestairs Forty second floor You ll find Section D in the starboard wing Astro and Tom immediately began to pile Manning s luggage to one side of the slidestairs 
3088-5436-0051	train-other-500	Take your luggage with you Misters snapped Herbert
none	none	 It isn t ours replied Tom Isn t yours Herbert glanced over the pile of suitcases and turned back to Tom Whose is it then Belongs to Cadet Candidate Roger Manning replied Tom What are you doing with it We were carrying it for him Do we have a candidate in the group who finds it necessary to provide himself with valet service Herbert moved along the line of boys Will Cadet Candidate Roger Manning please step forward Roger slid from behind a group of boys to face the senior cadet s cold stare Roger Manning here he presented himself smoothly Is that your luggage Herbert jerked his thumb over his shoulder It is Roger smiled confidently but Herbert merely stared coldly You have a peculiar attitude for a candidate Manning Is there a prescribed attitude mister Herbert Roger asked his smile broadening If there is I ll be only too glad to conform to it Herbert s face twitched almost imperceptibly Then he nodded made a notation on a pad and returned to his post at the head of the gaping line of boys From now on Candidate Manning you will be responsible for your own belongings Tom Astro and Philip Morgan stepped on the slidestairs and began their spiraling ascent to the forty second floor I saw what happened at the monorail station drawled the third member of Section forty two D leaning against the bannister of the moving belt By the craters of Luna that Manning felluh sure is a hot operator We found out for ourselves grunted Astro Say since we re all bunkin togethuh let s get to knowin each othuh My name s Phil Morgan come from Georgia Where you all from New Chicago replied Tom Name s Tom Corbett And this is Astro Hiya Astro stuck out a big paw and grinned his wide grin I guess you heard Astro s all the name I ve got How come inquired the Southerner I m from Venus and it s a custom from way back when Venus was first colonized to just hand out one name Funny custom drawled Phil Astro started to say something and then stopped clamping his lips together Tom could see his face turn a slow pink Phil saw it too and hastily added Oh I didn t mean anything I ah he broke off embarrassed Forget it Phil Astro grinned again Say interjected Tom Look at that They all turned to look at the floor they were passing Near the edge of the step off platform on the fourth floor was an oaken panel inscribed with silver lettering in relief As they drew even with the plaque they caught sight of someone behind them They turned to see Manning the pile of suitcases in front of him reading aloud to the brave men who sacrificed their lives in the conquest of space this Galaxy Hall is dedicated Say this must be the museum said Tom Here s where they have all the original gear used in the first space hops Absolutely right said Manning with a smile I wonder if we could get off and take a look Astro asked Sure you can said Roger In fact the Academy regs say every cadet must inspect the exhibits in the space museum within the first week The members of Section forty two D looked at Roger questioningly I don t know if we have time Tom was dubious Sure you have plenty I d hop off and take a look myself but I ve got to get this junk ready to ship home He indicated the pile of bags in front of him Aw come on Tom let s take a look urged Astro They have the old Space Queen in here the first ship to clear Earth s gravity Boy I d sure like to see her Without waiting for the others to agree the huge candidate stepped off the slidestairs Hey Astro yelled Tom Wait I don t think His voice trailed off as the moving stair carried him up to the next floor But then a curious thing happened As other boys came abreast of the museum floor and saw Astro they began to get off and follow him wandering around gazing at the relics of the past Soon nearly half of the cadet candidates were standing in silent awe in front of the battered hull of the Space Queen the first atomic powered rocket ship allowed on exhibition only fifty years before because of the deadly radioactivity in her hull created when a lead baffle melted in midspace and flooded the ship with murderous gamma rays They stood in front of the spaceship and listened while Astro in a hushed voice 
3088-5436-0052	train-other-500	read the inscription on the bronze tablet Earth to Luna and return seventh March
none	none	 twenty fifty one In honor of the brave men of the first atomic powered spaceship to land successfully on the planet Moon 
3088-5436-0053	train-other-500	only to perish on return to Earth
none	none	 Candidates staaaaaaaaannnnnd too Like a clap of thunder Warrant Officer McKenny s voice jarred the boys out of their silence He stepped forward like a bantam rooster and faced the startled group of boys 
3088-5436-0054	train-other-500	I wanna know just one thing Who stepped off that slidestairs first The boys all hesitated I
none	none	 guess I was the first sir said Astro stepping forward Oh you guess you were eh roared McKenny Taking a deep breath McKenny launched into a blistering tirade His choice of words were to be long remembered by the group and repeated to succeeding classes Storming against the huge Venusian like a pygmy attacking an elephant McKenny roared berated and blasted Later 
3088-5436-0056	train-other-500	when Astro finally reached his quarters and changed into the green coveralls of the cadet candidates Tom and Phil crowded around him It was Roger blast him said Tom angrily He was getting back at you because Cadet Herbert made him carry his own gear I asked for it grumbled Astro
3088-5436-0057	train-other-500	Ah I should ve known better But I just couldn t wait to see the Queen He balled his huge hands into tight knots and stared at the floor
none	none	 Now hear this A voice suddenly rasped over the PA system loud speaker above the door All cadet candidates will come to attention to receive the Space Academy oath from Commander Walters The voice paused AT TENT SHUN Cadet candidates Staaaaannnnd TO This is Commander Walters speaking A deep powerful voice purred through the speaker The Academy oath is taken individually It is something each candidate locks in his spirit his mind and his heart 
3088-5436-0058	train-other-500	That is why it is taken in your quarters
none	none	 The oath is not a show of color it is a way of life Each candidate will face as closely as possible in the direction of his home and swear by his own individual God as he repeats after me Astro stepped quickly to the window port and gazed into the blue heavens eyes searching out the misty planet Venus 
3088-5436-0059	train-other-500	Phil Morgan thought a moment and faced toward the wall with the inlaid star chart of the sky thinking of sun bathed Georgia Tom Corbett stared straight at a blank wall Each boy did not see what was in front of him yet he saw further perhaps than he had ever seen before
none	none	 He looked into a future which held the limitlessness of the universe and new worlds and planets to be lifted out of the oblivion of uncharted depths of space to come They repeated slowly I solemnly swear to uphold the Constitution of the Solar Alliance to obey interplanetary law to protect the liberties of the planets to safeguard the freedom of space and to uphold the cause of peace throughout the universe to this end I dedicate my life CHAPTER two Tom Corbett s first day at Space Academy began at five hundred thirty hours with the blaring of the Cadet Corps Song over the central communicators From the rocket fields of the Academy To the far flung stars of outer space We re Space Cadets training to be Ready for dangers we may face Up in the sky rocketing past Higher than high faster than fast Out into space into the sun Look at her go when we give her the gun From the rocket fields of the Within sixty seconds the buildings of the Academy rocked with the impact of three thousand voices singing the last stanza Lights flashed on in every window Cadets raced through the halls and across the quadrangle The central communicator began the incessant mustering of cadets and the never ending orders of the day Unit thirty eight Z report to Captain Edwards for astrogation Unit sixty eight E report to Commander Walters for special assignments On and on down the list of senior cadets watch officers and the newly arrived Earthworms Units and individuals to report for training or study in everything from ground assembly of an atomic rocket motor to the history of the founding of the Solar Alliance the governing body of the tri planet civilization Tom Corbett stepped out of the shower in Section forty two D and bellowed at the top of his voice Hit the deck Astro Make use of the gravity He tugged at an outsized foot dangling over the side of an upper bunk Uhhhh ahhhh hummmmm groaned the cadet from Venus and tried to go back to sleep Philip Morgan stepped into the shower turned on the cold water screeched at the top of his voice gradually trailing off into countless repetitions of the last verse of the Academy song Damp your tubes you blasted space monkey roared Astro sitting up bleary eyed What time do we eat asked Tom pulling on the green one piece coverall of the Earthworm cadet candidates I don t know replied Astro opening his mouth in a cavernous yawn But it d better be soon I like space but not between my backbone and my stomach Warrant Officer McKenny burst into the room and began to compete with the rest of the noise outside the buildings Five minutes to the dining hall and you d better not be late Take the slidestairs down to the twenty eighth floor Tell the mess cadet in charge of the hall your unit number and he ll show you to the right table Remember where it is because you ll have to find it yourself after that or not eat Finish your breakfast and report to the ninety ninth floor to doctor Dale at seven hundred hours And as fast as he had arrived he was gone a flash of red color with rasping voice trailing behind Exactly one hour and ten minutes later promptly at seven o clock the three members of Unit forty two D stood at attention in front of doctor Joan Dale along with the rest of the green clad cadets When the catcalls and wolf whistles had died away doctor Dale pretty trim and dressed in the gold and black uniform of the Solar Guard held up her hand and motioned for the cadets to sit down My answer to your she paused smiled and continued your enthusiastic welcome is simply thank you But we ll have no further repetitions This is Space Academy not a primary school Turning abruptly she stood beside a round desk in the well of an amphitheater and held up a thin tube about an inch in diameter and twelve inches long We will now begin your classification tests she said You will receive one of these tubes Inside you will find four sheets of paper You are to answer all the questions on each paper and place them back in the tube Take the tube and drop it in the green outline slot in this wall She indicated a four inch round hole to her left outlined with green paint Beside it was another slot outlined with red paint Remain there until the tube is returned to you in the red slot Take it back to your desk She paused and glanced down at her desk Now there are four possible classifications for a cadet Control deck officer which includes leadership and command Astrogation officer which includes radar and communications And power deck officer for engine room operations The fourth classification is for advanced scientific study here at the Academy Your papers are studied by an electronic calculator that has proven infallible You must make at least a passing grade on each of the four classifications doctor Dale looked up at the rows of upturned unsmiling faces and stepped from the dais coming to a halt near the first desk I know that all of you here have your hearts set on becoming spacemen officers in the Solar Guard Most of you want to be space pilots But there must be astrogators radar engineers communication officers and power deck operators on each ship and she paused braced her shoulders and added some of you will not be accepted for any of these Some of you will wash out doctor Dale turned her back on the cadets not wanting to look at the sudden pallor that washed over their faces It was brutal she thought this test Why bring them all the way to the Academy and then give the tests Why not start the entrance exams at the beginning with the classification and aptitude But she knew the answer even before the thoughtful question was completed Under the fear of being washed out the weaker ones would not pass The Solar Guard could not afford to have cadets and later Solar Guard officers who could not function under pressure She began handing out the tubes and one by one the green clad candidates stepped to the front of the room to receive them Excuse me Ma am said one cadet falteringly If if I wash out as a cadet as a Solar Guard officer cadet he gulped several times does that mean there isn t any chance of becoming a spaceman No she answered kindly You can become a member of the enlisted Solar Guard if you can pass the acceleration tests Thank you Ma am replied the boy and turned away nervously Tom Corbett accepted the tube and hurried back to his seat He knew that this was the last hurdle He did not know that the papers had been prepared individually the tests given on the basis of the entrance exams he had taken back at New Chicago Primary Space School He opened the tube pulling out the four sheets printed on both sides of the paper and read the heading on the first ASTROGATION COMMUNICATIONS SIGNALS Radar He studied the first question What is the range of the Mark Nine radar scope and how far can a spaceship be successfully distinguished from other objects in space He read the question four times then pulled out a pencil and began to write Only the rustle of the papers or the occasional sigh of a cadet over a problem disturbed the silence in the high ceilinged room as the hundred odd cadets fought the questions There was a sudden stir in the room and Tom looked up to see Roger Manning walk to the slot and casually deposit his tube in the green bordered slot Then he leaned idly against the wall waiting for it to be returned As he stood there he spoke to doctor Dale who smiled and replied There was something about his attitude that made Tom boil So fast He glanced at his own papers He had hardly finished two sheets and thought he was doing fine He clenched his teeth and bent over the paper again redoubling his efforts to triangulate a fix on Regulus by using dead reckoning as a basis for his computations Suddenly a tall man wearing the uniform of a Solar Guard officer appeared in the back of the room As doctor Dale looked up and smiled a greeting he placed his finger on his lips Steve Strong Captain in the Solar Guard gazed around the room at the backs bent over busy pencils He did not smile remembering how only fifteen years before he had gone through the same torture racking his brains trying to adjust the measurements of a magnascope prism He was joined by a thin handsome young man Lieutenant Judson Saminsky and finally Warrant Officer McKenny They nodded silently in greeting It would be over soon Strong glanced at the clock over the desk Another ten minutes to go The line of boys at the slots grew until more than twenty stood there each waiting patiently nervously for his turn to drop the tube in the slot and receive in return the sealed cylinder that held his fate Still at his desk his face wet with sweat Astro looked at the question in front of him for the fifteenth time Estimate the time it would take a three hundred ton rocket ship with half filled tanks cruising at the most economical speed to make a trip from Titan to Venusport a Estimate size and maximum capacity of fuel tanks b Give estimate of speed ship would utilize He thought He slumped in his chair He stared at the ceiling He chewed his pencil Five seats away Tom stacked his examination sheets neatly twisted them into a cylinder and inserted them in the tube As he passed the line of desks and headed for the slot a hand caught his arm Tom turned to see Roger Manning grinning at him Worried spaceboy asked Roger easily Tom didn t answer He simply withdrew his arm You know said Roger you re really a nice kid It s a shame you won t make it But the rules specifically say no cabbageheads No talking doctor Dale called sharply from her desk Tom walked away and stood in the line at the slots He found himself wanting to pass more than anything in the world Please he breathed please just let me pass A soft gong began to sound doctor Dale stood up Time s up she announced Please put your papers in the tubes and drop them in the slot Tom turned to see Astro stuffing his papers in the thin cylinder disgustedly Phil Morgan came up and stood in back of Tom His face was flushed Everything O K Phil inquired Tom Easy as free falling in space replied the other cadet his soft Georgian drawl full of confidence How about you I m just hoping against hope The few remaining stragglers hurried up to the line Think Astro ll make it asked Phil I don t know answered Tom I saw him sweating over there like a man facing death I guess he is in a way Astro took his place in line and shrugged his shoulders when Tom leaned forward to give him a questioning look Go ahead Tom urged Phil Tom turned and dropped his tube into the green bordered slot and waited He stared straight at the wall in front of him hardly daring to breathe Presently the tube was returned in the red slot He took it turned it over in his hands and walked slowly back to his desk You re washed out cabbagehead Manning s whisper followed him Let s see if you can take it without bawling Tom s face burned and he fought an impulse to answer Manning with a stiff belt in the jaw But he kept walking reached his desk and sat down Astro the last to return to his desk held the tube out in front of him as if it were alive The room was silent as doctor Dale rose from her desk All right now boys she announced Inside the tubes you will find colored slips of paper Those of you who have red slips will remain here Those who find green slips will return to their quarters Blue will go with Captain Strong orange with Lieutenant Saminsky and purple with Warrant Officer McKenny Now please open the tubes There was a tinkling of metal caps and then the slight rustle of paper as each boy withdrew the contents of the tube before him Tom took a deep breath and felt inside for the paper He held his breath and pulled it out It was green He didn t know what it meant He looked around Phil was signaling to him holding up a blue slip Tom s heart skipped a beat Whatever the colors meant he and Phil were apart He quickly turned around and caught Astro s eye The big Venusian held up a green slip Tom s heart then nearly stopped beating Phil who had breezed through with such confidence held a blue slip and Astro who hadn t even finished the test held up the same color that he had It could only mean one thing Failure He felt the tears welling in his eyes but had no strength left to fight them back He looked up his eyes meeting the insolent stare of Roger Manning who was half turned in his seat Remembering the caustic warning of the confident cadet Tom fought back the flood in his eyes and glared back What would he tell his mother And his father And Billy his brother five years younger than himself whom he had promised to bring a flask of water from the Grand Canal on Mars And his sister Tom remembered the shining pride in her eyes when she kissed him good bye at the Stratoport as he left for Atom City From the front of the room McKenny s rasping voice jarred him back to the present Cadets staaaaaaaand to There was a shuffle of feet as the boys rose as one All the purple slips follow me he roared and turned toward the door The cadets with purple slips marched after him Lieutenant Saminsky stepped briskly to the front of the room Cadets with orange slips will please come with me he said casually and another group of cadets left the room From the rear of the room Captain Strong snapped out an order Blue slips will come with me He turned smartly and followed the last of Lieutenant Saminsky s cadets out of the room Tom looked around The room was nearly empty now He looked over at Astro and saw his big friend slumped moodily over against his desk Then suddenly he noticed Roger Manning The arrogant cadet was not smiling any longer He was staring straight ahead Before him on the desk Tom could see a green slip So he had failed too thought Tom grimly It was poor solace for the misery he felt doctor Dale stepped forward again Will the cadets holding green slips return to their quarters Those with red slips will remain in their seats she announced Tom found himself moving with difficulty As he walked through the door Astro joined him A look more eloquent than words passed between them and they made their way silently up the slidestairs back to their quarters Lying in his bunk hands under his head eyes staring into space Tom asked What happens now Sprawled on his bunk Astro didn t answer right away He merely gulped and swallowed hard I I don t know he finally stammered I just don t know What ll you do It s back to the hold of a Venusport freighter I guess I don t know Astro paused and looked at Tom What ll you do Go home said Tom simply Go home and and find a job Ever think about the enlisted Solar Guard Look at McKenny Yeah but I know how you feel sighed Astro Being in the enlisted section is like well being a passenger almost The door was suddenly flung open Haul off them bunks you blasted Earthworms McKenny stood in the doorway in his usual aggressive pose and Tom and Astro hit the floor together to stand at attention Where s the other cadet He went with Captain Strong sir answered Tom Oh said Mike And in a surprisingly soft tone he added You two pulled green slips eh Yes sir they replied together Well I don t know how you did it but congratulations You passed the classification tests Both of you Tom just looked at the scarlet clad stumpy warrant officer He couldn t believe his ears Suddenly he felt as if he had been lifted off his feet And then he realized that he was off his feet Astro was holding him over his head Then he dumped him in his bunk as easily as if he had been a child And at the same time the big Venusian let out a loud long earsplitting yell McKenny matched him with his bull like roar Plug that foghorn you blasted Earthworm You ll have the whole Academy in here thinking there s a murder By this time Tom was on his feet again standing in front of McKenny You mean we made it We re really in We re cadets That s right McKenny looked at a clip board in his hand and read Cadet Corbett Tom Qualified for control deck Cadet Astro Power deck Astro took a deep breath and started another yell but before he could let go McKenny clamped a big hand over his mouth You bellow like that again and I ll make meteor dust out of you Astro gulped and then matched Tom s grin with one that spread from ear to ear What happened to Philip Morgan asked Tom What color slip did he have Blue Anything besides green washed out replied Mike quickly Now let s see you have a replacement for Morgan in this unit An astrogator Greetings gentlemen drawled a voice that Tom recognized without even looking Allow me to introduce myself to my new unit mates My name is Manning Roger Manning But then we re old friends aren t we Stow that rocket wash Manning snapped Mike He glanced at the clock over the door You have an hour and forty five minutes until lunch time I suggest you take a walk around the Academy and familiarize yourselves with the arrangement of the buildings And then for the first time Tom saw the hard little spaceman smile I m glad you made it boys All three of you He paused and looked at each of them in turn And I can honestly say I m looking forward to the day when I can serve under you He snapped his back straight gave the three startled boys a crisp salute executed a perfect about face and marched out of the room And that drawled Roger strolling to the bunk nearest the window is the corniest bit of space gas I ve ever heard Listen Manning growled Astro spinning around quickly to face him Yeah purred Roger his eyes drawn to fine points hands hanging loosely at his sides What would you like me to listen to Cadet Astro The hulking cadet lunged at Manning but Tom quickly stepped between them Stow it both of you he shouted We re in this room together so we might as well make the best of it Of course Corbett of course replied Manning easily He turned his back on Astro who stood feet wide apart neck muscles tight and hands clenched in hamlike fists One of these days I ll break you in two Manning I ll close that fast talking mouth of yours for good Astro s voice was a low growl Roger stood near the window port and appeared to have forgotten the incident The light shining in from the hallway darkened and Tom turned to see three blue clad senior cadets arranged in a row just inside the door Congratulations gentlemen You re now qualified cadets of Space Academy said a redheaded lad about twenty one My name is Al Dixon he turned to his left and right and these are cadets Bill Houseman and Rodney Withrop Hiya replied Tom Glad to know you I m Tom Corbett This is Astro and Roger Manning Astro shook hands the three senior cadets giving a long glance at the size of the hand he offered Roger came forward smartly and shook hands with a smile We re sorta like a committee began Dixon We ve come to sign you up for the Academy sports program They made themselves comfortable in the room You have a chance to take part in three sports Free fall wrestling mercuryball and space chess Dixon glanced at Houseman and Withrop From the looks of Cadet Astro free fall wrestling should be child s play for him Astro merely grinned Mercuryball is pretty much like the old game of soccer explained Houseman But inside the ball is a smaller ball filled with mercury making it take crazy dips and turns You have to be pretty fast even to touch it Sounds like you have to be a little Mercurian yourself smiled Tom You do replied Dixon Oh yes you three play as a unit Competition starts in a few days So if you ve never played before you might go down to the gym and start practicing You mentioned space chess asked Roger What s that It s really nothing more than maneuvers Space maneuvers said Dixon A glass case a seven foot cube is divided by light shafts into smaller cubes of equal shape and size Each man has a complete space squadron Three model rocket cruisers six destroyers and ten scouts The ships are filled with gas to make them float and your power is derived from magnetic force The problem is to get a combination of cruisers and destroyers and scouts into a space section where it could knock out your opponent s ships You mean interrupted Astro you ve got to keep track of all those ships at once Don t worry Astro commented Roger quickly You use your muscles to win for dear old forty two D in free fall wrestling Corbett here can pound down the grassy field for a goal in mercuryball and I ll do the brainwork of space chess The three visiting cadets exchanged sharp glances Everybody plays together Manning said Dixon You three take part in each sport as a unit Of course nodded Roger Of course as a unit The three cadets stood up shook hands all around and left Tom immediately turned to Manning What was the idea of that crack about brains Manning slouched over to the window port and said over his shoulder I don t know how you and your king sized friend here passed the classifications test Corbett and I don t care But as you say we re a unit So we might as well make adjustments He turned to face them with a cold stare I know this Academy like the palm of my hand he went on Never mind how just take it for granted I know it I m here for the ride For a special reason I wouldn t care to have you know I ll get my training and then pull out He took a step forward his face a mask of bitterness So from now on you two guys leave me alone You bore me to death with your emotional childish allegiance to this this he paused and spit the last out cynically space kindergarten 
3088-5438-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER three I just can t understand it Joan said Captain Steve Strong tossing the paper on his circular desk The psychographs of Corbett Manning and Astro fit together like gears And yet
3088-5438-0001	train-other-500	The Solar Guard officer suddenly rose and walked over to a huge window that filled the entire north wall of his office a solid sheet of glass that extended from the high domed ceiling to the translucent flooring
none	none	 Through the window he stared down moodily toward the grassy quadrangle where at the moment several hundred cadets were marching in formation under a hot sun And yet continued Strong every morning for the last three weeks I ve got a report from McKenny about some sort of friction between them I think it ll work out Steve answered the pretty girl in the uniform of the Solar Guard seated in an easy chair on the other side of the desk Joan Dale held the distinction of being the first woman ever admitted into the Solar Guard in a capacity other than administrative work Her experiments in atomic fissionables was the subject of a recent scientific symposium held on Mars Over fifty of the leading scientists of the Solar Alliance had gathered to study her latest theory on hyperdrive and had unanimously declared her ideas valid She had been offered the chair as Master of Physics at the Academy as a result giving her access to the finest laboratory in the tri planet society Now facing the problem of personality adjustment in Unit forty two D she sat across the desk from her childhood friend Steve Strong and frowned 
3088-5438-0003	train-other-500	What s happened this time Manning He paused It seems to be all Manning
none	none	 You mean he s the more aggressive of the three No not necessarily Corbett shows signs of being a number one spaceman And that big cadet Astro 
3088-5438-0004	train-other-500	Strong flashed a white smile that contrasted with his deep space tan I don t think he could make a manual mistake on the power deck if he tried You know I actually saw him put an auxiliary rocket motor together blindfolded The pretty scientist smiled
none	none	 I could have told you that after one look at his classification tests How On questions concerning the power deck operations he was letter perfect 
3088-5438-0005	train-other-500	And on the others Astrogation and control deck He just skimmed by But even where the problem involved fuel power supply of energy
none	none	 he offered some very practical answer to the problem 
3088-5438-0006	train-other-500	She smiled Astro is as much an artist on that power deck as Liddy Tamal doing Juliet in the stereos Yes mused Strong
none	none	 And Corbett is the same on the control deck 
3088-5438-0007	train-other-500	Good instinctive intelligence That boy soaks up knowledge like a sponge Facile mind quick to grasp the essentials She smiled again
none	none	 Seems to me I remember a few years back when a young lieutenant successfully put down a mutiny in space and at his promotion to captain the citation included the fact that he was quick to grasp the essentials 
3088-5438-0008	train-other-500	Strong grinned sheepishly A routine flight to Titan had misfired into open rebellion by the crew Using a trick picked up in ancient history books of sea roving pirates in the seventeenth century
none	none	 he had joined the mutiny gained control of the ship sought out the ring leaders and restored discipline And Manning asked Strong What about Manning One of the hardest brightest minds I ve come across in the Academy He has a brain like a steel trap He never misses Then do you think he s acting up because Corbett is the nominal head of the unit Does he feel that he should be the command cadet in the control deck instead of Corbett No replied doctor Dale Not at all I m sure he intentionally missed problems about control deck and command in his classification test He concentrated on astrogation communications and signal radar He wanted to be assigned to the radar deck And he turned in the best paper I ve ever read from a cadet to get the post Strong threw up his hands Then what is it Here we have a unit on paper at least that could be number one A good combination of brains experience and knowledge Everything that s needed And what is the result Friction Suddenly a buzzer sounded and on Steve Strong s desk a small teleceiver screen glowed into life Gradually the stern face of Commander Walters emerged Sorry to disturb you Steve Can you spare me a minute Of course Commander replied Strong Is anything wrong Very wrong Steve I ve been looking over the daily performance reports on Unit forty two D doctor Dale and I have just been discussing that situation sir A relieved expression passed over the commander s face Good I wanted to get your opinions before I broke up the unit No sir said Strong quickly Don t do that Oh replied the commander On the screen he could be seen settling back in his chair And why not Well Joan er doctor Dale and myself feel that the boys of Unit forty two D make it potentially the best in the Academy if they stay together sir Walters considered this for a moment and then asked thoughtfully Give me one good reason why the unit shouldn t be washed out The academy needs boys like this sir Steve answered flatly Needs their intelligence their experience They may be a problem now but if they re handled right they ll turn out to be ace spacemen they ll The commander interrupted You re pretty sold on them aren t you Steve Yes sir I am You know tomorrow all the units will be assigned to their personal instructors Yes sir And I ve selected Lieutenant Wolcheck for this unit He s tough and smart I think he s just the man for the job I don t agree Steve Wolcheck is a fine officer and with any other unit there d be no question But I think we have a better man for the job Whom do you suggest sir The commander leaned forward in his chair You Steve Me What do you think Joan I wanted to make the same suggestion Commander smiled Joan But I didn t know if Steve really would want the assignment Well what about it Steve asked the commander This is no reflection on your present work But if you re so convinced that forty two D is worth the trouble then take them over and mold them into spacemen Otherwise I ll have to wash them out Strong hesitated a moment All right sir I ll do my best On the screen the stern lines in Commander Walters face relaxed and he smiled approvingly Thanks Steve he said softly I was hoping you d say that Keep me posted The screen blacked out abruptly and Captain Strong turned to Joan Dale a troubled frown wrinkling his brow Huh I really walked into that one didn t I he muttered It isn t going to be easy Steve she replied Easy He snorted and walked over to the window to stare blankly at the quadrangle below I d almost rather try a landing on the hot side of Mercury It would be icy compared to this situation You can do it Steve I know you can Joan moved to his side to place a reassuring hand on his arm The Solar Guard officer didn t answer immediately He kept on staring at the Academy grounds and buildings spread out before him When he finally spoke his voice rang with determination I ve got to do it Joan I ve got to whip those boys into a unit Not only for their sakes but for the sake of the Academy CHAPTER four The first three weeks of an Earthworm s life at Space Academy are filled with never ending physical training and conditioning to meet the rigors of rocket flight and life on distant planets And under the grueling pressure of fourteen hour days filled with backbreaking exercises and long forced marches very few of the boys can find anything more desirable than sleep and more sleep Under this pressure the friction in Unit forty two D became greater and greater Roger and Astro continually needled each other with insults and Tom gradually slipped into the role of arbiter Returning from a difficult afternoon of endless marching in the hot sun with the prospect of an evening of free fall wrestling before them the three cadets dragged themselves wearily onto the slidestairs leading to their quarters their muscles screaming for rest Another day like this began Astro listlessly and I m going to melt down to nothing Doesn t McKenny have a heart No just an asteroid Tom grumbled He ll never know how close he came to getting a space boot in the face when he woke us up this morning Oh man Was I tired Stop complaining will you snarled Roger All I ve heard from you two space crawlers is gripes and complaints If I wasn t so tired Roger said Astro I d give you something to gripe about A flat lip Knock it off Astro said Tom wearily The role of keeping them apart was getting tiresome The trouble with you Astro pursued Roger is that you think with your muscles instead of your head Yeah I know And you ve got an electronic calculator for a brain All you have to do is push a button and you get the answers all laid out for you They had reached their quarters now and were stripping off their sweat soaked uniforms in preparation for a cool shower You know Roger continued Astro you ve got a real problem ahead of you Any problem you think I have is no problem at all was the cool reply Yes it is insisted Astro When you re ready for your first hop in space you won t be able to make it Why not They don t have a space helmet in the Academy large enough to fit that overinflated head of yours Roger turned slowly and spoke to Tom without looking at him Close the door Corbett Why asked Tom puzzled Because I don t want any interruptions I m going to take that big hunk of Venusian space junk apart Anything you say you bigmouthed squirt roared Astro Hey knock it off yelled Tom jumping between them and grabbing Astro s arm If you guys don t lay off each other you re going to be thrown out of the Academy and I ll be thrown out with you I ll be blasted if I ll suffer for your mistakes That s a very interesting statement Corbett A deep voice purred from the doorway and the three boys whirled to see Captain Strong walk into the room his black and gold uniform fitting snugly across the shoulders betraying their latent strength Stand to all of you As the boys quickly snapped to attention Strong eyed them slowly and then moved casually around the room He picked up a book looked out of the window port pushed a boot to one side and finally removed Tom s sweat stained uniform from a chair and sat down The cadets held their rigid poses backs stiff eyes looking straight ahead Corbett snapped Strong Yes sir What was the meaning of that little speech I heard a moment ago I ah don t quite understand what you mean sir stumbled Tom I think you do said Strong I want to know what provoked you to make such a statement I d rather not answer that sir Don t get cute Corbett barked Strong I know what s going on in this unit Were Manning and Astro squaring off to fight Yes sir replied Tom slowly All right At ease all of you said Strong The three boys relaxed and faced the officer Manning do you want to be a successful cadet here at Space Academy Yes sir answered Roger Then why don t you act like it asked Strong Is there something wrong with my work sir Tom recognized the smooth Manning confidence begin to appear and he wondered if Captain Strong would be taken in Everything s wrong with your work barked Strong You re too smart Know too much He stopped short and then added softly with biting sarcasm Why do you know so much Cadet Manning Roger hesitated I ve studied very hard Studied for years to become a Space Cadet he replied Just to be a cadet or a successful cadet and a Solar Guard officer To be successful at both sir Tell me Manning do you have any ideas on life That s a pretty general question sir Do you mean life as a whole or a specific part of life They re fencing with each other thought Tom He held his breath as Strong eyed the relaxed confident cadet A spaceman is supposed to have but one idea in life Manning And that idea is space I see sir replied Roger as a faraway look came into his eyes Yes sir I have some ideas about life in space I d like to hear them requested Strong coldly Very well sir Roger relaxed his shoulders and leaned against the bunk I believe space is the last frontier of man Earthman It s the last place for man to conquer It is the greatest adventure of all time and I want to be a part of that adventure Thank you Manning Strong s voice was even colder than before But as it happens I can read too That was a direct quote from the closing paragraph of Jon Builker s book on his trip to the stars He paused Couldn t you think of anything original to say Roger flushed and gritted his teeth Tom could hardly keep himself from laughing Captain Strong had scored heavily The Solar Guard officer then turned his attention to Astro Astro where in the name of the universe did you get the idea you could be an officer in the Solar Guard I can handle anything with push in it sir Astro smiled his confidence Know anything about hyperdrive Uhh no sir Then you can t handle everything with as you say push in it snapped Strong Er no sir answered Astro his face clouding over There was a long moment of silence while Strong lifted one knee swung it over the arm of his chair and looked steadily at the two half naked boys in front of him He smiled lazily Well for two Earthworms you ve certainly been acting like a couple of space aces He let that soak in while he toyed with the gleaming Academy ring on his finger He allowed it to flash in the light of the window port then slipped it off and flipped it over to Corbett Know what that is he asked the curly haired cadet Yes sir replied Tom Your Academy graduation ring Uh huh Now give it to our friend from Venus Tom gingerly handed Astro the ring Try it on Astro invited Strong The big cadet tried it on all of his fingers but couldn t get it past the first joint Give it to Manning Roger accepted the ring and held it in the palm of his hand He looked at it with a hard stare then dropped it in the outstretched hand of the Solar Guard officer Replacing it on his finger Strong spoke casually All units design their own rings There are only three like this in the universe One is drifting around in space on the finger of Sam Jones Another is blasting a trail to the stars on the finger of Addy Garcia He held up his finger This is the third one Strong got up and began to pace in front of the boys Addy Garcia couldn t speak a word of English when he first came to the Academy And for eight weeks Sam and I sweated to figure out what he was talking about I think we spent over a hundred hours in the galley doing KP because Addy kept getting us fouled up But that didn t bother us because we were a unit Unit thirty three V Class of twenty three thirty eight Strong turned to face the silent cadets Sam Jones was pretty much like you Astro Not as big but with the same love for that power deck He could always squeeze a few extra pounds of thrust out of those rockets What he knew about astrogation and control you could stick on the head of a pin On long flights he wouldn t even come up to the control deck He just sat in the power hole singing loud corny songs about the Arkansas mountains to those atomic motors He was a real power deck man But he was a unit man first The only reason I m here to tell you about it is because he never forgot the unit He died saving Addy and myself The room was still Down the long hall the lively chatter of other cadets could be heard as they showered and prepared for dinner In the distance the rumble of the slidewalks and test firing of rockets at the spaceport was dim subdued powerful The unit is the backbone of the Academy continued Strong It was set up to develop three men to handle a Solar Guard rocket cruiser Three men who could be taught to think feel and act as one intelligent brain Three men who would respect each other and who could depend on each other Tomorrow you begin your real education You will be supervised and instructed personally Many men have contributed to the knowledge that will be placed in front of you brave intelligent men who blasted through the atmosphere with a piece of metal under them for a spaceship and a fire in their tail for rockets But everything they accomplished goes to waste if the unit can t become a single personality It must be a single personality or it doesn t exist The unit is the ultimate of hundreds of years of research and progress But you have to fight to create it and keep it living Either you want it or you get out of the Academy Captain Strong turned away momentarily and Tom and Astro looked at Roger significantly Stand to The three boys snapped to attention as the wide shouldered captain addressed them again Tomorrow you begin to learn how to think as a single brain To act with combined intelligence as one person You either make up your minds to start tomorrow or you report to Commander Walters and resign There isn t any room here for individuals He stepped to the door and paused One more thing I ve been given the job of making you over into spacemen I m your unit commander If you re still here in the morning I ll accept that as your answer If you think you can t take he paused what I m going to dish out then you know what you can do And if you stay you ll be the best unit or I ll break you in two in the attempt Unit dis missed And he was gone The three cadets stood still not knowing quite what to do or say Finally Tom stepped before Astro and Roger Well he said quietly how about it you guys Are you going to lay off each other now Astro flushed but Roger eyed Corbett coolly Were you really taken in with that space gas Tom He turned to the shower room If you were then you re more childish than I thought A man died to save another man s life Roger Sam Jones I never knew him But I ve met Captain Strong and I believe that he would have done the same thing for Jones Very noble commented Roger from the doorway But I ll tell you this Manning said Tom following him fighting for self control I wouldn t want to have to depend on you to save my life And I wouldn t want to be faced with the situation where I would have to sacrifice mine to save yours Roger turned and glared at Tom The Academy regs say that the man on the control deck is the boss of the unit But I have my private opinion of the man who has that job now What s that supposed to mean asked Tom Just this spaceboy There s a gym below where I ll take you or your big friend on together or one at a time He paused a cold smile twisting his lips And that offer is good as of right now Tom and Astro looked at each other I m afraid began Astro slowly that you wouldn t stand much of a chance with me Manning So if Tom wants the chore of buttoning your lip he s welcome to it Thanks Astro said Tom evenly It ll be my pleasure Without another word the three cadets walked out of the door CHAPTER five Will this do Manning asked Tom The three boys were in a secluded corner of the gym a large hall on the fourteenth floor of the dormitory building At the far end of the gym a group of cadets had just finished a game of mercuryball and were sauntering to the showers When the last boy had disappeared the floor was deserted except for Tom Roger and Astro This will do fine Corbett said Roger The boxing ring had been taken down the week before to make room for drills and the physical exercises of the Earthworms so the three boys had to improvise a ring They dragged four large tumbling mats together spreading them side by side to form a square close to the size of an actual ring Astro went to one of the small lockers under the balcony and returned with two pairs of boxing gloves Here offered Astro put these on Gloves asked Roger in a voice of mock surprise I thought this was going to be a battle of blood Any way you want it Manning Any way at all said Tom You re going to use gloves growled Astro I don t want anybody killed He threw a pair at each of them There ll be three minute rounds with one minute rest he continued Go off the mats and you ll be counted out Usual rules otherwise Any questions Clear to me Astro said Tom Let s go nodded Roger One more thing said Astro I hope Tom pins your ears back Manning But I m going to see that both of you get a fair deal So keep the punches up and fight it out All right time The two boys moved carefully to the center of the improvised ring their guards up while Astro stood off the edge of the mat and watched the sweeping second hand of his wrist chronograph Shuffling forward Tom pushed out a probing left and then tried to cross his right but Manning stepped back easily countering with a hard left to Tom s heart I forgot to tell you Corbett he called out I m considered a counterpuncher I always He was cut off with a sharp left to the face that snapped his head back and his lips curled in a smile of condescension Good very good Corbett Then with lightning speed and the grace of a cat Roger slipped inside Tom s guard punching hard and true A left a right and a left pounded into Tom s mid section and as he gave way momentarily Tom s face clouded over They circled Tom kept leading with sharp lefts that popped in and out like a piston always connecting and keeping Roger off balance Roger concentrated on penetrating Tom s defense methodically pounding his ribs and heart and trying to wear him down Time bawled Astro The two boys dropped their hands and turned back to their corners They squatted on the floor breathing slowly and easily Astro stood in the middle of the ring glaring at both of them in turn and shaking his head Huh I expected to see you two try to wallop each other into meteor dust Keep fighting like that and we ll be here all night Talk to Corbett sneered Roger Looks like he s afraid to mix it up You fight your way Roger and I ll fight mine replied Tom his voice cold and impersonal Time suddenly yelled Astro and stepped back off the mat The two cadets jumped to their feet and met in the center of the ring again With a bull like rush Roger changed tactics and began to rain punches all over Tom s body but the curly haired cadet stood his ground coolly picking some off in mid air with his gloves and sliding under the others Then as Roger slowed down Tom took the offensive popping his left into his opponent s face steadily and methodically while keeping his right cocked for a clear opening to the chin Roger danced in and out watching Tom s left as though it was a snake and trying unsuccessfully to get through his guard But the sharp lefts kept snapping his head back and his face began to redden not only from the sting of the blows but with the mounting fury of his frustration Suddenly as Astro raised his arm to call time for the end of the round Roger jumped forward and rained another series of harmless blows on Tom s shoulders and arms But then as the big Venusian called time he stepped back and Tom dropped his guard Instantly Roger threw a right with all his weight behind it It landed flush on Tom s jaw and he dropped sprawling full length on the mats and lying still Smiling Roger sauntered to his corner while Astro charged in and bent over the fallen cadet None of that Astro snapped Roger Since when does a referee take sides Leave him alone If he doesn t come out for the next round you have to count him out The big Venusian straightened and walked menacingly toward Roger s corner You hit him after I called time he growled So I have to take you on too huh Roger jumped to his feet All right come on you big blast of space gas Wait Astro wait Astro suddenly wheeled around to see Tom shaking his head weakly and trying to rise up on his elbows He rushed back to the fallen boy s side Roger shouted at him angrily Leave him alone Ahhh go blow your jets was Astro s snarling reply as he bent over Tom who was now sitting up Tom are you O K Yeah yeah he replied weakly But stay out of this You re the referee How much time left Twenty seconds said Astro Roger smacked you after I called time If he did I didn t know a thing about it I was out Tom managed a cold smile Nice punch Roger Ten seconds said Astro stepping back off the mat Thanks for the compliment Corbett Roger eyed the other cadet speculatively But are you sure you want to go on I was saved by the bell wasn t I Yeah sure but if you d rather quit Time cried Astro Tom rose to his feet shook his head and brought up his hands He wasn t a moment too soon Roger had rushed across the mat trying to land another murderous right Tom brought up his shoulder just in time slipping with the punch and at the same time bringing up a terrific left to Roger s open mid section Manning let out a grunt and clinched Tom pursued his advantage pumping rights and lefts to the body and he could feel the arrogant cadet weakening Suddenly Roger crowded in close wrestling Tom around so that Astro was on the opposite side of the mat then brought up his head under Tom s chin The pop of Tom s teeth could be heard all over the great hall Roger quickly stepped back and back pedaled until Astro called time Thanks for teaching me that one Roger Learned two tricks from you today said Tom breathing heavily but with the same cold smile on his face That s all right Corbett Any time said Manning What tricks asked Astro He looked suspiciously at Manning who was doubled over finding it hard to breath Nothing I can t handle in time said Tom looking at Roger Time called Astro and stepped off the mat The two boys got to their feet slowly The pace was beginning to show on them and they boxed carefully The boys were perfectly matched Tom constantly snapping Roger s head back with the jolting left jabs and following to the head or heart with a right cross And Roger counterpunching slipping hooks and body punches in under Tom s long leads It was a savage fight The three weeks of hard physical training had conditioned the boys perfectly At the end of the twelfth round both boys showed many signs of wear Roger s cheeks were as red as the glow of a jet blast deflector from the hundreds of lefts Tom had pumped into his face while Tom s ribs and mid section were bruised and raw where Roger s punches had landed successfully It couldn t last much longer thought Astro as he called time for the beginning of the thirteenth round Roger quickened his pace dancing in and out trying to move in under Tom s lefts but suddenly Tom caught him with a right hand that was cocked and ready It staggered him and he fell back covering up Tom pressed his advantage showering rights and lefts everywhere he could find an opening In desperation his knees buckling Roger clinched tightly quickly brought up his open glove and gouged his thumb into Tom s eyes Tom pulled back instinctively pawing at his eye with his right glove Roger spotting the opening took immediate advantage of it shooting a hard looping right that landed flush on Tom s jaw Tom went down Unaware of Roger s tactics Astro jumped into the ring and his arm pumped the deadly count One two three four It was going to be tough if Roger won Astro thought as he counted Five six Arrogant enough now he would be impossible to live with Seven eight Tom struggled up to a sitting position and stared angrily at his opponent in the far corner Nine With one convulsive effort Tom regained his feet His left eye was closed and swollen his right bleary with fatigue He wobbled drunkenly on his feet But he pressed forward This was one fight he had to win Roger moved in for the finish He slammed a left into Tom s shell trying to find an opening for the last finishing blow But Tom remained in his shell forearms picking off the smashes that even hurt his arms as he waited for the strength to return to his legs and arms and his head to clear He knew that he couldn t go another round He wouldn t be able to see It would have to be this round and he had to beat Roger Not because he wanted to but because Roger was a member of the unit And he had to keep the unit together He circled his unit mate with care shielding himself from the shower of rights and lefts that rained around him He waited waited for the one perfect opening Come on Open up and fight Corbett panted Roger Tom snapped his right in reply He noticed that Roger moved in with a hook every time he tried to cross his right He waited his legs began to shake Roger circled and Tom shot out the left again dropped into a semicrouch and feinted with the right cross Roger moved in cocking his fist for the left hook and Tom was ready for him He threw the right threw it with every ounce of strength left in his body Roger was caught moving in and took the blow flush on the chin He stopped as if poleaxed His eyes turned glassy and then he dropped to the mat He was out cold Astro didn t even bother to count Tom squatted on the mat beside Roger and rubbed the blond head with his glove Get some water Astro he said gasping for breath I m glad I don t have to fight this guy again And I ll tell you something else What asked Astro Anybody that wants to win as much as this guy does is going to win and I want to have him on my side Astro merely grunted as he turned toward the water cooler Maybe he called back But he ought to read a book of rules first When he came back to the mat with the water Roger was sitting up biting the knots of the laces on his gloves Tom helped him and when the soggy leather was finally discarded he stuck out his hand Well Roger I m ready to forget everything we ve said and start all over again Roger looked at the extended hand for a moment his eyes blank and expressionless Then with a quick movement he slapped it away and lurched to his feet Go blow your jets he snarled and turning his back on them stumbled across the gym Tom watched him go bewilderment and pain mirrored on his face I thought sure this would work Astro he sighed I thought he d come to his senses if Nothing ll make that space creep come to his senses Astro broke in disgustedly At least nothing short of an atomic war head Come on Let s get you cleaned up Putting his arm around Tom s shoulder the big Venusian led him across the floor of the deserted gym and as they disappeared through the automatic sliding doors a tall figure in the uniform of the Solar Guard stepped out of the shadows on the balcony above It was Captain Strong He stood silently at the rail looking down at the mats and the soggy discarded boxing gloves Tom had won the fight he thought but he had lost the war The unit was now farther apart than it had ever been Illustration CHAPTER six Well Steve how s everything going 
3088-5441-0000	train-other-500	Captain Steve Strong didn t answer right away He returned the salute of a Space Cadet passing on the opposite slidewalk and then faced Commander Walters who stood beside him eyeing him quizzically Things are shaping up pretty well Commander he replied finally with an air of unconcern
none	none	 The Earthworm units buckling down to business Commander Walters voice matched Strong s in nonchalance 
3088-5441-0001	train-other-500	Yes I d say so sir Speaking generally of course
none	none	 Strong felt the back of his neck begin to flush as Walters kept eyeing him 
3088-5441-0002	train-other-500	And speaking specifically Steve
none	none	 Why ah what do you mean sir 
3088-5441-0003	train-other-500	Let s stop fencing with each other Steve
none	none	 Walters spoke kindly but firmly What about Manning and Unit forty two D 
3088-5441-0004	train-other-500	Are those boys learning to work together or not And I want facts not hopes
none	none	 Strong hesitated trying to word his reply In these weeks that had followed Tom s fight with Roger in the gym there had been no further incidents of open warfare Roger s attitude once openly defiant had now subsided into a stream of never ending sarcasm The sting had been taken out of his attack and he seemed satisfied merely to annoy Astro had withdrawn into a shell refusing to allow Roger to bother him and only an occasional rumble of anger indicated his true feelings toward his troublesome unit mate Tom maintained his role of peacemaker and daily in many ways showed his capacity for leadership by steering his unit mates away from any storm provoking activities 
3088-5441-0005	train-other-500	Strong finally broke the silence
none	none	 It s difficult to answer that question with facts Commander Walters 
3088-5441-0006	train-other-500	Why insisted Walters Well nothing s really happened answered Steve
none	none	 You mean nothing since the fight in the gym 
3088-5441-0007	train-other-500	Oh Strong flushed You know about that Commander Walters smiled Black eyes and faces that looked like raw beef don t go unnoticed Steve Uhh no sir was Strong s lame reply What I want to know is pursued Walters
3088-5441-0008	train-other-500	did the fight prove anything Did the boys get it out of their systems and are they concentrating on becoming a unit
none	none	 Right now Commander they re concentrating on passing their manuals 
3088-5441-0009	train-other-500	They realize that they have to work together to get through this series of tests Why doctor Dale told me the other day that she s sure Tom s been giving Roger a few pointers on control deck operation
none	none	 And one night I found Manning giving Astro a lecture in compression ratios Of course Manning s way of talking is a way that would confuse the Venusian more than it would help him but at least they weren t snarling at each other Hmm 
3088-5441-0010	train-other-500	Walters nodded Sounds hopeful but still not conclusive After all they have to help each other in the manuals If one member of the unit fails it will reflect on the marks of the other two
3088-5441-0011	train-other-500	and they might be washed out too Even the deadliest enemies will unite to save their lives Perhaps sir replied Strong But we re not dealing with deadly enemies now These are three boys with three distinct personalities who ve been lumped together in strange surroundings
3088-5441-0012	train-other-500	It takes time and patience to make a team that will last for years
none	none	 You may have the patience Steve but the Academy hasn t the time 
3088-5441-0013	train-other-500	Commander Walters was suddenly curt When does Unit forty two D take its manuals This afternoon sir replied Strong I m on my way over to the examination hall right now Very well I won t take any action yet I ll wait for the results of the tests
3088-5441-0014	train-other-500	Perhaps they will solve both our problems See you later Steve
none	none	 Turning abruptly Commander Walters stepped off the slidewalk onto the steps of the Administration Building 
3088-5441-0015	train-other-500	and rapidly disappeared from view Left alone Strong pondered the commander s parting statement
none	none	 The implication was clear If the unit failed to make a grade high enough to warrant the trouble it took keeping it together it would be broken up 
3088-5441-0016	train-other-500	Or even worse one or more of the boys would be dismissed from the Academy A few minutes later Strong arrived in the examination hall
none	none	 a large barren room with a small door in each of the three walls other than the one containing the entrance Tom Corbett was waiting in the center of the hall and saluted smartly as Strong approached 
3088-5441-0017	train-other-500	Cadet Corbett reporting for manual examination sir Stand easy Corbett replied Strong returning the salute
none	none	 This is going to be a rough one 
3088-5441-0018	train-other-500	Are you fully prepared I believe so sir Tom s voice wasn t too steady A fleeting smile passed over Strong s lips then he continued You ll take the control deck examination first
none	none	 Manning will be next on the radar bridge and Astro last on the power deck They ll be here according to schedule sir 
3088-5441-0019	train-other-500	Very well Follow me Strong walked quickly to the small door in the left wall
none	none	 Tom staying a respectful step behind When they reached the door the officer pressed a button in the wall beside it and the door slid open 
3088-5441-0020	train-other-500	All right Corbett Inside Strong nodded toward the interior of the room The boy stepped in quickly then stopped in amazement All around him was a maze of instruments and controls And in the center twin pilot s chairs Captain Strong
none	none	 Tom was so surprised that he could hardly get the words out 
3088-5441-0021	train-other-500	It s it s a real control deck Strong smiled
none	none	 As real as we can make it Corbett without allowing the building to blast off 
3088-5441-0022	train-other-500	He gestured toward the pilot s chairs Take your place and strap in Yes sir His eyes still wide with wonder Tom stepped over to the indicated chair and Strong followed him leaning casually against the other He watched the young cadet nervously adjust his seat strap and put a comforting hand on his shoulder
none	none	 Nervous Corbett Yes sir just a little replied Tom Don t worry said Strong You should have seen the way I came into this room fifteen years ago My cadet officer had to help me into the control pilot s seat Tom managed a fleeting smile Now Corbett Strong s voice became businesslike as you know these manual tests are the last tests before actually blasting off In the past weeks you cadets have been subjected to every possible examination to discover any flaw in your work that might later crop up in space This manual operations test of the control board like Manning s on the radar bridge and Astro s on the power deck is designed to test you under simulated space conditions If you pass this test your next step is real space Yes sir I warn you it isn t easy And if you fail you personally will wash out and if other members of the unit do not get a high enough mark to average out to a passing grade for all of you you fail as a unit I understand sir said Tom All right then we ll begin Your crew is aboard the air lock is closed What is the first thing you do Adjust the air circulating system to ensure standard Earth conditions How do you do that By pressing this button which will activate the servo units They automatically keep the circulating pumps in operation based on thermostatic readings from the main gauge Tom pointed to a black clock face with a luminous white hand and numbers All right carry on said Strong Tom reached over the huge control board that extended around him for some two feet on three sides He placed a nervous finger on a small button waited for the gauge below to register with a swing of the hand and then released it All pressures steady sir What next Check the crew sir all departments replied Tom Carry on said Strong Tom reached out and pulled a microphone toward him All hands Station check said Tom and then was startled to hear a metallic voice answer him Power deck ready for blast off And then another voice Radar deck ready for blast off Tom leaned back in the pilot s seat and turned to the captain All stations ready sir Good What next asked Strong Ask spaceport tower for blast off clearance Strong nodded Tom turned back to the microphone and without looking punched a button in front of him Rocket cruiser He paused and turned back to Strong What name do I give sir Strong smiled Noah s Ark Rocket cruiser Noah s Ark to spaceport control Request blast off clearance and orbit Once again a thin metallic voice answered him and gave the necessary instructions On and on through every possible command condition or decision that would be placed in front of him Tom guided his imaginary ship on its imaginary flight through space For two hours he pushed buttons snapped switches and jockeyed controls He gave orders and received them from the thin metallic voices They answered him with such accuracy and sometimes with seeming hesitation that Tom found it difficult to believe that they were only electronically controlled recording devices Once when supposedly blasting through space at three quarters space speed he received a warning from the radar bridge of an approaching asteroid He asked for a course change but in reply received only static Believing the recording to have broken down he turned inquiringly to Captain Strong but received only a blank stare in return Tom hesitated for a split second then turned back to the controls He quickly flipped the teleceiver button on and began plotting the course of the approaching asteroid ignoring for the moment his other duties on the control deck When he had finished he gave the course shift to the power deck and ordered a blast on the starboard jet He waited for the course change saw it register on the gauges in front of him then continued his work Strong suddenly leaned over and clapped him on the back enthusiastically Good work Corbett That broken recording was put there intentionally to trap you Not one cadet in twenty would have had the presence of mind you showed in plotting the course of that asteroid yourself Thank you sir stammered Tom That s all the test is over Return to your quarters He came over and laid a hand on Tom s shoulder And don t worry Corbett While it isn t customary to tell a cadet I think you deserve it You ve passed with a perfect score I have sir You mean I really passed Next step is Manning said Strong You ve done as much as one cadet can do Thank you sir 
3088-5441-0023	train-other-500	Tom could only repeat it over and over thank you sir thank you Dazed he saluted his superior and turned to the door
none	none	 Two hours in the pilot s chair had made him dizzy 
3088-5441-0024	train-other-500	But he was happy Five minutes later he slammed back the sliding door and entered the quarters of forty two D with a lusty shout Meet Space Cadet Corbett an Earthworm who s just passed his control deck manual operations exam
none	none	 Astro looked up from a book of tables on astrogation and gave Tom a wan smile 
3088-5441-0025	train-other-500	Congratulations Tom he said and turned back to his book
none	none	 adding bitterly but if I don t get these tables down by this afternoon for my power deck manual 
3088-5441-0026	train-other-500	you re sunk Say what s going on here asked Tom Where s Roger Didn t he help you with them
none	none	 He left Said he had to see someone before taking his radar bridge manual He helped me a little But when I d ask him a question he d just rattle the answer off so fast well I just couldn t follow him Suddenly slamming the book shut he got up Me and these tables he indicated the book 
3088-5441-0027	train-other-500	just don t mix What s the trouble Ah I can get the easy ones about astrogation They re simple
none	none	 But it s the ones where I have to combine it with the power deck 
3088-5441-0028	train-other-500	Well I mean what specifically asked Tom softly
none	none	 For instance I ve got to find the ratio for compression on the main firing tubes using a given amount of fuel heading for a given destination and taking a given time for the passage But that s control deck operations as well as astrogation and power exclaimed Tom 
3088-5441-0029	train-other-500	Yeah I know answered Astro
none	none	 but I ve still got to be able to do it If anything happened to you two guys and I didn t know how to get you home 
3088-5441-0030	train-other-500	then what Tom hesitated Astro was right
none	none	 Each member of the unit had to depend on the other in any emergency 
3088-5441-0031	train-other-500	And if one of them failed Tom saw why the ground manuals were so important now Look offered Tom Suppose we go over the whole thing again together Maybe you re fouled up on the basic concept Tom grabbed a chair hitched it close to the desk and pulled Astro down beside him
3088-5441-0032	train-other-500	He opened the book and began studying the problem Now look you have twenty two tons of fuel and considering the position of your ship in space
none	none	 As the two boys their shoulders hunched over the table 
3088-5441-0033	train-other-500	began reviewing the table of ratios
none	none	 across the quadrangle in the examination hall Roger Manning stood in a replica of a rocket ship s radar bridge 
3088-5441-0034	train-other-500	and faced Captain Strong Cadet Manning reporting for manual examination sir
none	none	 Roger brought up his arm in a crisp salute to Captain Strong who returned it casually Stand easy Manning replied Strong Do you recognize this room Yes sir It s a mock up of a radar bridge 
3088-5441-0035	train-other-500	A workable mock up cadet
none	none	 Strong was vaguely irritated by Roger s nonchalance in accepting a situation that Tom had marveled at 
3088-5441-0036	train-other-500	You will take your manuals here Yes sir
none	none	 On these tests you will be timed for both efficiency and speed and you ll use all the tables charts and astrogation equipment that you d find in a spaceship 
3088-5441-0037	train-other-500	Your problems are purely mathematical There are no decisions to make Just use your head Strong handed Roger several sheets of paper containing written problems
none	none	 Roger shuffled them around in his fingers giving each a quick glance You may begin any time you are ready Manning said Strong 
3088-5441-0038	train-other-500	I m ready now sir replied Roger calmly He turned to the swivel chair located between the huge communications board the adjustable chart table and the astrogation prism Directly in front of him was the huge radar scanner
none	none	 and to one side and overhead was a tube mounted on a swivel joint that looked like a small telescope but which was actually an astrogation prism for taking sights on the celestial bodies in space 
3088-5441-0039	train-other-500	Roger concentrated on the first problem
none	none	 you are now in the northwest quadrant of Mars chart M area twenty eight You have been notified by the control deck that it has been necessary to jettison three quarters of your fuel supply For the last five hundred and seventy nine seconds you have been blasting at one quarter space speed The four main drive rockets were cut out at thirty second intervals Making adjustment for degree of slip on each successive rocket cutout find present position by using cross fix with Regulus as your starboard fix Alpha Centauri as your port fix Suddenly a bell began to ring in front of Roger 
3088-5441-0040	train-other-500	Without hesitation he adjusted a dial that brought the radar scanner into focus
none	none	 When the screen remained blank he made a second adjustment and then a third and fourth until the bright white flash of a meteor was seen on the scanner He quickly grabbed two knobs one in each hand and twisted them to move two thin plotting lines one horizontal and one vertical across the surface of the scanner Setting the vertical line he fingered a tabulating machine with his right hand as he adjusted the second line with his left thus cross fixing the meteor Then he turned his whole attention to the tabulator ripped off the answer with lightning moves of his fingers and began talking rapidly into the microphone Radar bridge to control deck Alien body bearing zero one five one point seven degrees over plane of the ecliptic On intersecting orbit Change course two degrees hold for fifteen seconds then resume original heading Will compensate for change nearer destination Roger watched the scanner a moment longer When the rumbling blast of the steering jets sounded in the chamber and the meteor flash shifted on the scanner screen he returned to the problem in his hand Seven minutes later he turned to Strong and handed him the answer Present position by dead reckoning is northwest quadrant of Mars chart O area thirty nine sir he announced confidently Illustration I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri Strong tried to mask his surprise but a lifted eyebrow gave him away And how did you arrive at this conclusion Manning I was unable to get a sight on Alpha Centauri due to the present position of Jupiter sir replied Roger easily So I took a fix on Earth allowed for its rotational speed around the sun and took the cross fix with Regulus as ordered in the problem Of course I included all the other factors of the speed and heading of our ship That was routine Strong accepted the answer with a curt nod motioning for Roger to continue It would not do thought Strong to let Manning know that he was the first cadet in thirty nine years to make the correct selection of Earth in working up the fix with Regulus and still have the presence of mind to plot a meteor without so much as a half degree error Of course the problem varied with each cadet but it remained essentially the same Seven and a half minutes Commander Walters will be surprised to say the least thought Steve Forty five minutes later Roger as unruffled as if he had been sitting listening to a lecture from a sound slide handed in the rest of his papers executed a sharp salute and walked out Two down and one to go thought Strong and the toughest one of them all coming up Astro The big Venusian was unable to understand anything that couldn t be turned with a wrench The only thing that would prevent Unit forty two D from taking Academy unit honors over Unit seventy seven K the unit assigned to Lieutenant Wolcheck would be Astro While none of the members of the other units could come up to the individual brilliance of Corbett or Manning they worked together as a unit helping one another They might make a higher unit rating simply because they were better balanced He shrugged his shoulders and collected the papers It was as much torture for him as it was for any cadet he thought and turned to the door All right Astro he said to himself in ten minutes it ll be your turn and I m going to make it tough Back in the quarters of Unit forty two D Tom and Astro still pored over the books and papers on the desk Let s try again Astro sighed Tom as he hitched his chair closer to the desk You ve got thirty tons of fuel you want to find the compression ratio of the number one firing tube chamber so what do you do Start up the auxiliary burn a little of the stuff and judge what it ll be the big cadet replied That s the way I did it on the space freighters But you re not on a space freighter now exclaimed Tom You ve got to do things the way they want it done here at the Academy By the book These tables have been figured out by great minds to help you and you just want to burn a little of the stuff and guess at what it ll be Tom threw up his hands in disgust Seems to me I heard of an old saying back in the teen centuries about leading a horse to water but not being able to make him drink drawled Roger from the doorway He strolled in and kicked at the crumpled sheets of paper that littered the floor stark evidence of Tom s efforts with Astro All right wise guy said Tom suppose you explain it to him No can do replied Roger I tried I explained it to him twenty times this morning while you were taking your control deck manual He tapped his head delicately with his forefinger Can t get through too thick Astro turned to the window to hide the mist in his eyes Lay off Roger snapped Tom He got up and walked over to the big cadet Come on Astro we haven t got much time You re due in the examination hall in a few minutes It s no good Tom I just can t understand that stuff Astro turned and faced his unit mates his voice charged with sudden emotion Just fifteen minutes on the power deck of anything with rockets in her and I ll run her from here to the next galaxy I I can t explain it but when I look at those motors I can read em like you read an astrogation chart Roger or you the gauges on the control deck Tom But I just can t get those ratios out of a book I gotta put my hands on those motors touch em I mean really touch em then I know what to do As suddenly as he had started he stopped and turned leaving Tom and Roger staring at him startled by this unusual outburst Cadets stand to roared a voice from the doorway The three cadets snapped to attention and faced the entrance Take it easy Earthworms said Tony Richards A tall cadet with closely cut black hair and a lazy smiling face stood in the doorway Lay off Richards said Tom We haven t time for gags now Astro s going to take his power deck manual in a few minutes and we re cramming with him O K O K don t blow your jets said Richards I just wanted to see if there were any bets on which unit would cop honors in the manuals this afternoon I suppose you think your Unit seventy seven K will finish on top drawled Roger I d like to bet all the galley demerits we have in seventy seven K against yours With Astro on our team complained Roger What s the matter with Astro asked Richards From what I hear he s hot stuff It wasn t a compliment but a sharp dig made with a sly smile Astro balled his huge hands into fists Astro said Roger is the type that can smell out trouble on any power deck But today he came down with a cold No I m afraid it s no bet Richards I ll give you two to one Richards offered Nothing doing replied Roger Not even at five to one Not with Astro Richards grinned nodded and disappeared Roger turned to face the hard stare of Tom That was the dirtiest sellout I ve ever heard Manning Tom growled Sorry Corbett said Roger I only bet on sure things That s O K with me Manning said Astro but I m afraid you sold yourself a hot rocket because I m going to pass Who are you kidding Roger laughed and sprawled on his bunk Astro took a quick step forward his fists clenched his face a mask of burning anger but Tom quickly jumped in front of him You ll be late for the exam Astro he shouted Get going or it ll count against your mark Huh What s a few points more or less when you re going to fail anyway snorted Roger from the bunk Again Astro started to lunge forward and Tom braced himself against the Venusian s charge but suddenly the burly cadet stopped Disengaging Tom s restraining arms he spoke coldly to the sneering boy on the bed I m going to pass the exam Manning Get that I m going to pass and then come back and beat your head off Turning on his heel he stalked out of the room Tom immediately wheeled to face Roger fire in his eyes and the arrogant cadet sensing trouble jumped to his feet to meet him What s the idea of giving Astro a hard time demanded Tom Cool off Corbett replied Roger warily You re fusing your tubes you re so hot You bet I m hot Hot enough to blast you again Tom deliberately spat out the last word Roger flushed and brought his fists up quickly as though to charge in then suddenly dropped them again He turned to the door and slowly walked out Go blow your jets his voice drifted back to Tom as he disappeared Tom stood there looking at the empty door almost blind with rage and frustration He was failing in the main job assigned to him that of keeping the unit on an even keel and working together How could he command a crew out in space if he couldn t keep the friction of his own unit under control Slowly he left the room to wait for Astro in the recreation hall where the results of the manuals would be announced He thought of Astro now probably deep in his exam and wondered how bad it would be for him Then another thought crossed his mind Roger had said nothing of his own test and neither he nor Astro had even inquired He shook his head No matter where the unit placed in the manuals it just couldn t stay together Illustration CHAPTER seven It was customary for all Earthworm cadets to gather in the main recreation hall to wait for the results of the manuals which would be announced on the huge teleceiver screen Since all the units were taking their tests that afternoon the hall was crowded with green clad cadets talking in low murmurs and waiting tensely for the outcome of the exam Tom entered the huge room looked around and then drifted toward Al Dixon the senior cadet who had greeted them as a unit after passing classification tests The blue clad cadet was listening to a story spool a device that told a story rather than let the person read it from a book Hiya Corbett said Dixon smiling Drag up a chair Listening to a terrific yarn about a guy stranded on an asteroid and then he finds The redheaded cadet s voice trailed off when he noticed that Tom wasn t listening Say what s the matter with you You look like you just lost your best friend Not yet but it won t be long now commented Tom a trace of bitterness creeping into his voice Astro s taking his power deck manual What he knows about those compression ratios just isn t known But he just can t get it on paper Don t sell your unit mate short said Dixon sensing something beneath Tom s comment I ve heard that big fellow knows more about a rocket deck than McKenny Yeah that s true said Tom but You know Corbett said Dixon switching off the story spool there s something screwy in that outfit of yours You can say that again agreed Tom bitterly You come in here with a face dragging on the floor and Manning Tom s head jerked up Manning What about that space gassing hot shot Manning just tore through the rec hall trying to get some of the other Earthworm units to bet their galley demerits against your outfit Tom s mouth sagged open You mean he actually wanted to bet that Astro would pass Not just pass Corbett but he wanted to bet that your unit would be top rocket of the Earthworms The head of the list But he told Astro that he stopped Told him what Dixon asked Ah nothing nothing said Tom He jumped up and headed for the door Hey where are you going To find Manning There are a couple of things I want to clear up Tom left Dixon shaking his head in bewilderment and jumped on the slidestairs He was going to have it out with Roger once and for all Hopping off the slidestairs onto the forty second floor he started down the long hall to his quarters Nearing the door he heard Roger s laugh and then his lazy voice talking to someone inside Sure they re dumb but they re not bad guys said Roger Tom walked into the room Roger was sitting on the side of his bunk facing Tony Richards Hiya Corbett said Roger did you hear how Astro made out yet Tom ignored the question I want to talk to you Roger Roger eyed him suspiciously Sure Corbett go ahead Well I ll be going along said Richards He had heard about the previous fight between Manning and Corbett and didn t want to be hauled up as a witness later if they started again Remember Manning he called from the doorway the bet is two to one and are you going to get tired of washing pots and pans He waved his hand at Corbett and disappeared All right Corbett Roger turned to Tom What s frying you I just saw Al Dixon down in the rec hall answered Tom He told me you were looking for bets on the unit ratings Is that why Richards was here That s right nodded Roger What made you say the things you did to Astro before he went for his manual Very simple I wanted to make him pass and that was the only way You re pretty sure of yourself Roger I m always sure of myself Corbett And the sooner you learn that the easier it ll be for all of us I never bet unless it s in the bag I know Astro s going to pass Some guys have to have a fire built under them before they get moving Astro s one of them That doesn t answer my question said Tom Why did you say the things you did before a guy goes to take an exam I said what I did to make Tony Richards give me odds And to make Astro mad enough to pass We re a cinch to win and Richards outfit will be indebted to us for a year s worth of galley demerits He smiled easily Smooth huh I think it s rotten said Tom Astro left here feeling like a plugged credit And if he does fail it ll be because you made him think he was the dumbest guy in the universe He probably is mused Roger but he still won t fail that manual From the hallway behind them a loud blasting yell was suddenly heard echoing from somewhere on the lower floors Tom and Roger waited their eyes wide and hopeful There was only one person at Space Academy capable of making such a noise He made it Tom exclaimed Of course he made it said Roger casually Astro tore into forty two D with a mad rush Yeeeoooooowwww He grabbed the two cadets and picked them up one in each hand I made it hands down I handled those rocket motors like they were babes in arms I told you that all I had to do was touch them and I d know I told you Congratulations Astro said Tom with a wide grin I knew you d do it Put me down you oversized Venusian jerk said Roger almost good naturedly Astro released the smaller cadet and faced him Well hot shot I promised you something when I got back didn t I Make it later will you and I ll be glad to oblige He walked toward the door I ve got to go down and collect a bet What bet asked Astro With Tony Richards But I thought you were afraid to bet on me Not at all Astro I just wanted to make you mad enough to ensure my winning That sounds like you were more worried about your bet than you were about Astro passing snapped Tom You re exactly right spaceboy purred Roger standing in the doorway That s our boy Manning growled Astro The great team man Team Roger took a step back into the room Don t make me laugh Astro For your information tomorrow morning I m putting in for a transfer to another unit What exclaimed Tom You can t trans Yes I can interrupted Roger Read your Academy regs Anyone can request a transfer once the unit has passed its manuals And what excuse are you going to use snapped Astro bitterly That you can t take it A personality difference Astro my boy You hate me and I hate you It s a good enough reason I think It s just as well hot shot replied Astro Because if you don t transfer we will Roger merely smiled flipped his fingers to his forehead in an arrogant gesture of farewell and turned to leave again But his path was blocked by the sudden appearance of Captain Steve Strong The three cadets quickly braced The Solar Guard officer strode into the room his face beaming He looked at each of the boys pride shining out of his eyes and then brought his hand up and held it in salute I just want to tell you boys one thing he said solemnly It s the highest compliment I can pay you or anyone He paused All three of you are real spacemen Tom and Astro couldn t repress smiles but Roger s expression never changed Then we passed as a unit sir asked Tom eagerly Not only passed Corbett Strong s voice boomed in the small room but with honors You re the top rockets of this Earthworm group I m proud to be your commanding officer Again Tom and Astro fought back smiles of happiness and even Roger managed a small grin This is the fightingest group of cadets I ve ever seen Strong continued Frankly I was a little worried about your ability to pull together but the results of the manuals showed that you have You couldn t have made it without working as a unit Strong failed to notice Roger s face darken and Tom and Astro look at each other meaningfully My congratulations for having solved that problem too Strong saluted them again and walked toward the door where he paused By the way I want you to report to the Academy spaceport tomorrow at eight hundred hours Warrant Officer McKenny has something out there he wants to show you Tom s eyes bugged out and he stepped forward Sir he gasped scarcely able to get the question past his lips you don t mean we re we re going to You re absolutely right Corbett There s a brand new rocket cruiser out there Your ship Your future classroom You ll report to her in the blues of the Space Cadets And from now on your unit identification is the name of your ship The rocket cruiser Polaris A second later Strong had vanished down the corridor leaving Tom and Astro hugging each other and clapping each other on the back in delirious joy Roger merely stood to one side a sarcastic smile on his face And now as we prepare to face the unknown dangers of space he said bitingly let us unite our voices and sing the Academy hymn together Huh He strode toward the door Don t they ever get tired of waving that flag around here Before Tom and Astro could reply he had disappeared The big Venusian shrugged his shoulders I just don t understand that guy But Tom failed to reply He had turned toward the window and was staring out past the gleaming white Tower of Galileo into the slowly darkening skies of evening to the east For the moment the problems of Roger Manning and the unit were far away He was thinking of the coming morning when he would dress in the blues of a Space Cadet for the first time and step into his own ship as command pilot He was thinking of the morning when he would be a real spaceman Illustration CHAPTER eight The campus of Space Academy was quiet that evening Only a few cadets were still out on the quadrangle lounging around in the open before returning to their quarters for bed check On the forty second floor of the dormitory building two thirds of the newly formed Polaris unit Tom and Astro were in heated argument All right all right so the guy is brilliant said Astro But who can live with him Not even himself Maybe he is a little difficult replied Tom but somehow we ve got to adjust to him How about him adjusting to us It s two against one Astro shambled to the window and looked out moodily Besides he s putting in for a transfer and there s nothing we can do about it Maybe he won t now not after that little speech Captain Strong made this afternoon If he doesn t then blast it I will Aw now take it easy Astro Take it easy nothing Astro was building up a big head of steam Where is that space crawler right now I don t know He never came back Wasn t even down at mess tonight There that s just what I mean Astro turned to Tom to press his point It s close to bed check and he isn t in quarters yet If the MP s catch him outside after hours the whole unit will be logged and there goes our chance of blasting off tomorrow But there s still time Astro replied Tom lamely Not much there isn t It just shows you what he thinks of the unit He just doesn t care Astro paced the floor angrily There s only one thing to do He gets his transfer or we do Or he paused and looked at Tom meaningfully or I do You re not thinking Astro argued Tom How will that look on your record Every time there s a trip into deep space they yank out your file to see how you operate under pressure with other guys When they see that you asked for a transfer from your unit that s it Yeah yeah I know incompatible but honest Tom The curly haired cadet felt his big friend weaken and he pressed his advantage It isn t every day that a unit gets a ship right after finishing ground manuals Captain Strong said he waited for four months after manuals before getting his first hop into space Yeah but what do you think it s going to be like out in space with Manning making sour cracks all the time Tom hesitated before answering his Venusian friend He was fully aware that Roger was going to play a lone hand And that they would never really have unity among them until some drastic measure was taken After all Tom thought some guys don t have good hearts or eyes a defect to prevent them from becoming spacemen Roger is just mixed up inside And the handicap is just as real as if he had a physical flaw Well what do you want to do asked Tom finally Go see Captain Strong Give it to him straight Tell him we want a transfer But tomorrow we blast off We might not have another chance for months Certainly not until we get a new astrogator I d rather wait and have a guy on the radar bridge I know isn t going to pull something behind my back said Astro than blast off tomorrow with Manning aboard Again Tom hesitated He knew what Astro was saying was the truth Life so far at the Academy had been tough enough but with mutual dependence and security even more important out in space the danger of their constant friction was obvious O K he relented if that s the way you really want it Come on We ll go see Captain Strong now You go said Astro You know how I feel Whatever you say goes for me too Are you sure you want to do it asked Tom He knew what such a request would mean A black mark against Roger for being rejected by his unit mates and a black mark against Astro and himself for not being able to adjust Regardless of who was right and who was wrong there would always be a mark on their records Look Tom said Astro if I thought it was only me I d keep my mouth shut But you d let Manning get away with murder because you wouldn t want to be the one to get him into trouble No I wouldn t said Tom I think Roger would make a fine spaceman he s certainly smart enough and a good unit mate if he d only snap out of it But I can t let him or anyone else stop me from becoming a spaceman or a member of the Solar Guard Then you ll go see Captain Strong Yes said Tom If he had been in doubt before now that he had made the decision he felt relieved He slipped on his space boots and stood up The two boys looked at each other each realizing the question in the other s mind No said Tom decisively It s better for everyone Even Roger He might find two other guys that will fit him better He walked from the room The halls were silent as he strode toward the slidestairs that would take him to the nineteenth floor and Captain Strong s quarters Passing one room after another he glanced in and saw other units studying preparing for bed or just sitting around talking There weren t many units left The tests had taken a toll of the Earthworms But those that remained were solidly built Already friendships had taken deep root Tom found himself wishing he had become a member of another unit Where the comradeship was taken for granted in other units he was about to make a request to dissolve his because of friction Completely discouraged Tom stepped on the slidestairs and started down As he left the dormitory floors the noise of young cadet life was soon lost and he passed floors containing offices and apartments of the administration staff of the Solar Guard As he drew level with the floor that was Galaxy Hall he glanced at the lighted plaque and for the hundredth time reread the inscription to the brave men who sacrificed their lives in the conquest of space this Galaxy Hall is dedicated Something moved in the darkness of the hall Tom strained his eyes for a closer look and just managed to distinguish the figure of a cadet standing before the wreckage of the Space Queen Funny thought Tom Why should anyone be wandering around the hall at this time of night And then as the floor slipped past the figure turned slightly and was illuminated by the dim light that came from the slidestairs Tom recognized the sharp features and close cropped blond hair of Roger Manning Illustration Roger was still standing in front of the Space Queen Quickly changing over to the slidestairs going up Tom slipped back to the hall floor and stepped off Roger was still standing in front of the Space Queen Tom started to speak but stopped when he saw Roger take out a handkerchief and dab at his eyes The movements of the other boy were crystal clear to Tom Roger was crying Standing in front of the Space Queen and crying He kept watching as Roger put away the handkerchief saluted sharply and turned toward the slidestairs Ducking behind a glass case that held the first space suit ever used Tom held his breath as Roger passed him He could hear Roger mumble They got you but they won t get me with any of that glory stuff Tom waited heart racing trying to figure out what Roger meant and why he was here alone in Galaxy Hall Finally the blond cadet disappeared up the moving stair Tom didn t go to see Captain Strong Instead he returned to his room So quick asked Astro Tom shook his head Where s Roger he asked In the shower Astro gestured to the bathroom where Tom could hear the sound of running water What made you change your mind about seeing Captain Strong asked Astro I think we ve misjudged Roger Astro said Tom slowly And then related what he had seen and heard Well blast my jets exclaimed Astro when Tom had finished What s behind it do you think I don t know Astro But I m convinced that any guy that ll visit Galaxy Hall by himself late at night and cry well he couldn t be entirely off base regardless of what he does Astro studied his work hardened palms You wanta keep it this way for a while he asked I mean forget about talking to Captain Strong Roger s the best astrogator and radar man in the Academy Astro There s something bothering him But I m willing to bet that whatever it is Roger will work it out And if we re really unit mates then we won t sell him out now when he may need us most That s it then said Astro I ll kill him with kindness Come on Let s turn in We ve got a big day ahead of us tomorrow The two boys began to prepare for bed Roger came out of the shower wearing pajamas All excited spacemen he drawled leaning against the wall brushing his short hair About as excited as we can get Roger smiled Tom Yeah you space blasting jerk growled Astro good naturedly Turn out the lights before I introduce you to my space boot Roger eyed the two cadets quizzically puzzled by the strange good humor of both boys He shrugged his shoulders flipped out the light and crawled into bed But if he could have seen the satisfied smile of Tom Corbett Roger would have been even more puzzled We ll just kill him with kindness thought Tom and fell fast asleep Illustration CHAPTER nine The three members of the Polaris unit stepped off the slidewalk at the Academy spaceport and stood before Warrant Officer McKenny There she is said the stubby spaceman pointing to the gleaming spaceship resting not two hundred feet away Rocket cruiser Polaris The newest and fastest ship in space He faced the three boys with a smile And she s all yours You earned her Mouths open Tom Roger and Astro stood gaping in fascination at the mighty spaceship resting on the concrete ramp Her long two hundred foot polished beryllium steel hull mirrored the spaceport scene around them The tall buildings of the Academy the ready line of space destroyers and scouts and the hundreds of maintenance noncoms of the enlisted Solar Guard their scarlet uniforms spotted with grime were all reflected back to the Polaris unit as they eyed the sleek ship from the needlelike nose of her bow to the stubby opening of her rocket exhausts Not a seam or rivet could be seen in her hull At the top of the ship near her nose a large blister made of six inch clear crystal indicated the radar bridge Twelve feet below it six round window ports showed the position of the control deck Surrounding the base of the ship was an aluminum scaffold with a ladder over a hundred feet high anchored to it The top rung of the ladder just reached the power deck emergency hatch which was swung open like a giant plug revealing the thickness of the hull nearly a foot Well roared the red clad spaceman don t you want to climb aboard and see what your ship looks like inside Do we cried Tom and made a headlong dash for the scaffold Astro let out one of his famous yells and followed right at his heels Roger watched them running ahead and started off at a slow walk but suddenly no longer able to resist he broke into a dead run Those around the Polaris stopped their work to watch the three cadets scramble up the ladder Most of the ground crew were ex spacemen like McKenny no longer able to blast off because of acceleration reaction And they smiled knowingly remembering their reactions to their first spaceship Inside the massive cruiser the boys roamed over every deck examining the ship excitedly Say look at this cried Tom He stood in front of the control board and ran his hands over the buttons and switches This board makes the manual we worked on at the Academy look like it s ready for Galaxy Hall Yeeeooooooww Three decks below Astro had discovered the rocket motors Four of the most powerful ever installed on a spaceship enabling the Polaris to outrace any ship in space Roger stuck his head through the radar bridge hatch and gazed in awe at the array of electronic communicators detection radar and astrogation gear With lips pulled into a thin line he mumbled to himself Too bad they didn t give you this kind of equipment What d you say Roger asked Astro climbing alongside to peer into the radar bridge Startled Roger turned and stammered Ah nothing nothing Looking around Astro commented This place looks almost as good as that power deck Of course said Roger they could have placed that astrogation prism a little closer to the chart table Now I ll have to get up every time I want to take sights on stars Don t you ever get tired of complaining asked Astro Ah rocket off snarled Roger Hey you guys yelled Tom from below better get down here Captain Strong s coming aboard Climbing back down the ladder to the control deck Astro leaned over his shoulder and asked Roger Do you really think he ll let us take this baby up for a hop Manning Get your head out of that cloud Astro You ll pull about three weeks of dry runs before this baby gets five inches off the ground I wouldn t be too sure of that Manning Strong s voice boomed out as he climbed up through the control deck hatch The three boys immediately snapped to attention Strong walked around the control deck fingering the controls lightly This is a fine ship he mused aloud One of the finest that scientific brains can build She s yours The day you graduate from the Academy IF you graduate and I can think of about a thousand reasons why you won t you ll command an armed rocket cruiser similar to this As a matter of fact the only difference between this ship and those that patrol the space lanes now is in the armament Don t we have any arms aboard at all sir asked Tom Small arms like paralo ray pistols and paralo ray rifles Plus four atomic war heads for emergency use replied Strong Seeing a puzzled expression cross Astro s face the Solar Guard officer continued You haven t studied armament yet Astro but paralo rays are the only weapons used by law enforcement agencies in the Solar Alliance They work on a principle of controlled energy sending out a ray with an effective range of fifty yards that can paralyze the nervous system of any beast or human And it doesn t kill sir inquired Astro No Astro replied Strong Paralyzing a man is just as effective as killing him The Solar Alliance doesn t believe you have to kill anyone not even the most vicious criminal Freeze him and capture him and you still have the opportunity of making him a useful citizen But if you can t inquired Roger dryly Then he s kept on the prison asteroid where he can t harm anyone Strong turned away abruptly But this isn t the time for a general discussion We ve got work to do He walked over to the master control panel and switched the teleceiver screen There was a slight buzz and a view of the spaceport outside the ship suddenly came into focus filling the screen Strong flipped a switch and a view aft on the Polaris filled the glowing square The aluminum scaffolding was being hauled away by a jet truck Again the view changed as Strong twisted the dials in front of him Just scanning the outside boys he commented Have to make sure there isn t anyone near the ship when we blast off The rocket exhaust is powerful enough to blow a man two hundred feet to say nothing of burning him to death You mean sir began Tom not daring to hope Of course Corbett smiled Strong Take your stations for blast off We raise ship as soon as we get orbital clearance from spaceport control Without waiting for further orders the three boys scurried to their stations Soon the muffled whine of the energizing pumps on the power deck began to ring through the ship along with the steady beep of the radar scanner on the radar bridge Tom checked the maze of gauges and dials on the control board Air locks hatches oxygen supply circulating system circuits and feeds In five minutes the two hundred foot shining steel hull was a living thing as her rocket motors purred warming up for the initial thrust Tom made a last sweeping check of the complicated board and turned to Captain Strong who stood to one side watching Ship ready to blast off sir he announced Shall I check stations and proceed to raise ship Carry on Cadet Corbett Strong replied Log yourself in as skipper with me along as supercargo I ll ride in the second pilot s chair Tom snapped a sharp salute and added vocally Aye aye sir He turned back to the control board strapped himself into the command pilot s seat and opened the circuit to the spaceport control tower Rocket cruiser Polaris to spaceport control he droned into the microphone Check in Spaceport control to Polaris the voice of the tower operator replied You are cleared for blast off in two minutes Take out orbit seventy five repeat seventy five Polaris to spaceport control Orders received and understood End transmission Tom then turned his attention to the station check Control deck to radar deck Check in Radar deck aye Ready to raise ship Roger s voice was relaxed easy Tom turned to the board to adjust the teleceiver screen for a clear picture of the stern of the ship Gradually it came up in as sharp detail as if he had been standing on the ground He checked the electric timing device in front of him that ticked off the seconds as a red hand crawled around to zero and when it swept down to the thirty second mark Tom pulled the microphone to his lips again Control deck to power deck Check in Power deck aye Energize the cooling pumps Cooling pumps aye repeated Astro Feed reactant Reactant at D nine rate From seventy feet below them Strong and Tom heard the hiss of the reactant mass feeding into the rocket motors and the screeching whine of the mighty pumps that kept the mass from building too rapidly and exploding The second hand swept up to the twenty second mark Control deck to radar deck called Tom Do we have a clear trajectory forward All clear forward and overhead replied Roger Tom placed his hand on the master switch that would throw the combined circuits instruments and gauges into the single act of blasting the mighty ship into space His eyes glued to the sweeping hand he counted past the twelve second mark eleven ten nine Stand by to raise ship he bawled into the microphone Minus five four three two one zero Tom threw the master switch There was a split second pause and then the great ship roared into life Slowly at first she lifted her tail full of roaring jets free of the ground Ten feet twenty fifty a hundred five hundred a thousand picking up speed at an incredible rate Tom felt himself being pushed deeper and deeper into the softness of the acceleration cushions He had been worried about not being able to keep his eyes open to see the dwindling Earth in the teleceiver over his head but the tremendous force of the rockets pushing him against gravity to tear the two hundred tons of steel away from the Earth s grip held his eyelids open for him As the powerful rockets tore deeper into the gap that separated the ship from Earth he saw the spaceport gradually grow smaller The rolling hills around the Academy closed in and then the Academy itself with the Tower of Galileo shrinking to a white stick was lost in the brown and green that was Earth The rockets pushed harder and harder and he saw the needle of the acceleration gauge creep slowly up Four five six seven eight nine ten miles a second When the awful crushing weight on his body seemed unbearable when he felt as though he would never be able to draw another breath suddenly the pressure lifted and Tom felt amazingly and wonderfully buoyant He seemed to be floating in mid air his body rising against the webbed straps of his chair With a start and a momentary wave of panic he realized that he was floating Only the straps kept him from rising to the ceiling of the control room Recovering quickly he realized that he was in free fall The ship had cleared the pull of earth s gravity and was out in space where everything was weightless Reaching toward the control panel he flipped the switch for the synthetic gravity generator and seconds later felt the familiar and reassuring sensation of the chair under him as the generator supplied an artificial gravity field to the ship As he loosened the straps in his chair he noticed Captain Strong rising from his position beside him and he grinned sheepishly in answer to the twinkle in Strong s eye It s all right Tom reassured Strong Happens to everyone the first time Carry on Aye aye sir replied Tom and he turned to the microphone Control deck to all stations We are in space Observe standard cruise procedure Power deck aye was Astro s blasting answer over the loud speaker Yeeeoooww Out where we belong at last Radar bridge here Roger s voice chimed in softly on the speaker Everything under control And Astro you belong in a zoo if you re going to bellow like that Ahhh rocket off bubblehead The big Venusian s reply was good natured He was too happy to let Roger get under his skin All right you two interrupted Tom Knock it off We re on a ship now Let s cut the kindergarten stuff Aye aye skipper Astro was irrepressible Yes sir Roger s voice was soft but Tom recognized the biting edge to the last word Turning away from the controls he faced Captain Strong who had been watching quietly Polaris space borne at nine hundred thirty three hours Captain Strong All stations operating efficiently Very competent job Corbett nodded Strong in approval You handled the ship as if you d been doing it for years Thank you sir We ll just cruise for a while on this orbit so you boys can get the feel of the ship and of space The Solar Guard officer took Tom s place in the command pilot s chair You knock off for a while Go up to the radar bridge and have a look around I ll take over here Yes sir Tom turned and had to restrain himself from racing up the ladder to the radar bridge When he climbed through the hatch to Roger s station he found his unit mate tilted back in his chair staring through the crystal blister over his head Hiya spaceboy smiled Roger He indicated the blister Take a look at the wide deep and high Tom looked up and saw the deep blackness that was space It s like looking into a mirror Roger he breathed in awe Only there isn t any other side no reflection It just doesn t stop does it Nope commented Roger it just goes on and on and on And no one knows where it stops And no one can even guess Ah you ve got a touch of space fever laughed Astro You d better take it easy pal Tom suppressed a smile Now for the first time he felt that there was a chance to achieve unity among them Kill him with kindness he thought that s the way to do it All right boys Captain Strong s voice crackled over the speaker Time to pull in your eyeballs and get to work again We re heading back to the spaceport Take your stations for landing Tom and Astro immediately jumped toward the open hatch and started scrambling down the ladder toward their respective stations while Roger strapped himself into his chair in front of the astrogation panel Within sixty seconds the ship was ready for landing procedure and at a nod from Captain Strong who again strapped himself into the second pilot s chair Tom began the delicate operation Entering Earth s atmosphere Tom gave a series of rapid orders for course changes and power adjustments and then depressing the master turn control spun the ship around so that she would settle stern first toward her ramp at the Academy spaceport Radar deck to control deck called Roger over the intercom One thousand feet to touchdown Control deck aye answered Tom Control deck to power deck Check in Power deck aye replied Astro Stand by to adjust thrust to maximum drive at my command ordered Tom Power deck aye The great ship balanced perfectly on the hot exhaust slowly slipped toward the ground Five hundred feet to touchdown warned Roger Main rockets full blast ordered Tom The sudden blast of the powerful jets slowed the descent of the ship and finally fifty feet above the ground Tom snapped out another order Cut main rockets Hold auxiliary A moment later there was a gentle bump and the Polaris rested on the ramp her nose pointed to the heavens Touchdown yelled Tom Cut everything fellas and come up and sign the log We made it our first hop into space We re spacemen CHAPTER ten The next event will be Warrant Officer McKenny s voice boomed over the loud speaker and echoed over the Academy stadium the last semifinal round of mercuryball Polaris unit versus Arcturus unit As two thousand space cadets crowded in the grandstands watching the annual academy tournament rose to their feet and cheered lustily Tom Corbett turned to his unit mates Astro and Roger and called enthusiastically O K fellas Let s go out there and show them how to play this game During the two days of the tournament Tom Roger and Astro competing as a unit against all the other academy units had piled up a tremendous amount of points in all the events But so had Unit seventy seven K now known as the Capella unit Now with the Capella unit already in the finals the Polaris crew had to win their semifinal round against the Arcturus in order to meet the Capella in the final round for Academy honors This is going to be a cinch boasted Astro I m going to burn em up Save it for the field said Tom with a smile Yeah you big Venusian ape added Roger Make points instead of space gas Stripped to the waist wearing shorts and soft three quarter length space boots the three boys walked onto the sun baked field amid the rousing cheers from the stands Across the field the cadets of the Arcturus unit walked out to meet them stopping beside McKenny at the mid field line Mike waited for the six boys to form a circle around him while he held the mercuryball a twelve inch plastic sphere filled with air and the tricky tube of mercury You all know the rules announced McKenny abruptly Head shoulders feet knees or any part of your body except your hands can touch the ball Polaris unit will defend the north goal he said pointing to a white chalk line fifty yards away Arcturus the south and he pointed to a line equally distant in the opposite direction Five minute periods with one minute rest between All clear As captain of the Polaris unit Tom nodded while smiling at the captain of the Arcturus team a tow headed boy with short chunky legs named Schohari All clear Mike said Tom All clear here Mike responded Schohari All right shake hands and take your places The six boys shook hands and jogged toward respective opposite lines Mike waited for them to reach their goal lines and then placed the ball in the middle of a chalk drawn circle Toeing the line Tom Roger and Astro eyed the Arcturus crew and prepared for the dash to the ball All right fellas urged Tom let s show them something Yeah breathed Astro just let me get my size thirteens on that pumpkin before it starts twisting around Astro wanted the advantage of the first kick at the ball while the mercury tube inside was still quiet Once the mercury was agitated the ball would be as easy to kick as a well greased eel We ll block for you Astro said Tom and you put every ounce of beef you ve got into that first kick If we re lucky we might be able to get the jump on them Cut the chatter snapped Roger nervously Baldy s ready to give us the go ahead Standing on the side lines Warrant Officer McKenny slowly raised his hand and the crowd in the grandstand hushed in eager anticipation A second passed and then there was a tremendous roar as he brought his hand down and blew heavily on the whistle Running as if their lives depended on it the six cadets of the two units raced headlong toward the ball Tom just a little faster than Roger or Astro flashed down the field and veered off to block the advancing Schohari Roger following him charged into Swift the second member of the Arcturus crew Astro a few feet in back of them running with surprising speed for his size saw that it was going to be a close race between himself and Allen the third member of the Arcturus unit He bowed his head and drove himself harder the roar of the crowd filling his ears Go Astro Go Astro Pounding down for the kick Astro gauged his stride perfectly and with one last mighty leap swung his right foot at the ball There was a loud thud drowned by a roar from the crowd as the ball sailed off the ground with terrific force And then almost immediately there was another thud as Allen rose in a desperate leap to block the ball with his shoulder It caromed off at a crazy angle wobbling in its flight as the mercury within rolled from side to side Swift of the Arcturus crew reached the ball first and sent it sailing at an angle over Tom s head to bounce thirty feet away Seeing Astro charge the ball Tom threw a block on Allen to knock him out of the play The big Venusian judging his stride to be a little off shortened his steps to move in for the kick But just as he brought his foot forward to make contact the ball spun away to the left Astro s foot continued in a perfect arc over his head throwing him in a heap on the ground Two thousand voices from the stands roared in one peal of laughter While Astro lay on the ground with the wind knocked out of him Schohari and Swift converged on the ball With Astro down and Tom out of position the Arcturus unit seemed certain of scoring But again the ball rolled crazily this time straight to Roger the last defender He nudged it between his opponents toward Tom who in turn kicked it obliquely past Allen back to Roger again Running with the grace and speed of an antelope the blond cadet met the ball in mid field and when it dropped to the ground in front of him sent it soaring across the goal with one powerful kick As the cadets in the stands sent up a tumultuous cheer for the perfectly executed play the whistle blew ending the period and the Polaris unit led one to nothing Breathing deeply Astro and Roger flopped down near Tom and stretched full length on the grass That was a beautiful shot Roger said Tom Perfectly timed Yeah hot shot agreed Astro I m glad to see that big head of yours is good for something Listen fellas said Roger eagerly ignoring Astro to go into the finals against Richards and the Capella unit we ve got to beat the Arcturus crew right Yeah agreed Tom and it won t be easy We just happened to get the breaks Then why don t we put the game on ice said Roger Freeze the ball We got em one to nothing that s enough to beat them When the whistle blows and it s over we win Astro looked at Tom who frowned and replied But we ve still got three periods left Roger It isn t fair to freeze this early in the game If it was the last minute or so sure But not so early It just isn t fair What do you want to do snarled Roger Win or play fair Win of course but I want to win the right way said Tom How about you Astro asked Roger I feel the same way that Tom does said the big cadet We can beat these guys easily and on the square You guys make it sound like I was cheating snapped Roger Well said Tom it sure isn t giving the Arcturus guys a break The whistle blew for them to return to the goal line Well asked Roger do we freeze or don t we I don t want to But majority always rules in this unit Roger Tom glanced at Astro How about it Astro We can beat em fair and square We play all out answered Astro Roger didn t say anything He moved to one side and took his position for the dash down field The whistle blew again and the crowd roared as the two teams charged toward the ball The cadets were eager to see if the Arcturus crew could tie the score or if the crew of the Polaris would increase its lead But after a few moments of play their cries of encouragement subsided into rumbles of discontent In its eagerness to score the Arcturus unit kept making errors and lost the ball constantly but the crew of the Polaris failed to capitalize The second period ended with the score unchanged As he slumped to the ground for the rest period Astro turned on Roger bitterly What s the idea Manning You re dogging it You play your game Astro replied Roger calmly I ll play mine We re playing this game as a team Roger chimed in Tom heatedly You re kicking the ball all over the lot Yeah added Astro In every direction except the goal I was never clear defended Roger I didn t want to lose possession of the ball You sure didn t said Tom You acted as if it was your best friend and you never wanted to be separated from it Illustration We said we didn t want to freeze this game Roger and we meant it Astro glowered at his unit mate Next period you show us some action If you don t want to score feed it to us and we ll save you the trouble But the third period was the same While Tom and Astro dashed up and down the field blocking out the members of the Arcturus crew to give Roger a clear shot he simply nudged the ball back and forth between the side lines ignoring his teammates pleas to drive forward As the whistle sounded for the end of the period boos and catcalls from the grandstand filled the air Tom s face was an angry red as he faced Roger again on the side lines during the rest period You hear that Roger he growled nodding his head toward the stands That s what they think of your smart playing What do I care replied the blond cadet arrogantly They re not playing this game I am And we are too Astro s voice was a low rumble as he came up behind Manning If you don t give us a chance so help me I ll use your head for a ball Illustration If you re so interested in scoring why don t you go after the ball yourselves then said Roger Because we re too busy trying to be a team snapped Tom We re trying to clear shots for you Don t be so generous sneered Roger I m warning you Roger Astro glared at the arrogant cadet if you don t straighten out and fly right McKenny s whistle from the far side lines suddenly sounded interrupting the big cadet and the three boys trooped back out on the field again Again the air was filled with boos and shouts of derision and Tom s face flushed with shame This time when McKenny s hand flashed downward Tom streaked for the ball instead of Schohari his usual opponent He measured his stride carefully and reached the ball in perfect kicking position He felt the satisfying thud against his foot and saw the ball shoot out high in front of him and head for the goal line It was a beautiful kick But then the ball suddenly sank its flight altered by the action of the mercury Running down field Tom saw Swift and Allen meet the ball together Allen blocked it with his chest and caromed it over to Swift Swift let the ball drop to the ground drawing his foot back to kick But again the mercury changed the ball s action twisting it to one side and Swift s kick caught it on the side Instead of the ball going down field it veered to the left in the path of Astro Quickly getting his head under it he shifted it to Roger who streaked in and stopped it with his hip But then instead of passing ahead to Tom who by now was down field and in the open Roger prepared to kick for the goal himself Tom shouted a warning but it was too late Schohari came rushing in behind him and at running stride met the ball squarely with his right foot It sailed high in the air and over the Polaris goal line just as the whistle blew The game was tied That was some play Manning said Astro when they were lined up waiting for the next period to begin You asked for it snapped Roger you were yapping at me to play and now look what s happened Listen you loudmouthed punk said Astro advancing toward the smaller cadet but just then the whistle blew and the three boys ran out onto the field The Arcturus crew swept down the field quickly heading for the ball and seemingly ignoring the Polaris unit But Schohari slipped and fell on the grass which gave Tom a clear shot at the ball He caught it with the side of his boot and passed it toward Roger But Allen at full speed came in and intercepted sending the ball in a crazy succession of twists turns and bounces The crowd came to its feet as all six cadets made desperate attempts to clear the skittering ball with none of them so much as touching it This was the part of mercuryball that pleased the spectator Finally Schohari managed to get a toe on it and he sent it down field but Astro had moved out to play defense He stopped the ball on his shoulder and dropped it to the ground Steadying it there he waited until Tom was in the clear and kicked it forty yards to the mid field stripe The crowd came to its feet sensing this final drive might mean victory for the Polaris crew The boys of the Arcturus swarmed in trying to keep Tom from scoring With a tremendous burst of speed Tom reached the ball ahead of Schohari and with the strength of desperation he slammed his foot against it The whistle blew ending the game as the ball rose in an arc down the field and fell short of the goal by ten feet There was a groan from the crowd But suddenly the ball still reacting to the mercury inside spun like a top rolled sideways and as if it were being blown by a breeze rolled toward the goal line and stopped six inches inside the white chalk line There was a moment s pause as the crowd and the players stunned by the play grasped what had happened Then swelling into a roar there was one word chanted over and over Polaris Polaris Polaris The Polaris unit had reached the finals of the Academy tournament During the intermission Charlie Wolcheck unit commander of the Capella crew walked over to the refreshment unit behind the grandstand where Steve Strong doctor Dale and Commander Walters were drinking Martian water and eating spaceburgers Afternoon Commander saluted Wolcheck Hello Joan Steve Looks as though your boys on the Polaris are going to meet their match this afternoon I ve got to admit they re good but with Tony Richards feeding passes to Al Davison and with the blocking of Scott McAvoy The young officer broke off with a grin I don t know Charlie Commander Walters said with a wink to doctor Dale From the looks of Cadet Astro if he ever gets his foot on the ball your Capella unit will have to go after it with a jet boat Why Commander replied Wolcheck laughing good naturedly Tony Richards is one of the finest booters I ve ever seen Saw him make a goal from the sixty yard line from a standstill Steve Strong waved a Martian water pop bottle at young Wolcheck in a gesture of friendly derision Did you happen to see the play in the first period he boasted Manning took a perfect pass from Astro and scored You re finished Wolcheck you and your Capella unit won t even come close From what I hear and see Manning seems to be a little sore that he can t make all the scores himself grinned Wolcheck slyly He wants to be the whole show Strong reddened and turned to put the empty bottle on the counter using it as an excuse to hide his feelings from the commander and Joan So Wolcheck had observed Manning s attitude and play on the field too Before Strong could reply a bugle sounded from the field and the group of Solar Guard officers returned to their seats for the final game of the tournament between the Capella and the Polaris units Out on the field Mike made his usual speech about playing fair and gave the cadets the routine instructions of the game reminding them that they were spacemen first unit members second and individuals third and last The six boys shook hands and jogged down the field to take up their positions How about concentrating on the passes Richards is going to feed to Davison Tom asked his unit mates Never mind blocking out Richards and McAvoy Yeah agreed Astro play for the ball Sounds good to me How about it Roger asked Tom Just play the game said Roger And then added sarcastically And don t forget to give them every chance to score Let s play fair and square the way we did with the Arcturus unit If you feel that way Manning answered Astro coldly you can quit right now We ll handle the Capella guys ourselves Before Roger could answer McKenny blew the ready whistle and the three boys lined up along the white chalk line preparing for the dash to the waiting ball The cadets in the stands were hushed McKenny s hand swept up and then quickly down as he blew the whistle The crowd came to its feet roaring as Tom five steps from his own goal line tripped and fell headlong to the grass putting him out of the first play Astro and Roger charged down the field with Astro reaching the ball first He managed a good kick but Richards three feet away took the ball squarely on his chest The mercuryball fell to the ground spun in a dizzy circle and with a gentle tap by Richards rolled to Davison who took it in stride and sent it soaring for a forty five yard goal The Capella unit had drawn first blood Well hot shot snarled Roger back on the starting line what happened to the big pass stealing idea I tripped Manning said Tom through clenched teeth Yeah Tripped sneered Roger The whistle blew for the next goal Tom with an amazing burst of speed swept down the field broke stride to bring him in perfect line with the ball and with a kick that seemed almost lazy sent the ball from a dead standstill fifty yards over the Capella goal before any of the remaining players were within five feet of it and the score was tied The crowd sprang to its feet again and roared his name That was terrific said Astro slapping Tom on the back as they lined up again It looked as though you hardly kicked that ball at all Yeah muttered Roger you really made yourself the grandstand s delight What s that supposed to mean Manning asked Astro Superman Corbett probably burned himself out Let s see him keep up that speed for the next ten minutes The whistle blew for the next goal and again the three boys moved forward to meet the onrushing Capella unit Richards blocked Astro with a twist of his body and without stopping his forward motion kicked the ball squarely toward the goal It stopped ten feet short took a dizzying spin and rolled away from the goal line In a flash the six boys were around the ball blocking shoving and yelling instructions to each other while at the same time kicking at the unsteady ball With each grazing kick the ball went into even more maddening spins and gyrations At last Richards caught it with the side of his foot flipped it to McAvoy who dropped back and with twenty feet between him and the nearest Polaris member calmly booted it over the goal The whistle blew ending the first period and the Capella unit led two to one During the next three periods the Capella unit worked like a well oiled machine Richards passed to Davison or McAvoy and when they were too well guarded played brilliantly alone The Polaris unit on the other hand appeared to be hopelessly outclassed Tom and Astro fought like demons but Roger s lack of interest gave the Capella unit the edge in play At the end of the fourth period the Capella team led by three points seven to four While the boys rested before the fifth and final period Captain Strong having watched the play with keen interest realized that Roger was not playing up to his fullest capabilities Suddenly he summoned a near by Earthworm cadet scribbled a message on a slip of paper and instructed the cadet to take it directly to Roger Orders from the coach on the side lines asked Wolcheck as he noticed Strong s action You might call it that Charlie answered Steve blandly On the field the cadet messenger handed Roger the slip of paper not mentioning that it was from Strong and hurried back to the stands Getting fan mail already asked Astro Roger ignored the comment and opened the slip of paper to read It might interest you to know that the winning team of the mercuryball finals is to be awarded a first prize of three days liberty in Atom City There was no signature Roger stared up into the stands and searched vainly for some indication of the person who might have sent him the note The crowd hushed as McKenny stepped forward for the starting of the last period What was in the note Roger asked Tom The winning combination smiled Roger lazily Get set for the fastest game of mercuryball you ve ever played Corbett We ve got to pull this mess out of the fire Bewildered Tom looked at Astro who merely shrugged his shoulders and took his place ready for the whistle Roger tucked the note into his shorts and stepped up to the line Listen Corbett said Roger every time Richards gets the ball he kicks it to his left and then McAvoy feints as if to get it leaving Davison in the open When you go to block Davison you leave Richards in the clear He just keeps the ball He s scored three times that way Yeah said Tom I noticed that but there was nothing I could do about it the way you ve been playing Kinda late in the game for any new ideas Manning growled Astro Just get the ball and pass it to me That s my whole idea Play back Astro Move like you re very tired see Then they ll forget about you and play three on two You just be ready to kick and kick hard What s happened to you Roger asked Tom What was in that note Before Roger could answer the whistle and the roar from the crowd signaled the beginning of the last period The cadets raced down the field Roger swerving to the left and making a feint at blocking Richards He missed intentionally and allowed Richards to get the ball who immediately passed to the left McAvoy raced in on the ball Tom made a move as if to block him reversed and startled the onrushing Richards with a perfect block The ball was in the clear Roger gave it a half kick and the ball landed two feet in front of Astro The big cadet caught it perfectly on the first bounce and kicked it on a line across the goal seventy yards away Up in the stands Steve Strong smiled as he watched the score change on the board Capella seven Polaris five In rapid succession the Polaris unit succeeded in intercepting the play of the Capella unit and rolling up two goals to an even score Now there were only fifty five seconds left to play The cadets in the stands roared their approval of the gallant effort made by the three members of the Polaris crew It had been a long time since mercuryball had been played with such deadly accuracy at Space Academy and everyone who attended the game was to remember for years to come the last play of the game McKenny blew the whistle again and the boys charged forward but by now aware of the sudden flash of unity on the part of the opposing team the Capella unit fought desperately to salvage at least a tie Tom managed to block a kick by Richards and the ball took a dizzy hop to the left landing in front of Astro He was in the clear The stands were in an uproar as the cadets saw that the game was nearly over Astro paused a split second judged the ball and stepped forward to kick But the ball spun away just as Astro swung his leg And at that instant McAvoy came charging in from the left only to be blocked by Roger But the force of McAvoy s charge knocked Roger back into Astro Instead of kicking the ball Astro caught Roger on the side of the head Roger fell to the ground and lay still He was knocked cold Astro lost his balance twisted on one leg unsteadily and then fell to the ground When he tried to get up he couldn t walk He had twisted his ankle The Capella unit members stood still confused and momentarily unable to take advantage of their opportunity Without a moment s hesitation Tom swept in and kicked the ball before his opponents realized what had happened The ball drifted up in a high arc and landed with several bounces stopping five feet from the goal Suddenly Richards McAvoy and Davison came alive and charged after Tom who was running for the ball as fast as his weary legs would carry him He saw Richards pull up alongside of him then pass him Then Davison and McAvoy closed in on either side to block and give Richards a clear shot back down the field and a certain score Richards reached the ball stopped and carefully lined up his kick certain that his teammates could block out Tom But the young cadet in a last desperate spurt outraced both McAvoy and Davison Then as Richards cocked his foot to kick Tom jumped With a mighty leaping dive he sent his body hurtling headlong toward Richards just as he kicked Tom s body crashed into the ball and Richards The two boys went down in a heap but the ball caromed off his chest and rolled over the goal line The whistle blew ending the game In an instant two thousand officers cadets and enlisted men went wild as the ball rolled across the goal line The Polaris crew had won eight goals to seven From every corner of the field the crowd cheered the cadets who had finished the game had won it in the final seconds with two of them sprawled on the field unconscious and a third unable to stand on his feet Up in the stands Captain Strong turned to Commander Walters He found it hard to keep his eyes from filling up as he saluted briskly Captain Strong reporting sir on the success of the Polaris unit to overcome their differences and become a fighting unit And I mean fight Illustration CHAPTER eleven Atom City Express now arriving on track two The voice boomed over the loud speaker system and as the long gleaming line of monorail cars eased to a stop with a soft hissing of brakes the three cadets of the Polaris unit moved eagerly in that direction Atom City here we come cried Astro We and a lot of others with the same idea said Tom And in fact there were only a few civilians in the crowd pressing toward the car doors Uniforms predominated the blue of the cadets enlisted men in scarlet even a few in the black and gold uniforms which identified the officers of the Solar Guard Personally whispered Tom to his friends the first thing I want to do at Atom City is take a long walk somewhere where I won t see a single uniform As for me drawled Roger I m going to find a stereo studio where they re showing a Liddy Tamal feature I ll sit down in a front row seat and just watch that girl act for about six hours He turned to Astro And how about you Why why I ll string along with you Roger said the cadet from Venus It s been a long time since I ve seen a a Tom and Roger laughed A what teased Tom A a girl sputtered Astro blushing I don t believe it said Roger in mock surprise I never Come on interrupted Tom Time to get aboard They hurried across the platform and entered the sleek car Inside they found seats together and sank into the luxurious chairs Astro sighed gently stretched out his long legs and closed his eyes blissfully for a few moments Don t wake me till we get started he said We already have returned Tom Take a look Astro s eyes popped open He glanced through the clear crystal glass at the rapidly moving landscape These express jobs move on supercushioned ball bearings explained Tom You can t even feel it when you pull out of the station Blast my jets marveled Astro I d sure like to take a look at the power unit on this baby Even on a vacation all this guy can think about is power grumbled Roger How about building up our own power suggested Tom It s a long haul to Atom City Let s get a bite to eat O K with me spaceboy Astro grinned I could swallow a whole steer That s a great idea cadet said a voice from behind them It came from a gray haired man neatly dressed in the black one piece stylon suit currently in fashion and with a wide red sash around his waist Beg pardon sir said Tom were you speaking to us I certainly was replied the stranger I m asking you to be my guests at dinner And while I may not be able to buy your friend a whole steer I ll gladly get him a piece of one Hey said Astro do you think he means it He seems to replied Tom He turned to the stranger Thanks very much sir but don t think Astro was just kidding about his appetite I m sure he wasn t The gray haired man smiled and came over and stretched out his hand Then it s a deal he said My name s Joe Bernard Bernard exclaimed Roger He paled and glanced quickly at his two friends but they were too busy looking over their new friend to notice Glad to know you sir said Tom I m Tom Corbett This is Astro from Venus And over here is Roger s my name the third cadet said quickly Won t you sit down sir No use wasting time said Bernard Let s go right into the dining car The cadets were in no mood to argue with him They picked up the small microphones beside their chairs and sent food orders to the kitchen and by the time they were seated in the dining car their orders were ready on the table mister Bernard with a twinkle in his eye watched them enjoy their food In particular he watched Astro I warned you sir whispered Tom as the Venusian went to work on his second steak I wouldn t have missed this for anything said Bernard He smiled lit a cigar of fine Mercurian leaf tobacco and settled back comfortably And now he said let me explain why I was so anxious to have dinner with you I m in the import export business Ship to Mars mostly But all my life I ve wanted to be a spaceman Well what was the trouble mister Bernard asked Roger The man in black sighed Couldn t take the acceleration boys Bad heart I send out more than five hundred cargoes a year to all parts of the solar system but myself I ve never been more than a mile off the surface of the earth It sure must be disappointing to want to blast off and know that you can t said Tom I tried once said Bernard with a rueful smile Yup I tried He gazed thoughtfully out the window When I was your age about twenty I wanted to get into Space Academy worse than anybody I d ever met He paused Except for one person A boyhood buddy of mine named Kenneth Excuse me sir cut in Roger quickly but I think we d better get back to our car With this big liberty in front of us we need a lot of rest But Roger exclaimed Tom Bernard smiled I understand Roger Sometimes I forget that I m an old man And when you ve already tasted the excitement of space travel talk like mine must seem rather dull He stood up and faced the three cadets It s been very pleasant Corbett Astro Roger Now run along and get your rest I ll just sit here for a while and watch the scenery Thank you sir said Tom for the dinner your company and everything he finished lamely There was a chorus of good byes and the boys returned to their car But there was little conversation now Gradually the lights in the cars dimmed to permit sleep But Tom kept listening to the subdued click of the monorail and kept wondering Finally Roger sleeping next to him wakened for a moment Roger said Tom I want to ask you something Wait ll the mornin mumbled Roger Wanta sleep The way you acted with Bernard Tom persisted You ate his dinner and then acted like he was poison Why was that Roger The other sat bolt upright Listen he said Listen Then he slumped back in his chair and closed his eyes Lemme sleep Corbett Lemme sleep I tell you He turned his back and in a moment was making sounds of deep slumber but Tom felt sure that Roger was not asleep that he was wide awake with something seriously bothering him Tom leaned back and gazed out over the passing plains and up into the deep black of space The Moon was full large and round He could distinguish Mare Imbrium the largest of Luna s flat plains visible from Earth where men had built the great metropolis of Luna City Farther out in the deep blackness he could see Mars glowing like a pale ruby Before long he would be up there again Before long he would be blasting off in the Polaris with Astro and with Roger Roger Why had he acted so strangely at dinner Tom remembered the night he saw Roger in Galaxy Hall alone at night and the sudden flash on the field a few days before when they had won the mercuryball game Was there some reason behind his companion s strange actions In vain Tom racked his brain to find the answer There had to be some explanation Yet what could it possibly be He tossed and turned and worried and finally comfortable as the monorail car was he fell asleep from sheer exhaustion Atom City Built of the clear crystal mined so cheaply on Titan moon of Saturn Atom City had risen from a barren North American wasteland to become a show place of the universe Here was the center of all space communications a proud city of giant crystal buildings Here had been developed the first slidewalks air cars three dimensional stereos and hundreds of other ideas for better living And here at Atom City was the seat of the great Solar Alliance housed in a structure which covered a quarter of a mile at its base and which towered three thousand noble feet into the sky The three cadets stepped out of the monorail and walked across the platform to a waiting air car jet powered shaped like a teardrop and with a clear crystal top We want the best hotel in town said Astro grandly to the driver And get this speed bug outa here in a hurry Roger told him There s a lot we want to do The driver couldn t help smiling at the three cadets so obviously enjoying their first leave We ve got three top hotels he said One s as good as the other They re the Earth the Mars and the Venus The Earth voted Tom The Mars shouted Roger The Venus roared Astro All right said the driver with a laugh make up your minds Which of em is nearest the center of the city Tom asked The Mars Then blast off for Mars ordered Tom and the air car shot away from the station and moved up into the stream of expressway traffic fifty feet above the ground As the little car sped along the broad avenue Tom remembered how often as a boy he d envied the Space Cadets who d come to his home town of New Chicago on leave Now here he was in uniform with a three day pass and all of Atom City to enjoy it in A few minutes later the air car stopped in front of the Mars Hotel The cadets saw the entrance loom before them a huge opening with ornate glass and crystal in many different colors They walked across the high ceilinged lobby toward the desk All around them the columns that supported the ceiling were made of the clearest crystal Their feet sank into soft lustrous deep pile rugs made of Venusian jungle grass The boys advanced toward the huge circular reception desk where a pretty girl with red hair waited to greet them May I help you she asked She flashed a dazzling smile You re a lucky girl said Roger It just so happens you can help me We ll have dinner together just the two of us and then we ll go to the stereos After which we ll The girl shook her head sadly I can see your friend s got a bad case of rocket shock she said to Tom That s right Tom admitted But if you ll give us a triple room we ll make sure he doesn t disturb anybody Ah said Roger go blow your jets I have a nice selection of rooms here on photo slides if you d care to look at them the girl suggested How many rooms in this hotel Beautiful asked Roger Nearly two thousand answered the girl And you have photo slides of all two thousand Why yes answered the girl Why do you ask You and Astro go take a walk Corbett said Roger with a grin I ll select our quarters You mean asked the girl a little flustered you want to look at all the slides Sure thing Lovely said Roger with a lazy smile But but that would take three hours Exactly my idea said Roger Just give us a nice room Miss said Tom cutting in And please excuse Manning He s so smart he gets a little dizzy now and then Have to take him over to a corner and revive him He glanced at Astro who picked Roger up in his arms and walked away with him as though he were a baby Come on you space Romeo said Astro Hey ouch hey lemme go ya big ape You re killing your best friend Roger twisted around in Astro s viselike grasp to no avail Space fever explained Tom He ll be O K soon I think I understand said the girl with a nervous smile She handed Tom a small flashlight Here s your photoelectric light key for room twenty three oh five F That s on the two hundred thirtieth floor Tom took the light key and turned toward the slidestairs where Astro was holding Roger firmly despite his frantic squirming Hey Tom cried Roger tell this Venusian ape to let me go Promise to behave yourself asked Tom We came here to have fun didn t we demanded Roger That doesn t mean getting thrown out of the hotel because you ve got to make passes at every beautiful girl What s the matter with beautiful girls growled Roger They re official equipment like a radar scanner You can t get along without them Tom and Astro looked at each other and burst out laughing Come on you jerk said Astro let s get washed up I wanta take a walk and get something to eat I m hungry again An hour later showered and dressed in fresh uniforms the Polaris crew began a tour of the city They went to the zoo and saw dinosaurs a tyrannosaurus and many other monsters extinct on Earth millions of years ago but still breeding in the jungles of Tara They visited the council chamber of the Solar Alliance where delegates from the major planets and from the larger satellites such as Titan of Saturn Ganymede of Jupiter and Luna of Earth made the laws for the tri planetary league The boys walked through the long halls of the Alliance building looking at the great documents which had unified the solar system They reverently inspected original documents of the Universal Bill of Rights and the Solar Constitution which guaranteed basic freedoms of speech press religion peaceful assembly and representative government And even brash irrepressible Roger Manning was awestruck as they tiptoed into the great Chamber of the Galactic Court where the supreme judicial body of the entire universe sat in solemn dignity Later the boys visited the Plaza de Olympia a huge fountain filled with water taken from the Martian Canals the lakes of Venus and the oceans of Earth and ringed by a hundred large statues each one symbolizing a step in mankind s march through space But then for the Space Cadets came the greatest thrill of all a trip through the mighty Hall of Science at once a museum of past progress and a laboratory for the development of future wonders Thousands of experiments were being conducted within this crystal palace and as Space Cadets the boys were allowed to witness a few of them They watched a project which sought to harness the solar rays more effectively another which aimed to create a new type of fertilizer for Mars so people of that planet would be able to grow their own food in their arid deserts instead of importing it all from other worlds Other scientists were trying to adapt Venusian jungle plants to grow on other planets with a low oxygen supply while still others in the medical field sought for a universal antibody to combat all diseases Evening finally came and with it time for fun and entertainment Tired and leg weary the cadets stepped on a slidewalk and allowed themselves to be carried to a huge restaurant in the heart of Atom City Food exulted Astro as the crystal doors swung open before them Smell it Real honest to gosh food He rushed for a table Hold it Astro shouted Tom Take it easy Yeah added Roger It s been five hours since your last meal not five weeks Meal snorted the Venusian cadet Call four spaceburgers a meal And anyway it s been six hours not five Laughing Tom and Roger followed their friend inside Luckily they found a table not far from the door where Astro grabbed the microphone and ordered his usual tremendous dinner The three boys ate hungrily as course after course appeared on the middle of the table via the direct shaft from the kitchen So absorbed was Manning that he did not notice the approach of a tall dark young man of about his own age dressed in the red brown uniform of the Passenger Space Service But the young man who wore a captain s high billed hat suddenly caught sight of Roger Manning he called what brings you here Al James cried Roger and quickly got up to shake hands Of all the guys in the universe to show up Sit down and have a bite with us The space skipper sat down Roger introduced him to Tom and Astro There was a round of small talk Whatever made you become a Space Cadet Roger asked James finally Oh you know how it is said Roger You can get used to anything Astro almost choked on a mouthful of food He shot a glance at Tom who shook his head as though warning him not to speak James grinned broadly I remember how you used to talk back home The Space Cadets were a bunch of tin soldiers trying to feel important The Academy was a lot of space gas I guess now you ve changed your mind Maybe I have said Roger He glanced uneasily at his two friends but they pretended to be busy eating Maybe I have Roger s eyes narrowed his voice became a lazy drawl At that it s better n being a man in a monkey suit with nothing to do but impress the passengers and order around the crew Wait a minute said James What kind of a crack is that No crack at all Just the way I feel about you passenger gents who don t know a rocket tube from a ray gun nozzle Look Manning returned James No need to get sore just because you couldn t do any better than the Space Cadets Blast off shouted Roger before I fuse your jets Tom spoke up I think you d better go Captain I ve got six men outside sneered the other I ll go when I m ready You re ready now spoke up Astro He stood up to his full height We don t want any trouble the cadet from Venus said but we re not braking our jets to get away from it either James took a good look at Astro s powerful frame Without another word he walked away Tom shook his head That pal of yours is a real Space Cadet fan isn t he Roger Yeah said Astro Just like Manning is himself Look said Roger Look you guys He hesitated as though intending to say something more but then he turned back to his dinner Go on finish your food he growled He bent over his plate and ate without lifting his eyes And not another word was spoken at the table until a young man approached carrying a portable teleceiver screen Pardon me he said Is one of you Cadet Tom Corbett Why I am acknowledged Tom There s a call for you Seems they ve been trying to reach you all over Atom City He placed the teleceiver screen on the table plugged it into a floor socket and set the dials Hope s there s nothing wrong at home said Tom to his friends My last letter from Mom said Billy was messing around with a portable atom reactor and she was afraid he might blow himself up A picture began to take shape on the screen Migosh said Astro It s Captain Strong It certainly is said the captain s image Having dinner eh boys Ummmm those baked shrimps look good They re terrific said Astro Wish you were here Wish you could stay there said Captain Strong Oh no moaned Astro Don t tell me Sorry boys came the voice from the teleceiver But that s it You ve got to return to the Academy immediately The whole cadet corps has been ordered into space for special maneuvers We blast off tomorrow morning at six hundred But sir objected Tom we can t get a monorail until morning This is an official order Corbett So you have priority over all civilian transportation The Solar Guard captain smiled I ve tied up a whole bank of teleceivers in Atom City searching for you Get back to Space Academy fast commandeer an air car if you must but be here by six hundred hours The captain waved a cheery good bye and the screen went dark Space maneuvers breathed Astro The real thing Yeah agreed Tom Here we go Our first hop into deep space said Roger Let s get out of here Illustration CHAPTER twelve The following ships in Squadron A will blast off immediately roared Commander Walters over the teleceiver He looked up alertly from a chart before him in the Academy spaceport control tower He began to name the ships Capella orbital tangent nine thousand eight hundred thirty four Arcturus orbital tangent nine thousand eight hundred thirty five Centauri orbital tangent nine thousand eight hundred thirty six Polaris orbital tangent nine thousand eight hundred thirty seven Aboard the space cruiser Polaris Tom Corbett turned away from the control board That s us sir he said to Captain Strong Very well Corbett The Solar Guard captain walked to the ship s intercom and flipped on the switch Astro Roger stand by Astro and Roger reported in Strong began to speak The cadet corps has been divided into squadrons of four ships each We are command ship of Squadron A When we reach free fall space we are to proceed as a group until eight hundred hours when we are to open sealed orders Each of the other seven squadrons will open their orders at the same time Two of the squadrons will then act as invaders while the remaining six will be the defending fleet It will be the invaders job to reach their objective and the defenders job to stop them Spaceport control to rocket cruiser Polaris your orbit has been cleared for blast off The voice of Commander Walters interrupted Strong in his instructions and he turned back to Tom Take over Corbett Tom turned to the teleceiver Rocket cruiser Polaris to spaceport control Blast off minus two six hundred forty eight I read you clear said Tom He clicked off the teleceiver and turned back to the intercom Stand by to raise ship Control deck to radar deck Do we have clear trajectory forward and up Roger All clear forward and up replied Roger Control deck to power deck energize the cooling pumps Cooling pumps aye came from Astro The giant ship began to shudder as the mighty pumps on the power deck started their build Tom strapped himself into the pilot s seat and began checking the dials in front of him Satisfied he fastened his eyes on the sweep hand of the time clock Above his head the teleceiver screen brought him a clear picture of the Academy spaceport He watched the giant cruisers take to the air one by one and rocket into the vastness of space The clock hand reached the ten second mark Stand by to raise ship Tom called into the intercom The red hand moved steadily inexorably Tom reached for the master switch Blast off minus five four three two one zero Tom threw the switch The great ship hovered above the ground for a few moments Then it heaved itself skyward faster and ever faster pushing the Earthmen deep into their acceleration cushions Reaching free fall space Tom flipped on the artificial gravity generator He felt its pull on his body quickly checked all the instruments and turned to Captain Strong Ship space borne at six hundred fifty three sir Very well Corbett replied Strong Check in with the Arcturus Capella and the Centauri form up on one another and assume a course that will bring you back over Academy spaceport at eight hundred hours when we will open orders Yes sir said Tom turning back eagerly to the control board For nearly two hours the four rocket ships of Squadron A moved through space in a perfect arc shaping up for the eight hundred deadline Strong made use of the time to check a new astrogation prism perfected by doctor Dale for use at hyperspace speeds Tom rechecked his instruments then prepared hot tea and sandwiches in the galley for his shipmates This is what I call service said Astro He stood stripped to the waist a wide leather belt studded with assorted wrenches of various shapes and sizes strapped around his hips In one hand he carried a wad of waste cotton with which he continually polished the surfaces of the atomic motors while his eyes constantly searched the many gauges in front of him for the slightest sign of engine failure Never mind bringing anything up to Manning I ll eat his share Astro had deliberately turned the intercom on so Roger on the radar deck might hear The response from that corner was immediate and emphatic Listen you rocket headed grease monkey yelled Roger If you so much as smell that grub I ll come down and feed you into the reactant chamber Tom smiled at Astro and turned to the ladder leading up from the power deck Passing through the control deck on the way to the radar bridge he glanced at the clock It was ten minutes to eight Only one thing I m worried about Corbett said Roger through a mouthful of sandwich What s that asked Tom Collision said Roger Some of these space happy cadets might get excited and I for one don t want to wind up as a flash in Earth s atmosphere Why you have radar to see anything that goes on Oh sure said Roger I can keep this wagon outa their way but will they stay outa mine Why my father told me once Roger choked on his food and turned away to the radar screen Well said Tom after a moment what did your father tell you Ah nothing not important But I ve got to get a cross fix on Regulus before we start our little games Tom looked puzzled Here was another of Roger s quick changes of attitude What was it all about But there was work to do so Tom shrugged his shoulders and returned to the control deck He couldn t forget what Roger had said about a collision though Excuse me Captain said Tom but have there been any serious collisions in space between ships Sure have Tom replied Strong About twenty years ago maybe less there was a whole wave of them That was before we developed superrebound pulse radar The ships were faster than the radar at close range Strong paused Why do you ask Before Tom could answer there was a sharp warning from the captain Eight o clock Corbett Tom ripped open the envelope containing the sealed orders Congratulations he read You are in command of the defenders You have under your command Squadrons A B C D E F Squadrons G and H are your enemies and at this moment are on their way to attack Luna City It is your job to protect it and destroy the enemy fleet Spaceman s luck Walters Commander Space Academy Senior Officer Solar Guard Roger yelled Tom we ve been selected as flagship for the defenders Get me a course to Luna City Good for us spaceboy I ll give you that course in a jiffy Capella to Polaris am standing by for your orders Tony Richards voice crackled over the teleceiver One by one the twenty three ships that made up the defender s fleet checked in for orders Astro shouted Tom stand by for maneuver and be prepared to give me every ounce of thrust you can get Ready willing and able Tom replied Astro Just be sure those other space jockeys can keep up with me that s all Tom turned to Captain Strong What do you think of approaching Strong cut him off Corbett you are in complete command Take over you re losing time talking to me Yes sir said Tom He turned back to the control board his face flushed with excitement Twenty four ships to maneuver and the responsibility all his own Via a chart projected on a screen he studied various approaches to the Moon and Luna City What would he do if he were in command of the invading fleet He noticed the Moon was nearing a point where it would be in eclipse on Luna City itself He studied the chart further made several notations and turned to the teleceiver Attention attention flagship Polaris to Squadrons B and C proceed to chart seven sectors eight and nine You will patrol those sectors Attention Squadrons D and F proceed to Luna City at emergency space speed hover at one hundred thousand feet above Luna City spaceport and wait for further orders Attention ships three and four of Squadron F you will proceed to chart six sectors sixty eight through seventy five Cut all rockets and remain there until further orders The remainder of Squadron F ships one and two will join Squadron A Squadron A will stand by for further orders Tom glanced at the clock and punched the intercom button Illustration Attention Squadrons D and F proceed to Luna City Have you got that course Roger Three degrees on the starboard rockets seventy eight degrees on the up plane of the ecliptic will put you at the corner of Luna Drive and Moonset Land in the heart of Luna City spaceboy answered Roger Get that Astro asked Tom on the intercom All set replied Astro Attention all ships in Squadron A this is flagship code name Starlight am changing course Stand by to form up on me Tom turned back to the intercom Power deck execute At more than five thousand miles an hour the Polaris hurtled toward its destination One by one the remaining ships moved alongside until all six had their needlelike noses pointed toward the pale satellite of the Moon I d like to know what your plans are Tom said Strong when the long haul toward the Moon had settled down to a routine Just idle curiosity nothing more You don t have to tell me if you don t want to Golly yes said Tom I d be very grateful for your opinion Well let s have it said the captain But as for my opinion I ll listen but I won t say anything Tom grinned sheepishly Well he began if I were in command of the invading fleet I would strike in force I d have to to do damage with only eight ships There are three possible approaches to Luna City One is from the Earth side using the eclipse corridor of darkness as protection To meet that I ve stationed two ships at different levels and distances in that corridor so that it would be impossible for an invasion to pass unnoticed You mean you d be willing to give up two ships to the invader to have him betray his position Is that right Yes sir But I ve also sent Squadrons B and C to sectors eight and nine on chart seven So I have a roving squadron to go to their aid should the invader strike there And on the other hand should he manage to get through my outer defense I have Squadrons D and E over Luna City itself as an inner defense As for Squadron A we ll try to engage the enemy first and maybe weaken him at least reduce the full force of his attack And then have Squadrons B C D and E finish him off by attack from three different points Strong nodded silently The young cadet was shaping up a defensive strategy with great skill If he could only follow through on his plans the invaders of Luna City wouldn t have much chance of success even if willing to take heavy losses Roger s voice came on Got a report for you Tom From command ship Squadron B They ve sighted the invaders and are advancing to meet them Tom checked his charts and turned to the intercom Send them this message Roger he said From Starlight to command ship Squadrons B and C approach enemy ships from position of chart nineteen sections one through ten Right said Roger Strong smiled Tom was driving his heaviest force between the invading fleet and its objective forcing the aggressors into a trap Tom gave more crisp orders to his squadrons He asked Roger for an estimated range and then rechecking his position turned again to the intercom Astro how much could you get out of this baby by opening the by pass between the cooling pumps and the reactant chamber That d mean feeding the stuff into the motors only half cooled Strong turned started to speak then clamped his lips together Another quarter space speed roughly replied Astro about fifteen hundred miles more an hour Do you want me to do that No not now replied Tom Just wanted to know what I could depend on if I get stuck O K said Astro Let me know Why use emergency speed Corbett asked Strong You seem to have your enemy right where you want him now Yes sir replied Tom And the enemy knows I have him He can t possibly attack Luna City now But he can still run away He can make his escape by this one route Tom walked to the chart and ran his finger on a line away from the invader s position into the asteroid belt I don t want him to get away Tom explained And with the extra speed we can cut him off force him to turn into a position where the remainder of my fleet would finish him off You ll do this with just the Polaris Oh no sir said Tom I d use the Arcturus Capella and the Centauri as well Are you sure those other ships can equal your speed They ve got exactly the same type engines as we have here on the Polaris sir I m sure they could and with perfect safety Strong hesitated a moment started to ask a question then stopped and walked to the chart screen He checked the figures He checked them four times then turned to Tom with a grin and an outstretched hand I ve got to offer my congratulations Tom This maneuver would wipe them out And I ve got a notion that you d come off without the loss of a single ship plus and it is a big plus keeping the invaders more than fifty thousand miles away from their objective The captain turned to the teleceiver Rocket cruiser Polaris to control tower at Space Academy There was a crackle of static and then the deep voice of Commander Walters boomed from the speaker Spaceport control to Polaris Come in Steve In a few brief sentences Strong outlined Tom s plan of action to the Academy commander The commander s face on the teleceiver widened into a grin then broke out in a hearty laugh What s that sir asked Captain Strong Very simple Steve All of us all the Academy top brass develop a foolproof test for cadet maneuvers And then your young Corbett makes us look like amateurs But didn t you expect one side or the other to win asked Strong Of course but not like this We ve been expecting a couple of days of maneuver with both sides making plenty of mistakes that we could call them on But here Corbett wraps the whole thing up before we can get our pencils sharpened Better stuff cotton in Corbett s ears before he hears all this rasped Roger Manning over the intercom Or his head ll be too big to go through the hatch Quiet Manning came Astro s voice from the power deck Your mouth alone is bigger than Tom s head ll ever be Look you Venusian ape began Roger but Commander Walters voice boomed out again His face on the teleceiver screen was serious now Attention Attention all units The battle has been fought and won on the chart screen of the rocket cruiser Polaris The Luna City attack has been repelled and the invading fleet wiped out All units and ships will return to Space Academy at once Congratulations to all and end transmission The commander s face faded from the screen Captain Strong turned to Tom Good work he said He was interrupted by a crackle of static from the teleceiver A face suddenly appeared on the screen a man s face frightened and tense S O S The voice rang out through the control deck This is an S O S Space passenger ship Lady Venus requests assistance immediately Position is sector two chart one hundred three Emergency We must have The screen went blank the voice stopped as though cut off by a knife Strong frantically worked the teleceiver dials to re establish contact Polaris to Lady Venus he called Come in Lady Venus Rocket cruiser Polaris calling Lady Venus Come in Come in There was no answer The passenger ship s instruments had gone dead CHAPTER thirteen Polaris to Commander Walters at Space Academy Come in Commander Walters Captain Strong s voice was urgent in the teleceiver Just worked up an assumed position on the Lady Venus said Roger over the intercom I think she s bearing about seventeen degrees to port of us and about one twenty eight on the down plane of the ecliptic O K Roger said Tom Captain Strong s trying to reach Commander Walters now He made a quick mental calculation Golly Roger if you ve figured it right we re closer to the Lady Venus than anyone else The teleceiver audio crackled Commander Walters at Space Academy to Captain Strong on the Polaris Come in Steve Commander Strong s voice sounded relieved Did you get that emergency from the Lady Venus the S O S Yes we did Steve said the commander How far away from her are you Without a word Tom handed Strong the position that Roger had computed Strong relayed the information to the commander If you re that close go to her aid in the Polaris You re nearer than any Solar Guard patrol ship and you can do just as much Right sir replied Steve I ll report as soon as I get any news End transmission Spaceman s luck end transmission said the commander Have you got a course for us Roger asked Strong Yes sir Then let s get out of here I have a feeling there s something more than just the usual emergency attached to that S O S from the Lady Venus In twenty seconds the mighty cruiser was blasting through space to the aid of the stricken passenger ship Better get the emergency equipment ready Tom said Strong Space suits for the four of us and every spare space suit you have on the ship Never can tell what we might run into Also the first aid surgical kit and every spare oxygen bottle Oh yeah and have Astro get both jet boats ready to blast off immediately I ll keep trying to pick them up again on the teleceiver Yes sir replied Tom sharply What s going on up there asked Astro when Tom had relayed the orders from Captain Strong Tom quickly told him of the emergency signal from the Lady Venus Lady Venus said the big cadet rolling the name on his tongue I know her She s one of the Martian City Venusport jobs an old timer Converted from a chemical burner to atomic reaction about three years ago Any ideas what the trouble might be asked Tom I don t know replied Astro There are a hundred and fifty things that could go wrong even on this wagon and she s brand new But I wouldn t be surprised if it was on the power deck And what makes you think so asked Tom I knew a spaceman once that was on a converted tub just like the Lady Venus and he had trouble with the reaction chamber Wow exclaimed Tom Let s hope it isn t that now You can say that again said Astro grimly When this stuff gets out of control there s very little you can do with it except leave it alone and pile out The Polaris rocketing through space at full space speed plunged like a silver bullet through the vastness of the black void heading for what Strong hoped to be the Lady Venus Tom prepared the emergency equipment doubling all the reserves on the oxygen bottles by refilling the empties he found on the ship and making sure that all space suits were in perfect working order Then he opened the emergency surgical kit and began the laborious task of examining every vial and drug in the kit to acquaint himself with what there was to work with just in case He brought all the stores of jelly out for radiation burns and finally opened a bottle of special sterilization liquid with which to wipe all the instruments and vials clean He checked the contents of the kit once more and satisfied that everything was as ready as he could make it he went up to the control deck Any other message from them yet sir asked Tom Nothing yet answered Strong If I could pick them up on the teleceiver maybe they could tell us what the trouble is and then we could more or less be prepared to help them He bent over the teleceiver screen and added grimly If there is anything left to help Radar deck to control deck Roger s voice was tense I think I ve picked them up on the radar scanner Captain Strong Relay it down here to control deck scanner Manning ordered Strong Ummmh murmured the captain when the screen began to glow I m pretty sure that s her Here s that assumed position Roger worked up Tom Check it against this one here on the scanner Tom quickly computed the position of the object on the scanner and compared it to the position Roger had given them previously If Roger s positioning was correct sir said Tom then that s the Lady Venus They both check out perfectly Strong bent over the radar scanner didn t answer Finally he turned around and flipped off the scanner That s her he announced Congratulations Roger You hit it right on the nose How shall we approach her sir asked Tom We d better wait until she sends up her flares You mean the identification flares for safety factors That s right replied Strong A white flare means it s all right to come alongside and couple air locks A red one means to stand off and wait for instructions Strong turned to the intercom Control deck to power deck Reduce thrust to one quarter space speed Power deck aye answered Astro We ll wait until we re about two miles away from her and then use our braking jets in the bow of the ship to bring us within a few thousand feet of her commented Strong Yes sir said Tom Work up an estimated range Roger said Strong and give me a distance on our approach Aye aye sir Roger replied Objective four miles away now sir When we hit three miles said Strong to Tom have Astro stand by the forward braking jets Aye sir said Tom Three and a half miles said Roger a few moments later Closing in fast Lady Venus looks like a dead ship That could only mean one thing said Strong bitterly There has been a power deck failure of some sort Three miles to objective sir reported Roger I think I can pick her up on the teleceiver now but only one way from us to her All right said Strong see what you can do In a few moments the teleceiver screen glowed and then the silver outline of the Lady Venus appeared on the screen I don t see any damage to her hull said Strong half to himself So if it was an explosion it wasn t a bad one Yes sir said Tom Shall I stand by with the flares Better send up a yellow identification flare identifying us as the Solar Guard Let them know who we are Tom turned to the yellow button on his left and pressed it Immediately a white flash resembling a meteor appeared on the teleceiver screen There should be an answer soon said Strong Three thousand yards to objective reported Roger Fire braking rockets one half ordered Strong Tom relayed the order to Astro and made the necessary adjustments on the control panel Stern drive rockets out ordered Strong Once again Tom relayed the message to Astro and turned to the control board Cut all rockets ordered Strong sharply The great ship slowed by the force of the braking rockets became motionless in space a bare five hundred yards from the Lady Venus They should be sending up their safety factor flare soon said Strong Keep trying to raise them on the teleceiver Roger Strong was peering through a crystal port directly at the ship hanging dead in space opposite them There wasn t any sign of life Tom stepped to the side of Steve Strong and looked out at the crippled passenger ship Why don t we go aboard sir asked Tom We ll wait a little longer for the flare If we don t get it soon There it is sir shouted Tom at Strong s side From the flare port near the nose of the commercial ship a ball of fire streaked out Red said Strong grimly That means we can t go alongside We ll have to use jet boats Captain Strong shouted Roger from the radar deck they re signaling us with a small light from the upper port on the starboard side Can you read it asked Strong quickly I think so sir They re using standard space code but the light is very dim What do they say reaction chamber said Roger slowly as he read the blinking light radiation leaking around baffle all safe Roger stopped That s all sir I couldn t get the rest of it Strong turned to the intercom Astro get the jet boats ready to blast off immediately Roger send this message Am coming aboard Stand by to receive me on your number one starboard jet boat catapult deck signed Strong Captain Solar Guard Yes sir replied Roger Get into your space suit Tom and give Astro a hand with the jet boats I have to get a message back to Space Academy and tell them to send out help right away Aye sir said Tom Roger said Strong stand by to record this message for the teleceiver in case Space Academy should call our circuit while we re off the ship All set sir came the reply from the radar deck O K here goes Captain Steve Strong Solar Guard am boarding passenger ship Lady Venus Secondary communications signal message received indicates it is power deck failure Am taking cadets Corbett Manning and Astro and boarding same at he paused and glanced at the clock thirteen hundred fifty one hours That all sir asked Roger That s it Get that set on the open circuit for any one calling us then climb into your space suit In a matter of minutes the four spacemen of the Polaris crew were making last minute adjustments on their space suits Astro picked up his heavy belt of tools and strapped them around his waist What s that for Astro asked Strong They ll have tools aboard the ship if we need them If that lead baffle in the reaction chamber has worked loose sir the odds are ten to one that the control chamber is flooded with radiation And if it is the tools are probably so hot you couldn t use them That s good thinking Astro complimented Strong He turned to Tom and Roger and checked their suits and the oxygen supply and feeder valves on their backs He then turned his back while Tom checked his and Roger adjusted Astro s All right turn on your communicators and test them ordered Strong One by one the boys flipped on the switch of the portable spacephones in their fish bowl helmets and spoke to each other Strong indicated that he was satisfied and turned toward the jet boat catapult deck the three boys following him in single file Astro you and Roger take number one boat said Strong Tom and I will take number two His voice had a harsh metallic tone through the headset spacephones Roger hurried along with Astro to the number one boat and climbed inside Jet boat has its own oxygen system said Astro to Roger Better make use of it while we re in here and save our suits supplies Good idea said Roger He locked the clear plastic airtight covering of the jet boat and began flicking at the control buttons Strap in you Venusian hick Here we go Roger shoved a lever at his side making the jet boat deck airtight from the rest of the Polaris and then by pressing a button on the simple control board a section of the Polaris hull slipped back exposing them to empty space The controls of a jet boat were simplicity itself A half moon wheel for guiding up down and either side and two pedals on the floor one for going and one for stopping Roger stepped on the Go pedal and the small ship flashed out into the darkness of space Almost immediately on the opposite side of the Polaris Captain Strong and Tom in the second boat shot away from the rocket cruiser and both boats headed for the stricken spaceship CHAPTER fourteen The hatch clanked shut behind them Inside the huge air lock of the Lady Venus Tom Roger Astro and Captain Strong waited for the oxygen to equal the pressure in their space suits before removing their fish bowl space helmets O K sir said Tom pressure s equal Strong stepped to the hatch leading to the inside of the ship and pushed hard It slid to one side How many jet boats do you have was the first thing Strong heard as he stepped through the door to the interior of the passenger ship Al James cried Manning So this is your tub The startled young skipper whom Tom Roger and Astro had met in Atom City turned to face the blond headed cadet Manning he gasped What s your trouble skipper asked Strong of the young spaceship captain Before James could answer there was a sudden clamor from beyond the next hatch leading to the main passenger cabin Suddenly the hatch was jerked open and a group of frightened men and women poured through The first to reach Strong a short fat man with a moonface and wearing glasses began to jabber hysterically while clinging to Strong s arm Sir this ship is going to blow up any moment You ve got to save us He turned to face Al James And he refused to allow us to escape in the jet boats He pointed an accusing finger at the young skipper as the other passengers loudly backed him up Just a moment snapped Strong There s a Solar Guard rocket cruiser only five hundred yards away so take it easy and don t get hysterical No one is going to get hurt if you keep calm and obey orders He turned to James What s the trouble skipper It s the reaction chamber The lead baffle around the chamber worked loose and flooded everything with radiation Now the mass in number three rocket is building and wildcatting itself If it gets any higher it ll explode Why didn t your power deck man dump the mass asked Strong We didn t know it was wildcatting until after he had tried to repair it And he didn t tighten the bolts enough to keep it from leaking radiation The young skipper paused He lived long enough to warn us though What s the Geiger count on the radiation asked Strong Up to twelve thirty two about ten minutes ago answered James I pulled everybody out of the power deck and cut all energy circuits including the energizing pumps We didn t have any power so I had to use the combined juice of the three jet boats to send out the emergency signal that you picked up He turned to face the little man with the glasses I had a choice of either saving about fifteen passengers on the jet boats and leaving the others or take a chance on saving everybody by using the power to send out a message Ummmmh said Strong to himself He felt confidence in a young spaceman who would take a decision like that on himself What was that Geiger count again he asked Must be better than fourteen hundred by now answered James Strong made a quick decision All right he said tight lipped abandon ship How many passengers Seventeen women and twenty three men including the crew replied James Does that include yourself asked Strong No came the reply Strong felt better Any man who would not count himself on a list to survive could be counted on in any emergency We ll take four women at a time in each jet boat first said Strong James you and I will operate the jet boats and ferry the passengers to the Polaris Tom you and Roger and Astro get everybody aboard the ship ready to leave Yes sir said Tom We haven t much time The reaction mass is building fast Come on James we have to rip out the seats in the jet boats to get five people in them Strong turned back into the jet boat launching well May I have the passenger lists Captain asked Tom turning to James The young skipper handed him a clip board with the names of the passengers and crew and followed Strong We will abandon ship in alphabetical order announced Tom Miss Nancy Anderson A young girl about sixteen stepped forward Just stand there by the hatch Miss said Tom He glanced at the next name Miss Elizabeth Anderson Another girl looking very much like the first stepped forward and stood beside her sister missus John Bailey called Tom A gray haired woman of about sixty stepped forward Pardon me sir but I would rather remain with my husband and go later with him No no Mary pleaded an elderly man holding his arm around her shoulder Go now I ll be all right Won t I sir He looked at Tom anxiously I can t be sure sir said Tom He found it difficult to control his voice as he looked down at the old couple who couldn t weigh more than two hundred pounds between them I m going to stay said the woman firmly As you wish Madam said Tom He looked at the list again missus Helen Carson A woman about thirty five carrying a young boy about four years old stepped out and took her place beside the two sisters In a moment the first eight passengers were assembled into two groups helped into space suits with a special portable suit for the little boy and loaded in the jet boats The red light over the hatch glowed then went out The first load of passengers had left the Lady Venus They re pretty jumpy Roger whispered nodding toward the remaining passengers Yeah answered Tom Say where s Astro I don t know Probably went to take a look at the jet boats to see if one could be repaired so we d have a third ferry running Good idea said Tom See if you can t cheer these people up Roger Tell them stories or sing songs or better yet get them to sing Try to make them forget they re sitting on an atom bomb I can t forget it myself said Roger How can I make them forget it Try anything I ll go see if I can t give Astro a hand Roger turned to face the assembled passengers and smiled All around him in the main passenger lounge the frightened men and women sat huddled together in small groups staring at him terror in their eyes Ladieeees and Gentlemen began Roger You are now going to be entertained by the loudest corniest and most miserable voice in the universe I m going to sing He waited for a laugh but there was only a slight stir as the passengers shifted nervously in their seats Shrugging his shoulders Roger took a deep breath and began to sing He only knew one song and he sang it with gusto From the rocket fields of the Academy To the far flung stars of outer space We re Space Cadets training to be On the lower deck of the passenger ship Tom smiled as he faintly heard his unit mate s voice He made his way to the jet boat deck of the Lady Venus and opened the hatch Hey Astro he called There wasn t any answer He stepped inside and looked around the empty deck Walking over to one of the jet boats he saw evidence of Al James s attempts to send out emergency signal messages He called again Hey Astro where are you Still no answer He noticed that one of the jet boats was missing There were three still on the deck but an empty catapult for the fourth made Tom think that Astro might have repaired the fourth and taken it out in space for a test The light over the escape hatch indicated that someone had gone out It was odd thought Tom for Astro to go out alone But then he shrugged remembering how Astro could lose himself in his work and forget everything but the job at hand He climbed back to the passenger deck When Tom opened the hatch to the main lounge the sight that filled his eyes was so funny that even in the face of danger he had to laugh Roger with his hands clasped behind his back was down on his knees trying to push a food pellet across the deck with his nose The whole passenger lounge echoed with hysterical laughter Suddenly the laughter was stopped by the sound of the bell over the air lock hatch Strong and James had returned to ferry more passengers to the Polaris Immediately the fun was forgotten and the passengers crowded around for the roll call Where s Astro asked Strong as he reappeared in the lounge He s down on the jet boat deck sir trying to fix another one replied Tom I think he s out testing one now Good said Strong How re they taking it He indicated the passengers Roger s been keeping them amused with games and songs sir said Tom proudly They ll need it I don t mind telling you Corbett said Strong it s a wonder to me this tub hasn t blown up already In less than a half hour the forty passengers and crewmen of the Lady Venus were transferred in alphabetical order to the waiting Polaris Roger kept up a continual line of patter and jokes and stories making a fool of himself but keeping the remaining passengers amused and their minds off the dangers of the rapidly building reaction mass Just one passenger left said Strong with myself and you three I think we can squeeze five in that jet boat and get off here That s for me said Roger I m the only man in the whole universe that s ever played to a packed house sitting on top of an atomic bomb All right Barrymore said Strong get aboard Say asked Tom where s Astro I don t know replied Roger I thought you went to find him half an hour ago I did said Tom but when I went to the jet boat deck one was missing So I figured he had fixed one and taken it out for a test Then he s probably outside in space now said Strong Suddenly the Solar Guard captain caught himself Wait a minute How many jet boats were on the deck Corbett Three sir Then Astro is still aboard the ship said Strong He couldn t have taken a boat James told me he couldn t repeat the message he sent out because he only had the power of three jet boats One was damaged and left behind at Atom City By the rings of Saturn said Roger a coupla million miles from home sitting on an atomic bomb and that big Venusian hick decides to play hide and seek Never mind the cracks said Strong We ve got to find him Captain said the little man with the round face and glasses who had first spoken to Strong when he came aboard just because my name happens to be Zewbriski and I have to be the very last to get on a jet boat I don t see why I have to wait any longer I demand to be taken off this ship immediately I refuse to risk my life waiting around for some foolish cadet That foolish cadet mister Zewbriski said Strong coldly is a human being like you and we don t budge until we find him At that moment the bell began to ring indicating that the outer hatch to the air lock was opening By the craters of Luna said Tom that must be Astro now But if it is said Roger how did he get out there From behind them the hatch to the inner air lock opened and Al James stepped through Captain Strong he said excitedly you ve got to come quickly Some of the crewmen have broken into your arms locker and taken paralo ray guns They threaten to leave you here if you don t return to the ship within five minutes They re afraid the Venus might blow up and damage the Polaris at this close range The young skipper his red brown uniform torn and dirty looked at the Solar Guard captain with wild eyed desperation They can t leave us here whimpered Zewbriski We ll all be blown to bits Shut up barked Strong He turned to Tom and Roger I can do one of two things he said I can order you to return to the Polaris now with James and myself or you can volunteer to stay behind and search for Astro Without looking at Roger Tom answered We ll stay sir And we won t have to search for him I think I know where he is Now that I think about it replied Strong I guess there is only one place he could be Yes sir said Tom down on the power deck trying to save this wagon Come on Roger Let s get him CHAPTER fifteen What s the reading on the Geiger counter now asked Tom Roger looked down at the face of the radioactive measuring device and answered She s been dropping for the last five minutes Tom Looks like the mass in number three is cooling off Fourteen hundred and ten now That s not fast enough said Astro straightening up from tightening a nut on the lead baffle She s still plenty hot That mass should have been dumped out of the rocket exhaust right away Now the whole tube control box is so hot with radiation it d burn you to a crisp if you opened the hatch Good thing you brought along those tools from the Polaris said Tom Yeah greaseball said Roger you used your head for once Now let s see you use it again and pile out of this hunk of junk Fifteen hundred on the counter is the danger mark Roger and as long as we keep it under that I m going to try and save this wagon replied Astro Why To get yourself a Solar Medal asked Roger sarcastically What do you think made this tub act up like this Astro asked Tom ignoring Roger s remark Using special reactant feed Tom replied Astro This is a converted chemical burner with an old type cooling pump It s touchy stuff Well couldn t we drive boron rods into the mass and slow down the reaction asked Tom No Tom answered Astro the control for the rods are inside the tube control box We can t reach it There was a sudden loud ticking from the Geiger counter Astro cried Roger The mass is building Here lemme see shouted Astro He took the instrument in his big hand and watched the clocklike face intently fourteen hundred thirty fourteen hundred fifty fourteen hundred seventy He faced his unit mates Well that does it The mass is maintaining a steady reaction without the energizing pumps It s sustaining itself But how is that possible asked Tom It s one of those freaks Tom It s been known to happen before The fuel is just hot enough to sustain a steady reaction because of its high intensity Once that baffle worked loose the mass started wildcatting itself And if it doesn t stop asked Roger tensely It ll reach a point where the reaction comes so fast it ll explode Let s pile out of here said Roger The three boys made a dash for their space suits and the jet boat Inside the air lock they adjusted their oxygen valves and waited for pressure to equalize so they could blast off Blast it said Astro there must be some way to get to that rocket tube and dump that stuff Impossible Astro said Roger The release controls are in the control box and with all that radiation loose you wouldn t last half a minute Tom walked over to the valve that would open the outside hatch Wonder how Captain Strong is making out with those tough babies on the Polaris asked Tom I don t know replied Roger but anything would be better than sitting around waiting for this thing to blow up Ah stop griping said Astro or I ll shove you up a rocket tube and blast you from here all the way back to Atom City Hey wait a minute shouted Tom Astro remember the time we were on the ground crew as extra duty and we had to overhaul the Polaris Yeah why There was one place you couldn t go You were too big so I went in remember Yeah the space between the rocket tubes and the hull of the ship It was when we were putting in the new tube So what So this said Tom When they converted this tub they had standard exhausts so it must have the same layout as the Polaris Suppose I climb in the main exhaust between the tube and the outer hull and cut away the cleats that hold the tube to the ship Why then everything would come out in one piece Astro s face lit up Reactant mass tube control box the works Say what are you two guys talking about asked Roger Saving a ship Roger said Tom Dumping the whole assembly of the number three rocket Ah you re space happy Maybe said Tom but I think it s worth trying How about it Astro O K by me Tom replied Astro Good You get the cutting torches rigged Astro Roger you give him a hand and keep your eye on the counter Then feed the torches to me when I get inside the tube I m going outside to get rid of a bad rocket and save a five million credit spaceship Before Astro or Roger could protest Tom opened the hatch and began to climb out on the steel hull toward the rocket tubes main exhaust His magnetic soled shoes gripping the smooth steel hull the cadet made his way aft to the stern of the ship and began the climb down around the huge firing tubes and into the tubes themselves Hey Astro he yelled into the spacephone I m inside the tubes How about those torches The cadets had adjusted the wave length so that all could hear what was said Take it easy spaceboy said Roger I m leaving the hatch now You and your fatheaded friend from Venus are so hopped up for getting a Solar Medal Knock it off Manning said Astro from inside the ship And for your information I don t want a medal I don t want anything except for you to stop griping Roger reached the end of the ship and began to climb down inside the tube where Tom was waiting for him O K spaceboy said Roger here re your cutting torches He started moving back I ll see you around I don t mind being a little hero for saving people and all that stuff But not for any ship And the odds against a big hero staying alive are too big Roger wait shouted Tom I ll need And then the curly headed cadet clamped his teeth together and turned back to the task at hand He made adjustments on the nozzle of the cutting torch and then focusing his chest light called to Astro O K Astro he said shoot me the juice Coming up Tom answered Astro And wait till I get my hands on that Manning I m going to smear that yellow space crawler from one corner of the universe to another Never mind the talk snarled Roger who at the moment was re entering the tube Just get that juice down to this torch and make it fast Tom turned to see Roger crawling back into the tube and adjusting a cutting torch Glad to have you aboard Roger said Tom with a smile that Roger could not see in the darkness of the tube The two boys went to work Suddenly the torches came to life And immediately Tom and Roger began to cut away at the cleats that held the tube lining to the skin of the ship Steadily the cadets worked their way up toward the center of the ship cutting anything that looked as though it might hold the giant tube to the ship Boy said Tom it s getting hot in here From inside the ship Astro s reassuring voice came back in answer You re getting close to the reactant mass chamber The last cleat is up by one of the exhaust gratings Think you can last it Well if he can t snarled Roger he s sure to get that medal anyway He inched up a little Move over Corbett I m skinnier than you are and I can reach that cleat easier than you can Roger slipped past Tom and inched his way toward the last cleat He pulled his torch up alongside and pulled the trigger The flame shot out and began eating the steel In a moment the last cleat was cut and the two boys started their long haul down the tube to the outside of the ship As they walked across the steel surface back to the air lock Tom stuck out his hand I m glad you came back Roger Save it for the boys that fall for that stuff Corbett said Roger sarcastically I came back because I didn t want you and that Venusian hick to think you re the only ones with guts around here No one has ever accused you of not having guts Roger Ah go blast your jets snarled Roger They went directly to the power deck where Astro was waiting for them the Geiger counter in his hand All set to get rid of the rotten apple he asked with a smile All set Astro said Tom What s the count She seems to have steadied around fourteen hundred ninety and believe me the ten points to the official danger mark of fifteen hundred is so small that we could find out where the angels live any moment now Then what re we waiting for said Tom Let s dump that thing How snarled Roger Tom and Astro looked at him bewilderedly What do you mean how asked Astro I mean how are you going to get the tube out of the ship Why started Tom there s nothing holding that tube assembly to the ship now We cut all the cleats remember We can jettison the whole unit It seems to me drawled Roger lazily that the two great heroes in their mad rush for the Solar Medal have forgotten an unwritten law of space There s no gravity out here no natural force to pull or push the tube The only way it could be moved is by the power of thrust either forward or backward O K Then let s push it out just that way said Astro How asked Roger cynically Simple Roger said Tom Newton s Laws of motion Everything in motion tends to keep going at the same speed unless influenced by an outside force So if we blasted our nose rockets and started going backward everything on the ship would go backward too then if we reversed Astro cut in Yeah if we blasted the stern rockets the ship would go forward but the tube being loose would keep going the other way There s only one thing wrong said Roger That mass is so hot now if any booster energy hit it it would be like a trigger on a bomb It d blow us from here to the next galaxy I m willing to try it said Tom How about you Astro I ve gone this far and I m not quitting now They turned to face Roger Well how about it Roger asked Tom No one will think you re yellow if you take the jet boat and leave now Ah talk again grumbled Roger We always have to talk Let s be original for a change and just do our jobs All right said Tom Take an emergency light and signal Captain Strong Tell him what we re going to do Warn him to stay away about two hundred miles off He ll know if we re successful or not within a half hour Yeah said Roger then we ll send him one big flash to mean we failed Bon voyage Fifteen minutes later as the Lady Venus drifted in her silent but deadly orbit Tom Roger and Astro still worked feverishly as the Geiger counter ticked off the increasing radioactivity of the wildcatting reaction mass in number three rocket tube Reading on the counter still s going up Astro warned Roger Fifteen O five Hurry it up Astro urged Tom Hand me that wrench Tom ordered Astro The big cadet stripped to the waist his thick arms and chest splattered with grease and sweat fitted the wrench to the nut and applied pressure Tom and Roger watched the muscles ripple along his back as the big Venusian pitted all of his great strength against the metal Give it all you ve got said Tom If we do manage to jettison that tube we ve got to keep this part of the power deck airtight Astro pulled harder The veins standing out on his neck At last easing off he stood up and looked down at the nut That s as tight as I can get it he said breathing heavily Or anyone else said Tom All the valve connections broken asked Astro Yep replied Roger We re sealed tight That s it then said Tom Let s get to the control deck and start blasting Astro turned to the power deck control board and checked the gauges for the last time From above his head he heard Tom s voice over the intercom All your relays to the power deck working Astro Ready Tom answered Astro Then stand by said Tom on the control deck He had made a hasty check of the controls and found them to be similar enough to those on the Polaris so that he could handle the ship He flipped the switch to the radar deck and spoke into the intercom Do we have a clear trajectory fore and aft Roger All clear replied Roger I sent Captain Strong the message What d he say The rebellion wasn t anything more than a bunch of badly scared old men Al James just got hysterical that s all Illustration A low muted roar pulsed through the ship What did he have to say about this operation I can t repeat it for your young ears said Roger So bad huh Yeah but not because we re trying to save the ship Then why asked Tom He s afraid of losing a good unit Tom smiled and turned to the control board Energize the cooling pumps he bawled to Astro over the intercom The slow whine of the pumps began to build to a shrieking pitch Pumps in operation Tom said Astro Cut in nose braking rockets ordered Tom A low muted roar pulsed through the ship Rockets on we re moving backward Tom reported Astro And then suddenly Astro let out a roar Tom the Geiger counter is going wild Never mind that now answered Tom Sound off Roger he yelled Ship moving astern one thousand feet a second two thousand four thousand I m going to let her build to ten Roger yelled Tom We ve only got one chance and we might as well make it a good one Six thousand yelled Roger Seven thousand Astro bellowed Tom stand by to fire stern rockets Ready Tom was Astro s reply Eight thousand warned Roger Spaceman s luck fellas The silver ship moved through space away from the Polaris Nine thousand reported Roger And Astro I really love ya Cut nose braking rockets ordered Tom There was a sudden hush that seemed to be as loud as the noise of the rockets The huge passenger ship Lady Venus was traveling through space as silent as a ghost Nine thousand five hundred feet a second yelled Roger Stand by Astro Roger Hang on tight and spaceman s luck Ten thousand feet a second Roger s voice was a hoarse scream Fire stern rockets bawled Tom Illustration CHAPTER sixteen Under the tremendous drive of the stern rockets the silver ship suddenly hurtled forward as if shot out of a cannon The dangerous tube slid out of the stern of the ship and was quickly left behind as the Lady Venus sped in the opposite direction That s it yelled Tom hold full space speed We dumped the tube but we re still close enough for it to blow us from here to Pluto I tracked it on the radar Tom yelled Roger I think we re far enough away to miss At that moment a tremendous flash of light filled the radar scanner as the mass exploded miles to the rear of the Lady Venus There it goes shouted Roger Great jumping Jupiter yelled Tom and we re still in one piece We did it From the power deck Astro s bull like roar could be heard through the whole ship Gimme an open circuit Tom said Astro I want to operate the air blowers down here and try to get rid of some of that radiation I have to get into the control chamber and see what s going on Tom flipped a switch on the board and set the ship on automatic flight Then turning to the teleceiver he switched the set on Lady Venus to Polaris said Tom come in Polaris come in Strong here on the Polaris the officer s voice crackled over the speaker By the rings of Saturn I should log you three space brained idiots for everything in the book Strong s face gradually focused on the teleceiver screen and he stared at Tom coldly That was the most foolish bit of heroics I ve ever seen and if I had my way I d I ll well The captain s glare melted into a smile I ll spend the rest of my life being known as the skipper of the three heroes Well done Corbett it was foolish and dangerous but well done Tom his face changing visibly with each change in Strong s attitude finally broke out into a grin Thank you sir said Tom but Astro and Roger did as much as I did I m sure they did replied Strong Tell them I think it was one of the the he thought a moment and then added darndest most foolish things most Yes sir said Tom trying hard to control his face He knew the moment for disciplining had passed and that Captain Strong was just overwhelmed with concern for their safety Stand by the air locks Corbett we re coming aboard again We re pretty cramped for space here on the Polaris Just then Astro yelled up from the power deck Hey Tom he called If Captain Strong is thinking about putting those passengers back aboard I think you d better tell him about the radiation I haven t been able to flush it all out yet And since we only have three lead lined suits He left the statement unfinished I get you Astro replied Tom He turned back to the teleceiver and faced Strong Astro says the ship is still hot from radiation sir And that he hasn t been able to flush it out with the blowers Ummmmh mused Strong thoughtfully Well in that case stand by Corbett I ll get in touch with Commander Walters right away Very well sir replied Tom He turned from the teleceiver and climbed up to the radar deck Well hot shot said Roger looks like you ve made yourself a hero this trip What do you mean by that Roger First you run off with top honors on the space maneuvers and now you save the ship and have Strong eating out of your hand That s not very funny Roger said Tom I think it is drawled Roger Tom studied the blond cadet for a moment What s eating you Roger Since the day you came into the Academy you ve acted like you hated every minute of it And yet on the other hand I ve seen you act like it was the most important thing in your life Why I told you once Corbett said Roger with the sneering air which Tom knew he used when he was on the defensive that I had my own special reasons for being here I m not a hero Corbett Never was and never will be You re strictly the hero type Tried and true a thousand just like you all through the Academy and the Solar Guard Strong is a hero type Then what about Al James asked Tom What about that time in Atom City when you defended the Academy Uh uh grunted Roger I wasn t defending the Academy I was just avoiding a fight He paused and eyed Tom between half closed lids You ll never do anything I can t or won t do just as well Tom The difference between us is simple I m in the Academy for a reason a special reason You re here like most of the other cadets because you believe in it That s the difference between you me and Astro You believe in it I don t I don t believe in anything but Roger Manning Tom faced him squarely I m not going to buy that Roger I don t think that s true And the reasons I don t believe it are many You have a chip on your shoulder yes But I don t think you re selfish or that you only believe in Manning If you did you wouldn t be here on the Lady Venus You had your chance to escape back in the rocket tube but you came back Roger and you made a liar out of yourself Hey you guys yelled Astro coming up behind them I thought we left that stuff back at the Academy Tom turned to face the power deck cadet What s cooking below Astro Were you able to get rid of the radiation Naw replied the cadet from Venus Too hot Couldn t even open the hatch It ll take a special job with the big equipment at the space shipyards We need their big blowers and antiradiation flushers to clean this baby up Then I d better tell Captain Strong right away He s going to get in touch with Commander Walters at the Academy for orders Yeah you re right said Astro There isn t a chance of getting those people back aboard here now Once we opened up that outer control deck to dump that tube the whole joint started buzzing with radioactive electrons Tom turned to the ladder leading to the control deck and disappeared through the hatch leaving Astro and Roger alone What was that little bit of space gas about Roger Ah nothing replied Roger Just a little argument on who was the biggest hero Roger smiled and waved a hand in a friendly gesture Tom won two to one He sure handled that control deck like he had been born here all right said Astro Well I ve got to take a look at those motors We ll be doing something soon and whatever it is we ll need those power boxes to get us where we want to go Yeah said Roger and I ve got to get a course and a position He turned to the chart screen and began plotting rapidly Down on the control deck Strong was listening to Tom and Astro said we d need the special equipment at the space shipyards to clean out the radiation sir If we took passengers aboard and it suddenly shot up well we only have the three lead lined suits to protect us Very well Corbett replied Strong I ve just received orders from Commander Walters to proceed to Mars with both ships I ll blast off now and you three follow along on the Lady Venus Any questions I don t have any sir Tom said but I ll check with Roger and Astro to see if they have any Tom turned to the intercom and informed the radar and power deck cadets of their orders and asked if there were any questions Both replied that everything on the ship was ready to blast off immediately Tom turned back to the teleceiver No questions sir reported Tom We re all set to blast off Very well Corbett said Strong I m going to make as much speed as possible to get these people on Mars The crew of the Lady Venus will take over the radar and power decks O K sir and spaceman s luck said Tom We ll see you on Mars Tom stood beside the crystal port on the control deck and watched the rocket cruiser Polaris stern glow red from her jets and then quickly disappear into the vastness of space visible only as a white blip on the radar scanner Get me a course to Mars Roger said Tom Astro stand by to blast off with as much speed as you can safely get out of this old wagon and stand by for Mars The two cadets quickly reported their departments ready and following the course Roger plotted Astro soon had the Lady Venus blasting through space heading for Mars Mars fourth planet in order from the Sun loomed like a giant red gem against a perfect backdrop of deep black space The Lady Venus rocketing through the inky blackness a dull red glow from her three remaining rockets blasted steadily ahead to the planet that was crisscrossed with wide spacious canals Last time I was on Mars said Astro to Tom and Roger over a cup of tea was about two years ago I was bucking rockets on an old tub called the Space Plunger It was on a shuttle run from the Martian south pole to Venusport hauling vegetables What a life Burning up on Venus and then freezing half to death at the south pole on Mars Astro shook his head as the vivid memory took him back for a moment From what I hear said Tom there isn t much to see but the few cities the mountains the deserts and the canals Yeah commented Roger big deal Rocket into the wild depths of space and see the greatest hunk of wasteland in the universe The three boys were silent listening to the steady hum of the rockets driving them forward toward Mars For four days they had traveled on the Lady Venus enjoying the many luxuries found on the passenger ship Now with their destination only a few hours away they were having a light snack before making a touchdown on Mars You know said Tom quietly I ve been thinking As far back as the twentieth century Earthmen have wanted to get to Mars And finally they did And what have they found Nothing but a planet full of dry sand a few canals and dwarf mountains That s exactly what I ve been saying said Roger The only man who ever got anything out of all this was the first man to make it to Mars and return He got the name the glory and a paragraph in a history book And after that nothing He got up and climbed the ladder to the radar deck leaving Astro and Tom alone Suddenly the ship lurched to one side What s that cried Tom A bell began to ring Then another and then three more Finally the entire ship was vibrating with the clanging of emergency bells Astro made a diving leap for the ladder leading down to the power deck with Tom lunging for the control board Quickly Tom glanced about the huge board with its many different gauges and dials searching for the one that would indicate the trouble His eye spotted a huge gauge A small light beside it flashed off and on By the moons of Jupiter we ve run out of reactant fuel Tom Tom shouted Astro from the power deck We re smack out of reactant feed Isn t there any left at all asked Tom Not even enough to get us into Marsopolis We haven t enough left to keep the generator going said Astro Everything including the lights and the teleceiver will go any minute Then we can t change course Right drawled Roger And if we can t change course the one we re on now will take us straight into Mars s gravity and we crash Send out an emergency call right away Roger said Tom Can t spaceboy replied Roger in his lazy drawl Not enough juice to call for help Or haven t you noticed you re standing in the dark But how how could this happen asked Tom puzzled We were only going at half speed and using just three rockets When we got rid of that hot tube back in space explained Astro grimly we dumped the main reactant mass There isn t a thing we can do We ve got one choice said Tom hollowly We can either pile out now in space suits and use the jet boat and hope for someone to pick us up before the oxygen gives out or we can ride this space wagon right on in Make up your minds quick we re already inside Mars s gravity pull There was a pause then Astro s voice filled the control deck I ll ride this baby right to the bottom If I m going to splash in I ll take it on solid ground even if it is Mars and not Venus I don t want to wash out in space That goes for me too said Roger O K said Tom Here we go Just keep your fingers crossed that we hit the desert instead of the mountains or we ll be smeared across those rocks like applesauce Spaceman s luck fellas Spaceman s luck both of you said Astro Just plain ordinary luck commented Roger and plenty of it The three boys quickly strapped themselves into acceleration seats with Tom hooking up an emergency relay switch that he could hold in his hand He hoped he would remain conscious long enough to throw the switch and start the water sprinkler in case the ship caught fire The Lady Venus flashed into the thin atmosphere from the void of space and the three cadets imagined that they could hear the shriek of the ship as it cut through the thin air Tom figured his speed rapidly and counting on the thinness of the atmosphere he estimated that it would take eleven seconds for the ship to crash He began to count One two three four five he thought briefly of his family and how nice they had been to him six seven eight nine ten The ship crashed Illustration CHAPTER seventeen Astro Roger yelled Tom He opened his eyes and then felt the weight on his chest A section of the control board had fallen across him pinning his left arm to his side He reached for the railing around the acceleration chair with his right and discovered he still held the switch for the water sprinkler He started to flip it on then sniffed the air and smelling no trace of smoke dropped the switch He unstrapped himself from the acceleration chair with his right hand and then slowly with great effort pushed the section of the control board off him He stood up rubbing his left arm Astro Roger he called again and scrambled over the broken equipment that was strewn over the deck He stumbled over more rubble that was once a precision instrument panel and climbed the ladder leading to the radar deck Roger he yelled Roger are you all right He pushed several shattered instruments out of the way and looked around the shambles that once had been a room He didn t see Roger He began to scramble through the litter on the deck kicking aside instruments that were nearly priceless so delicately were they made Suddenly a wave of cold fear gripped him and he began tearing through the rubble desperately From beneath a heavy tube casing he could see the outstretched arm of Roger He squatted down bending his legs and keeping his back straight Then gripping the heavy casing on one side he tried to stand up It was too much for him He lifted it three inches and then had to let go Tom Roger Tom heard the bull like roar of Astro below him and stumbled over to the head of the ladder Up here Astro he yelled on the radar deck Roger s pinned under the radar scanner casing Tom turned back to the casing and looking around the littered deck desperately grabbed an eight foot length of steel pipe that had been snapped off like a twig by the force of the crash Barely able to lift it he shoved it with all his strength to get the end of the pipe beneath the casing Here let me get at that thing growled Astro from behind Tom stepped back half falling out of the Venusian s way and watched as Astro got down on his hands and knees putting his shoulder against the case He lifted it about three inches then slowly still balancing the weight on his shoulder shifted his position braced it with his hands and began to straighten up The casing came up from the floor as the huge cadet strained against it All right Tom he gasped see if you can get a hold on Roger and pull him out Tom scrambled back and grabbed Roger s uniform He pulled and slowly the cadet s form slid from beneath the casing All right Astro said Tom I ve got im Astro began to lower the casing in the same manner in which he had lifted it He eased it back down to the floor on his knees and dropped it the last few inches He sat on the floor beside it and hung his head between his knees Are you all right Astro asked Tom Never mind me panted Astro between deep gasps for breath just see if hot shot is O K Tom quickly ran his hands up and down Roger s arms and legs his chest collarbone and at last with gently probing fingers his head No broken bones he said still looking at Roger but I don t know about internal injuries He wasn t pinned under that thing said Astro at last It was resting on a beam No weight was on him Uh huh ahhh uhhhh moaned Roger Roger said Tom gently Roger are you all right Uh huh Ohhhh My head Take it easy hot shot said Astro that head of yours is O K Nothing but nothing could hurt it Ooohhhh groaned Roger sitting up I don t know which is worse feeling the way I do or waking up and listening to you again Tom sat back with a smile Roger s remark clinched it No one was hurt Well said Astro at last where do we go from here First thing I suggest we do is take a survey and see what s left said Tom I came up from the power deck said Astro all the way through the ship You see this radar deck He made a sweeping gesture around the room that looked like a junk heap Well it s in good shape compared to the rest of the ship The power deck has the rocket motors where the master panel should be and the panel is ready to go into what s left of the reactant chamber The jet boat is nothing but a worthless piece of junk The three boys considered the fate of the jet boat soberly Finally Astro broke the silence with a question Where do you think we are Somewhere in the New Sahara desert answered Tom I had the chart projector on just before we splashed in but I can t tell you any more than that Well at least we have plenty of water sighed Roger You had plenty of water The tanks were smashed when we came in Not even a puddle left in a corner Of course it might rain said Roger Tom gave a short laugh The last time it rained in this place dinosaurs were roaming around on Earth How about food asked Roger Plenty of that answered Astro This is a passenger ship remember They have everything you could ask for including smoked Venusian fatfish Then let s get out of here and take a look said Tom The three bruised but otherwise healthy cadets climbed slowly down to the control deck and headed for the galley where Tom found six plastic containers of Martian water Spaceman this is the biggest hunk of luck we ve had in the last two hours said Roger taking one of the containers Why two hours Roger asked Astro puzzled Two hours ago we were still in space expecting to splash in said Tom He opened one of the containers and offered it to Astro Take it easy Astro said Tom Unless we find something else to drink this might have to last a long time Yeah said Roger a long time I ve been thinking about our chances of getting out of this mess Well asked Astro what has the great Manning brain figured out There s no chance at all said Roger slowly You re wrong Corbett about this being midday It s early morning He pointed to a chronometer on the bulkhead behind Astro It s still running I made a mental note before we splashed in it was eight O seven That clock says nine O three It doesn t begin to get hot here until three o clock in the afternoon I think you re wrong two ways said Tom In the first place Captain Strong probably has a unit out looking for us right now And in the second place as long as we stay with the ship we ve got shade That sun is only bad because the atmosphere is thinner here on Mars and easier to burn through But if we stay out of the sun we re O K Just sit back and wait for Strong Roger shrugged his shoulders Well commented Astro with a grin I m not going to sit around waiting for Strong without eating He tore open a plastic package of roast beef sandwiches and began eating Tom measured out three small cups of Martian water After we eat suggested Roger I think we ought to take a look around outside and try to set up an identification signal That s a good idea said Tom but don t you think the ship itself is big enough for that Yeah answered Roger I guess you re right Boy said Astro We sure are lucky to still be able to argue That s about all you can call it Luck Spaceman s luck said Tom The only reason I can figure why we didn t wind up as permanent part of the scenery around here is because of the course we were on How do you figure that asked Astro Luckily and I mean luckily we were on a course that took us smack onto the surface of Mars And our speed was great enough to resist the gravity pull of the planet keeping us horizontal with the surface of the desert We skidded in like a kid does on a sled instead of coming in on our nose Well blast my jets said Astro softly In that case said Roger we must have left a pretty long skid mark in back of us That should be easy to see when the jet scouts come looking for us commented Astro I wonder if we could rig up some sort of emergency signal so we could send out a relative position How are you going to get the position asked Astro I can give you some sort of position as soon as I get outside and take a sight on the sun replied Roger Can you do it without your astrogation prism asked Astro Navigation not astrogation Astro said Roger Like the ancient sailors used on the oceans back on Earth hundreds of years ago Only thing is I ll have to work up the logarithms by hand instead of using the computer Might be a little rough but it ll be close enough for what we want The three cadets finished the remaining sandwiches and then picked their way back through the ship to the control deck There they rummaged through the pile of broken and shattered instruments If we could find just one tube that hasn t been damaged I think I might be able to rig up some sort of one lung communications set said Roger It might have enough range to get a message to the nearest atmosphere booster station Nothing but a pile of junk here Roger said Tom We might find something on the radar deck The three members of the Polaris unit climbed over the rubble and made their way to the radar deck and started their search for an undamaged tube After forty five minutes of searching Roger stood up in disgust Nothing he said sourly That kills any hope of getting a message out said Tom By the craters of Luna said Astro wiping his forehead I didn t notice it before but it s getting hotter here than on the power deck on a trip to Mercury Do we have any flares asked Roger Naw Al James used them all answered Tom That does it said Roger In another couple of hours when and if anyone shows up all they ll find is three space cadets fried on the half shell of a spaceship Listen Roger said Tom as soon as we fail to check in the whole Mars Solar Guard fleet will be out looking for us Our last report will show them we were heading in this direction It won t take Captain Strong long to figure out that we might have run out of fuel and with that skid mark in the sand trailing back for twenty miles all we have to do is stick with the ship and wait for them to show up What s that asked Astro sharply From a distance the three cadets could hear a low moaning and wailing They rushed to the crystal port and looked out on the endless miles of brown sand stretching as far as the horizon and meeting the cloudless blue sky Shimmering in the heat the New Sahara desert of Mars was just beginning to warm up for the day under the bleaching sun The thin atmosphere offered little protection against the blazing heat rays Nothing but sand said Tom Maybe something is still hot on the power deck He looked at Astro I checked it before I came topside said Astro I ve heard that noise before It can only mean one thing What s that asked Roger Astro turned quickly and walked to the opposite side of the littered control deck He pushed a pile of junk out of the way for a clear view of the outside There s your answer said Astro pointing at the port By the rings of Saturn look at that cried Tom Yeah said Roger black as the fingernails of a Titan miner That s a sandstorm Astro said finally It blows as long as a week and can pile up sand for two hundred feet Sometimes the velocity reaches as much as a hundred and sixty miles an hour Once in the south we got caught in one and it was so bad we had to blast off And it took all the power we had to do it The three cadets stood transfixed as they gazed through the crystal port at the oncoming storm The tremendous black cloud rolled toward the spaceship in huge folds that billowed upward and back in three thousand foot waves The roar and wail of the wind grew louder rising in pitch until it was a shrill scream We d better get down to the power deck said Tom and take some oxygen bottles along with us just in case Astro bring the rest of the Martian water and you grab several of those containers of food Roger We might be holed in for a long time Why go down to the power deck asked Roger There s a huge hole in the upper part of the ship s hull That sand will come in here by the ton and there s nothing to stop it Tom answered Roger but kept his eyes on the churning black cloud Already the first gusts of wind were lashing at the stricken Lady Venus Illustration CHAPTER eighteen You think it ll last much longer asked Astro I don t know old fellow replied Tom You know sometimes you can hear the wind even through the skin of the ship commented Roger For two days the cadets of the Polaris unit had been held prisoner in the power deck while the violence of the New Sahara sandstorm raged around them outside the ship For a thousand square miles the desert was a black cloud of churning sand sweeping across the surface of Mars like a giant shroud After many attempts to repair a small generator Astro finally succeeded only to discover that he had no means of running the unit His plan was to relieve the rapidly weakening emergency batteries with a more steady source of power While Astro occupied himself repairing the generator Tom and Roger had slept but after the first day when sleep would no longer come they resorted to playing checkers with washers and nuts on a board scratched on the deck Think it s going to let up soon asked Roger They ve been known to last for a week or more said Astro Wonder if Strong has discovered we re missing mused Roger Sure he has replied Tom He s a real spaceman Can smell out trouble like a telemetered alarm system Astro got up and stretched I ll bet we re out of this five hours after the sand settles down The big Venusian walked to the side of the power deck and pressed his ear against the hull listening for the sound of the wind After a few seconds he turned back I can t hear a thing fellas I have a feeling it s about played itself out Of course reasoned Tom we have no real way of knowing when it s stopped and when it hasn t Want to open the hatch and take a look asked Astro Tom looked questioningly at Roger who nodded his head in agreement Tom walked over to the hatch and began undogging the heavy door As the last of the heavy metal bars were raised sand began to trickle inside around the edges Astro bent down and sifted a handful through his fingers It s so fine it s like powder he said as it fell to the deck in a fine cloud Come on said Tom give me a hand with this hatch It s probably jammed up against sand on the other side Tom Roger and Astro braced their shoulders against the door but when they tried to push they lost their footing and slipped down Astro dragged over a section of lead baffle jammed it between the rocket motors and placed his feet up against it Tom and Roger got on either side of him and pressed their shoulders against the door All right said Tom When I give the word let s all push together Ready All set said Astro Let s go said Roger O K then one two three push Together the three cadets strained against the heavy steel hatch The muscles in Astro s legs bulged into knots as he applied his great weight and strength against the door Roger his face twisted into a grimace from the effort finally slumped to the floor gasping for breath Roger asked Tom quickly are you all right Roger nodded his head but stayed where he was breathing deeply Finally recovering his strength he rose and stood up against the hatch with his two unit mates You and Roger just give a steady pressure Tom said Astro Don t try to push it all at once Slow and steady does it That way you get more out of your effort O K said Tom Roger nodded Again they braced themselves against the hatch One two three push counted Tom Slowly applying the pressure evenly they heaved against the steel hatch Tom s head swam dizzily as the blood raced through his veins Keep going gasped Astro I think it s giving a little Tom and Roger pushed with the last ounce of strength in their bodies and after a final desperate effort slumped to the floor breathless Astro continued to push but a moment later relaxed and slipped down beside Tom and Roger They sat on the deck for nearly five minutes gasping for air Like began Roger like father like son He blurted the words out bitterly Like who asked Astro Like my father said Roger in a hard voice He got up and walked unsteadily over to the oxygen bottle and kicked it Empty he said with a harsh laugh Empty and we only have one more bottle Empty as my head the day I got into this space happy outfit You going to start that again growled Astro I thought you had grown out of your childish bellyaching about the Academy Astro eyed the blond cadet with a cold eye And now just because you re in a tough spot you start whining again Knock it off Astro snapped Tom Come on Let s give this hatch another try I think it gave a little on that last push Never say die Corbett snarled Roger Let s give it the old try for dear old Space Academy Tom whirled around and stood face to face with Manning I think maybe Astro s right Roger he said coldly I think you re a foul ball a space gassing hot shot that can t take it when the chips are down That s right said Roger coldly I m just what you say Go ahead push against that hatch until your insides drop out and see if you can open it He paused and looked directly at Tom If that sand has penetrated inside the ship far enough and heavily enough to jam that hatch you can imagine what is on top outside A mountain of sand And we re buried under it with about eight hours of oxygen left Tom and Astro were silent thinking about the truth in Roger s words Roger walked slowly across the deck and stood in front of them defiantly You were counting on the ship being spotted by Captain Strong or part of a supposed searching party Ha What makes you think three cadets are so important that the Solar Guard will take time out to look for us And if they do come looking for us the only thing left up there now he pointed his finger over his head is a pile of sand like any other sand dune on this crummy planet We re stuck Corbett so lay off that last chance do or die routine I ve been eating glory all my life If I do have to splash in now I want it to be on my own terms And that s to just sit here and wait for it to come And if they pin the Medal the Solar Medal on me I m going to be up there where all good spacemen go having the last laugh when they put my name alongside my father s Your father s asked Tom bewilderedly Yeah my father Kenneth Rogers Manning Captain in the Solar Guard Graduate of Space Academy class of twenty three twenty nine killed while on duty in space June twenty three thirty five Awarded the Solar Medal posthumously Leaving a widow and one son me Astro and Tom looked at each other dumfounded Surprised huh Roger s voice grew bitter Maybe that clears up a few things for you Like why I never missed on an exam I never missed because I ve lived with Academy textbooks since I was old enough to read Or why I wanted the radar deck instead of the control deck I didn t want to have to make a decision My father had to make a decision once As skipper and pilot of the ship he decided to save a crewman s life He died saving a bum a no good space crawling rat Tom and Astro sat stupefied at Roger s bitter tirade He turned away from them and gave a short laugh I ve lived with only one idea in my head since I was big enough to know why other kids had fathers to play ball with them and I didn t To get into the Academy get the training and then get out and cash in Other kids had fathers All I had was a lousy hunk of gold worth exactly five hundred credits A Solar Medal And my mother Trying to scrape by on a lousy pension that was only enough to keep us going but not enough to get me the extra things other kids had It couldn t bring back my father That night in Galaxy Hall when you were crying asked Tom So eavesdropping is one of your talents too eh Corbett asked Roger sarcastically Now wait a minute Roger said Astro getting up Stay out of this Astro snapped Roger He paused and looked back at Tom Remember that night on the monorail going into Atom City That man Bernard who bought dinner for us He was a boyhood friend of my father s He didn t recognize me and I didn t tell him who I was because I didn t want you space creeps to know that much about me And remember when I gave Al James the brush in that restaurant in Atom City He was talking about the old days and he might have spilled the beans too It all adds up doesn t it I had a reason I told you and it s just this To make Space Academy pay me back To train me to be one of the best astrogators in the universe so I could go into commercial ships and pile up credits Plenty of credits and have a good life and be sure my mother had a good life what s left of it And the whole thing goes right back to when my father made the decision to let a space rat live and die in his place So leave me alone with your last big efforts and grandstand play for glory From now on keep your big fat mouth shut I I don t know what to say Roger began Tom Don t try to say anything Tom said Astro There was a coldness in his voice that made Tom turn around and stare questioningly at the big Venusian You can t answer him because you came from a good home With a mom and pop and brother and sister You had it good You were lucky but I don t hold it against you because you had a nice life and I didn t Astro continued softly You can t answer mister Hot shot Manning but I can What do you mean asked Tom I mean that Manning doesn t know what it is to really have it tough You got a real hard luck story eh big boy snarled Roger Yeah I have growled Astro I got one that ll make your life look like a spaceman s dream At least you know about your father And you lived with your mother I didn t have anything nothing Did you hear that Manning I didn t even have a pair of shoes until I found a kid at the Venusport spaceport one day and figured his shoes would fit me I beat the space gas out of him and took his shoes And then they were so tight they hurt my feet I don t know who my father was nothing about him except that he was a spaceman A rocket buster like me And my mother She died when I was born Since I can remember I ve been on my own When I was twelve I was hanging around the spaceport day and night I learned to buck rockets by going aboard when the ships were cradled for repairs running dry runs going through the motions I talked to spacemen all who would listen to me I lied about my age and because I was a big kid I was blasting off when I was fifteen What little education I ve got I picked up listening to the crew talk on long hops and listening to every audioslide I could get my hands on I ve had it tough And because I have had it tough I want to forget about it I don t want to be reminded what it s like to be so hungry that I d go out into jungles and trap small animals and take a chance on meeting a tyrannosaurus So lay off that stuff about feeling sorry for yourself And about Tom being a hero because with all your space gas you still can t take it And if you don t want to fight to live then go lie down in the corner and just keep your big mouth shut Tom stood staring at the big cadet His head jutted forward from his shoulders the veins in his neck standing out like thick cords He knew Astro had been an orphan but he had never suspected the big cadet s life had been anything like that which he had just described Roger had stood perfectly still while Astro spoke Now as the big cadet walked back to the hatch and nervously began to examine the edges with his finger tips Roger walked over and stood behind him Well you knuckle headed orphan said Roger are you going to get us out of here or not Astro whirled around his face grim his hands balled into fists ready to fight What s that Mann He stopped Roger was smiling and holding out his hand Whether you like it or not you poor little waif you ve just made yourself a friend Tom came up to them and leaned against the door casually When you two stop gawking at each other like long lost brothers he said lazily suppose we try to figure a way out of this dungeon Illustration CHAPTER nineteen Tom Roger shouted Astro I think I ve got it Astro on his knees pulled a long file blade away from the hatch and jumped to his feet Did you cut all the way through asked Tom I don t know at least I m not sure Astro replied looking down at the hole he had made in the hatch But let s give it a try Think we can force it back enough to get a good hold on it asked Roger We ll know in a minute Roger said Astro Get that steel bar over there and I ll try to slip it in between the hatch and the bulkhead Roger rummaged around in the jumble of broken parts and tools on the opposite side of the power deck and found the steel bar Astro wanted After several attempts to force the hatch open had proven futile Tom suggested that they try to file the hinges off the hatch and then attempt to slide it sideways After much effort and working in shifts they had filed through the three hinges and now were ready to make a last desperate attempt to escape Astro took the steel bar from Roger and jammed it between the bulkhead wall and the hatch No telling what we ll find on the other side said Astro If the sand has covered up the ship all the way down to here then we ll never get out Couldn t we tunnel through it to the top if it has filled the ship down as far as here asked Roger Not through this stuff said Tom It s just like powder Tom s right said Astro As soon as you dig into it it ll fall right back in on you He paused and looked at the hatch thoughtfully No The only way we can get out of here is if the sand was only blown into the deck outside and hasn t filled the rest of the ship Only one way to find out said Tom Yeah agreed Roger Let s get that hatch shoved aside and take a look Astro jammed the heavy steel bar farther into the space between the hatch and the bulkhead and then turned back to his unit mates Get that piece of pipe over there he said We ll slip it over the end of the bar and that ll give us more leverage Tom and Roger scrambled after the length of pipe slipped it over the end of the bar and then holding it at either end began to apply even pressure against the hatch Gradually a half inch at a time the heavy steel hatch began to move sideways sliding out and behind the bulkhead And as the opening grew larger the fine powderlike sand began to fall into the power deck Let s move it back about a foot and a half said Tom That ll give us plenty of room to get through and see what s on the other side Astro and Roger nodded in agreement Once more the three boys exerted their strength against the pipe and applied pressure to the hatch Slowly grudgingly it moved back until there was an eighteen inch opening exposing a solid wall of the desert sand Suddenly as if released by a hidden switch the sand began to pour into the power deck Watch out shouted Tom The three boys jumped back and looked on in dismay as the sand came rushing through the opening Gradually it slowed to a stop and the pile in front of the opening rose as high as the hatch itself That does it said Tom Now we ve got to dig through and find out how deep that stuff is And spacemen between you and me I hope it doesn t prove too deep I ve been thinking Tom said Roger suppose it s as high as the upper decks outside All we have to do is keep digging it out and spreading it around the power deck here until we can get through Only one thing wrong with that idea Roger said Tom If the whole upper part of the ship is flooded with that stuff we won t have enough room to spread it around We could always open the reaction chamber and fill that suggested Astro indicating the hatch in the floor of the power deck that lead to the reactant chamber I d just as soon take my chances with sand said Roger as risk opening that hatch The chamber is still hot from the wildcatting reaction mass we had to dump back in space Well then let s start digging said Tom He picked up an empty grease bucket and began filling it with sand You two get busy loading them and I ll dump said Astro O K replied Tom and continued digging into the sand with his hands Here use this Tom said Roger offering an empty Martian water container Slowly the three cadets worked their way through the pile on the deck in front of the hatch opening and then started on the main pile in the opening itself But as soon as they made a little progress on the main pile the sand would fall right in again from the open hatch and after two hours of steady work the sand in front of the hatch still filled the entire opening Their work had been all for nothing They sat down for a rest Let s try it a little higher up Tom suggested Roger Maybe this stuff isn t as deep as we think Tom nodded and stepped up feeling around the top of the opening He began clawing at the sand overhead The sand still came pouring through the opening See anything asked Astro I don t know spluttered Tom as the sand slid down burying him to his waist Better back up Tom warned Roger Might be a cave in and you ll get buried Wait a minute shouted Tom I think I see something A light asked Astro eagerly Careful Tom warned Roger again Tom clawed at the top of the pile ignoring the sand that was heaped around him I ve got it shouted Tom struggling back into the power deck just in time to avoid being buried under a sudden avalanche There s another hatch up there just behind the ladder that leads into the passenger lounge That s the side facing the storm And as soon as we dig a little the sand falls from that pile But the opposite side leading to the jet boat deck is free and clear Then all we have to do is force our way through to the top said Astro That s all said Tom We d be here until doomsday digging our way clear I get it said Roger The storm filled up the side of the ship facing that way and that is where the passenger lounge is I remember now I left the hatch open when we came down here to the power deck so the sand just kept pouring in He smiled sheepishly I guess it s all my fault Never mind that now said Tom Take this hose and stick it in your mouth Astro Breath through your mouth and plug up your nose so you won t get it all stopped up with sand while you pull your way through I ll take this rope with me too said Astro That way I can help pull you guys up after me Good idea said Roger As soon as you get outside the hatch here said Tom turn back this way Keep your face up against the bulkhead until you get to the top Right above you is the ladder You can grab it to pull yourself up Illustration O K said Astro and took the length of hose and put it in his mouth Then taking a piece of waste cotton he stopped up his nose and tested the hose Can you breathe O K asked Tom Astro signaled that he could and stepped through the hatch He turned and facing backward began clawing his way upward Keep that hose clear Roger ordered Tom There s about five feet of sand that he has to dig through and if any of it gets into the hose well Don t worry Tom interrupted Roger I ve got the end of the hose right next to the oxygen bottle He s getting pure stuff Soon the big cadet was lost to view Only the slow movement of the hose and rope indicated that Astro was all right Finally the hose and rope stopped moving Tom and Roger looked at each other worried You think something might be wrong asked Tom I don t know Roger caught himself Say look the rope It s jerking Astro s signaling Illustration He made it cried Tom I wonder if Roger suddenly picked up the end of the hose and spoke into it Astro Hey Astro can you hear me Sure I can Astro s voice came back through the hose Don t shout so loud I m not on Earth you know I m just ten feet above you Roger and Tom clapped each other on the shoulders in glee All set down there called Astro through the hose O K replied Tom Listen said Astro when you get outside the hatch you ll find a pipe running along the bulkhead right over your head Grab that and pull yourself up Tie the rope around your shoulder but leave enough of it so the next guy can come up We don t have any way of getting it back down there he warned Who s coming up first Tom looked at Roger You re stronger Tom said Roger You go up now and then you can give Astro a hand pulling me through All right agreed Tom He began pulling the hose back through the sand He took the end cleared it out with a few blasts from the oxygen bottle and put it in his mouth Then after Roger had helped him tie the rope around his shoulders he stuffed his nose with the waste cotton He stepped to the opening Roger gave three quick jerks on the rope and Astro started hauling in With Astro s help Tom was soon free and clear standing beside Astro on the jet boat deck Phoooeeeey said Tom spitting out the sand that had filtered into his mouth I never want to do that again He dusted himself off and flashed his emergency light around the deck Look at that he said in amazement If we d kept on digging we d have been trapped down there for he paused and looked at Astro who was grinning a long long time He held the light on the sand that was flowing out of the open hatch of the passenger lounge Come on urged Astro Let s get Roger out of there They called to Roger through the hose and told him to bring two more emergency lights and the remainder of the Martian water Three minutes later the Polaris unit was together again Standing on the deck beside his two unit mates Roger brushed himself off and smiled Well he said looks like we made it Yeah said Tom but take a look at this He walked across the jet boat deck to the nearest window port What should have been a clear view of the desert was a mass of solidly packed sand Oh no cried Roger Don t tell me we have to go through that again I don t think it ll be so bad this time said Astro Why not asked Tom The sand is banked the heaviest on the port side of the ship And the window ports on the starboard side of the control deck were pretty high off the ground Well let s not just stand here and talk about it said Roger Let s take a look He turned and walked through the jet boat deck Tom and Astro followed the blond cadet through the darkened passages of the dead ship and after digging a small pile of sand away from the control deck hatch found themselves once more amid the jumble of the wrecked instruments For the first time in three days the boys saw sunlight streaking through the crystal port I told you cried Astro triumphantly But there still isn t any way out of this place said Roger We can t break that port It s six inches thick Find me a wrench said Astro I can take the whole window port apart from inside How do you think they replace these things when they get cracked Hurriedly searching through the rubble Tom finally produced a wrench and handed it to Astro In a half hour Astro had taken the whole section down and had pushed the crystal outward The air of the desert rushed into the control room in a hot blast Whew cried Roger It must be at least a hundred and twenty five degrees out there Come on Let s take a look said Tom And keep your fingers crossed Why asked Roger That we can dig enough of the sand away from the ship to make it recognizable from the air Following Tom s lead Roger and Astro climbed through the open port and out onto the sand Well blast my jets said Astro You can t even tell there was a storm You can t if you don t look at the ship said Tom bitterly That was the only thing around here of any size that would offer resistance to the sand and make it pile up And spaceman look at that pile Astro and Roger turned to look at the spaceship Instead of seeing the ship they saw a small mountain of sand well over a hundred feet high They walked around it and soon discovered that the window port in the control deck had been the only possible way out Call it what you want said Roger but I think it s just plain dumb luck that we were able to get out He eyed the mound of sand Unless one knew there was a spaceship beneath it it would have been impossible to distinguish it from the rest of the desert We re not in the clear yet commented Astro grimly It would take a hundred men at least a week to clear away enough of that sand so search parties could recognize it He glanced toward the horizon There isn t anything but sand here fellows sand that stretches for a thousand miles in every direction And we ve got to walk it said Tom Either that or sit here and die of thirst said Roger Any canals around here Tom asked Astro softly There better be replied Tom thoughtfully He turned to Roger If you can estimate our position Roger I ll go back inside and see if I can find a chart to plot it on That way we might get a direction to start on at least Astro glanced up at the pale blue sky It s going to be a hot day he said softly looking out over the flat plain of the desert an awful hot day Illustration CHAPTER twenty Got everything we need asked Tom Everything we ll need and about all we can safely carry without weighing ourselves down too much answered Roger Enough food for a week the rest of the Martian water space goggles to protect our eyes from the sun and emergency lights for each of us Not much to walk a hundred and fifty miles on offered Astro Too bad the sand got in the galley and messed up the rest of that good food We ll have plenty to get us by if my calculations are right said Tom One hundred and fifty four miles to be exact Exact only as far as my sun sight told me said Roger Do you think it s right asked Tom I ll answer you this way Roger replied I took that sight six times in a half hour and got a mean average on all of them that came out within a few miles of each other If I m wrong I m very wrong but if I m right we re within three to five miles of the position I gave you That s good enough for me said Astro If we re going out there he pointed toward the desert instead of sitting around here waiting for Strong or someone to show up then I d just as soon go now Wait a minute fellas Let s get this straight said Tom We re all agreed that the odds on Captain Strong s showing up here before our water runs out are too great to risk it and that we ll try to reach the nearest canal The most important thing in this place is water If we stay and the water we have runs out we re done for If we go we might not reach the canal and the chance of being spotted in the desert is even smaller than if we wait here at the ship He paused So we move on He looked at the others Astro nodded and looked at Roger who bobbed his head in agreement O K then said Tom it s settled We ll move at night when it s cool and try to rest during the day when it s the hottest Roger looked up at the blazing white sphere in the pale blue sky that burned down relentlessly I figure we have about six hours before she drops for the day he said Then let s go back inside the ship and get some rest he said Without another word the three cadets climbed back inside the ship and made places for themselves amid the littered deck of the control room A hot wind blew out of the New Sahara through the open port like a breath of fire Stripped to their shorts the three boys lay around the deck unable to sleep each thinking quietly about the task ahead each remembering stories of the early pioneers who first reached Mars In the mad rush for the uranium yielding pitchblende they had swarmed over the deserts toward the dwarf mountains by the thousands Greedy thinking only of the fortunes that could be torn from the rugged little mountains they had come unprepared for the heat of the Martian deserts and nine out of ten had never returned Each boy thought too of the dangers they had just faced This new danger was different This was something that couldn t be defeated with an idea or a sudden lucky break This danger was ever present a fight against nature man against the elements on an alien planet It was a battle of endurance that would wring the last drop of moisture mercilessly from the body until it became a dry brittle husk Getting pretty close to sundown said Tom finally He stood beside the open port and shielded his eyes from the glare of the sun now slowly sinking below the Martian horizon I guess we d better get going said Roger All set Astro Ready Roger answered the Venusian The three boys dressed and arranged the food packs on their backs Tom carried the remainder of the Martian water two quart plastic containers and a six yard square of space cloth an extremely durable flyweight fabric that would serve as protection from the sun during the rest stop of the day Roger and Astro carried the food in compact packs on their backs Each boy wore a makeshift hat of space cloth along with space goggles a clear sheet of colored plastic that fitted snugly across the face All three carried emergency lights salvaged from the wrecked ship Tom walked out away from the ship several hundred yards and studied his pocket compass He held it steady for a moment watching the needle swing around He turned and walked slowly still watching the needle of the compass He waited for it to steady again then turned back to Roger and Astro who stood watching from the window port This is the way Tom pointed away from the ship Three degrees south of east one hundred and fifty four miles away if everything is correct should bring us smack on top of a major canal So long Lady Venus said Astro as he left the ship Don t think it hasn t been fun added Roger because it hasn t Astro fell in behind Roger who in turn followed Tom who walked some ten feet ahead A light breeze sprang up and blew across the surface of the powdery sand Ten minutes later when they stopped to adjust their shoulder packs they looked back The breeze had obliterated their tracks and the mountain of sand covering the spaceship appeared to be no different from any of the other small dunes on the desert The New Sahara desert of Mars had claimed another Earth ship victim If we can t see the Lady Venus standing still and knowing where to look said Astro how could a man in a rocket scout ever find it He wouldn t said Roger flatly And when the water ran out we d just be sitting there We re losing time said Tom Let s move He lengthened his stride through the soft sand that sucked at his high space boots and faced the already dimming horizon The light breeze felt good on his face The three cadets had no fear of running into anything in their march through the darkness across the shifting sands And only an occasional flash of the emergency light to check the compass was necessary to keep them moving in the right direction There wasn t much talk There wasn t much to talk about About nine o clock the boys stopped and opened one of the containers of food and ate a quick meal of sandwiches This was followed by a carefully measured ounce of water and fifteen minutes later they resumed their march across the New Sahara About ten o clock Deimos one of the small twin moons of Mars swung up overhead washing the desert with a pale cold light By morning when the cherry red sun broke the line of the horizon Tom estimated that they had walked about twenty miles Think we ought to camp here asked Astro If you can show me a better spot said Roger with a laugh I ll be happy to use it He swung his arm in a wide circle indicating a wasteland of sand that spread as far as the eyes could see I could go for another hour or so said Astro before it gets too hot And wait for the heat to reach the top of the thermometer Uh huh not me said Roger I ll take as much sleep as I can get now while it s still a little cool Roger s right said Tom We d better take it easy now We won t be able to get much sleep after noon What do we do from noon until evening asked Astro Aside from just sitting under this hunk of space cloth I guess we ll come as close to being roasted alive as a human can get You want to eat now asked Astro Tom and Roger laughed I m not hungry but you go ahead said Tom I know that appetite of yours won t wait I m not too hungry either said Roger Go ahead you clobber headed juice jockey Astro grinned sheepishly and opening one of the containers of food quickly wolfed down a breakfast of smoked Venusian fatfish Tom and Roger began spreading the space cloth on the sand that was already hot to the touch Anchoring the four corners in the sand with the emergency lights and one of Tom s boots they propped up the center with the food packs one on top of the other A crude tent was the result and both boys crawled in under sprawling on the sand Astro finished eating lay down beside his two unit mates and in a moment the three cadets were sound asleep The sun climbed steadily over the desert while the Polaris unit slept With each hour the heat of the desert rose climbing past the hundred mark reaching one hundred and twenty then one hundred and thirty five degrees Tom woke up with a start He felt as if he were inside a blazing furnace He rolled over and saw Astro and Roger still asleep sweat pouring off them in small rivulets He started to wake them but decided against it and just lay still under the thin sheet of space cloth that protected him from the sun As light as the fabric square was weighing no more than a pound under the intense heat of the sun it felt like a woolen blanket where it touched him Astro rolled over and opened his eyes What time is it Tom Must be about noon How do you feel I m not sure yet I had a dream The big cadet rubbed his eyes and wiped the sweat from his forehead I dreamed I was being shoved into an oven like Hansel and Gretel in that old fairy tale Personally mumbled Roger without opening his eyes I ll take Hansel and Gretel They might be a little more tender I could do with a drink said Astro looking at Tom Tom hesitated He felt that as hot as it was it would get still hotter and there had to be strict control of the remainder of the water Try to hold out a little longer Astro said Tom This heat hasn t really begun yet You could drink the whole thing and still want more That s right Astro said Roger sitting up Best thing to do is just wet your tongue and lips a little Drinking won t do much good now O K by me said Astro Well what do we do now We sit here and we wait answered Tom He sat up and held the space cloth up on his side You get in the middle Astro suggested Roger Your head is up higher than mine and Tom s You can be the tent pole under this big top Astro grunted and changed places with the smaller cadet Think there might be a breeze if we opened up one side of this thing asked Roger If there was a breeze answered Tom it d be so hot it d be worse than what we ve got inside It sure is going to be a hot day said Astro softly The thin fabric of the space cloth was enough to protect them from the direct rays of the sun but offered very little protection against the heat Soon the inside of the tent was boiling under the relentless sun They sat far apart their knees pulled up heads bowed Once when the heat seemed unbearable Tom opened one side of the cloth in a desperate hope that it might be a little cooler outside A blast of hot air entered the makeshift tent and he quickly closed the opening About three o clock Roger suddenly slipped backward and lay sprawled on the sand Tom opened one of the containers of water and dipped his shirttail into it Astro watched him moisten Roger s lips and wipe his temples In a few moments the cadet stirred and opened his eyes I I don t know what happened he said slowly Everything started swimming and then went black You fainted said Tom simply What time is it asked Astro Sun should be dropping soon now in another couple of hours They were silent again The sun continued its journey across the sky and at last began to slip behind the horizon When the last red rays stretched across the sandy desert the three cadets folded back the space cloth covering and stood up A soft evening breeze sprang up refreshing them a little and though none of them was hungry each boy ate a light meal Tom opened the container of water again and measured out about an ounce apiece Moisten your tongue and sip it slowly ordered Tom Roger and Astro took their share of the water and dipped fingers in it wiping their lips and eyelids They continued to do this until finally no longer able to resist they took the precious water and swished it around in their mouths before swallowing it They folded the space cloth shouldered their packs and after Tom had checked the compass started their long march toward their plotted destination They had survived their first twenty four hours in the barren wastes of the New Sahara with each boy acutely aware that there was at least a week more of the same in front of them The sky blackened and soon after Deimos rose and started climbing across the dark sky CHAPTER twenty one How much water left asked Astro thickly Enough for one more drink apiece Tom replied And then what happens mumbled Roger through his cracked lips You know what will happen Roger you know and I know and Tom knows muttered Astro grimly For eight days they had been struggling across the blistering shifting sands walking by night sweltering under the thin space cloth during the day Their tongues were swollen Scraggly beards covered their chins and jaws Roger s lips were cracked The back of Tom s neck had suffered ten minutes of direct sun and turned into a large swollen blister Only Astro appeared to be bearing up under the ordeal There was no sign of their being close to the canal Wanta try marching during the day asked Astro They had broken camp on the evening of the eighth day and were preparing to move on into the never changing desert If we don t hit the canal sometime during the night there might be a chance it s close enough to reach in a couple of hours replied Tom Either that or we ve miscalculated altogether How about you Roger asked Astro Whatever you guys decide I ll be right in back of you Roger had grown steadily weaker during the last three days and found it difficult to sleep during the hours of rest Then we ll keep marching tomorrow said Astro Let s move out said Tom Roger and Astro shouldered the remaining slender food packs with Tom carrying the water and space cloth and they started out into the rapidly darkening desert Once again as on the previous eight nights the little moon Deimos swung across the sky casting dim shadows ahead of the three marching boys Tom found it necessary to look at the compass more often He couldn t trust his sense of direction as much as he had earlier Once he had gone for two hours in a direction that was fifty degrees off course The rest stops also were more frequent now with each boy throwing his pack to the ground and lying flat on his back to enjoy the cool breeze that never failed to soothe their scorched faces When the sun rose out of the desert on the morning of the ninth day they stopped ate a light breakfast of preserved figs divided the juice evenly among them and ripping the space cloth into three sections wrapped it around themselves like Arabs and continued to walk By noon with the sun directly overhead they were staggering At two thirty the sun and the heat were so overpowering that they stopped involuntarily and tried to sit on the hot sand only to find that they couldn t and so they stumbled on Neither Roger nor Astro asked for water Finally Tom stopped and faced his two unit mates wobbling on unsteady legs I ve gone as far as I can without water I I don t think I can go another step So come on we ll finish what we ve got Astro and Roger nodded in quiet agreement They watched with dull eyes as Tom carefully opened the plastic container of water He gave each a cup and slowly cautiously measured out the remaining water into three equal parts He held the container up for a full minute allowing the last drop to run out before tossing the empty bottle to one side Here goes said Tom He wet his lips placed a wet finger on his temples and sipped the liquid slowly allowing it to trickle down his parched throat Roger and Astro did the same After he had wet his lips Astro took the full amount in his mouth and washed it around before swallowing it Roger brought the cup up slowly to his mouth with trembling hands tipped it shakily and then before Astro or Tom could catch him fell to the ground The precious water spilled into the sand Tom and Astro watched dumfounded as the dry sand sucked away the water until nothing remained but a damp spot six inches wide I guess began Tom I guess that about does it We ll have to carry him said Astro simply Tom looked up into the eyes of his unit mate There he saw a determination that would not be defeated He nodded his head and stooped over to grapple with Roger s legs He got one leg under each arm and then tried to straighten up He fell to the sand and rolled to one side Astro watched him get up slowly wearily his space cloth covering remaining on the ground and then with gritted teeth try once more to pick Roger s legs up Astro put out his hand and touched Tom on the shoulder His voice was low hardly above a whisper You lead the way Tom I ll carry him Illustration You lead the way Tom I ll carry him Tom looked up at the big Venusian Their eyes locked for a moment and then he nodded his head and turned away He pulled out the pocket compass and through blurred vision read the course beneath its wavering needle He waved an arm in a direction to the right of them and staggered off Astro stooped down picked Roger up in his arms and slowly got him across his shoulders Then steadying himself he walked after Tom Suddenly a blast of wind hot as fire swept across the sandy plains whipping the sand up and around the two walking figures biting into exposed hands and faces Tom tried to adjust his goggles when the sand began to penetrate around the edges but his fingers shook and he dropped them In a flash the sand drove into his eyes blinding him I can t see Astro said Tom in a hoarse whisper when Astro staggered up You ll have to guide Astro took the compass out of Tom s hand and then placed his unit mate s hand on his back Tom gripped the loose folds of the space cloth and uniform beneath and struggled blindly after the big cadet The hot sun bore down The wind kept blowing and Astro with Roger slung across his back like a sack of potatoes and Tom clinging blindly to his uniform walked steadily on He felt each step would be his last but with each step he told himself through gritted teeth that he could do ten more and then ten more ten more He walked he staggered and once he fell to the ground Tom slumping behind him and Roger being tossed limply to the scorching sand Slowly Astro recovered helped Tom to his feet then with the last of his great strength picked up Roger again This time he was unable to get him to his shoulder so he carried him like a baby in his arms At last the sun began to drop in the red sky Astro felt Roger s limp body slipping from his grip By now Tom had lost all but the very last ounce of his strength and was simply being pulled along Tom gasped Astro with great effort I m going to count to a thousand and then I m going to stop Tom didn t answer Astro began to count One two three four five six He tried to make each number become a step forward He closed his eyes It wasn t important which way he went It was only important that he walk those thousand steps five hundred eleven five hundred twelve five hundred thirteen Involuntarily he opened his eyes when he felt himself climbing up a small rise in the sand He opened his eyes and ten feet away was the flat blue surface of the canal they had been searching for You can let go now Tom said Astro in a voice hardly above a whisper We made it We re on the bank of the canal Hey Roger yelled Astro from the middle of the canal ever see a guy make like a submarine Tom and Roger sat on the top of the low bank of the canal drying off from a swim while Astro still splashed around luxuriating in the cool water Go on yelled Roger let s see you drown yourself Not me hot shot yelled Astro After that walk all I d have to do is open my mouth and start drinking Finally tiring of his sport the big Venusian pulled himself up onto the bank of the canal and quickly dressed Pulling on his space boots he turned to Tom and Roger who were breaking out the last two containers of food You know Astro said Roger quietly I ll never be able to repay you for carrying me Tom was quiet for a moment and then added Same here Astro Astro grinned from ear to ear Answer me this one question both of you Would you have done it for me The two boys nodded Then you paid me As long as I know I m backed up by two guys like you then I m paid Carrying you Roger was just something I could do for you at that particular time One of these days when we get out of this oven there ll come a time when you or Tom will do something for me and that s the way it should be Thanks Astro said Roger He reached over and put his hand on top of Astro s and then Tom placed his hand on top of theirs The three boys were quiet for a moment There was an understanding in each of them that they had accomplished more than just survival in a desert They had learned to respect each other They were a unit at last What do we do next asked Roger Start walking that way said Tom pointing to his left along the bank of the canal that stretched off in a straight line to the very horizon If we re lucky we might be able to find something to use as a raft and then we can ride Think there are any fish in this canal asked Astro gazing out over the cool blue water Doubt it At least I ve never heard of there being any replied Tom Well said Roger standing up you can go a lot farther without food than you can without water And we still have that big container of ham left Yeah as soon as it gets hot we just swim instead of walk said Astro And believe me there s going to be a lot of swimming done Think we might strike anything down that way asked Roger He looked down the canal in the direction Tom had indicated That s the direction of the nearest atmosphere booster station At least that was the way it looked on the chart All of them were built near the canals How far away do you think it is asked Astro Must be at least three hundred miles Let s start moving said Roger and hope we can find something that ll float us on the canal Single file wearing the space cloths once more as protection against the sun they walked along the bank of the canal When the heat became unbearable they dipped the squares of space cloths into the water and wrapped themselves in them When they began to dry out they would repeat the process At noon when the sun dried the fabric nearly as fast as they could wet it they stopped and slipped over the edge of the bank into the cool water Covering their heads with the cloths they remained partly submerged until the late afternoon When the sun had lost some of its power again they climbed out and continued walking Marching late into the night they made camp beside the canal finished the last container of food and for the first time since leaving the ship slept during the night By the time Deimos had risen in the sky they were sound asleep Illustration CHAPTER twenty two Eeeeeeoooooooow Astro s bull like roar shattered the silence of the desert There up ahead Tom Roger a building Tom and Roger stopped and strained their eyes in the bright sunshine I think you re right said Tom at last But I doubt if anyone s there Looks like an abandoned mining shack to me Who wants to stand here and debate the question asked Roger and started off down the side of the canal at a lope with Astro and Tom right behind him During the last three days the boys had been living off the contents of the last remaining food container and the few lichens they found growing along the canal Their strength was weakening but with an abundant supply of water near at hand and able to combat the sun s heat with frequent swims they were still in fair condition Tom was the first to reach the building a one story structure made of dried mud from the canal The shutters and the door had long since been torn away by countless sandstorms The three boys entered the one room building cautiously The floor was covered with sand and sand was piled in heaping drifts in front of the open windows and door Nothing not a thing said Roger disgustedly This place must be at least a hundred and fifty years old Probably built by a miner commented Tom What do you mean nothing said Astro Look They followed Astro s pointing finger to the ceiling Crisscrossed from wall to wall were heavy wooden beams Raft Tom cried That s right spaceman said Astro a raft There s enough wood up there to float the Polaris Come on Astro hurried outside with Tom and Roger following at his heels They quickly climbed to the roof of the old building and soon were ripping the beams from the crumbling mud Fortunately the beams had been joined by notching the ends of the crosspieces Astro explained that this was necessary because of the premium on nails when the house was built Everything at that time had to be hauled from Earth and no one wanted to pay the price heavy nails and bolts demanded One by one they removed the heavy beams until they had eight of them lined up alongside the edge of the canal How do we keep them together asked Roger With this said Tom He began ripping his space cloth into long strips Astro and Roger tugged at the first beam At last they had it in the water It floats cried Astro Tom and Roger couldn t help but shout for joy They quickly hauled the remaining beams into the water and lashed them together Without hesitation they shoved the raft into the canal climbing aboard and standing like conquering heroes as the raft moved out into the main flow of the canal and began to drift forward I dub thee Polaris the Second said Tom in formal tones and gave the nearest beam a kick Astro and Roger gave a lusty cheer Steadily silently the raft bore them through the never changing scene of the canal s muddy banks and the endlessness of the desert beyond Protecting themselves from the sun during the day by repeated dunkings in the water they traveled day and night in a straight course down the center of the canal At night the tiny moon Deimos climbed across the desert and reflected light upon the satin smooth water The third day on the raft they began to feel the pangs of hunger And where during their march through the desert their thoughts were of water now visions of endless tables of food occupied their thoughts At first they talked of their hunger dreaming up wild combinations of dishes and giving even wilder estimates of how much each could consume Finally discovering that talking about it only intensified their desire they kept a stolid silence When the heat became unbearable they simply took to the water Once Tom s grip on the raft slipped and Roger plunged in after him without a moment s hesitation only to have Astro go in to save both of them On and on down the canal the three boys floated Days turned into nights and nights cooling and refreshing gave way to the blazing sun of the next day The silent desert swept past them One night when Astro unable to sleep was staring ahead into the darkness he heard a rustling in the water alongside the raft He moved slowly to the edge of the raft and peered down into the clear water He saw a fish The big cadet watched it dart around the raft He waited his body tense Once the fish came to the edge of the raft but before Astro could move his arm it darted off in another direction At last the fish disappeared and Astro sank back on the timbers He trailed one hand over the side in the water and suddenly felt the rough scales of the fish brush his fingers In a flash Astro closed his hand and snatched the wriggling creature out of the water Tom Roger he shouted Look look a fish I caught a fish with my bare hands Tom rolled over and opened his eyes Roger sat in bewilderment I watched him I was watching him and then he went away And then I held my hand over the side of the raft and he came snooping around and well I just grabbed him He held the fish in the viselike grip of his right hand until it stopped moving You know said Tom weakly I just remembered When we were in the Science Building in Atom City one of their projects was to breed both Earth and Venus fish in the canals I am going to shake personally the hand of the man who started this project when we get back to Atom City said Astro Suddenly Roger gripped Tom s arms He was staring in the direction the raft was going Tom he breathed Astro look They turned and peered into the dusk In the distance not a mile away was the huge crystal clear dome of the atmosphere booster station its roaring atomic motors sending a steady purring sound out across the desert We made it said Tom choking back the tears We made it Well blast my jets said Astro We sure did And you mean to tell me you walked across that desert asked Captain Strong Tom glanced over at Astro and Roger We sure did sir With Astro doing the last stretch to the canal carrying me and dragging Tom said Roger as he sipped his hot broth The room in the chief engineer s quarters at the atmosphere station was crowded with workers enlisted Solar Guardsmen and officers of the Solar Guard They stood around staring in disbelief at the three disheveled cadets But how did you ever survive asked Strong By the craters of Luna that blasted desert was hotter this past month than it has ever been since Mars was first colonized by Earthmen Why why you were walking through temperatures that reached a hundred and fifty degrees You don t have to convince us sir said Roger with a smile We ll never forget it as long as we live Later when Tom Roger and Astro had taken a shower and dressed in fresh uniforms Strong came in with an audioscriber and the three cadets gave the full version of their adventure for the official report back to the Academy When they had finished Strong told them of his efforts to find them We knew you were in trouble right away said Strong and we tracked you on radar But that blasted storm fouled us all up We figured that the sand would have covered up the ship and that the chances of finding you in a scout were very small so I got permission from Commander Walters to organize this ground search for you He paused Frankly we had just about given up hope Took us three weeks finally to locate the section of desert you landed in We knew you would come sir said Tom but we didn t have enough water to wait for you and we had to leave Boys said Strong slowly I ve had a lot of wonderful things happen to me in the Solar Guard But I have to confess that seeing you three space brained idiots clinging to that raft ready to eat a raw fish well that was just about the happiest moment of my life Thank you sir said Roger and I think I can speak for Tom and Astro when I say that seeing you here with over a hundred men and all this equipment ready to start searching for us in that desert well it makes us feel pretty proud to be members of an outfit where the skipper feels that way about his crew What happens now sir asked Tom Aside from getting a well deserved liberty it s back to the old grind at the Academy The Polaris is at the spaceport at Marsopolis waiting for us He paused and eyed the three cadets with a smile I guess the routine at Space Academy will seem a little dull now after what you ve been through Captain Strong said Astro formally I know I speak for Tom and Roger when I say that routine is all we want for a long time to come Amen added Tom and Roger in unison Very well said Strong Polaris unit Staaaaand TO The three boys snapped to attention You are hereby ordered to report aboard the Polaris at fifteen hundred hours and stand by to raise ship He returned their salutes turned sharply and walked from the room Outside Steve Strong leaned against the wall and stared through the crystal shell of the atmosphere station into the endless desert Thank you Mars he said softly for making spacemen out of the Polaris crew He saluted sharply and walked away Tom suddenly burst from the room with Roger and Astro yelling after him Hey Tom where you going yelled Roger I ve got to get a bottle of that water out of the canal for my kid brother Billy shouted Tom and disappeared down a slidestairs Roger turned to Astro and said That s what I call a real spaceman What do you mean asked Astro After what we ve been through he still remembers that his kid brother wants a bottle of water from a canal as a souvenir Yeah breathed Astro Tom Corbett is is a real spaceman Illustration Illustration End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Stand by for Mars by Carey Rockwell END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK
