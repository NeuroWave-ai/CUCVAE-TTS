1264_129805_000022_000010	train-clean-360	he knew too much 
none	none	about this fellow Monmouth and the pretty brown slut who had borne him to be deceived by the legend of legitimacy on the strength of which this standard of rebellion had been raised He had read the absurd proclamation posted at the Cross at Bridgewater as it had been posted also at Taunton and elsewhere setting forth that upon the decease of our Sovereign Lord Charles the Second the right of succession to the Crown of England Scotland France and Ireland with the dominions and territories thereunto belonging did legally descend and devolve upon the most illustrious and high born Prince James Duke of Monmouth son and heir apparent to the said King Charles the Second It had moved him to laughter as had the further announcement that James Duke of York did first cause the said late King to be poysoned and immediately thereupon did usurp and invade the Crown He knew not which was the greater lie For mister Blood had spent a third of his life in the Netherlands where this same James Scott who now proclaimed himself James the Second by the grace of God King et cetera first saw the light some six and thirty years ago and he was acquainted with the story current there of the fellow s real paternity Far from being legitimate by virtue of a pretended secret marriage between Charles Stuart and Lucy Walter it was possible that this Monmouth who now proclaimed himself King of England was not even the illegitimate child of the late sovereign What but ruin and disaster could be the end of this grotesque pretension How could it be hoped that England would ever swallow such a Perkin And it was on his behalf to uphold his fantastic claim that these West Country clods led by a few armigerous Whigs had been seduced into rebellion Quo quo scelesti ruitis He laughed and sighed in one but the laugh dominated the sigh for mister Blood was unsympathetic as are most self sufficient men and he was very self sufficient adversity had taught him so to be A more tender hearted man possessing his vision and his knowledge might have found cause for tears in the contemplation of these ardent simple Nonconformist sheep going forth to the shambles escorted to the rallying ground on Castle Field by wives and daughters sweethearts and mothers sustained by the delusion that they were to take the field in defence of Right of Liberty and of Religion For he knew as all Bridgewater knew and had known now for some hours that it was Monmouth s intention to deliver battle that same night The Duke was to lead a surprise attack upon the Royalist army under Feversham that was now encamped on Sedgemoor mister Blood assumed that Lord Feversham would be equally well informed and if in this assumption he was wrong at least he was justified of it He was not to suppose the Royalist commander so indifferently skilled in the trade he followed mister Blood knocked the ashes from his pipe and drew back to close his window As he did so his glance travelling straight across the street met at last the glance of those hostile eyes that watched him There were two pairs and they belonged to the Misses Pitt two amiable sentimental maiden ladies who yielded to none in Bridgewater in their worship of the handsome Monmouth mister Blood smiled and inclined his head for he was on friendly terms with these ladies one of whom indeed had been for a little while his patient But there was no response to his greeting Instead the eyes gave him back a stare of cold disdain The smile on his thin lips grew a little broader a little less pleasant He understood the reason of that hostility which had been daily growing in this past week since Monmouth had come to turn the brains of women of all ages The Misses Pitt he apprehended contemned him that he a young and vigorous man of a military training which might now be valuable to the Cause should stand aloof that he should placidly smoke his pipe and tend his geraniums on this evening of all evenings when men of spirit were rallying to the Protestant Champion offering their blood to place him on the throne where he belonged If mister Blood had condescended to debate the matter with these ladies he might have urged that having had his fill of wandering and adventuring he was now embarked upon the career for which he had been originally intended and for which his studies had equipped him that he was a man of medicine and not of war a healer not a slayer But they would have answered him he knew that in such a cause it behoved every man who deemed himself a man to take up arms They would have pointed out that their own nephew Jeremiah who was by trade a sailor the master of a ship which by an ill chance for that young man had come to anchor at this season in Bridgewater Bay had quitted the helm to snatch up a musket in defence of Right But mister Blood was not of those who argue As I have said he was a self sufficient man He closed the window drew the curtains and turned to the pleasant candle lighted room and the table on which missus Barlow his housekeeper was in the very act of spreading supper To her however he spoke aloud his thought It s out of favour I am with the vinegary virgins over the way He had a pleasant vibrant voice whose metallic ring was softened and muted by the Irish accent which in all his wanderings he had never lost It was a voice that could woo seductively and caressingly or command in such a way as to compel obedience Indeed the man s whole nature was in that voice of his For the rest of him he was tall and spare swarthy of tint as a gipsy with eyes that were startlingly blue in that dark face and under those level black brows In their glance those eyes flanking a high bridged intrepid nose were of singular penetration and of a steady haughtiness that went well with his firm lips Though dressed in black as became his calling yet it was with an elegance derived from the love of clothes that is peculiar to the adventurer he had been rather than to the staid medicus he now was His coat was of fine camlet and it was laced with silver there were ruffles of Mechlin at his wrists and a Mechlin cravat encased his throat His great black periwig was as sedulously curled as any at Whitehall Seeing him thus and perceiving his real nature which was plain upon him you might have been tempted to speculate how long such a man would be content to lie by in this little backwater of the world into which chance had swept him some six months ago how long he would continue to pursue the trade for which he had qualified himself before he had begun to live Difficult of belief though it may be when you know his history previous and subsequent yet it is possible that but for the trick that Fate was about to play him he might have continued this peaceful existence settling down completely to the life of a doctor in this Somersetshire haven It is possible but not probable He was the son of an Irish medicus by a Somersetshire lady in whose veins ran the rover blood of the Frobishers which may account for a certain wildness that had early manifested itself in his disposition This wildness had profoundly alarmed his father who for an Irishman was of a singularly peace loving nature He had early resolved that the boy should follow his own honourable profession and Peter Blood being quick to learn and oddly greedy of knowledge had satisfied his parent by receiving at the age of twenty the degree of baccalaureus medicinae at Trinity College Dublin His father survived that satisfaction by three months only His mother had
224_129790_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 then 
none	none	been dead some years already Thus Peter Blood came into an inheritance of some few hundred pounds with which he had set out to see the world and give for a season a free rein to that restless spirit by which he was imbued A set of curious chances led him to take service with the Dutch then at war with France and a predilection for the sea made him elect that this service should be upon that element He had the advantage of a commission under the famous de Ruyter and fought in the Mediterranean engagement in which that great Dutch admiral lost his life After the Peace of Nimeguen his movements are obscure But we know that he spent two years in a Spanish prison though we do not know how he contrived to get there It may be due to this that upon his release he took his sword to France and saw service with the French in their warring upon the Spanish Netherlands Having reached at last the age of thirty two his appetite for adventure surfeited his health having grown indifferent as the result of a neglected wound he was suddenly overwhelmed by homesickness He took ship from Nantes with intent to cross to Ireland But the vessel being driven by stress of weather into Bridgewater Bay and Blood s health having grown worse during the voyage he decided to go ashore there additionally urged to it by the fact that it was his mother s native soil Thus in January of that year sixteen eighty five he had come to Bridgewater possessor of a fortune that was approximately the same as that with which he had originally set out from Dublin eleven years ago Because he liked the place in which his health was rapidly restored to him and because he conceived that he had passed through adventures enough for a man s lifetime he determined to settle there and take up at last the profession of medicine from which he had with so little profit broken away That is all his story or so much of it as matters up to that night six months later when the battle of Sedgemoor was fought Deeming the impending action no affair of his as indeed it was not and indifferent to the activity with which Bridgewater was that night agog mister Blood closed his ears to the sounds of it and went early to bed He was peacefully asleep long before eleven o clock at which hour as you know Monmouth rode but with his rebel host along the Bristol Road circuitously to avoid the marshland that lay directly between himself and the Royal Army You also know that his numerical advantage possibly counter balanced by the greater steadiness of the regular troops on the other side and the advantages he derived from falling by surprise upon an army that was more or less asleep were all lost to him by blundering and bad leadership before ever he was at grips with Feversham The armies came into collision in the neighbourhood of two o clock in the morning mister Blood slept undisturbed through the distant boom of cannon Not until four o clock when the sun was rising to dispel the last wisps of mist over that stricken field of battle did he awaken from his tranquil slumbers He sat up in bed rubbed the sleep from his eyes and collected himself Blows were thundering upon the door of his house and a voice was calling incoherently This was the noise that had aroused him Conceiving that he had to do with some urgent obstetrical case he reached for bedgown and slippers to go below On the landing he almost collided with missus Barlow new risen and unsightly in a state of panic He quieted her cluckings with a word of reassurance and went himself to open There in slanting golden light of the new risen sun stood a breathless wild eyed man and a steaming horse Smothered in dust and grime his clothes in disarray the left sleeve of his doublet hanging in rags this young man opened his lips to speak yet for a long moment remained speechless In that moment mister Blood recognized him for the young shipmaster Jeremiah Pitt the nephew of the maiden ladies opposite one who had been drawn by the general enthusiasm into the vortex of that rebellion The street was rousing awakened by the sailor s noisy advent doors were opening and lattices were being unlatched for the protrusion of anxious inquisitive heads Take your time now said mister Blood I never knew speed made by overhaste But the wild eyed lad paid no heed to the admonition He plunged headlong into speech gasping breathless It is Lord Gildoy he panted He is sore wounded at Oglethorpe s Farm by the river I bore him thither and and he sent me for you Come away Come away He would have clutched the doctor and haled him forth by force in bedgown and slippers as he was But the doctor eluded that too eager hand To be sure I ll come said he He was distressed Gildoy had been a very friendly generous patron to him since his settling in these parts And mister Blood was eager enough to do what he now could to discharge the debt grieved that the occasion should have arisen and in such a manner for he knew quite well that the rash young nobleman had been an active agent of the Duke s To be sure I ll come But first give me leave to get some clothes and other things that I may need There s no time to lose Be easy now I ll lose none I tell ye again ye ll go quickest by going leisurely Come in take a chair He threw open the door of a parlour Young Pitt waved aside the invitation I ll wait here Make haste in God s name mister Blood went off to dress and to fetch a case of instruments Questions concerning the precise nature of Lord Gildoy s hurt could wait until they were on their way Whilst he pulled on his boots he gave missus Barlow instructions for the day which included the matter of a dinner he was not destined to eat When at last he went forth again missus Barlow clucking after him like a disgruntled fowl he found young Pitt smothered in a crowd of scared half dressed townsfolk mostly women who had come hastening for news of how the battle had sped The news he gave them was to be read in the lamentations with which they disturbed the morning air At sight of the doctor dressed and booted the case of instruments tucked under his arm the messenger disengaged himself from those who pressed about shook off his weariness and the two tearful aunts that clung most closely and seizing the bridle of his horse he climbed to the saddle Come along sir he cried Mount behind me mister Blood without wasting words did as he was bidden Pitt touched the horse with his spur The little crowd gave way and thus upon the crupper of that doubly laden horse clinging to the belt of his companion Peter Blood set out upon his Odyssey For this Pitt in whom he beheld no more than the messenger of a wounded rebel gentleman was indeed the very messenger of Fate CHAPTER II KIRKE S DRAGOONS Oglethorpe s farm stood a mile or so to the south of Bridgewater on the right bank of the river It was a straggling Tudor building showing grey above the ivy that clothed its lower parts Approaching it now through the fragrant orchards amid which it seemed to drowse in Arcadian peace beside the waters of the Parrett sparkling in the morning sunlight mister Blood might have had a difficulty in believing it part of a world tormented by strife and bloodshed On the bridge as they had been riding out of Bridgewater they had met a vanguard of fugitives from the field of battle weary broken men many of them wounded all of them terror stricken staggering in speedless haste with the last remnants of their strength into the shelter which it was their vain illusion the town would afford them Eyes glazed with lassitude and fear looked up piteously out of haggard faces at mister Blood and his companion as they rode forth hoarse voices cried a warning that merciless pursuit was not far behind Undeterred however young Pitt rode amain along the dusty road by which these poor fugitives from that swift rout on Sedgemoor came flocking in ever increasing numbers Presently he swung aside and quitting the road took to a pathway that crossed the dewy meadowlands Even here they met odd groups of these human derelicts who were scattering in all directions looking fearfully behind them as they came through the long grass expecting at every moment to see the red coats of the dragoons But as Pitt s direction was a southward one bringing them ever nearer to Feversham s headquarters they were presently clear of that human flotsam and jetsam of the battle and riding through the peaceful orchards heavy with the ripening fruit that was soon to make its annual yield of cider At last they alighted on the kidney stones of the courtyard and Baynes the master of the homestead grave of countenance and flustered of manner gave them welcome In the spacious stone flagged hall the doctor found Lord Gildoy a very tall and dark young gentleman prominent of chin and nose stretched on a cane day bed under one of the tall mullioned windows in the care of missus Baynes and her comely daughter His cheeks were leaden hued his eyes closed and from his blue lips came with each laboured breath a faint moaning noise mister Blood stood for a moment silently considering his patient He deplored that a youth with such bright hopes in life as Lord Gildoy s should have risked all perhaps existence itself to forward the ambition of a worthless adventurer Because he had liked and honoured this brave lad he paid his case the tribute of a sigh Then he knelt to his task ripped away doublet and underwear to lay bare his lordship s mangled side and called for water and linen and what else he needed for his work He was still intent upon it a half hour later when the dragoons invaded the homestead The clatter of hooves and hoarse shouts that heralded their approach disturbed him not at all For one thing he was not easily disturbed for another his task absorbed him But his lordship who had now recovered consciousness showed considerable alarm and the battle stained Jeremy Pitt sped to cover in a clothes press Baynes was uneasy and his wife and daughter trembled mister Blood reassured them Why what s to fear he said It s a Christian country this and Christian men do not make war upon the wounded nor upon those who harbour them He still had you see illusions about Christians He held a glass of cordial prepared under his directions to his lordship s lips Give your mind peace my lord The worst is done And then they came rattling and clanking into the stone flagged hall a round dozen jack booted lobster coated troopers of the Tangiers Regiment led by a sturdy black browed fellow with a deal of gold lace about the breast of his coat Baynes stood his ground his attitude half defiant whilst his wife and daughter shrank away in renewed fear mister Blood at the head of the day bed looked over his shoulder to take stock of the invaders The officer barked an order which brought his men to an attentive halt then swaggered forward his gloved hand bearing down the pummel of his sword his spurs jingling musically as he moved He announced his authority to the yeoman I am Captain Hobart of Colonel Kirke s dragoons What rebels do you harbour The yeoman took alarm at that ferocious truculence It expressed itself in his trembling voice I I am no harbourer of rebels sir This wounded gentleman I can see for myself The Captain stamped forward to the day bed and scowled down upon the grey faced sufferer No need to ask how he came in this state and by his wounds A damned rebel and that s enough for me He flung a command at his dragoons Out with him my lads mister Blood got between the day bed and the troopers In the name of humanity sir said he on a note of anger This is England not Tangiers The gentleman is in sore case He may not be moved without peril to his life Captain Hobart was amused Oh I am to be tender of the lives of these rebels Odds blood Do you think it s to benefit his health we re taking him There s gallows being planted along the road from Weston to Bridgewater and he ll serve for one of them as well as another Colonel Kirke ll learn these nonconforming oafs something they ll not forget in generations You re hanging men without trial Faith then it s mistaken I am We re in Tangiers after all it seems where your regiment belongs The Captain considered him with a kindling eye He looked him over from the soles of his riding boots to the crown of his periwig He noted the spare active frame the arrogant poise of the head the air of authority that invested mister Blood and soldier recognized soldier The Captain s eyes narrowed Recognition went further Who the hell may you be he exploded My name is Blood sir Peter Blood at your service Aye aye Codso That s the name You were in French service once were you not If mister Blood was surprised he did not betray it I was Then I remember you five years ago or more you were in Tangiers That is so I knew your colonel Faith you may be renewing the acquaintance The Captain laughed unpleasantly What brings you here sir This wounded gentleman I was fetched to attend him I am a medicus A doctor you Scorn of that lie as he conceived it rang in the heavy hectoring voice Medicinae baccalaureus said mister Blood Don t fling your French at me man snapped Hobart Speak English mister Blood s smile annoyed him I am a physician practising my calling in the town of Bridgewater The Captain sneered Which you reached by way of Lyme Regis in the following of your bastard Duke It was mister Blood s turn to sneer If your wit were as big as your voice my dear it s the great man you d be by this For a moment the dragoon was speechless The colour deepened in his face You may find me great enough to hang you Faith yes Ye ve the look and the manners of a hangman But if you practise your trade on my patient here you may be putting a rope round your own neck He s not the kind you may string up and no questions asked He has the right to trial and the right to trial by his peers By his peers The Captain was taken aback by these three words which mister Blood had stressed Sure now any but a fool or a savage would have asked his name before ordering him to the gallows The gentleman is my Lord Gildoy And then his lordship spoke for himself in a weak voice I make no concealment of my association with the Duke of Monmouth I ll take the consequences But if you please I ll take them after trial by my peers as the doctor has said The feeble voice ceased and was followed by a moment s silence As is common in many blustering men there was a deal of timidity deep down in Hobart The announcement of his lordship s rank had touched those depths A servile upstart he stood in awe of titles And he stood in awe of his colonel Percy Kirke was not lenient with blunderers By a gesture he checked his men He must consider mister Blood observing his pause added further matter for his consideration Ye ll be remembering Captain that Lord Gildoy will have friends and relatives on the Tory side who ll have something to say to Colonel Kirke if his lordship should be handled like a common felon You ll go warily Captain or as I ve said it s a halter for your neck ye ll be weaving this morning Captain Hobart swept the warning aside with a bluster of contempt but he acted upon it none the less Take up the day bed said he and convey him on that to Bridgewater Lodge him in the gaol until I take order about him He may not survive the journey Blood remonstrated He s in no case to be moved So much the worse for him My affair is to round up rebels He confirmed his order by a gesture Two of his men took up the day bed and swung to depart with it Gildoy made a feeble effort to put forth a hand towards mister Blood Sir he said you leave me in your debt If I live I shall study how to discharge it mister Blood bowed for answer then to the men Bear him steadily he commanded His life depends on it As his lordship was carried out the Captain became brisk He turned upon the yeoman What other cursed rebels do you harbour None other sir His lordship We ve dealt with his lordship for the present We ll deal with you in a moment when we ve searched your house And by God if you ve lied to me He broke off snarling to give an order Four of his dragoons went out In a moment they were heard moving noisily in the adjacent room Meanwhile the Captain was questing about the hall sounding the wainscoting with the butt of a pistol mister Blood saw no profit to himself in lingering By your leave it s a very good day I ll be wishing you said he By my leave you ll remain awhile the Captain ordered him mister Blood shrugged and sat down You re tiresome he said I wonder your colonel hasn t discovered it yet But the Captain did not heed him He was stooping to pick up a soiled and dusty hat in which there was pinned a little bunch of oak leaves It had been lying near the clothes press in which the unfortunate Pitt had taken refuge The Captain smiled malevolently His eyes raked the room resting first sardonically on the yeoman then on the two women in the background and finally on mister Blood who sat with one leg thrown over the other in an attitude of indifference that was far from reflecting his mind Then the Captain stepped to the press and pulled open one of the wings of its massive oaken door He took the huddled inmate by the collar of his doublet and lugged him out into the open And who the devil s this quoth he Another nobleman mister Blood had a vision of those gallows of which Captain Hobart had spoken and of this unfortunate young shipmaster going to adorn one of them strung up without trial in the place of the other victim of whom the Captain had been cheated On the spot he invented not only a title but a whole family for the young rebel Faith ye ve said it Captain This is Viscount Pitt first cousin to Sir Thomas Vernon who s married to that slut Moll Kirke sister to your own colonel and sometime lady in waiting upon King James s queen Both the Captain and his prisoner gasped But whereas thereafter young Pitt discreetly held his peace the Captain rapped out a nasty oath He considered his prisoner again He s lying is he not he demanded seizing the lad by the shoulder and glaring into his face He s rallying rue by God If ye believe that said Blood hang him and see what happens to you The dragoon glared at the doctor and then at his prisoner Pah He thrust the lad into the hands of his men Fetch him along to Bridgewater And make fast that fellow also he pointed to Baynes We ll show him what it means to harbour and comfort rebels There was a moment of confusion Baynes struggled in the grip of the troopers protesting vehemently The terrified women screamed until silenced by a greater terror The Captain strode across to them He took the girl by the shoulders She was a pretty golden headed creature with soft blue eyes that looked up entreatingly piteously into the face of the dragoon He leered upon her his eyes aglow took her chin in his hand and set her shuddering by his brutal kiss It s an earnest he said smiling grimly Let that quiet you little rebel till I ve done with these rogues And he swung away again leaving her faint and trembling in the arms of her anguished mother His men stood grinning awaiting orders the two prisoners now fast pinioned Take them away Let Cornet Drake have charge of them His smouldering eye again sought the cowering girl I ll stay awhile to search out this place There may be other rebels hidden here As an afterthought he added And take this fellow with you He pointed to mister Blood Bestir mister Blood started out of his musings He had been considering that in his case of instruments there was a lancet with which he might perform on Captain Hobart a beneficial operation Beneficial that is to humanity In any case the dragoon was obviously plethoric and would be the better for a blood letting The difficulty lay in making the opportunity He was beginning to wonder if he could lure the Captain aside with some tale of hidden treasure when this untimely interruption set a term to that interesting speculation He sought to temporize Faith it will suit me very well said he For Bridgewater is my destination and but that ye detained me I d have been on my way thither now Your destination there will be the gaol
1264_129805_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah 
none	none	bah Ye re surely joking There s a gallows for you if you prefer it It s merely a question of now or later Rude hands seized mister Blood and that precious lancet was in the case on the table out of reach He twisted out of the grip of the dragoons for he was strong and agile but they closed with him again immediately and bore him down Pinning him to the ground they tied his wrists behind his back then roughly pulled him to his feet again Take him away said Hobart shortly and turned to issue his orders to the other waiting troopers Go search the house from attic to cellar then report to me here The soldiers trailed out by the door leading to the interior mister Blood was thrust by his guards into the courtyard where Pitt and Baynes already waited From the threshold of the hall he looked back at Captain Hobart and his sapphire eyes were blazing On his lips trembled a threat of what he would do to Hobart if he should happen to survive this business Betimes he remembered that to utter it were probably to extinguish his chance of living to execute it For to day the King s men were masters in the West and the West was regarded as enemy country to be subjected to the worst horror of war by the victorious side Here a captain of horse was for the moment lord of life and death Under the apple trees in the orchard mister Blood and his companions in misfortune were made fast each to a trooper s stirrup leather Then at the sharp order of the cornet the little troop started for Bridgewater As they set out there was the fullest confirmation of mister Blood s hideous assumption that to the dragoons this was a conquered enemy country There were sounds of rending timbers of furniture smashed and overthrown the shouts and laughter of brutal men to announce that this hunt for rebels was no more than a pretext for pillage and destruction Finally above all other sounds came the piercing screams of a woman in acutest agony Baynes checked in his stride and swung round writhing his face ashen As a consequence he was jerked from his feet by the rope that attached him to the stirrup leather and he was dragged helplessly a yard or two before the trooper reined in cursing him foully and striking him with the flat of his sword It came to mister Blood as he trudged forward under the laden apple trees on that fragrant delicious July morning that man as he had long suspected was the vilest work of God and that only a fool would set himself up as a healer of a species that was best exterminated CHAPTER III THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE It was not until two months later on the nineteenth of September if you must have the actual date that Peter Blood was brought to trial upon a charge of high treason We know that he was not guilty of this but we need not doubt that he was quite capable of it by the time he was indicted Those two months of inhuman unspeakable imprisonment had moved his mind to a cold and deadly hatred of King James and his representatives It says something for his fortitude that in all the circumstances he should still have had a mind at all Yet terrible as was the position of this entirely innocent man he had cause for thankfulness on two counts The first of these was that he should have been brought to trial at all the second that his trial took place on the date named and not a day earlier In the very delay which exacerbated him lay although he did not realize it his only chance of avoiding the gallows Easily but for the favour of Fortune he might have been one of those haled on the morrow of the battle more or less haphazard from the overflowing gaol at Bridgewater to be summarily hanged in the market place by the bloodthirsty Colonel Kirke There was about the Colonel of the Tangiers Regiment a deadly despatch which might have disposed in like fashion of all those prisoners numerous as they were but for the vigorous intervention of Bishop Mews which put an end to the drumhead courts martial Even so in that first week after Sedgemoor Kirke and Feversham contrived between them to put to death over a hundred men after a trial so summary as to be no trial at all They required human freights for the gibbets with which they were planting the countryside and they little cared how they procured them or what innocent lives they took What after all was the life of a clod The executioners were kept busy with rope and chopper and cauldrons of pitch I spare you the details of that nauseating picture It is after all with the fate of Peter Blood that we are concerned rather than with that of the Monmouth rebels He survived to be included in one of those melancholy droves of prisoners who chained in pairs were marched from Bridgewater to Taunton Those who were too sorely wounded to march were conveyed in carts into which they were brutally crowded their wounds undressed and festering Many were fortunate enough to die upon the way When Blood insisted upon his right to exercise his art so as to relieve some of this suffering he was accounted importunate and threatened with a flogging If he had one regret now it was that he had not been out with Monmouth That
1264_129805_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 of course 
none	none	was illogical but you can hardly expect logic from a man in his position His chain companion on that dreadful march was the same Jeremy Pitt who had been the agent of his present misfortunes The young shipmaster had remained his close companion after their common arrest Hence fortuitously had they been chained together in the crowded prison where they were almost suffocated by the heat and the stench during those days of July August and September Scraps of news filtered into the gaol from the outside world Some may have been deliberately allowed to penetrate Of these was the tale of Monmouth s execution It created profoundest dismay amongst those men who were suffering for the Duke and for the religious cause he had professed to champion Many refused utterly to believe it A wild story began to circulate that a man resembling Monmouth had offered himself up in the Duke s stead and that Monmouth survived to come again in glory to deliver Zion and make war upon Babylon mister Blood heard that tale with the same indifference with which he had received the news of Monmouth s death But one shameful thing he heard in connection with this which left him not quite so unmoved and served to nourish the contempt he was forming for King James His Majesty had consented to see Monmouth To have done so unless he intended to pardon him was a thing execrable and damnable beyond belief for the only other object in granting that interview could be the evilly mean satisfaction of spurning the abject penitence of his unfortunate nephew Later they heard that Lord Grey who after the Duke indeed perhaps before him was the main leader of the rebellion had purchased his own pardon for forty thousand pounds Peter Blood found this of a piece with the rest His contempt for King James blazed out at last Why here s a filthy mean creature to sit on a throne If I had known as much of him before as I know to day I don t doubt I should have given cause to be where I am now And then on a sudden thought And where will Lord Gildoy be do you suppose he asked Young Pitt whom he addressed turned towards him a face from which the ruddy tan of the sea had faded almost completely during those months of captivity His grey eyes were round and questioning Blood answered him Sure now we ve never seen his lordship since that day at Oglethorpe s And where are the other gentry that were taken the real leaders of this plaguey rebellion Grey s case explains their absence I think They are wealthy men that can ransom themselves Here awaiting the gallows are none but the unfortunates who followed those who had the honour to lead them go free It s a curious and instructive reversal of the usual way of these things Faith it s an uncertain world entirely He laughed and settled down into that spirit of scorn wrapped in which he stepped later into the great hall of Taunton Castle to take his trial With him went Pitt and the yeoman Baynes The three of them were to be tried together and their case was to open the proceedings of that ghastly day The hall even to the galleries thronged with spectators most of whom were ladies was hung in scarlet a pleasant conceit this of the Lord Chief Justice s who naturally enough preferred the colour that should reflect his own bloody mind At the upper end on a raised dais sat the Lords Commissioners the five judges in their scarlet robes and heavy dark periwigs Baron Jeffreys of Wem enthroned in the middle place The prisoners filed in under guard The crier called for silence under pain of imprisonment and as the hum of voices gradually became hushed mister Blood considered with interest the twelve good men and true that composed the jury Neither good nor true did they look They were scared uneasy and hangdog as any set of thieves caught with their hands in the pockets of their neighbours They were twelve shaken men each of whom stood between the sword of the Lord Chief Justice s recent bloodthirsty charge and the wall of his own conscience From them mister Blood s calm deliberate glance passed on to consider the Lords Commissioners and particularly the presiding Judge that Lord Jeffreys whose terrible fame had come ahead of him from Dorchester He beheld a tall slight man on the young side of forty with an oval face that was delicately beautiful There were dark stains of suffering or sleeplessness under the low lidded eyes heightening their brilliance and their gentle melancholy The face was very pale save for the vivid colour of the full lips and the hectic flush on the rather high but inconspicuous cheek bones It was something in those lips that marred the perfection of that countenance a fault elusive but undeniable lurked there to belie the fine sensitiveness of those nostrils the tenderness of those dark liquid eyes and the noble calm of that pale brow The physician in mister Blood regarded the man with peculiar interest knowing as he did the agonizing malady from which his lordship suffered and the amazingly irregular debauched life that he led in spite of it perhaps because of it Peter Blood hold up your hand Abruptly he was recalled to his position by the harsh voice of the clerk of arraigns His obedience was mechanical and the clerk droned out the wordy indictment which pronounced Peter Blood a false traitor against the Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Prince James the Second by the grace of God of England Scotland France and Ireland King his supreme and natural lord It informed him that having no fear of God in his heart but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the Devil he had failed in the love and true and due natural obedience towards his said lord the King and had moved to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the kingdom and to stir up war and rebellion to depose his said lord the King from the title honour and the regal name of the imperial crown and much more of the same kind at the end of all of which he was invited to say whether he was guilty or not guilty He answered more than was asked It s entirely innocent I am A small sharp faced man at a table before and to the right of him bounced up It was mister Pollexfen the Judge Advocate Are you guilty or not guilty snapped this peppery gentleman You must take the words Words is it said Peter Blood Oh not guilty And he went on addressing himself to the bench On this same subject of words may it please your lordships I am guilty of nothing to justify any of those words I have heard used to describe me unless it be of a want of patience at having been closely confined for two months and longer in a foetid gaol with great peril to my health and even life Being started he would have added a deal more but at this point the Lord Chief Justice interposed in a gentle rather plaintive voice Look you sir because we must observe the common and usual methods of trial I must interrupt you now You are no doubt ignorant of the forms of law Not only ignorant my lord but hitherto most happy in that ignorance I could gladly have forgone this acquaintance with them A pale smile momentarily lightened the wistful countenance I believe you You shall be fully heard when you come to your defence But anything you say now is altogether irregular and improper Enheartened by that apparent sympathy and consideration mister Blood answered thereafter as was required of him that he would be tried by God and his country Whereupon having prayed t

none	none	to send him a good deliverance the clerk called upon Andrew Baynes to hold up his hand and plead From Baynes who pleaded not guilty the clerk passed on to Pitt who boldly owned his guilt The Lord Chief Justice stirred at that Come that s better quoth he and his four scarlet brethren nodded If all were as obstinate as his two fellow rebels there would never be an end After that ominous interpolation delivered with an inhuman iciness that sent a shiver through the court mister Pollexfen got to his feet With great prolixity he stated the general case against the three men and the particular case against Peter Blood whose indictment was to be taken first The only witness called for the King was Captain Hobart He testified briskly to the manner in which he had found and taken the three prisoners together with Lord Gildoy Upon the orders of his colonel he would have hanged Pitt out of hand but was restrained by the lies of the prisoner Blood who led him to believe that Pitt was a peer of the realm and a person of consideration As the Captain s evidence concluded Lord Jeffreys looked across at Peter Blood Will the prisoner Blood ask the witness any questions None my lord He has correctly related what occurred I am glad to have your admission of that without any of the prevarications that are usual in your kind And I will say this that here prevarication would avail you little For we always have the truth in the end Be sure of that Baynes and Pitt similarly admitted the accuracy of the Captain s evidence whereupon the scarlet figure of the Lord Chief Justice heaved a sigh of relief This being so let us get on in God s name for we have much to do There was now no trace of gentleness in his voice It was brisk and rasping and the lips through which it passed were curved in scorn I take it mister Pollexfen that the wicked treason of these three rogues being established indeed admitted by them there is no more to be said Peter Blood s voice rang out crisply on a note that almost seemed to contain laughter May it please your lordship but there s a deal more to be said His lordship looked at him first in blank amazement at his audacity then gradually with an expression of dull anger The scarlet lips fell into unpleasant cruel lines that transfigured the whole countenance How now rogue Would you waste our time with idle subterfuge I would have your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury hear me on my defence as your lordship promised that I should be heard Why so you shall villain so you shall His lordship s voice was harsh as a file He writhed as he spoke and for an instant his features were distorted A delicate dead white hand on which the veins showed blue brought forth a handkerchief with which he dabbed his lips and then his brow Observing him with his physician s eye Peter Blood judged him a prey to the pain of the disease that was destroying him So you shall But after the admission made what defence remains You shall judge my lord That is the purpose for which I sit here And so shall you gentlemen Blood looked from judge to jury The latter shifted uncomfortably under the confident flash of his blue eyes Lord Jeffreys s bullying charge had whipped the spirit out of them Had they themselves been prisoners accused of treason he could not have arraigned them more ferociously Peter Blood stood boldly forward erect self possessed and saturnine He was freshly shaven and his periwig if out of curl was at least carefully combed and dressed Captain Hobart has testified to what he knows that he found me at Oglethorpe s Farm on the Monday morning after the battle at Weston But he has not told you what I did there Again the Judge broke in Why what should you have been doing there in the company of rebels two of whom Lord Gildoy and your fellow there have already admitted their guilt That is what I beg leave to tell your lordship I pray you do and in God s name be brief man For if I am to be troubled with the say of all you traitor dogs I may sit here until the Spring Assizes I was there my lord in my quality as a physician to dress Lord Gildoy s wounds What s this Do you tell us that you are a physician A graduate of Trinity College Dublin Good God cried Lord Jeffreys his voice suddenly swelling his eyes upon the jury What an impudent rogue is this You heard the witness say that he had known him in Tangiers some years ago and that he was then an officer in the French service You heard the prisoner admit that the witness had spoken the truth Why so he had Yet what I am telling you is also true so it is For some years I was a soldier but before that I was a physician and I have been one again since January last established in Bridgewater as I can bring a hundred witnesses to prove There s not the need to waste our time with that I will convict you out of your own rascally mouth I will ask you only this How came you who represent yourself as a physician peacefully following your calling in the town of Bridgewater to be with the army of the Duke of Monmouth I was never with that army No witness has sworn to that and I dare swear that no witness will I never was attracted to the late rebellion I regarded the adventure as a wicked madness I take leave to ask your lordship his brogue became more marked than ever what should I who was born and bred a papist be doing in the army of the Protestant Champion A papist thou The judge gloomed on him a moment Art more like a snivelling canting Jack Presbyter I tell you man I can smell a Presbyterian forty miles Then I ll take leave to marvel that with so keen a nose your lordship can t smell a papist at four paces There was a ripple of laughter in the galleries instantly quelled by the fierce glare of the Judge and the voice of the crier Lord Jeffreys leaned farther forward upon his desk He raised that delicate white hand still clutching its handkerchief and sprouting from a froth of lace We ll leave your religion out of account for the moment friend said he But mark what I say to you With a minatory forefinger he beat the time of his words Know friend that there is no religion a man can pretend to can give a countenance to lying Thou hast a precious immortal soul and there is nothing in the world equal to it in value Consider that the great God of Heaven and Earth before Whose tribunal thou and we and all persons are to stand at the last day will take vengeance on thee for every falsehood and justly strike thee into eternal flames make thee drop into the bottomless pit of fire and brimstone if thou offer to deviate the least from the truth and nothing but the truth For I tell thee God is not mocked On that I charge you to answer truthfully How came you to be taken with these rebels Peter Blood gaped at him a moment in consternation The man was incredible unreal fantastic a nightmare judge Then he collected himself to answer I was summoned that morning to succour Lord Gildoy and I conceived it to be the duty imposed upon me by my calling to answer that summons Did you so The Judge terrible now of aspect his face white his twisted lips red as the blood for which they thirsted glared upon him in evil mockery Then he controlled himself as if by an effort He sighed He resumed his earlier gentle plaintiveness Lord How you waste our time But I ll have patience with you Who summoned you Master Pitt there as he will testify Oh Master Pitt will testify he that is himself a traitor self confessed Is that your witness There is also Master Baynes here who can answer to it Good Master Baynes will have to answer for himself and I doubt not he ll be greatly exercised to save his own neck from a halter Come come sir are these your only witnesses I could bring others from Bridgewater who saw me set out that morning upon the crupper of Master Pitt s horse His lordship smiled It will not be necessary For mark me I do not intend to waste more time on you Answer me only this When Master Pitt as you pretend came to summon you did you know that he had been as you have heard him confess of Monmouth s following I did My lord You did Ha His lordship looked at the cringing jury and uttered a short stabbing laugh Yet in spite of that you went with him To succour a wounded man as was my sacred duty Thy sacred duty sayest thou Fury blazed out of him again Good God What a generation of vipers do we live in Thy sacred duty rogue is to thy King and to God But let it pass Did he tell you whom it was that you were desired to succour Lord Gildoy yes And you knew that Lord Gildoy had been wounded in the battle and on what side he fought I knew And yet being as you would have us believe a true and loyal subject of our Lord the King you went to succour him Peter Blood lost patience for a moment My business my lord was with his wounds not with his politics A murmur from the galleries and even from the jury approved him It served only to drive his terrible judge into a deeper fury Jesus God Was there ever such an impudent villain in the world as thou He swung white faced to the jury I hope gentlemen of the jury you take notice of the horrible carriage of this traitor rogue and withal you cannot but observe the spirit of this sort of people what a villainous and devilish one it is Out of his own mouth he has said enough to hang him a dozen times Yet is there more Answer me this sir When you cozened Captain Hobart with your lies concerning the station of this other traitor Pitt what was your business then To save him from being hanged without trial as was threatened What concern was it of yours whether or how the wretch was hanged Justice is the concern of every loyal subject for an injustice committed by one who holds the King s commission is in some sense a dishonour to the King s majesty It was a shrewd sharp thrust aimed at the jury and it reveals I think the alertness of the man s mind his self possession ever steadiest in moments of dire peril With any other jury it must have made the impression that he hoped to make It may even have made its impression upon these poor pusillanimous sheep But the dread judge was there to efface it He gasped aloud then flung himself violently forward Lord of Heaven he stormed Was there ever such a canting impudent rascal But I have done with you I see thee villain I see thee already with a halter round thy neck Having spoken so gloatingly evilly he sank back again and composed himself It was as if a curtain fell All emotion passed again from his pale face Back to invest it again came that gentle melancholy Speaking after a moment s pause his voice was soft almost tender yet every word of it carried sharply through that hushed court If I know my own heart it is not in my nature to desire the hurt of anybody much less to delight in his eternal perdition It is out of compassion for you that I have used all these words because I would have you have some regard for your immortal soul and not ensure its damnation by obdurately persisting in falsehood and prevarication But I see that all the pains in the world and all compassion and charity are lost upon you and therefore I will say no more to you He turned again to the jury that countenance of wistful beauty Gentlemen I must tell you for law of which we are the judges and not you that if any person be in actual rebellion against the King and another person who really and actually was not in rebellion does knowingly receive harbour comfort or succour him such a person is as much a traitor as he who indeed bore arms We are bound by our oaths and consciences to declare to you what is law and you are bound by your oaths and your consciences to deliver and to declare to us by your verdict the truth of the facts Upon that he proceeded to his summing up showing how Baynes and Blood were both guilty of treason the first for having harboured a traitor the second for having succoured that traitor by dressing his wounds He interlarded his address by sycophantic allusions to his natural lord and lawful sovereign the King whom God had set over them and with vituperations of Nonconformity and of Monmouth of whom in his own words he dared boldly affirm that the meanest subject within the kingdom that was of legitimate birth had a better title to the crown Jesus God That ever we should have such a generation of vipers among us he burst out in rhetorical frenzy And then he sank back as if exhausted by the violence he had used A moment he was still dabbing his lips again then he moved uneasily once more his features were twisted by pain and in a few snarling almost incoherent words he dismissed the jury to consider the verdict Peter Blood had listened to the intemperate the blasphemous and almost obscene invective of that tirade with a detachment that afterwards in retrospect surprised him He was so amazed by the man by the reactions taking place in him between mind and body and by his methods of bullying and coercing the jury into bloodshed that he almost forgot that his own life was at stake The absence of that dazed jury was a brief one The verdict found the three prisoners guilty Peter Blood looked round the scarlet hung court For an instant that foam of white faces seemed to heave before him Then he was himself again and a voice was asking him what he had to say for himself why sentence of death should not be passed upon him being convicted of high treason He laughed and his laugh jarred uncannily upon the deathly stillness of the court It was all so grotesque such a mockery of justice administered by that wistful eyed jack pudding in scarlet who was himself a mockery the venal instrument of a brutally spiteful and vindictive king His laughter shocked the austerity of that same jack pudding Do you laugh sirrah with the rope about your neck upon the very threshold of that eternity you are so suddenly to enter into And then Blood took his revenge Faith it s in better case I am for mirth than your lordship For I have this to say before you deliver judgment Your lordship sees me an innocent man whose only offence is that I practised charity with a halter round my neck Your lordship being the justiciar speaks with knowledge of what is to come to me I being a physician may speak with knowledge of what is to come to your lordship And I tell you that I would not now change places with you that I would not exchange this halter that you fling about my neck for the stone that you carry in your body The death to which you may doom me is a light pleasantry by contrast with the death to which your lordship has been doomed by that Great Judge with whose name your lordship makes so free The Lord Chief Justice sat stiffly upright his face ashen his lips twitching and whilst you might have counted ten there was no sound in that paralyzed court after Peter Blood had finished speaking All those who knew Lord Jeffreys regarded this as the lull before the storm and braced themselves for the explosion But none came Slowly faintly the colour crept back into that ashen face The scarlet figure lost its rigidity and bent forward His lordship began to speak In a muted voice and briefly much more briefly than his wont on such occasions and in a manner entirely mechanical the manner of a man whose thoughts are elsewhere while his lips are speaking he delivered sentence of death in the prescribed form and without the least allusion to what Peter Blood had said Having delivered it he sank back exhausted his eyes half closed his brow agleam with sweat The prisoners filed out mister Pollexfen a Whig at heart despite the position of Judge Advocate which he occupied was overheard by one of the jurors to mutter in the ear of a brother counsel On my soul that swarthy rascal has given his lordship a scare It s a pity he must hang For a man who can frighten Jeffreys should go far CHAPTER IV HUMAN MERCHANDISE mister Pollexfen was at one and the same time right and wrong a condition much more common than is generally supposed He was right in his indifferently expressed thought that a man whose mien and words could daunt such a lord of terror as Jeffreys should by the dominance of his nature be able to fashion himself a considerable destiny He was wrong though justifiably so in his assumption that Peter Blood must hang I have said that the tribulations with which he was visited as a result of his errand of mercy to Oglethorpe s Farm contained although as yet he did not perceive it perhaps two sources of thankfulness one that he was tried at all the other that his trial took place on the nineteenth of September Until the eighteenth the sentences passed by the court of the Lords Commissioners had been carried out literally and expeditiously But on the morning of the nineteenth there arrived at Taunton a courier from Lord Sunderland the Secretary of State with a letter for Lord Jeffreys wherein he was informed that His Majesty had been graciously pleased to command that eleven hundred rebels should be furnished for transportation to some of His Majesty s southern plantations Jamaica Barbados or any of the Leeward Islands You are not to suppose that this command was dictated by any sense of mercy Lord Churchill was no more than just when he spoke of the King s heart as being as insensible as marble It had been realized that in these wholesale hangings there was taking place a reckless waste of valuable material Slaves were urgently required in the plantations and a healthy vigorous man could be reckoned worth at least from ten to fifteen pounds Then there were at court many gentlemen who had some claim or other upon His Majesty s bounty Here was a cheap and ready way to discharge these claims From amongst the convicted rebels a certain number might be set aside to be bestowed upon those gentlemen so that they might dispose of them to their own profit My Lord Sunderland s letter gives precise details of the royal munificence in human flesh A thousand prisoners were to be distributed among some eight courtiers and others whilst a postscriptum to his lordship s letter asked for a further hundred to be held at the disposal of the Queen These prisoners were to be transported at once to His Majesty s southern plantations and to be kept there for the space of ten years before being restored to liberty the parties to whom they were assigned entering into security to see that transportation was immediately effected We know from Lord Jeffreys s secretary how the Chief Justice inveighed that night in drunken frenzy against this misplaced clemency to which His Majesty had been persuaded We know how he attempted by letter to induce the King to reconsider his decision But James adhered to it It was apart from the indirect profit he derived from it a clemency full worthy of him He knew that to spare lives in this fashion was to convert them into living deaths Many must succumb in torment to the horrors of West Indian slavery and so be the envy of their surviving companions Thus it happened that Peter Blood and with him Jeremy Pitt and Andrew Baynes instead of being hanged drawn and quartered as their sentences directed were conveyed to Bristol and there shipped with some fifty others aboard the Jamaica Merchant From close confinement under hatches ill nourishment and foul water a sickness broke out amongst them of which eleven died Amongst these was the unfortunate yeoman from Oglethorpe s Farm brutally torn from his quiet homestead amid the fragrant cider orchards for no other sin but that he had practised mercy The mortality might have been higher than it was but for Peter Blood At first the master of the Jamaica Merchant had answered with oaths and threats the doctor s expostulations against permitting men to perish in this fashion and his insistence that he should be made free of the medicine chest and given leave to minister to the sick But presently Captain Gardner came to see that he might be brought to task for these too heavy losses of human merchandise and because of this he was belatedly glad to avail himself of the skill of Peter Blood The doctor went to work zealously and zestfully and wrought so ably that by his ministrations and by improving the condition of his fellow captives he checked the spread of the disease Towards the middle of December the Jamaica Merchant dropped anchor in Carlisle Bay and put ashore the forty two surviving rebels convict If these unfortunates had imagined as many of them appear to have done that they were coming into some wild savage country the prospect of which they had a glimpse before they were hustled over the ship s side into the waiting boats was enough to correct the impression They beheld a town of sufficiently imposing proportions composed of houses built upon European notions of architecture but without any of the huddle usual in European cities The spire of a church rose dominantly above the red roofs a fort guarded the entrance of the wide harbour with guns thrusting their muzzles between the crenels and the wide facade of Government House revealed itself dominantly placed on a gentle hill above the town This hill was vividly green as is an English hill in April and the day was such a day as April gives to England the season of heavy rains being newly ended On a wide cobbled space on the sea front they found a guard of red coated militia drawn up to receive them and a crowd attracted by their arrival which in dress and manner differed little from a crowd in a seaport at home save that it contained fewer women and a great number of negroes To inspect them drawn up there on the mole came Governor Steed a short stout red faced gentleman in blue taffetas burdened by a prodigious amount of gold lace who limped a little and leaned heavily upon a stout ebony cane After him in the uniform of a colonel of the Barbados Militia rolled a tall corpulent man who towered head and shoulders above the Governor with malevolence plainly written on his enormous yellowish countenance At his side and contrasting oddly with his grossness moving with an easy stripling grace came a slight young lady in a modish riding gown The broad brim of a grey hat with scarlet sweep of ostrich plume shaded an oval face upon which the climate of the Tropic of Cancer had made no impression so delicately fair was its complexion Ringlets of red brown hair hung to her shoulders Frankness looked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide commiseration repressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh young mouth Peter Blood caught himself staring in a sort of amazement at that piquant face which seemed here so out of place and finding his stare returned he shifted uncomfortably He grew conscious of the sorry figure that he cut Unwashed with rank and matted hair and a disfiguring black beard upon his face and the erstwhile splendid suit of black camlet in which he had been taken prisoner now reduced to rags that would have disgraced a scarecrow he was in no case for inspection by such dainty eyes as these Nevertheless they continued to inspect him with round eyed almost childlike wonder and pity Their owner put forth a hand to touch the scarlet sleeve of her companion whereupon with an ill tempered grunt the man swung his great bulk round so that he directly confronted her Looking up into his face she was speaking to him earnestly but the Colonel plainly gave her no more than the half of his attention His little beady eyes closely flanking a fleshly pendulous nose had passed from her and were fixed upon fair haired sturdy young Pitt who was standing beside Blood The Governor had also come to a halt and for a moment now that little group of three stood in conversation What the lady said Peter could not hear at all for she lowered her voice the Colonel s reached him in a confused rumble but the Governor was neither considerate nor indistinct he had a high pitched voice which carried far and believing himself witty he desired to be heard by all But my dear Colonel Bishop it is for you to take first choice from this dainty nosegay and at your own price After that we ll send the rest to auction Colonel Bishop nodded his acknowledgment He raised his voice in answering Your excellency is very good But faith they re a weedy lot not likely to be of much value in the plantation His beady eyes scanned them again and his contempt of them deepened the malevolence of his face It was as if he were annoyed with them for being in no better condition Then he beckoned forward Captain Gardner the master of the Jamaica Merchant and for some minutes stood in talk with him over a list which the latter produced at his request Presently he waved aside the list and advanced alone towards the rebels convict his eyes considering them his lips pursed Before the young Somersetshire shipmaster he came to a halt and stood an instant pondering him Then he fingered the muscles of the young man s arm and bade him open his mouth that he might see his teeth He pursed his coarse lips again and nodded He spoke to Gardner over his shoulder Fifteen pounds for this one The Captain made a face of dismay Fifteen pounds It isn t half what I meant to ask for him It is double what I had meant to give grunted the Colonel But he would be cheap at thirty pounds your honour I can get a negro for that These white swine don t live They re not fit for the labour Gardner broke into protestations of Pitt s health youth and vigour It was not a man he was discussing it was a beast of burden Pitt a sensitive lad stood mute and unmoving Only the ebb and flow of colour in his cheeks showed the inward struggle by which he maintained his self control Peter Blood was nauseated by the loathsome haggle In the background moving slowly away down the line of prisoners went the lady in conversation with the Governor who smirked and preened himself as he limped beside her She was unconscious of the loathly business the Colonel was transacting Was she wondered Blood indifferent to it Colonel Bishop swung on his heel to pass on I ll go as far as twenty pounds Not a penny more and it s twice as much as you are like to get from Crabston Captain Gardner recognizing the finality of the tone sighed and yielded Already Bishop was moving down the line For mister Blood as for a weedy youth on his left the Colonel had no more than a glance of contempt But the next man a middle aged Colossus named Wolverstone who had lost an eye at Sedgemoor drew his regard and the haggling was recommenced Peter Blood stood there in the brilliant sunshine and inhaled the fragrant air which was unlike any air that he had ever breathed It was laden with a strange perfume blend of logwood flower pimento and aromatic cedars He lost himself in unprofitable speculations born of that singular fragrance He was in no mood for conversation nor was Pitt who stood dumbly at his side and who was afflicted mainly at the moment by the thought that he was at last about to be separated from this man with whom he had stood shoulder to shoulder throughout all these troublous months and whom he had come to love and depend upon for guidance and sustenance A sense of loneliness and misery pervaded him by contrast with which all that he had endured seemed as nothing To Pitt this separation was the poignant climax of all his sufferings Other buyers came and stared at them and passed on Blood did not heed them And then at the end of the line there was a movement Gardner was speaking in a loud voice making an announcement to the general public of buyers that had waited until Colonel Bishop had taken his choice of that human merchandise As he finished Blood looking in his direction noticed that the girl was speaking to Bishop and pointing up the line with a silver hilted riding whip she carried Bishop shaded his eyes with his hand to look in the direction in which she was pointing Then slowly with his ponderous rolling gait he approached again accompanied by Gardner and followed by the lady and the Governor On they came until the Colonel was abreast of Blood He would have passed on but that the lady tapped his arm with her whip But this is the man I meant she said This one Contempt rang in the voice Peter Blood found himself staring into a pair of beady brown eyes sunk into a yellow fleshly face like currants into a dumpling He felt the colour creeping into his face under the insult of that contemptuous inspection Bah A bag of bones What should I do with him He was turning away when Gardner interposed He maybe lean but he s tough tough and healthy When half of them was sick and the other half sickening this rogue kept his legs and doctored his fellows But for him there d ha been more deaths than there was Say fifteen pounds for him Colonel That s cheap enough He s tough I tell your honour tough and strong though he be lean And he s just the man to bear the heat when it comes The climate ll never kill him There came a chuckle from Governor Steed You hear Colonel Trust your niece Her sex knows a man when it sees one And he laughed well pleased with his wit But he laughed alone A cloud of annoyance swept across the face of the Colonel s niece whilst the Colonel himself was too absorbed in the consideration of this bargain to heed the Governor s humour He twisted his lip a little stroking his chin with his hand the while Jeremy Pitt had almost ceased to breathe I ll give you ten pounds for him said the Colonel at last Peter Blood prayed that the offer might be rejected For no reason that he could have given you he was taken with repugnance at the thought of becoming the property of this gross animal and in some sort the property of that hazel eyed young girl But it would need more than repugnance to save him from his destiny A slave is a slave and has no power to shape his fate Peter Blood was sold to Colonel Bishop a disdainful buyer for the ignominious sum of ten pounds CHAPTER V ARABELLA BISHOP One sunny morning in January about a month after the arrival of the Jamaica Merchant at Bridgetown Miss Arabella Bishop rode out from her uncle s fine house on the heights to the northwest of the city She was attended by two negroes who trotted after her at a respectful distance and her destination was Government House whither she went to visit the Governor s lady who had lately been ailing Reaching the summit of a gentle grassy slope she met a tall lean man dressed in a sober gentlemanly fashion who was walking in the opposite direction He was a stranger to her and strangers were rare enough in the island And yet in some vague way he did not seem quite a stranger Miss Arabella drew rein affecting to pause that she might admire the prospect which was fair enough to warrant it Yet out of the corner of those hazel eyes she scanned this fellow very attentively as he came nearer She corrected her first impression of his dress It was sober enough but hardly gentlemanly Coat and breeches were of plain homespun and if the former sat so well upon him it was more by virtue of his natural grace than by that of tailoring His stockings were of cotton harsh and plain and the broad castor which he respectfully doffed as he came up with her was an old one unadorned by band or feather What had seemed to be a periwig at a little distance was now revealed for the man s own lustrous coiling black hair Out of a brown shaven saturnine face two eyes that were startlingly blue considered her gravely The man would have passed on but that she detained him I think I know you sir said she Her voice was crisp and boyish and there was something of boyishness in her manner if one can apply the term to so dainty a lady It arose perhaps from an ease a directness which disdained the artifices of her sex and set her on good terms with all the world To this it may be due that Miss Arabella had reached the age of five and twenty not merely unmarried but unwooed She used with all men a sisterly frankness which in itself contains a quality of aloofness rendering it difficult for any man to become her lover Her negroes had halted at some distance in the rear and they squatted now upon the short grass until it should be her pleasure to proceed upon her way The stranger came to a standstill upon being addressed A lady should know her own property said he My property Your uncle s leastways Let me present myself I am called Peter Blood and I am worth precisely ten pounds I know it because that is the sum your uncle paid for me It is not every man has the same opportunities of ascertaining his real value She recognized him then She had not seen him since that day upon the mole a month ago and that she should not instantly have known him again despite the interest he had then aroused in her is not surprising considering the change he had wrought in his appearance which now was hardly that of a slave My God said she And you can laugh It s an achievement he admitted But then I have not fared as ill as I might I have heard of that said she What she had heard was that this rebel convict had been discovered to be a physician The thing had come to the ears of Governor Steed who suffered damnably from the gout and Governor Steed had borrowed the fellow from his purchaser Whether by skill or good fortune Peter Blood had afforded the Governor that relief which his excellency had failed to obtain from the ministrations of either of the two physicians practising in Bridgetown Then the Governor s lady had desired him to attend her for the megrims mister Blood had found her suffering from nothing worse than peevishness the result of a natural petulance aggravated by the dulness of life in Barbados to a lady of her social aspirations But he had prescribed for her none the less and she had conceived herself the better for his prescription After that the fame of him had gone through Bridgetown and Colonel Bishop had found that there was more profit to be made out of this new slave by leaving him to pursue his profession than by setting him to work on the plantations for which purpose he had been originally acquired It is yourself madam I have to thank for my comparatively easy and clean condition said mister Blood and I am glad to take this opportunity of doing so The gratitude was in his words rather than in his tone Was he mocking she wondered and looked at him with the searching frankness that another might have found disconcerting He took the glance for a question and answered it If some other planter had bought me he explained it is odds that the facts of my shining abilities might never have been brought to light and I should be hewing and hoeing at this moment like the poor wretches who were landed with me And why do you thank me for that It was my uncle who bought you But he would not have done so had you not urged him I perceived your interest At the time I resented it You resented it There was a challenge in her boyish voice I have had no lack of experiences of this mortal life but to be bought and sold was a new one and I was hardly in the mood to love my purchaser If I urged you upon my uncle sir it was that I commiserated you There was a slight severity in her tone as if to reprove the mixture of mockery and flippancy in which he seemed to be speaking She proceeded to explain herself My uncle may appear to you a hard man No doubt he is They are all hard men these planters It is the life I suppose But there are others here who are worse There is mister Crabston for instance up at Speightstown He was there on the mole waiting to buy my uncle s leavings and if you had fallen into his hands A dreadful man That is why He was a little bewildered This interest in a stranger he began Then changed the direction of his probe But there were others as deserving of commiseration You did not seem quite like the others I am not said he Oh She stared at him bridling a little You have a good opinion of yourself On the contrary The others are all worthy rebels I am not That is the difference I was one who had not the wit to see that England requires purifying I was content to pursue a doctor s trade in Bridgewater whilst my betters were shedding their blood to drive out an unclean tyrant and his rascally crew Sir she checked him I think you are talking treason I hope I am not obscure said he There are those here who would have you flogged if they heard you The Governor would never allow it He has the gout and his lady has the megrims Do you depend upon that She was frankly scornful You have certainly never had the gout probably not even the megrims said he She made a little impatient movement with her hand and looked away from him a moment out to sea Quite suddenly she looked at him again and now her brows were knit But if you are not a rebel how come you here He saw the thing she apprehended and he laughed Faith now it s a long story said he And one perhaps that you would prefer not to tell Briefly on that he told it her My God What an infamy she cried when he had done Oh it s a sweet country England under King James There s no need to commiserate me further All things considered I prefer Barbados Here at least one can believe in God He looked first to right then to left as he spoke from the distant shadowy bulk of Mount Hillbay to the limitless ocean ruffled by the winds of heaven Then as if the fair prospect rendered him conscious of his own littleness and the insignificance of his woes he fell thoughtful Is that so difficult elsewhere she asked him and she was very grave Men make it so I see She laughed a little on a note of sadness it seemed to him I have never deemed Barbados the earthly mirror of heaven she confessed But no doubt you know your world better than I She touched her horse with her little silver hilted whip I congratulate you on this easing of your misfortunes He bowed and she moved on Her negroes sprang up and went trotting after her Awhile Peter Blood remained standing there where she left him conning the sunlit waters of Carlisle Bay below and the shipping in that spacious haven about which the gulls were fluttering noisily It was a fair enough prospect he reflected but it was a prison and in announcing that he preferred it to England he had indulged that almost laudable form of boasting which lies in belittling our misadventures He turned and resuming his way went off in long swinging strides towards the little huddle of huts built of mud and wattles a miniature village enclosed in a stockade which the plantation slaves inhabited and where he himself was lodged with them Through his mind sang the line of Lovelace Stone walls do not a prison make Nor iron bars a cage But he gave it a fresh meaning the very converse of that which its author had intended A prison he reflected was a prison though it had neither walls nor bars however spacious it might be And as he realized it that morning so he was to realize it increasingly as time sped on Daily he came to think more of his clipped wings of his exclusion from the world and less of the fortuitous liberty he enjoyed Nor did the contrasting of his comparatively easy lot with that of his unfortunate fellow convicts bring him the satisfaction a differently constituted mind might have derived from it Rather did the contemplation of their misery increase the bitterness that was gathering in his soul Of the forty two who had been landed with him from the Jamaica Merchant Colonel Bishop had purchased no less than twenty five The remainder had gone to lesser planters some of them to Speightstown and others still farther north What may have been the lot of the latter he could not tell but amongst Bishop s slaves Peter Blood came and went freely sleeping in their quarters and their lot he knew to be a brutalizing misery They toiled in the sugar plantations from sunrise to sunset and if their labours flagged there were the whips of the overseer and his men to quicken them They went in rags some almost naked they dwelt in squalor and they were ill nourished on salted meat and maize dumplings food which to many of them was for a season at least so nauseating that two of them sickened and died before Bishop remembered that their lives had a certain value in labour to him and yielded to Blood s intercessions for a better care of such as fell ill To curb insubordination one of them who had rebelled against Kent the brutal overseer was lashed to death by negroes under his comrades eyes and another who had been so misguided as to run away into the woods was tracked brought back flogged and then branded on the forehead with the letters F T that all might know him for a fugitive traitor as long as he lived Fortunately for him the poor fellow died as a consequence of the flogging After that a dull spiritless resignation settled down upon the remainder The most mutinous were quelled and accepted their unspeakable lot with the tragic fortitude of despair Peter Blood alone escaping these excessive sufferings remained outwardly unchanged whilst inwardly the only change in him was a daily deeper hatred of his kind a daily deeper longing to escape from this place where man defiled so foully the lovely work of his Creator It was a longing too vague to amount to a hope Hope here was inadmissible And yet he did not yield to despair He set a mask of laughter on his saturnine countenance and went his way treating the sick to the profit of Colonel Bishop and encroaching further and further upon the preserves of the two other men of medicine in Bridgetown Immune from the degrading punishments and privations of his fellow convicts he was enabled to keep his self respect and was treated without harshness even by the soulless planter to whom he had been sold He owed it all to gout and megrims He had won the esteem of Governor Steed and what is even more important of Governor Steed s lady whom he shamelessly and cynically flattered and humoured Occasionally he saw Miss Bishop and they seldom met but that she paused to hold him in conversation for some moments evincing her interest in him Himself he was never disposed to linger He was not he told himself to be deceived by her delicate exterior her sapling grace her easy boyish ways and pleasant boyish voice In all his life and it had been very varied he had never met a man whom he accounted more beastly than her uncle and he could not dissociate her from the man She was his niece of his own blood and some of the vices of it some of the remorseless cruelty of the wealthy planter must he argued inhabit that pleasant body of hers He argued this very often to himself as if answering and convincing some instinct that pleaded otherwise and arguing it he avoided her when it was possible and was frigidly civil when it was not Justifiable as his reasoning was plausible as it may seem yet he would have done better to have trusted the instinct that was in conflict with it Though the same blood ran in her veins as in those of Colonel Bishop yet hers was free of the vices that tainted her uncle s for these vices were not natural to that blood they were in his case acquired Her father Tom Bishop that same Colonel Bishop s brother had been a kindly chivalrous gentle soul who broken hearted by the early death of a young wife had abandoned the Old World and sought an anodyne for his grief in the New He had come out to the Antilles bringing with him his little daughter then five years of age and had given himself up to the life of a planter He had prospered from the first as men sometimes will who care nothing for prosperity Prospering he had bethought him of his younger brother a soldier at home reputed somewhat wild He had advised him to come out to Barbados and the advice which at another season William Bishop might have scorned reached him at a moment when his wildness was beginning to bear such fruit that a change of climate was desirable William came and was admitted by his generous brother to a partnership in the prosperous plantation Some six years later when Arabella was fifteen her father died leaving her in her uncle s guardianship It was perhaps his one mistake But the goodness of his own nature coloured his views of other men moreover himself he had conducted the education of his daughter giving her an independence of character upon which perhaps he counted unduly As things were there was little love between uncle and niece But she was dutiful to him and he was circumspect in his behaviour before her All his life and for all his wildness he had gone in a certain awe of his brother whose worth he had the wit to recognize and now it was almost as if some of that awe was transferred to his brother s child who was also in a sense his partner although she took no active part in the business of the plantations Peter Blood judged her as we are all too prone to judge upon insufficient knowledge He was very soon to have cause to correct that judgment One day towards the end of May when the heat was beginning to grow oppressive there crawled into Carlisle Bay a wounded battered English ship the Pride of Devon her freeboard scarred and broken her coach a gaping wreck her mizzen so shot away that only a jagged stump remained to tell the place where it had stood She had been in action off Martinique with two Spanish treasure ships and although her captain swore that the Spaniards had beset him without provocation it is difficult to avoid a suspicion that the encounter had been brought about quite otherwise One of the Spaniards had fled from the combat and if the Pride of Devon had not given chase it was probably because she was by then in no case to do so The other had been sunk but not before the English ship had transferred to her own hold a good deal of the treasure aboard the Spaniard It was in fact one of those piratical affrays which were a perpetual source of trouble between the courts of saint James s and the Escurial complaints emanating now from one and now from the other side Steed however after the fashion of most Colonial governors was willing enough to dull his wits to the extent of accepting the English seaman s story disregarding any evidence that might belie it He shared the hatred so richly deserved by arrogant overbearing Spain that was common to men of every other nation from the Bahamas to the Main Therefore he gave the Pride of Devon the shelter she sought in his harbour and every facility to careen and carry out repairs But before it came to this they fetched from her hold over a score of English seamen as battered and broken as the ship herself and together with these some half dozen Spaniards in like case the only survivors of a boarding party from the Spanish galleon that had invaded the English ship and found itself unable to retreat These wounded men were conveyed to a long shed on the wharf and the medical skill of Bridgetown was summoned to their aid Peter Blood was ordered to bear a hand in this work and partly because he spoke Castilian and he spoke it as fluently as his own native tongue partly because of his inferior condition as a slave he was given the Spaniards for his patients Now Blood had no cause to love Spaniards His two years in a Spanish prison and his subsequent campaigning in the Spanish Netherlands had shown him a side of the Spanish character which he had found anything but admirable Nevertheless he performed his doctor s duties zealously and painstakingly if emotionlessly and even with a certain superficial friendliness towards each of his patients These were so surprised at having their wounds healed instead of being summarily hanged that they manifested a docility very unusual in their kind They were shunned however by all those charitably disposed inhabitants of Bridgetown who flocked to the improvised hospital with gifts of fruit and flowers and delicacies for the injured English seamen Indeed had the wishes of some of these inhabitants been regarded the Spaniards would have been left to die like vermin and of this Peter Blood had an example almost at the very outset With the assistance of one of the negroes sent to the shed for the purpose he was in the act of setting a broken leg when a deep gruff voice that he had come to know and dislike as he had never disliked the voice of living man abruptly challenged him What are you doing there Blood did not look up from his task There was not the need He knew the voice as I have said I am setting a broken leg he answered without pausing in his labours I can see that fool A bulky body interposed between Peter Blood and the window The half naked man on the straw rolled his black eyes to stare up fearfully out of a clay coloured face at this intruder A knowledge of English was unnecessary to inform him that here came an enemy The harsh minatory note of that voice sufficiently expressed the fact I can see that fool just as I can see what the rascal is Who gave you leave to set Spanish legs I am a doctor Colonel Bishop The man is wounded It is not for me to discriminate I keep to my trade Do you by God If you d done that you wouldn t now be here On the contrary it is because I did it that I am here Aye I know that s your lying tale The Colonel sneered and then observing Blood to continue his work unmoved he grew really angry Will you cease that and attend to me when I am speaking Peter Blood paused but only for an instant The man is in pain he said shortly and resumed his work In pain is he I hope he is the damned piratical dog But will you heed me you insubordinate knave The Colonel delivered himself in a roar infuriated by what he conceived to be defiance and defiance expressing itself in the most unruffled disregard of himself His long bamboo cane was raised to strike Peter Blood s blue eyes caught the flash of it and he spoke quickly to arrest the blow Not insubordinate sir whatever I may be I am acting upon the express orders of Governor Steed The Colonel checked his great face empurpling His mouth fell open Governor Steed he echoed Then he lowered his cane swung round and without another word to Blood rolled away towards the other end of the shed where the Governor was standing at the moment Peter Blood chuckled But his triumph was dictated less by humanitarian considerations than by the reflection that he had baulked his brutal owner The Spaniard realizing that in this altercation whatever its nature the doctor had stood his friend ventured in a muted voice to ask him what had happened But the doctor shook his head in silence and pursued his work His ears were straining to catch the words now passing between Steed and Bishop The Colonel was blustering and storming the great bulk of him towering above the wizened little overdressed figure of the Governor But the little fop was not to be browbeaten His excellency was conscious that he had behind him the force of public opinion to support him Some there might be but they were not many who held such ruthless views as Colonel Bishop His excellency asserted his authority It was by his orders that Blood had devoted himself to the wounded Spaniards and his orders were to be carried out There was no more to be said Colonel Bishop was of another opinion In his view there was a great deal to be said He said it with great circumstance loudly vehemently obscenely for he could be fluently obscene when moved to anger You talk like a Spaniard Colonel said the Governor and thus dealt the Colonel s pride a wound that was to smart resentfully for many a week At the moment it struck him silent and sent him stamping out of the shed in a rage for which he could find no words It was two days later when the ladies of Bridgetown the wives and daughters of her planters and merchants paid their first visit of charity to the wharf bringing their gifts to the wounded seamen Again Peter Blood was there ministering to the sufferers in his care moving among those unfortunate Spaniards whom no one heeded All the charity all the gifts were for the members of the crew of the Pride of Devon And this Peter Blood accounted natural enough But rising suddenly from the re dressing of a wound a task in which he had been absorbed for some moments he saw to his surprise that one lady detached from the general throng was placing some plantains and a bundle of succulent sugar cane on the cloak that served one of his patients for a coverlet She was elegantly dressed in lavender silk and was followed by a half naked negro carrying a basket Peter Blood stripped of his coat the sleeves of his coarse shirt rolled to the elbow and holding a bloody rag in his hand stood at gaze a moment The lady turning now to confront him her lips parting in a smile of recognition was Arabella Bishop The man s a Spaniard said he in the tone of one who corrects a misapprehension and also tinged never so faintly by something of the derision that was in his soul The smile with which she had been greeting him withered on her lips She frowned and stared at him a moment with increasing haughtiness So I perceive But he s a human being none the less said she That answer and its implied rebuke took him by surprise Your uncle the Colonel is of a different opinion said he when he had recovered He regards them as vermin to be left to languish and die of their festering wounds She caught the irony now more plainly in his voice She continued to stare at him Why do you tell me this To warn you that you may be incurring the Colonel s displeasure If he had had his way I should never have been allowed to dress their wounds And you thought of course that I must be of my uncle s mind There was a crispness about her voice an ominous challenging sparkle in her hazel eyes I d not willingly be rude to a lady even in my thoughts said he But that you should bestow gifts on them considering that if your uncle came to hear of it He paused leaving the sentence unfinished Ah well there it is he concluded But the lady was not satisfied at all First you impute to me inhumanity and then cowardice Faith For a man who would not willingly be rude to a lady even in his thoughts it s none so bad Her boyish laugh trilled out but the note of it jarred his ears this time He saw her now it seemed to him for the first time and saw how he had misjudged her Sure now how was I to guess that that Colonel Bishop could have an angel for his niece said he recklessly for he was reckless as men often are in sudden penitence You wouldn t of course I shouldn t think you often guess aright Having withered him with that and her glance she turned to her negro and the basket that he carried From this she lifted now the fruits and delicacies with which it was laden and piled them in such heaps upon the beds of the six Spaniards that by the time she had so served the last of them her basket was empty and there was nothing left for her own fellow countrymen These indeed stood in no need of her bounty as she no doubt observed since they were being plentifully supplied by others Having thus emptied her basket she called her negro and without another word or so much as another glance at Peter Blood swept out of the place with her head high and chin thrust forward Peter watched her departure Then he fetched a sigh It startled him to discover that the thought that he had incurred her anger gave him concern It could not have been so yesterday It became so only since he had been vouchsafed this revelation of her true nature Bad cess to it now it serves me right It seems I know nothing at all of human nature But how the devil was I to guess that a family that can breed a devil like Colonel Bishop should also breed a saint like this CHAPTER VI PLANS OF ESCAPE After that Arabella Bishop went daily to the shed on the wharf with gifts of fruit and later of money and of wearing apparel for the Spanish prisoners But she contrived so to time her visits that Peter Blood never again met her there Also his own visits were growing shorter in a measure as his patients healed That they all throve and returned to health under his care whilst fully one third of the wounded in the care of Whacker and Bronson the two other surgeons died of their wounds served to increase the reputation in which this rebel convict stood in Bridgetown It may have been no more than the fortune of war But the townsfolk did not choose so to regard it It led to a further dwindling of the practices of his free colleagues and a further increase of his own labours and his owner s profit Whacker and Bronson laid their heads together to devise a scheme by which this intolerable state of things should be brought to an end But that is to anticipate One day whether by accident or design Peter Blood came striding down the wharf a full half hour earlier than usual and so met Miss Bishop just issuing from the shed He doffed his hat and stood aside to give her passage She took it chin in the air and eyes which disdained to look anywhere where the sight of him was possible Miss Arabella said he on a coaxing pleading note She grew conscious of his presence and looked him over with an air that was faintly mockingly searching La said she It s the delicate minded gentleman Peter groaned Am I so hopelessly beyond forgiveness I ask it very humbly What condescension It is cruel to mock me said he and adopted mock humility After all I am but a slave And you might be ill one of these days What then It would be humiliating to send for me if you treat me like an enemy You are not the only doctor in Bridgetown But I am the least dangerous She grew suddenly suspicious of him aware that he was permitting himself to rally her and in a measure she had already yielded to it She stiffened and looked him over again You make too free I think she rebuked him A doctor s privilege I am not your patient Please to remember it in future And on that unquestionably angry she departed Now is she a vixen or am I a fool or is it both he asked the blue vault of heaven and then went into the shed It was to be a morning of excitements As he was leaving an hour or so later Whacker the younger of the other two physicians joined him an unprecedented condescension this for hitherto neither of them had addressed him beyond an occasional and surly good day If you are for Colonel Bishop s I ll walk with you a little way Doctor Blood said he He was a short broad man of five and forty with pendulous cheeks and hard blue eyes Peter Blood was startled But he dissembled it I am for Government House said he Ah To be sure The Governor s lady And he laughed or perhaps he sneered Peter Blood was not quite certain She encroaches a deal upon your time I hear Youth and good looks Doctor Blood Youth and good looks They are inestimable advantages in our profession as in others particularly where the ladies are concerned Peter stared at him If you mean what you seem to mean you had better say it to Governor Steed It may amuse him You surely misapprehend me I hope so You re so very hot now The doctor linked his arm through Peter s I protest I desire to be your friend to serve you Now listen Instinctively his voice grew lower This slavery in which you find yourself must be singularly irksome to a man of parts such as yourself What intuitions cried sardonic mister Blood But the doctor took him literally I am no fool my dear doctor I know a man when I see one and often I can tell his thoughts If you can tell me mine you ll persuade me of it said mister Blood doctor Whacker drew still closer to him as they stepped along the wharf He lowered his voice to a still more confidential tone His hard blue eyes peered up into the swart sardonic face of his companion who was a head taller than himself How often have I not seen you staring out over the sea your soul in your eyes Don t I know what you are thinking If you could escape from this hell of slavery you could exercise the profession of which you are an ornament as a free man with pleasure and profit to yourself The world is large There are many nations besides England where a man of your parts would be warmly welcomed There are many colonies besides these English ones Lower still came the voice until it was no more than a whisper Yet there was no one within earshot It is none so far now to the Dutch settlement of Curacao At this time of the year the voyage may safely be undertaken in a light craft And Curacao need be no more than a stepping stone to the great world which would lie open to you once you were delivered from this bondage doctor Whacker ceased He was pale and a little out of breath But his hard eyes continued to study his impassive companion Well he said alter a pause What do you say to that Yet Blood did not immediately answer His mind was heaving in tumult and he was striving to calm it that he might take a proper survey of this thing flung into it to create so monstrous a disturbance He began where another might have ended I have no money And for that a handsome sum would be necessary Did I not say that I desired to be your friend Why asked Peter Blood at point blank range But he never heeded the answer Whilst doctor Whacker was professing that his heart bled for a brother doctor languishing in slavery denied the opportunity which his gifts entitled him to make for himself Peter Blood pounced like a hawk upon the obvious truth Whacker and his colleague desired to be rid of one who threatened to ruin them Sluggishness of decision was never a fault of Blood s He leapt where another crawled And so this thought of evasion never entertained until planted there now by doctor Whacker sprouted into instant growth I see I see he said whilst his companion was still talking explaining and to save doctor Whacker s face he played the hypocrite It is very noble in you very brotherly as between men of medicine It is what I myself should wish to do in like case The hard eyes flashed the husky voice grew tremulous as the other asked almost too eagerly You agree then You agree Agree Blood laughed If I should be caught and brought back they d clip my wings and brand me for life Surely the thing is worth a little risk More tremulous than ever was the tempter s voice Surely Blood agreed But it asks more than courage It asks money A sloop might be bought for twenty pounds perhaps It shall be forthcoming It shall be a loan which you shall repay us repay me when you can That betraying us so hastily retrieved completed Blood s understanding The other doctor was also in the business They were approaching the peopled part of the mole Quickly but eloquently Blood expressed his thanks where he knew that no thanks were due We will talk of this again sir to morrow he concluded You have opened for me the gates of hope In that at least he tittered no more than the bare truth and expressed it very baldly It was indeed as if a door had been suddenly flung open to the sunlight for escape from a dark prison in which a man had thought to spend his life He was in haste now to be alone to straighten out his agitated mind and plan coherently what was to be done Also he must consult another Already he had hit upon that other For such a voyage a navigator would be necessary and a navigator was ready to his hand in Jeremy Pitt The first thing was to take counsel with the young shipmaster who must be associated with him in this business if it were to be undertaken All that day his mind was in turmoil with this new hope and he was sick with impatience for night and a chance to discuss the matter with his chosen partner As a result Blood was betimes that evening in the spacious stockade that enclosed the huts of the slaves together with the big white house of the overseer and he found an opportunity of a few words with Pitt unobserved by the others To night when all are asleep come to my cabin I have something to say to you The young man stared at him roused by Blood s pregnant tone out of the mental lethargy into which he had of late been lapsing as a result of the dehumanizing life he lived Then he nodded understanding and assent and they moved apart The six months of plantation life in Barbados had made an almost tragic mark upon the young seaman His erstwhile bright alertness was all departed His face was growing vacuous his eyes were dull and lack lustre and he moved in a cringing furtive manner like an over beaten dog He had survived the ill nourishment the excessive work on the sugar plantation under a pitiless sun the lashes of the overseer s whip when his labours flagged and the deadly unrelieved animal life to which he was condemned But the price he was paying for survival was the usual price He was in danger of becoming no better than an animal of sinking to the level of the negroes who sometimes toiled beside him The man however was still there not yet dormant but merely torpid from a surfeit of despair and the man in him promptly shook off that torpidity and awoke at the first words Blood spoke to him that night awoke and wept Escape he panted O God He took his head in his hands and fell to sobbing like a child Sh Steady now Steady Blood admonished him in a whisper alarmed by the lad s blubbering He crossed to Pitt s side and set a restraining hand upon his shoulder For God s sake command yourself If we re overheard we shall both be flogged for this Among the privileges enjoyed by Blood was that of a hut to himself and they were alone in this But after all it was built of wattles thinly plastered with mud and its door was composed of bamboos through which sound passed very easily Though the stockade was locked for the night and all within it asleep by now it was after midnight yet a prowling overseer was not impossible and a sound of voices must lead to discovery Pitt realized this and controlled his outburst of emotion Sitting close thereafter they talked in whispers for an hour or more and all the while those dulled wits of Pitt s were sharpening themselves anew upon this precious whetstone of hope They would need to recruit others into their enterprise a half dozen at least a half score if possible but no more than that They must pick the best out of that score of survivors of the Monmouth men that Colonel Bishop had acquired Men who understood the sea were desirable But of these there were only two in that unfortunate gang and their knowledge was none too full They were Hagthorpe a gentleman who had served in the Royal Navy and Nicholas Dyke who had been a petty officer in the late king s time and there was another who had been a gunner a man named Ogle It was agreed before they parted that Pitt should begin with these three and then proceed to recruit some six or eight others He was to move with the utmost caution sounding his men very carefully before making anything in the nature of a disclosure and even then avoid rendering that disclosure so full that its betrayal might frustrate the plans which as yet had to be worked out in detail Labouring with them in the plantations Pitt would not want for opportunities of broaching the matter to his fellow slaves Caution above everything was Blood s last recommendation to him at parting Who goes slowly goes safely as the Italians have it And remember that if you betray yourself you ruin all for you are the only navigator amongst us and without you there is no escaping Pitt reassured him and slunk off back to his own hut and the straw that served him for a bed Coming next morning to the wharf Blood found doctor Whacker in a generous mood Having slept on the matter he was prepared to advance the convict any sum up to thirty pounds that would enable him to acquire a boat capable of taking him away from the settlement Blood expressed his thanks becomingly betraying no sign that he saw clearly into the true reason of the other s munificence It s not money I ll require said he but the boat itself For who will be selling me a boat and incurring the penalties in Governor Steed s proclamation Ye ll have read it no doubt doctor Whacker s heavy face grew overcast Thoughtfully he rubbed his chin I ve read it yes And I dare not procure the boat for you It would be discovered It must be And the penalty is a fine of two hundred pounds besides imprisonment It would ruin me You ll see that The high hopes in Blood s soul began to shrink And the shadow of his despair overcast his face But then he faltered There is nothing to be done Nay nay things are not so desperate doctor Whacker smiled a little with tight lips I ve thought of it You will see that the man who buys the boat must be one of those who goes with you so that he is not here to answer questions afterwards But who is to go with me save men in my own case What I cannot do they cannot There are others detained on the island besides slaves There are several who are here for debt and would be glad enough to spread their wings There s a fellow Nuttall now who follows the trade of a shipwright whom I happen to know would welcome such a chance as you might afford him But how should a debtor come with money to buy a boat The question will be asked To be sure it will But if you contrive shrewdly you ll all be gone before that happens Blood nodded understanding and the doctor setting a hand upon his sleeve unfolded the scheme he had conceived You shall have the money from me at once Having received it you ll forget that it was I who supplied it to you You have friends in England relatives perhaps who sent it out to you through the agency of one of your Bridgetown patients whose name as a man of honour you will on no account divulge lest you bring trouble upon him That is your tale if there are questions He paused looking hard at Blood Blood nodded understanding and assent Relieved the doctor continued But there should be no questions if you go carefully to work You concert matters with Nuttall You enlist him as one of your companions and a shipwright should be a very useful member of your crew You engage him to discover a likely sloop whose owner is disposed to sell Then let your preparations all be made before the purchase is effected so that your escape may follow instantly upon it before the inevitable questions come to be asked You take me So well did Blood take him that within an hour he contrived to see Nuttall and found the fellow as disposed to the business as doctor Whacker had predicted When he left the shipwright it was agreed that Nuttall should seek the boat required for which Blood would at once produce the money The quest took longer than was expected by Blood who waited impatiently with the doctor s gold concealed about his person But at the end of some three weeks Nuttall whom he was now meeting daily informed him that he had found a serviceable wherry and that its owner was disposed to sell it for twenty two pounds That evening on the beach remote from all eyes Peter Blood handed that sum to his new associate and Nuttall went off with instructions to complete the purchase late on the following day He was to bring the boat to the wharf where under cover of night Blood and his fellow convicts would join him and make off Everything was ready In the shed from which all the wounded men had now been removed and which had since remained untenanted Nuttall had concealed the necessary stores a hundredweight of bread a quantity of cheese a cask of water and some few bottles of Canary a compass quadrant chart half hour glass log and line a tarpaulin some carpenter s tools and a lantern and candles And in the stockade all was likewise in readiness Hagthorpe Dyke and Ogle had agreed to join the venture and eight others had been carefully recruited In Pitt s hut which he shared with five other rebels convict all of whom were to join in this bid for liberty a ladder had been constructed in secret during those nights of waiting With this they were to surmount the stockade and gain the open The risk of detection so that they made little noise was negligible Beyond locking them all into that stockade at night there was no great precaution taken Where after all could any so foolish as to attempt escape hope to conceal himself in that island The chief risk lay in discovery by those of their companions who were to be left behind It was because of these that they must go cautiously and in silence The day that was to have been their last in Barbados was a day of hope and anxiety to the twelve associates in that enterprise no less than to Nuttall in the town below Towards sunset having seen Nuttall depart to purchase and fetch the sloop to the prearranged moorings at the wharf Peter Blood came sauntering towards the stockade just as the slaves were being driven in from the fields He stood aside at the entrance to let them pass and beyond the message of hope flashed by his eyes he held no communication with them He entered the stockade in their wake and as they broke their ranks to seek their various respective huts he beheld Colonel Bishop in talk with Kent the overseer The pair were standing by the stocks planted in the middle of that green space for the punishment of offending slaves As he advanced Bishop turned to regard him scowling Where have you been this while he bawled and although a minatory note was normal to the Colonel s voice yet Blood felt his heart tightening apprehensively I ve been at my work in the town he answered missus Patch has a fever and mister Dekker has sprained his ankle I sent for you to Dekker s and you were not there You are given to idling my fine fellow We shall have to quicken you one of these days unless you cease from abusing the liberty you enjoy D ye forget that ye re a rebel convict I am not given the chance said Blood who never could learn to curb his tongue By God Will you be pert with me Remembering all that was at stake growing suddenly conscious that from the huts surrounding the enclosure anxious ears were listening he instantly practised an unusual submission Not pert sir I I am sorry I should have been sought Aye and you ll be sorrier yet There s the Governor with an attack of gout screaming like a wounded horse and you nowhere to be found Be off man away with you at speed to Government House You re awaited I tell you Best lend him a horse Kent or the lout ll be all night getting there They bustled him away choking almost from a reluctance that he dared not show The thing was unfortunate but after all not beyond remedy The escape was set for midnight and he should easily be back by then He mounted the horse that Kent procured him intending to make all haste How shall I reenter the stockade sir he enquired at parting You ll not reenter it said Bishop When they ve done with you at Government House they may find a kennel for you there until morning Peter Blood s heart sank like a stone through water But he began Be off I say Will you stand there talking until dark His excellency is waiting for you And with his cane Colonel Bishop slashed the horse s quarters so brutally that the beast bounded forward all but unseating her rider Peter Blood went off in a state of mind bordering on despair And there was occasion for it A postponement of the escape at least until to morrow night was necessary now and postponement must mean the discovery of Nuttall s transaction and the asking of questions it would be difficult to answer It was in his mind to slink back in the night once his work at Government House were done and from the outside of the stockade make known to Pitt and the others his presence and so have them join him that their project might still be carried out But in this he reckoned without the Governor whom he found really in the thrall of a severe attack of gout and almost as severe an attack of temper nourished by Blood s delay The doctor was kept in constant attendance upon him until long after midnight when at last he was able to ease the sufferer a little by a bleeding Thereupon he would have withdrawn But Steed would not hear of it Blood must sleep in his own chamber to be at hand in case of need It was as if Fate made sport of him For that night at least the escape must be definitely abandoned Not until the early hours of the morning did Peter Blood succeed in making a temporary escape from Government House on the ground that he required certain medicaments which he must himself procure from the apothecary On that pretext he made an excursion into the awakening town and went straight to Nuttall whom he found in a state of livid panic The unfortunate debtor who had sat up waiting through the night conceived that all was discovered and that his own ruin would be involved Peter Blood quieted his fears It will be for to night instead he said with more assurance than he felt if I have to bleed the Governor to death Be ready as last night But if there are questions meanwhile bleated Nuttall He was a thin pale small featured man with weak eyes that now blinked desperately Answer as best you can Use your wits man I can stay no longer And Peter went off to the apothecary for his pretexted drugs Within an hour of his going came an officer of the Secretary s to Nuttall s miserable hovel The seller of the boat had as by law required since the coming of the rebels convict duly reported the sale at the Secretary s office so that he might obtain the reimbursement of the ten pound surety into which every keeper of a small boat was compelled to enter The Secretary s office postponed this reimbursement until it should have obtained confirmation of the transaction We are informed that you have bought a wherry from mister Robert Farrell said the officer That is so said Nuttall who conceived that for him this was the end of the world You are in no haste it seems to declare the same at the Secretary s office The emissary had a proper bureaucratic haughtiness Nuttall s weak eyes blinked at a redoubled rate To to declare it Ye know it s the law I I didn t may it please you But it s in the proclamation published last January I I can t read sir I I didn t know Faugh The messenger withered him with his disdain Well now you re informed See to it that you are at the Secretary s office before noon with the ten pounds surety into which you are obliged to enter The pompous officer departed leaving Nuttall in a cold perspiration despite the heat of the morning He was thankful that the fellow had not asked the question he most dreaded which was how he a debtor should come by the money to buy a wherry But this he knew was only a respite The question would presently be asked of a certainty and then hell would open for him He cursed the hour in which he had been such a fool as to listen to Peter Blood s chatter of escape He thought it very likely that the whole plot would be discovered and that he would probably be hanged or at least branded and sold into slavery like those other damned rebels convict with whom he had been so mad as to associate himself If only he had the ten pounds for this infernal surety which until this moment had never entered into their calculations it was possible that the thing might be done quickly and questions postponed until later As the Secretary s messenger had overlooked the fact that he was a debtor so might the others at the Secretary s office at least for a day or two and in that time he would he hoped be beyond the reach of their questions But in the meantime what was to be done about this money And it was to be found before noon Nuttall snatched up his hat and went out in quest of Peter Blood But where look for him Wandering aimlessly up the irregular unpaved street he ventured to enquire of one or two if they had seen doctor Blood that morning He affected to be feeling none so well and indeed his appearance bore out the deception None could give him information and since Blood had never told him of Whacker s share in this business he walked in his unhappy ignorance past the door of the one man in Barbados who would eagerly have saved him in this extremity Finally he determined to go up to Colonel Bishop s plantation Probably Blood would be there If he were not Nuttall would find Pitt and leave a message with him He was acquainted with Pitt and knew of Pitt s share in this business His pretext for seeking Blood must still be that he needed medical assistance And at the same time that he set out insensitive in his anxiety to the broiling heat to climb the heights to the north of the town Blood was setting out from Government House at last having so far eased the Governor s condition as to be permitted to depart Being mounted he would but for an unexpected delay have reached the stockade ahead of Nuttall in which case several unhappy events might have been averted The unexpected delay was occasioned by Miss Arabella Bishop They met at the gate of the luxuriant garden of Government House and Miss Bishop herself mounted stared to see Peter Blood on horseback It happened that he was in good spirits The fact that the Governor s condition had so far improved as to restore him his freedom of movement had sufficed to remove the depression under which he had been labouring for the past twelve hours and more In its rebound the mercury of his mood had shot higher far than present circumstances warranted He was disposed to be optimistic What had failed last night would certainly not fail again to night What was a day after all The Secretary s office might be troublesome but not really troublesome for another twenty four hours at least and by then they would be well away This joyous confidence of his was his first misfortune The next was that his good spirits were also shared by Miss Bishop and that she bore no rancour The two things conjoined to make the delay that in its consequences was so deplorable Good morning sir she hailed him pleasantly It s close upon a month since last I saw you Twenty one days to the hour said he I ve counted them I vow I was beginning to believe you dead I have to thank you for the wreath The wreath To deck my grave he explained Must you ever be rallying she wondered and looked at him gravely remembering that it was his rallying on the last occasion had driven her away in dudgeon A man must sometimes laugh at himself or go mad said he Few realize it That is why there are so many madmen in the world You may laugh at yourself all you will sir But sometimes I think you laugh at me which is not civil Then faith you re wrong I laugh only at the comic and you are not comic at all What am I then she asked him laughing A moment he pondered her so fair and fresh to behold so entirely maidenly and yet so entirely frank and unabashed You are he said the niece of the man who owns me his slave But he spoke lightly So lightly that she was encouraged to insistence Nay sir that is an evasion You shall answer me truthfully this morning Truthfully To answer you at all is a labour But to answer truthfully Oh well now I should say of you that he ll be lucky who counts you his friend It was in his mind to add more But he left it there That s mighty civil said she You ve a nice taste in compliments mister Blood Another in your place Faith now don t I know what another would have said Don t I know my fellow man at all Sometimes I think you do and sometimes I think you don t Anyway you don t know your fellow woman There was that affair of the Spaniards Will ye never forget it Never Bad cess to your memory Is there no good in me at all that you could be dwelling on instead Oh several things For instance now He was almost eager You speak excellent Spanish Is that all He sank back into dismay Where did you learn it Have you been in Spain That I have I was two years in a Spanish prison In prison Her tone suggested apprehensions in which he had no desire to leave her As a prisoner of war he explained I was taken fighting with the French in French service that is But you re a doctor she cried That s merely a diversion I think By trade I am a soldier at least it s a trade I followed for ten years It brought me no great gear but it served me better than medicine which as you may observe has brought me into slavery I m thinking it s more pleasing in the sight of Heaven to kill men than to heal them Sure it must be But how came you to be a soldier and to serve the French I am Irish you see and I studied medicine Therefore since it s a perverse nation we are Oh but it s a long story and the Colonel will be expecting my return She was not in that way to be defrauded of her entertainment If he would wait a moment they would ride back together She had but come to enquire of the Governor s health at her uncle s request So he waited and so they rode back together to Colonel Bishop s house They rode very slowly at a walking pace and some whom they passed marvelled to see the doctor slave on such apparently intimate terms with his owner s niece One or two may have promised themselves that they would drop a hint to the Colonel But the two rode oblivious of all others in the world that morning He was telling her the story of his early turbulent days and at the end of it he dwelt more fully than hitherto upon the manner of his arrest and trial The tale was barely done when they drew up at the Colonel s door and dismounted Peter Blood surrendering his nag to one of the negro grooms who informed them that the Colonel was from home at the moment Even then they lingered a moment she detaining him I am sorry mister Blood that I did not know before she said and there was a suspicion of moisture in those clear hazel eyes With a compelling friendliness she held out her hand to him Why what difference could it have made he asked Some I think You have been very hardly used by Fate Och now He paused His keen sapphire eyes considered her steadily a moment from under his level black brows It might have been worse he said with a significance which brought a tinge of colour to her cheeks and a flutter to her eyelids He stooped to kiss her hand before releasing it and she did not deny him Then he turned and strode off towards the stockade a half mile away and a vision of her face went with him tinted with a rising blush and a sudden unusual shyness He forgot in that little moment that he was a rebel convict with ten years of slavery before him he forgot that he had planned an escape which was to be carried into effect that night forgot even the peril of discovery which as a result of the Governor s gout now overhung him CHAPTER VII PIRATES mister James Nuttall made all speed regardless of the heat in his journey from Bridgetown to Colonel Bishop s plantation and if ever man was built for speed in a hot climate that man was mister James Nuttall with his short thin body and his long fleshless legs So withered was he that it was hard to believe there were any juices left in him yet juices there must have been for he was sweating violently by the time he reached the stockade At the entrance he almost ran into the overseer Kent a squat bow legged animal with the arms of a Hercules and the jowl of a bulldog I am seeking Doctor Blood he announced breathlessly You are in a rare haste growled Kent What the devil is it Twins Eh Oh Nay nay I m not married sir It s a cousin of mine sir What is He is taken bad sir Nuttall lied promptly upon the cue that Kent himself had afforded him Is the doctor here That s his hut yonder Kent pointed carelessly If he s not there he ll be somewhere else And he took himself off He was a surly ungracious beast at all times readier with the lash of his whip than with his tongue Nuttall watched him go with satisfaction and even noted the direction that he took Then he plunged into the enclosure to verify in mortification that doctor Blood was not at home A man of sense might have sat down and waited judging that to be the quickest and surest way in the end But Nuttall had no sense He flung out of the stockade again hesitated a moment as to which direction he should take and finally decided to go any way but the way that Kent had gone He sped across the parched savannah towards the sugar plantation which stood solid as a rampart and gleaming golden in the dazzling June sunshine Avenues intersected the great blocks of ripening amber cane In the distance down one of these he espied some slaves at work Nuttall entered the avenue and advanced upon them They eyed him dully as he passed them Pitt was not of their number and he dared not ask for him He continued his search for best part of an hour up one of those lanes and then down another Once an overseer challenged him demanding to know his business He was looking he said for doctor Blood His cousin was taken ill The overseer bade him go to the devil and get out of the plantation Blood was not there If he was anywhere he would be in his hut in the stockade Nuttall passed on upon the understanding that he would go But he went in the wrong direction he went on towards the side of the plantation farthest from the stockade towards the dense woods that fringed it there The overseer was too contemptuous and perhaps too languid in the stifling heat of approaching noontide to correct his course Nuttall blundered to the end of the avenue and round the corner of it and there ran into Pitt alone toiling with a wooden spade upon an irrigation channel A pair of cotton drawers loose and ragged clothed him from waist to knee above and below he was naked save for a broad hat of plaited straw that sheltered his unkempt golden head from the rays of the tropical sun At sight of him Nuttall returned thanks aloud to his Maker Pitt stared at him and the shipwright poured out his dismal news in a dismal tone The sum of it was that he must have ten pounds from Blood that very morning or they were all undone And all he got for his pains and his sweat was the condemnation of Jeremy Pitt Damn you for a fool said the slave If it s Blood you re seeking why are you wasting your time here I can t find him bleated Nuttall He was indignant at his reception He forgot the jangled state of the other s nerves after a night of anxious wakefulness ending in a dawn of despair I thought that you You thought that I could drop my spade and go and seek him for you Is that what you thought My God that our lives should depend upon such a dummerhead While you waste your time here the hours are passing And if an overseer should catch you talking to me How ll you explain it For a moment Nuttall was bereft of speech by such ingratitude Then he exploded I would to Heaven I had never had no hand in this affair I would so I wish that What else he wished was never known for at that moment round the block of cane came a big man in biscuit coloured taffetas followed by two negroes in cotton drawers who were armed with cutlasses He was not ten yards away but his approach over the soft yielding marl had been unheard mister Nuttall looked wildly this way and that a moment then bolted like a rabbit for the woods thus doing the most foolish and betraying thing that in the circumstances it was possible for him to do Pitt groaned and stood still leaning upon his spade Hi there Stop bawled Colonel Bishop after the fugitive and added horrible threats tricked out with some rhetorical indecencies But the fugitive held amain and never so much as turned his head It was his only remaining hope that Colonel Bishop might not have seen his face for the power and influence of Colonel Bishop was quite sufficient to hang any man whom he thought would be better dead Not until the runagate had vanished into the scrub did the planter sufficiently recover from his indignant amazement to remember the two negroes who followed at his heels like a brace of hounds It was a bodyguard without which he never moved in his plantations since a slave had made an attack upon him and all but strangled him a couple of years ago After him you black swine he roared at them But as they started he checked them Wait Get to heel damn you It occurred to him that to catch and deal with the fellow there was not the need to go after him and perhaps spend the day hunting him in that cursed wood There was Pitt here ready to his hand and Pitt should tell him the identity of his bashful friend and also the subject of that close and secret talk he had disturbed Pitt might of course be reluctant So much the worse for Pitt The ingenious Colonel Bishop knew a dozen ways some of them quite diverting of conquering stubbornness in these convict dogs He turned now upon the slave a countenance that was inflamed by heat internal and external and a pair of heady eyes that were alight with cruel intelligence He stepped forward swinging his light bamboo cane Who was that runagate he asked with terrible suavity Leaning over on his spade Jeremy Pitt hung his head a little and shifted uncomfortably on his bare feet Vainly he groped for an answer in a mind that could do nothing but curse the idiocy of mister James Nuttall The planter s bamboo cane fell on the lad s naked shoulders with stinging force Answer me you dog What s his name Jeremy looked at the burly planter out of sullen almost defiant eyes I don t know he said and in his voice there was a faint note at least of the defiance aroused in him by a blow which he dared not for his life s sake return His body had remained unyielding under it but the spirit within writhed now in torment You don t know Well here s to quicken your wits Again the cane descended Have you thought of his name yet I have not Stubborn eh For a moment the Colonel leered Then his passion mastered him Swounds You impudent dog D you trifle with me D you think I m to be mocked Pitt shrugged shifted sideways on his feet again and settled into dogged silence Few things are more provocative and Colonel Bishop s temper was never one that required much provocation Brute fury now awoke in him Fiercely now he lashed those defenceless shoulders accompanying each blow by blasphemy and foul abuse until stung beyond endurance the lingering embers of his manhood fanned into momentary flame Pitt sprang upon his tormentor But as he sprang so also sprang the watchful blacks Muscular bronze arms coiled crushingly about the frail white body and in a moment the unfortunate slave stood powerless his wrists pinioned behind him in a leathern thong Breathing hard his face mottled Bishop pondered him a moment Then Fetch him along he said Down the long avenue between those golden walls of cane standing some eight feet high the wretched Pitt was thrust by his black captors in the Colonel s wake stared at with fearful eyes by his fellow slaves at work there Despair went with him What torments might immediately await him he cared little horrible though he knew they would be The real source of his mental anguish lay in the conviction that the elaborately planned escape from this unutterable hell was frustrated now in the very moment of execution They came out upon the green plateau and headed for the stockade and the overseer s white house Pitt s eyes looked out over Carlisle Bay of which this plateau commanded a clear view from the fort on one side to the long sheds of the wharf on the other Along this wharf a few shallow boats were moored and Pitt caught himself wondering which of these was the wherry in which with a little luck they might have been now at sea Out over that sea his glance ranged miserably In the roads standing in for the shore before a gentle breeze that scarcely ruffled the sapphire surface of the Caribbean came a stately red hulled frigate flying the English ensign Colonel Bishop halted to consider her shading his eyes with his fleshly hand Light as was the breeze the vessel spread no canvas to it beyond that of her foresail Furled was her every other sail leaving a clear view of the majestic lines of her hull from towering stern castle to gilded beakhead that was aflash in the dazzling sunshine So leisurely an advance argued a master indifferently acquainted with these waters who preferred to creep forward cautiously sounding his way At her present rate of progress it would be an hour perhaps before she came to anchorage within the harbour And whilst the Colonel viewed her admiring perhaps the gracious beauty of her Pitt was hurried forward into the stockade and clapped into the stocks that stood there ready for slaves who required correction Colonel Bishop followed him presently with leisurely rolling gait A mutinous cur that shows his fangs to his master must learn good manners at the cost of a striped hide was all he said before setting about his executioner s job That with his own hands he should do that which most men of his station would out of self respect have relegated to one of the negroes gives you the measure of the man s beastliness It was almost as if with relish as if gratifying some feral instinct of cruelty that he now lashed his victim about head and shoulders Soon his cane was reduced to splinters by his violence You know perhaps the sting of a flexible bamboo cane when it is whole But do you realize its murderous quality when it has been split into several long lithe blades each with an edge that is of the keenness of a knife When at last from very weariness Colonel Bishop flung away the stump and thongs to which his cane had been reduced the wretched slave s back was bleeding pulp from neck to waist As long as full sensibility remained Jeremy Pitt had made no sound But in a measure as from pain his senses were mercifully dulled he sank forward in the stocks and hung there now in a huddled heap faintly moaning Colonel Bishop set his foot upon the crossbar and leaned over his victim a cruel smile on his full coarse face Let that teach you a proper submission said he And now touching that shy friend of yours you shall stay here without meat or drink without meat or drink d ye hear me until you please to tell me his name and business He took his foot from the bar When you ve had enough of this send me word and we ll have the branding irons to you On that he swung on his heel and strode out of the stockade his negroes following Pitt had heard him as we hear things in our dreams At the moment so spent was he by his cruel punishment and so deep was the despair into which he had fallen that he no longer cared whether he lived or died Soon however from the partial stupor which pain had mercifully induced a new variety of pain aroused him The stocks stood in the open under the full glare of the tropical sun and its blistering rays streamed down upon that mangled bleeding back until he felt as if flames of fire were searing it And soon to this was added a torment still more unspeakable Flies the cruel flies of the Antilles drawn by the scent of blood descended in a cloud upon him Small wonder that the ingenious Colonel Bishop who so well understood the art of loosening stubborn tongues had not deemed it necessary to have recourse to other means of torture Not all his fiendish cruelty could devise a torment more cruel more unendurable than the torments Nature would here procure a man in Pitt s condition The slave writhed in his stocks until he was in danger of breaking his limbs and writhing screamed in agony Thus was he found by Peter Blood who seemed to his troubled vision to materialize suddenly before him mister Blood carried a large palmetto leaf Having whisked away with this the flies that were devouring Jeremy s back he slung it by a strip of fibre from the lad s neck so that it protected him from further attacks as well as from the rays of the sun Next sitting down beside him he drew the sufferer s head down on his own shoulder and bathed his face from a pannikin of cold water Pitt shuddered and moaned on a long indrawn breath Drink he gasped Drink for the love of Christ The pannikin was held to his quivering lips He drank greedily noisily nor ceased until he had drained the vessel Cooled and revived by the draught he attempted to sit up My back he screamed There was an unusual glint in mister Blood s eyes his lips were compressed But when he parted them to speak his voice came cool and steady Be easy now One thing at a time Your back s taking no harm at all for the present since I ve covered it up I m wanting to know what s happened to you D ye think we can do without a navigator that ye go and provoke that beast Bishop until he all but kills you Pitt sat up and groaned again But this time his anguish was mental rather than physical I don t think a navigator will be needed this time Peter What s that cried mister Blood Pitt explained the situation as briefly as he could in a halting gasping speech I m to rot here until I tell him the identity of my visitor and his business mister Blood got up growling in his throat Bad cess to the filthy slaver said he But it must be contrived nevertheless To the devil with Nuttall Whether he gives surety for the boat or not whether he explains it or not the boat remains and we re going and you re coming with us You re dreaming Peter said the prisoner We re not going this time The magistrates will confiscate the boat since the surety s not paid even if when they press him Nuttall does not confess the whole plan and get us all branded on the forehead mister Blood turned away and with agony in his eyes looked out to sea over the blue water by which he had so fondly hoped soon to be travelling back to freedom The great red ship had drawn considerably nearer shore by now Slowly majestically she was entering the bay Already one or two wherries were putting off from the wharf to board her From where he stood mister Blood could see the glinting of the brass cannons mounted on the prow above the curving beak head and he could make out the figure of a seaman in the forechains on her larboard side leaning out to heave the lead An angry voice aroused him from his unhappy thoughts What the devil are you doing here The returning Colonel Bishop came striding into the stockade his negroes following ever mister Blood turned to face him and over that swarthy countenance which indeed by now was tanned to the golden brown of a half caste Indian a mask descended Doing said he blandly Why the duties of my office The Colonel striding furiously forward observed two things The empty pannikin on the seat beside the prisoner and the palmetto leaf protecting his back Have you dared to do this The veins on the planter s forehead stood out like cords Of course I have mister Blood s tone was one of faint surprise I said he was to have neither meat nor drink until I ordered it Sure now I never heard ye You never heard me How should you have heard me when you weren t here Then how did ye expect me to know what orders ye d given mister Blood s tone was positively aggrieved All that I knew was that one of your slaves was being murthered by the sun and the flies And I says to myself this is one of the Colonel s slaves and I m the Colonel s doctor and sure it s my duty to be looking after the Colonel s property So I just gave the fellow a spoonful of water and covered his back from the sun And wasn t I right now Right The Colonel was almost speechless Be easy now be easy mister Blood implored him It s an apoplexy ye ll be contacting if ye give way to heat like this The planter thrust him aside with an imprecation and stepping forward tore the palmetto leaf from the prisoner s back In the name of humanity now mister Blood was beginning The Colonel swung upon him furiously Out of this he commanded And don t come near him again until I send for you unless you want to be served in the same way He was terrific in his menace in his bulk and in the power of him But mister Blood never flinched It came to the Colonel as he found himself steadily regarded by those light blue eyes that looked so arrestingly odd in that tawny face like pale sapphires set in copper that this rogue had for some time now been growing presumptuous It was a matter that he must presently correct Meanwhile mister Blood was speaking again his tone quietly insistent In the name of humanity he repeated ye ll allow me to do what I can to ease his sufferings or I swear to you that I ll forsake at once the duties of a doctor and that it s devil another patient will I attend in this unhealthy island at all For an instant the Colonel was too amazed to speak Then By God he roared D ye dare take that tone with me you dog D ye dare to make terms with me I do that The unflinching blue eyes looked squarely into the Colonel s and there was a devil peeping out of them the devil of recklessness that is born of despair Colonel Bishop considered him for a long moment in silence I ve been too soft with you he said at last But that s to be mended And he tightened his lips I ll have the rods to you until there s not an inch of skin left on your dirty back Will ye so And what would Governor Steed do then Ye re not the only doctor on the island mister Blood actually laughed And will ye tell that to his excellency him with the gout in his foot so bad that he can t stand Ye know very well it s devil another doctor will he tolerate being an intelligent man that knows what s good for him But the Colonel s brute passion thoroughly aroused was not so easily to be baulked If you re alive when my blacks have done with you perhaps you ll come to your senses He swung to his negroes to issue an order But it was never issued At that moment a terrific rolling thunderclap drowned his voice and shook the very air Colonel Bishop jumped his negroes jumped with him and so even did the apparently imperturbable mister Blood Then the four of them stared together seawards Down in the bay all that could be seen of the great ship standing now within a cable s length of the fort were her topmasts thrusting above a cloud of smoke in which she was enveloped From the cliffs a flight of startled seabirds had risen to circle in the blue giving tongue to their alarm the plaintive curlew noisiest of all As those men stared from the eminence on which they stood not yet understanding what had taken place they saw the British Jack dip from the main truck and vanish into the rising cloud below A moment more and up through that cloud to replace the flag of England soared the gold and crimson banner of Castile And then they understood Pirates roared the Colonel and again Pirates Fear and incredulity were blent in his voice He had paled under his tan until his face was the colour of clay and there was a wild fury in his beady eyes His negroes looked at him grinning idiotically all teeth and eyeballs CHAPTER VIII SPANIARDS The stately ship that had been allowed to sail so leisurely into Carlisle Bay under her false colours was a Spanish privateer coming to pay off some of the heavy debt piled up by the predaceous Brethren of the Coast and the recent defeat by the Pride of Devon of two treasure galleons bound for Cadiz It happened that the galleon which escaped in a more or less crippled condition was commanded by Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez who was own brother to the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de Espinosa and who was also a very hasty proud and hot tempered gentleman Galled by his defeat and choosing to forget that his own conduct had invited it he had sworn to teach the English a sharp lesson which they should remember He would take a leaf out of the book of Morgan and those other robbers of the sea and make a punitive raid upon an English settlement Unfortunately for himself and for many others his brother the Admiral was not at hand to restrain him when for this purpose he fitted out the Cinco Llagas at San Juan de Porto Rico He chose for his objective the island of Barbados whose natural strength was apt to render her defenders careless He chose it also because thither had the Pride of Devon been tracked by his scouts and he desired a measure of poetic justice to invest his vengeance And he chose a moment when there were no ships of war at anchor in Carlisle Bay He had succeeded so well in his intentions that he had aroused no suspicion until he saluted the fort at short range with a broadside of twenty guns And now the four gaping watchers in the stockade on the headland beheld the great ship creep forward under the rising cloud of smoke her mainsail unfurled to increase her steering way and go about close hauled to bring her larboard guns to bear upon the unready fort With the crashing roar of that second broadside Colonel Bishop awoke from stupefaction to a recollection of where his duty lay In the town below drums were beating frantically and a trumpet was bleating as if the peril needed further advertising As commander of the Barbados Militia the place of Colonel Bishop was at the head of his scanty troops in that fort which the Spanish guns were pounding into rubble Remembering it he went off at the double despite his bulk and the heat his negroes trotting after him mister Blood turned to Jeremy Pitt He laughed grimly Now that said he is what I call a timely interruption Though what ll come of it he added as an afterthought the devil himself knows As a third broadside was thundering forth he picked up the palmetto leaf and carefully replaced it on the back of his fellow slave And then into the stockade panting and sweating came Kent followed by best part of a score of plantation workers some of whom were black and all of whom were in a state of panic He led them into the low white house to bring them forth again within a moment as it seemed armed now with muskets and hangers and some of them equipped with bandoleers By this time the rebels convict were coming in in twos and threes having abandoned their work upon finding themselves unguarded and upon scenting the general dismay Kent paused a moment as his hastily armed guard dashed forth to fling an order to those slaves To the woods he bade them Take to the woods and lie close there until this is over and we ve gutted these Spanish swine On that he went off in haste after his men who were to be added to those massing in the town so as to oppose and overwhelm the Spanish landing parties The slaves would have obeyed him on the instant but for mister Blood What need for haste and in this heat quoth he He was surprisingly cool they thought Maybe there ll be no need to take to the woods at all and anyway it will be time enough to do so when the Spaniards are masters of the town And so joined now by the other stragglers and numbering in all a round score rebels convict all they stayed to watch from their vantage ground the fortunes of the furious battle that was being waged below The landing was contested by the militia and by every islander capable of bearing arms with the fierce resoluteness of men who knew that no quarter was to be expected in defeat The ruthlessness of Spanish soldiery was a byword and not at his worst had Morgan or L Ollonais ever perpetrated such horrors as those of which these Castilian gentlemen were capable But this Spanish commander knew his business which was more than could truthfully be said for the Barbados Militia Having gained the advantage of a surprise blow which had put the fort out of action he soon showed them that he was master of the situation His guns turned now upon the open space behind the mole where the incompetent Bishop had marshalled his men tore the militia into bloody rags and covered the landing parties which were making the shore in their own boats and in several of those which had rashly gone out to the great ship before her identity was revealed All through the scorching afternoon the battle went on the rattle and crack of musketry penetrating ever deeper into the town to show that the defenders were being driven steadily back By sunset two hundred and fifty Spaniards were masters of Bridgetown the islanders were disarmed and at Government House Governor Steed his gout forgotten in his panic supported by Colonel Bishop and some lesser officers was being informed by Don Diego with an urbanity that was itself a mockery of the sum that would be required in ransom For a hundred thousand pieces of eight and fifty head of cattle Don Diego would forbear from reducing the place to ashes And what time that suave and courtly commander was settling these details with the apoplectic British Governor the Spaniards were smashing and looting feasting drinking and ravaging after the hideous manner of their kind mister Blood greatly daring ventured down at dusk into the town What he saw there is recorded by Jeremy Pitt to whom he subsequently related it in that voluminous log from which the greater part of my narrative is derived I have no intention of repeating any of it here It is all too loathsome and nauseating incredible indeed that men however abandoned could ever descend such an abyss of bestial cruelty and lust What he saw was fetching him in haste and white faced out of that hell again when in a narrow street a girl hurtled into him wild eyed her unbound hair streaming behind her as she ran After her laughing and cursing in a breath came a heavy booted Spaniard Almost he was upon her when suddenly mister Blood got in his way The doctor had taken a sword from a dead man s side some little time before and armed himself with it against an emergency As the Spaniard checked in anger and surprise he caught in the dusk the livid gleam of that sword which mister Blood had quickly unsheathed Ah perro ingles he shouted and flung forward to his death It s hoping I am ye re in a fit state to meet your Maker said mister Blood and ran him through the body He did the thing skilfully with the combined skill of swordsman and surgeon The man sank in a hideous heap without so much as a groan mister Blood swung to the girl who leaned panting and sobbing against a wall He caught her by the wrist Come he said But she hung back resisting him by her weight Who are you she demanded wildly Will ye wait to see my credentials he snapped Steps were clattering towards them from beyond the corner round which she had fled from that Spanish ruffian Come he urged again And this time reassured perhaps by his clear English speech she went without further questions They sped down an alley and then up another by great good fortune meeting no one for already they were on the outskirts of the town They won out of it and white faced physically sick mister Blood dragged her almost at a run up the hill towards Colonel Bishop s house He told her briefly who and what he was and thereafter there was no conversation between them until they reached the big white house It was all in darkness which at least was reassuring If the Spaniards had reached it there would be lights He knocked but had to knock again and yet again before he was answered Then it was by a voice from a window above Who is there The voice was Miss Bishop s a little tremulous but unmistakably her own mister Blood almost fainted in relief He had been imagining the unimaginable He had pictured her down in that hell out of which he had just come He had conceived that she might have followed her uncle into Bridgetown or committed some other imprudence and he turned cold from head to foot at the mere thought of what might have happened to her It is I Peter Blood he gasped What do you want It is doubtful whether she would have come down to open For at such a time as this it was no more than likely that the wretched plantation slaves might be in revolt and prove as great a danger as the Spaniards But at the sound of her voice the girl mister Blood had rescued peered up through the gloom Arabella she called It is I Mary Traill Mary The voice ceased above on that exclamation the head was withdrawn After a brief pause the door gaped wide Beyond it in the wide hall stood Miss Arabella a slim virginal figure in white mysteriously revealed in the gleam of a single candle which she carried mister Blood strode in followed by his distraught companion who falling upon Arabella s slender bosom surrendered herself to a passion of tears But he wasted no time Whom have you here with you What servants he demanded sharply The only male was James an old negro groom The very man said Blood Bid him get out horses Then away with you to Speightstown or even farther north where you will be safe Here you are in danger in dreadful danger But I thought the fighting was over she was beginning pale and startled So it is But the deviltry s only beginning Miss Traill will tell you as you go In God s name madam take my word for it and do as I bid you He he saved me sobbed Miss Traill Saved you Miss Bishop was aghast Saved you from what Mary Let that wait snapped mister Blood almost angrily You ve all the night for chattering when you re out of this and away beyond their reach Will you please call James and do as I say and at once You are very peremptory Oh my God I am peremptory Speak Miss Trail tell her whether I ve cause to be peremptory Yes yes the girl cried shuddering Do as he says Oh for pity s sake Arabella Miss Bishop went off leaving mister Blood and Miss Traill alone again I I shall never forget what you did sir said she through her diminishing tears She was a slight wisp of a girl a child no more I ve done better things in my time That s why I m here said mister Blood whose mood seemed to be snappy She didn t pretend to understand him and she didn t make the attempt Did you did you kill him she asked fearfully He stared at her in the flickering candlelight I hope so It is very probable and it doesn t matter at all he said What matters is that this fellow James should fetch the horses And he was stamping off to accelerate these preparations for departure when her voice arrested him Don t leave me Don t leave me here alone she cried in terror He paused He turned and came slowly back Standing above her he smiled upon her There there You ve no cause for alarm It s all over now You ll be away soon away to Speightstown where you ll be quite safe The horses came at last four of them for in addition to James who was to act as her guide Miss Bishop had her woman who was not to be left behind mister Blood lifted the slight weight of Mary Traill to her horse then turned to say good bye to Miss Bishop who was already mounted He said it and seemed to have something to add But whatever it was it remained unspoken The horses started and receded into the sapphire starlit night leaving him standing there before Colonel Bishop s door The last he heard of them was Mary Traill s childlike voice calling back on a quavering note I shall never forget what you did mister Blood I shall never forget But as it was not the voice he desired to hear the assurance brought him little satisfaction He stood there in the dark watching the fireflies amid the rhododendrons till the hoofbeats had faded Then he sighed and roused himself He had much to do His journey into the town had not been one of idle curiosity to see how the Spaniards conducted themselves in victory It had been inspired by a very different purpose and he had gained in the course of it all the information he desired He had an extremely busy night before him and must be moving He went off briskly in the direction of the stockade where his fellow slaves awaited him in deep anxiety and some hope CHAPTER IX THE REBELS CONVICT There were when the purple gloom of the tropical night descended upon the Caribbean not more than ten men on guard aboard the Cinco Llagas so confident and with good reason were the Spaniards of the complete subjection of the islanders And when I say that there were ten men on guard I state rather the purpose for which they were left aboard than the duty which they fulfilled As a matter of fact whilst the main body of the Spaniards feasted and rioted ashore the Spanish gunner and his crew who had so nobly done their duty and ensured the easy victory of the day were feasting on the gun deck upon the wine and the fresh meats fetched out to them from shore Above two sentinels only kept vigil at stem and stern Nor were they as vigilant as they should have been or else they must have observed the two wherries that under cover of the darkness came gliding from the wharf with well greased rowlocks to bring up in silence under the great ship s quarter From the gallery aft still hung the ladder by which Don Diego had descended to the boat that had taken him ashore The sentry on guard in the stern coming presently round this gallery was suddenly confronted by the black shadow of a man standing before him at the head of the ladder Who s there he asked but without alarm supposing it one of his fellows It is I softly answered Peter Blood in the fluent Castillan of which he was master Is it you Pedro The Spaniard came a step nearer Peter is my name but I doubt I ll not be the Peter you re expecting How quoth the sentry checking This way said mister Blood The wooden taffrail was a low one and the Spaniard was taken completely by surprise Save for the splash he made as he struck the water narrowly missing one of the crowded boats that waited under the counter not a sound announced his misadventure Armed as he was with corselet cuissarts and headpiece he sank to trouble them no more Whist hissed mister Blood to his waiting rebels convict Come on now and without noise Within five minutes they had swarmed aboard the entire twenty of them overflowing from that narrow gallery and crouching on the quarter deck itself Lights showed ahead Under the great lantern in the prow they saw the black figure of the other sentry pacing on the forecastle From below sounds reached them of the orgy on the gun deck a rich male voice was singing an obscene ballad to which the others chanted in chorus Y estos son los usos de Castilla y de Leon From what I ve seen to day I can well believe it said mister Blood and whispered Forward after me Crouching low they glided noiseless as shadows to the quarter deck rail and thence slipped without sound down into the waist Two thirds of them were armed with muskets some of which they had found in the overseer s house and others supplied from the secret hoard that mister Blood had so laboriously assembled against the day of escape The remainder were equipped with knives and cutlasses In the vessel s waist they hung awhile until mister Blood had satisfied himself that no other sentinel showed above decks but that inconvenient fellow in the prow Their first attention must be for him mister Blood himself crept forward with two companions leaving the others in the charge of that Nathaniel Hagthorpe whose sometime commission in the King s Navy gave him the best title to this office mister Blood s absence was brief When he rejoined his comrades there was no watch above the Spaniards decks Meanwhile the revellers below continued to make merry at their ease in the conviction of complete security The garrison of Barbados was overpowered and disarmed and their companions were ashore in complete possession of the town glutting themselves hideously upon the fruits of victory What then was there to fear Even when their quarters were invaded and they found themselves surrounded by a score of wild hairy half naked men who save that they appeared once to have been white looked like a horde of savages the Spaniards could not believe their eyes Who could have dreamed that a handful of forgotten plantation slaves would have dared to take so much upon themselves The half drunken Spaniards their laughter suddenly quenched the song perishing on their lips stared stricken and bewildered at the levelled muskets by which they were checkmated And then from out of this uncouth pack of savages that beset them stepped a slim tall fellow with light blue eyes in a tawny face eyes in which glinted the light of a wicked humour He addressed them in the purest Castilian You will save yourselves pain and trouble by regarding yourselves my prisoners and suffering yourselves to be quietly bestowed out of harm s way Name of God swore the gunner which did no justice at all to an amazement beyond expression If you please said mister Blood and thereupon those gentlemen of Spain were induced without further trouble beyond a musket prod or two to drop through a scuttle to the deck below After that the rebels convict refreshed themselves with the good things in the consumption of which they had interrupted the Spaniards To taste palatable Christian food after months of salt fish and maize dumplings was in itself a feast to these unfortunates But there were no excesses mister Blood saw to that although it required all the firmness of which he was capable Dispositions were to be made without delay against that which must follow before they could abandon themselves fully to the enjoyment of their victory This after all was no more than a preliminary skirmish although it was one that afforded them the key to the situation It remained to dispose so that the utmost profit might be drawn from it Those dispositions occupied some very considerable portion of the night But at least they were complete before the sun peeped over the shoulder of Mount Hilibay to shed his light upon a day of some surprises It was soon after sunrise that the rebel convict who paced the quarter deck in Spanish corselet and headpiece a Spanish musket on his shoulder announced the approach of a boat It was Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez coming aboard with four great treasure chests containing each twenty five thousand pieces of eight the ransom delivered to him at dawn by Governor Steed He was accompanied by his son Don Esteban and by six men who took the oars Aboard the frigate all was quiet and orderly as it should be She rode at anchor her larboard to the shore and the main ladder on her starboard side Round to this came the boat with Don Diego and his treasure mister Blood had disposed effectively It was not for nothing that he had served under de Ruyter The swings were waiting and the windlass manned Below a gun crew held itself in readiness under the command of Ogle who as I have said had been a gunner in the Royal Navy before he went in for politics and followed the fortunes of the Duke of Monmouth He was a sturdy resolute fellow who inspired confidence by the very confidence he displayed in himself Don Diego mounted the ladder and stepped upon the deck alone and entirely unsuspicious What should the poor man suspect Before he could even look round and survey this guard drawn up to receive him a tap over the head with a capstan bar efficiently handled by Hagthorpe put him to sleep without the least fuss He was carried away to his cabin whilst the treasure chests handled by the men he had left in the boat were being hauled to the deck That being satisfactorily accomplished Don Esteban and the fellows who had manned the boat came up the ladder one by one to be handled with the same quiet efficiency Peter Blood had a genius for these things and almost I suspect an eye for the dramatic Dramatic certainly was the spectacle now offered to the survivors of the raid With Colonel Bishop at their head and gout ridden Governor Steed sitting on the ruins of a wall beside him they glumly watched the departure of the eight boats containing the weary Spanish ruffians who had glutted themselves with rapine murder and violences unspeakable They looked on between relief at this departure of their remorseless enemies and despair at the wild ravages which temporarily at least had wrecked the prosperity and happiness of that little colony The boats pulled away from the shore with their loads of laughing jeering Spaniards who were still flinging taunts across the water at their surviving victims They had come midway between the wharf and the ship when suddenly the air was shaken by the boom of a gun A round shot struck the water within a fathom of the foremost boat sending a shower of spray over its occupants They paused at their oars astounded into silence for a moment Then speech burst from them like an explosion Angrily voluble they anathematized this dangerous carelessness on the part of their gunner who should know better than to fire a salute from a cannon loaded with shot They were still cursing him when a second shot better aimed than the first came to crumple one of the boats into splinters flinging its crew dead and living into the water But if it silenced these it gave tongue still more angry vehement and bewildered to the crews of the other seven boats From each the suspended oars stood out poised over the water whilst on their feet in the excitement the Spaniards screamed oaths at the ship begging Heaven and Hell to inform them what madman had been let loose among her guns Plump into their middle came a third shot smashing a second boat with fearful execution Followed again a moment of awful silence then among those Spanish pirates all was gibbering and jabbering and splashing of oars as they attempted to pull in every direction at once Some were for going ashore others for heading straight to the vessel and there discovering what might be amiss That something was very gravely amiss there could be no further doubt particularly as whilst they discussed and fumed and cursed two more shots came over the water to account for yet a third of their boats The resolute Ogle was making excellent practice and fully justifying his claims to know something of gunnery In their consternation the Spaniards had simplified his task by huddling their boats together After the fourth shot opinion was no longer divided amongst them As with one accord they went about or attempted to do so for before they had accomplished it two more of their boats had been sunk The three boats that remained without concerning themselves with their more unfortunate fellows who were struggling in the water headed back for the wharf at speed If the Spaniards understood nothing of all this the forlorn islanders ashore understood still less until to help their wits they saw the flag of Spain come down from the mainmast of the Cinco Llagas and the flag of England soar to its empty place Even then some bewilderment persisted and it was with fearful eyes that they observed the return of their enemies who might vent upon them the ferocity aroused by these extraordinary events Ogle however continued to give proof that his knowledge of gunnery was not of yesterday After the fleeing Spaniards went his shots The last of their boats flew into splinters as it touched the wharf and its remains were buried under a shower of loosened masonry That was the end of this pirate crew which not ten minutes ago had been laughingly counting up the pieces of eight that would fall to the portion of each for his share in that act of villainy Close upon threescore survivors contrived to reach the shore Whether they had cause for congratulation I am unable to say in the absence of any records in which their fate may be traced That lack of records is in itself eloquent We know that they were made fast as they landed and considering the offence they had given I am not disposed to doubt that they had every reason to regret the survival The mystery of the succour that had come at the eleventh hour to wreak vengeance upon the Spaniards and to preserve for the island the extortionate ransom of a hundred thousand pieces of eight remained yet to be probed That the Cinco Llagas was now in friendly hands could no longer be doubted after the proofs it had given But who the people of Bridgetown asked one another were the men in possession of her and whence had they come The only possible assumption ran the truth very closely A resolute party of islanders must have got aboard during the night and seized the ship It remained to ascertain the precise identity of these mysterious saviours and do them fitting honour Upon this errand Governor Steed s condition not permitting him to go in person went Colonel Bishop as the Governor s deputy attended by two officers As he stepped from the ladder into the vessel s waist the Colonel beheld there beside the main hatch the four treasure chests the contents of one of which had been contributed almost entirely by himself It was a gladsome spectacle and his eyes sparkled in beholding it Ranged on either side athwart the deck stood a score of men in two well ordered files with breasts and backs of steel polished Spanish morions on their heads overshadowing their faces and muskets ordered at their sides Colonel Bishop could not be expected to recognize at a glance in these upright furbished soldierly figures the ragged unkempt scarecrows that but yesterday had been toiling in his plantations Still less could he be expected to recognize at once the courtly gentleman who advanced to greet him a lean graceful gentleman dressed in the Spanish fashion all in black with silver lace a gold hilted sword dangling beside him from a gold embroidered baldrick a broad castor with a sweeping plume set above carefully curled ringlets of deepest black Be welcome aboard the Cinco Llagas Colonel darling a voice vaguely familiar addressed the planter We ve made the best of the Spaniards wardrobe in honour of this visit though it was scarcely yourself we had dared hope to expect You find yourself among friends old friends of yours all The Colonel stared in stupefaction mister Blood tricked out in all this splendour indulging therein his natural taste his face carefully shaven his hair as carefully dressed seemed transformed into a younger man The fact is he looked no more than the thirty three years he counted to his age Peter Blood It was an ejaculation of amazement Satisfaction followed swiftly Was it you then Myself it was myself and these my good friends and yours mister Blood tossed back the fine lace from his wrist to wave a hand towards the file of men standing to attention there The Colonel looked more closely Gad s my life he crowed on a note of foolish jubilation And it was with these fellows that you took the Spaniard and turned the tables on those dogs Oddswounds It was heroic Heroic is it Bedad it s epic Ye begin to perceive the breadth and depth of my genius Colonel Bishop sat himself down on the hatch coaming took off his broad hat and mopped his brow Y amaze me he gasped On my soul y amaze me To have recovered the treasure and to have seized this fine ship and all she ll hold It will be something to set against the other losses we have suffered As Gad s my life you deserve well for this I am entirely of your opinion Damme You all deserve well and damme you shall find me grateful That s as it should be said mister Blood The question is how well we deserve and how grateful shall we find you Colonel Bishop considered him There was a shadow of surprise in his face Why his excellency shall write home an account of your exploit and maybe some portion of your sentences shall be remitted The generosity of King James is well known sneered Nathaniel Hagthorpe who was standing by and amongst the ranged rebels convict some one ventured to laugh Colonel Bishop started up He was pervaded by the first pang of uneasiness It occurred to him that all here might not be as friendly as appeared And there s another matter mister Blood resumed There s a matter of a flogging that s due to me Ye re a man of your word in such matters Colonel if not perhaps in others and ye said I think that ye d not leave a square inch of skin on my back The planter waved the matter aside Almost it seemed to offend him Tush Tush After this splendid deed of yours do you suppose I can be thinking of such things I m glad ye feel like that about it But I m thinking it s mighty lucky for me the Spaniards didn t come to day instead of yesterday or it s in the same plight as Jeremy Pitt I d be this minute And in that case where was the genius that would have turned the tables on these rascally Spaniards Why speak of it now mister Blood resumed ye ll please to understand that I must Colonel darling Ye ve worked a deal of wickedness and cruelty in your time and I want this to be a lesson to you a lesson that ye ll remember for the sake of others who may come after us There s Jeremy up there in the round house with a back that s every colour of the rainbow and the poor lad ll not be himself again for a month And if it hadn t been for the Spaniards maybe it s dead he d be by now and maybe myself with him Hagthorpe lounged forward He was a fairly tall vigorous man with a clear cut attractive face which in itself announced his breeding Why will you be wasting words on the hog wondered that sometime officer in the Royal Navy Fling him overboard and have done with him The Colonel s eyes bulged in his head What the devil do you mean he blustered It s the lucky man ye are entirely Colonel though ye don t guess the source of your good fortune And now another intervened the brawny one eyed Wolverstone less mercifully disposed than his more gentlemanly fellow convict String him up from the yardarm he cried his deep voice harsh and angry and more than one of the slaves standing to their arms made echo Colonel Bishop trembled mister Blood turned He was quite calm If you please Wolverstone said he I conduct affairs in my own way That is the pact You ll please to remember it His eyes looked along the ranks making it plain that he addressed them all I desire that Colonel Bishop should have his life One reason is that I require him as a hostage If ye insist on hanging him ye ll have to hang me with him or in the alternative I ll go ashore He paused There was no answer But they stood hang dog and half mutinous before him save Hagthorpe who shrugged and smiled wearily mister Blood resumed Ye ll please to understand that aboard a ship there is one captain So He swung again to the startled Colonel Though I promise you your life I must as you ve heard keep you aboard as a hostage for the good behaviour of Governor Steed and what s left of the fort until we put to sea Until you Horror prevented Colonel Bishop from echoing the remainder of that incredible speech Just so said Peter Blood and he turned to the officers who had accompanied the Colonel The boat is waiting gentlemen You ll have heard what I said Convey it with my compliments to his excellency But sir one of them began There is no more to be said gentlemen My name is Blood Captain Blood if you please of this ship the Cinco Llagas taken as a prize of war from Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez who is my prisoner aboard You are to understand that I have turned the tables on more than the Spaniards There s the ladder You ll find it more convenient than being heaved over the side which is what ll happen if you linger They went though not without some hustling regardless of the bellowings of Colonel Bishop whose monstrous rage was fanned by terror at finding himself at the mercy of these men of whose cause to hate him he was very fully conscious A half dozen of them apart from Jeremy Pitt who was utterly incapacitated for the present possessed a superficial knowledge of seamanship Hagthorpe although he had been a fighting officer untrained in navigation knew how to handle a ship and under his directions they set about getting under way The anchor catted and the mainsail unfurled they stood out for the open before a gentle breeze without interference from the fort As they were running close to the headland east of the bay Peter Blood returned to the Colonel who under guard and panic stricken had dejectedly resumed his seat on the coamings of the main batch Can ye swim Colonel Colonel Bishop looked up His great face was yellow and seemed in that moment of a preternatural flabbiness his beady eyes were beadier than ever As your doctor now I prescribe a swim to cool the excessive heat of your humours Blood delivered the explanation pleasantly and receiving still no answer from the Colonel continued It s a mercy for you I m not by nature as bloodthirsty as some of my friends here And it s the devil s own labour I ve had to prevail upon them not to be vindictive I doubt if ye re worth the pains I ve taken for you He was lying He had no doubt at all Had he followed his own wishes and instincts he would certainly have strung the Colonel up and accounted it a meritorious deed It was the thought of Arabella Bishop that had urged him to mercy and had led him to oppose the natural vindictiveness of his fellow slaves until he had been in danger of precipitating a mutiny It was entirely to the fact that the Colonel was her uncle although he did not even begin to suspect such a cause that he owed such mercy as was now being shown him You shall have a chance to swim for it Peter Blood continued It s not above a quarter of a mile to the headland yonder and with ordinary luck ye should manage it Faith you re fat enough to float Come on Now don t be hesitating or it s a long voyage ye ll be going with us and the devil knows what may happen to you You re not loved any more than you deserve Colonel Bishop mastered himself and rose A merciless despot who had never known the need for restraint in all these years he was doomed by ironic fate to practise restraint in the very moment when his feelings had reached their most violent intensity Peter Blood gave an order A plank was run out over the gunwale and lashed down If you please Colonel said he with a graceful flourish of invitation The Colonel looked at him and there was hell in his glance Then taking his resolve and putting the best face upon it since no other could help him here he kicked off his shoes peeled off his fine coat of biscuit coloured taffetas and climbed upon the plank A moment he paused steadied by a hand that clutched the ratlines looking down in terror at the green water rushing past some five and twenty feet below Just take a little walk Colonel darling said a smooth mocking voice behind him Still clinging Colonel Bishop looked round in hesitation and saw the bulwarks lined with swarthy faces the faces of men that as lately as yesterday would have turned pale under his frown faces that were now all wickedly agrin For a moment rage stamped out his fear He cursed them aloud venomously and incoherently then loosed his hold and stepped out upon the plank Three steps he took before he lost his balance and went tumbling into the green depths below When he came to the surface again gasping for air the Cinco Llagas was already some furlongs to leeward But the roaring cheer of mocking valediction from the rebels convict reached him across the water to drive the iron of impotent rage deeper into his soul 
224_129790_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER X DON DIEGO
none	none	 Don Diego de Espinosa y Valdez awoke and with languid eyes in aching head he looked round the cabin which was flooded with sunlight from the square windows astern 
224_129790_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Then he uttered a moan and closed his eyes again impelled to this by the monstrous ache in his head 
none	none	Lying thus he attempted to think to locate himself in time and space But between the pain in his head and the confusion in his mind he found coherent thought impossible An indefinite sense of alarm drove him to open his eyes again and once more to consider his surroundings There could be no doubt that he lay in the great cabin of his own ship the Cinco Llagas so that his vague disquiet must be surely ill founded 
224_129790_000003_000001	train-clean-360	And yet stirrings of memory coming now to the assistance of reflection compelled him uneasily to insist that here something was not as it should be 
224_129790_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The low position of the sun flooding the cabin with golden light from those square ports astern suggested to him at first that it was early morning on the assumption that the vessel was headed westward 
224_129790_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Then the alternative occurred to him 
224_129790_000003_000004	train-clean-360	They might be sailing eastward in which case the time of day would be late afternoon That they were sailing he could feel from the gentle forward heave of the vessel under him 
none	none	But how did they come to be sailing and he the master not to know whether their course lay east or west not to be able to recollect whither they were bound 
224_129790_000004_000000	train-clean-360	His mind went back over the adventure of yesterday if of yesterday it was 
224_129790_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He was clear on the matter of the easily successful raid upon the Island of Barbados every detail stood vividly in his memory up to the moment at which returning aboard he had stepped on to his own deck again 
224_129790_000004_000002	train-clean-360	There memory abruptly and inexplicably ceased 
224_129790_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He was beginning to torture his mind with conjecture when the door opened and to Don Diego s increasing mystification he beheld his best suit of clothes step into the cabin 
none	none	It was a singularly elegant and characteristically Spanish suit of black taffetas with silver lace that had been made for him a year ago in Cadiz and he knew each detail of it so well that it was impossible he could now be mistaken 
224_129790_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The suit paused to close the door then advanced towards the couch on which Don Diego was extended and inside the suit came a tall slender gentleman of about Don Diego s own height and shape 
224_129790_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Seeing the wide startled eyes of the Spaniard upon him the gentleman lengthened his stride 
none	none	Awake eh said he in Spanish The recumbent man looked up bewildered into a pair of light blue eyes that regarded him out of a tawny sardonic face set in a cluster of black ringlets 
224_129790_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But he was too bewildered to make any answer 
224_129790_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The stranger s fingers touched the top of Don Diego s head whereupon Don Diego winced and cried out in pain 
none	none	Tender eh said the stranger 
224_129790_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He took Don Diego s wrist between thumb and second finger 
224_129790_000010_000002	train-clean-360	And then at last the intrigued Spaniard spoke 
224_129790_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you a doctor 
224_129790_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Among other things The swarthy gentleman continued his study of the patient s pulse 
224_129790_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Firm and regular he announced at last and dropped the wrist 
224_129790_000012_000002	train-clean-360	 You ve taken no great harm 
224_129790_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Don Diego struggled up into a sitting position on the red velvet couch 
none	none	Who the devil are you he asked
224_129790_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 And what the devil are you doing in my clothes and aboard my ship 
none	none	The level black eyebrows went up a faint smile curled the lips of the long mouth You are still delirious I fear 
224_129790_000016_000001	train-clean-360	This is not your ship 
224_129790_000016_000002	train-clean-360	This is my ship and these are my clothes 
224_129790_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Your ship quoth the other aghast and still more aghast he added Your clothes 
224_129790_000017_000001	train-clean-360	But then Wildly his eyes looked about him 
224_129790_000017_000002	train-clean-360	They scanned the cabin once again scrutinizing each familiar object 
224_129790_000017_000003	train-clean-360	 Am I mad he asked at last 
224_129790_000017_000004	train-clean-360	 Surely this ship is the Cinco Llagas 
224_129790_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 The Cinco Llagas it is 
none	none	Then 
224_129790_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The Spaniard broke off 
none	none	His glance grew still more troubled Valga me Dios he cried out like a man in anguish
224_129790_000019_000003	train-clean-360	 Will you tell me also that you are Don Diego de Espinosa 
224_129790_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no my name is Blood Captain Peter Blood 
224_129790_000020_000001	train-clean-360	This ship like this handsome suit of clothes is mine by right of conquest 
224_129790_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Just as you Don Diego are my prisoner 
224_129790_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Startling as was the explanation yet it proved soothing to Don Diego being so much less startling than the things he was beginning to imagine 
none	none	But 
224_129790_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Are you not Spanish then 
224_129790_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You flatter my Castilian accent 
none	none	I have the honour to be Irish You were thinking that a miracle had happened 
224_129790_000023_000003	train-clean-360	So it has a miracle wrought by my genius which is considerable 
none	none	Succinctly now Captain Blood dispelled the mystery by a relation of the facts 
224_129790_000024_000001	train-clean-360	It was a narrative that painted red and white by turns the Spaniard s countenance 
224_129790_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He put a hand to the back of his head and there discovered in confirmation of the story a lump as large as a pigeon s egg 
224_129790_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Lastly he stared wild eyed at the sardonic Captain Blood 
224_129790_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 And my son 
none	none	What of my son he cried out
224_129790_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 He was in the boat that brought me aboard 
none	none	Your son is safe he and the boat s crew together with your gunner and his men are snugly in irons under hatches Don Diego sank back on the couch his glittering dark eyes fixed upon the tawny face above him 
224_129790_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He composed himself 
224_129790_000027_000002	train-clean-360	After all he possessed the stoicism proper to his desperate trade 
224_129790_000027_000003	train-clean-360	The dice had fallen against him in this venture 
none	none	The tables had been turned upon him in the very moment of success 
224_129790_000027_000005	train-clean-360	He accepted the situation with the fortitude of a fatalist 
224_129790_000028_000000	train-clean-360	With the utmost calm he enquired 
none	none	And now Senior Capitan And now said Captain Blood to give him the title he had assumed being a humane man I am sorry to find that ye re not dead from the tap we gave you 
224_129790_000030_000001	train-clean-360	For it means that you ll be put to the trouble of dying all over again 
224_129790_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah Don Diego drew a deep breath 
224_129790_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 But is that necessary he asked without apparent perturbation 
224_129790_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood s blue eyes approved his bearing 
none	none	Ask yourself said he Tell me as an experienced and bloody pirate what in my place would you do yourself Ah but there is a difference Don Diego sat up to argue the matter It lies in the fact that you boast yourself a humane man 
224_129790_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood perched himself on the edge of the long oak table 
none	none	But I am not a fool said he and I ll not allow a natural Irish sentimentality to stand in the way of my doing what is necessary and proper 
224_129790_000034_000002	train-clean-360	You and your ten surviving scoundrels are a menace on this ship More than that she is none so well found in water and provisions 
224_129790_000034_000003	train-clean-360	True we are fortunately a small number but you and your party inconveniently increase it 
224_129790_000034_000004	train-clean-360	So that on every hand you see prudence suggests to us that we should deny ourselves the pleasure of your company and steeling our soft hearts to the inevitable invite you to be so obliging as to step over the side 
224_129790_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I see said the Spaniard pensively 
224_129790_000035_000001	train-clean-360	He swung his legs from the couch and sat now upon the edge of it his elbows on his knees 
none	none	He had taken the measure of his man and met him with a mock urbanity and a suave detachment that matched his own
224_129790_000035_000003	train-clean-360	 I confess he admitted that there is much force in what you say 
224_129790_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 You take a load from my mind said Captain Blood 
none	none	I would not appear unnecessarily harsh especially since I and my friends owe you so very much For whatever it may have been to others to us your raid upon Barbados was most opportune I am glad therefore that you agree the I have no choice
224_129790_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 But my friend I did not agree so much 
none	none	If there is any alternative that you can suggest I shall be most happy to consider it 
224_129790_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Don Diego stroked his pointed black beard 
none	none	Can you give me until morning for reflection 
224_129790_000040_000001	train-clean-360	My head aches so damnably that I am incapable of thought 
none	none	And this you will admit is a matter that asks serious thought 
224_129790_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood stood up 
224_129790_000041_000001	train-clean-360	From a shelf he took a half hour glass reversed it so that the bulb containing the red sand was uppermost and stood it on the table 
none	none	I am sorry to press you in such a matter Don Diego but one glass is all that I can give you If by the time those sands have run out you can propose no acceptable alternative I shall most reluctantly be driven to ask you to go over the side with your friends 
224_129790_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood bowed went out and locked the door 
none	none	Elbows on his knees and face in his hands Don Diego sat watching the rusty sands as they filtered from the upper to the lower bulb 
224_129790_000043_000002	train-clean-360	And what time he watched the lines in his lean brown face grew deeper 
224_129790_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Punctually as the last grains ran out the door reopened 
224_129790_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The Spaniard sighed and sat upright to face the returning Captain Blood with the answer for which he came 
224_129790_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I have thought of an alternative sir captain but it depends upon your charity 
224_129790_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It is that you put us ashore on one of the islands of this pestilent archipelago and leave us to shift for ourselves 
224_129790_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood pursed his lips 
224_129790_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 It has its difficulties said he slowly 
224_129790_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I feared it would be so Don Diego sighed again and stood up 
none	none	Let us say no more 
224_129790_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The light blue eyes played over him like points of steel 
none	none	You are not afraid to die Don Diego The Spaniard threw back his head a frown between his eyes
224_129790_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 The question is offensive sir 
224_129790_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Then let me put it in another way perhaps more happily You do not desire to live 
224_129790_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah that I can answer 
224_129790_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I do desire to live and even more do I desire that my son may live 
224_129790_000053_000002	train-clean-360	But the desire shall not make a coward of me for your amusement master mocker It was the first sign he had shown of the least heat or resentment 
none	none	Captain Blood did not directly answer 
224_129790_000054_000001	train-clean-360	As before he perched himself on the corner of the table 
none	none	Would you be willing sir to earn life and liberty for yourself your son and the other Spaniards who are on board
224_129790_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 To earn it said Don Diego and the watchful blue eyes did not miss the quiver that ran through him 
224_129790_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 To earn it do you say 
224_129790_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Why if the service you would propose is one that cannot hurt my honour 
224_129790_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Could I be guilty of that protested the Captain 
224_129790_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 I realize that even a pirate has his honour And forthwith he propounded his offer 
none	none	If you will look from those windows Don Diego you will see what appears to be a cloud on the horizon That is the island of Barbados well astern 
224_129790_000057_000004	train-clean-360	All day we have been sailing east before the wind with but one intent to set as great a distance between Barbados and ourselves as possible 
none	none	But now almost out of sight of land we are in a difficulty The only man among us schooled in the art of navigation is fevered delirious in fact as a result of certain ill treatment he received ashore before we carried him away with us I can handle a ship in action and there are one or two men aboard who can assist me but of the higher mysteries of seamanship and of the art of finding a way over the trackless wastes of ocean we know nothing To hug the land and go blundering about what you so aptly call this pestilent archipelago is for us to court disaster as you can perhaps conceive 
224_129790_000057_000009	train-clean-360	And so it comes to this We desire to make for the Dutch settlement of Curacao as straightly as possible 
224_129790_000057_000010	train-clean-360	Will you pledge me your honour if I release you upon parole that you will navigate us thither 
none	none	If so we will release you and your surviving men upon arrival there 
224_129790_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Don Diego bowed his head upon his breast and strode away in thought to the stern windows 
none	none	There he stood looking out upon the sunlit sea and the dead water in the great ship s wake his ship which these English dogs had wrested from him his ship which he was asked to bring safely into a port where she would be completely lost to him and refitted perhaps to make war upon his kin 
224_129790_000058_000002	train-clean-360	That was in one scale in the other were the lives of sixteen men 
224_129790_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Fourteen of them mattered little to him but the remaining two were his own and his son s 
none	none	He turned at length and his back being to the light the Captain could not see how pale his face had grown I accept he said CHAPTER XI FILIAL PIETY By virtue of the pledge he had given Don Diego de Espinosa enjoyed the freedom of the ship that had been his and the navigation which he had undertaken was left entirely in his hands And because those who manned her were new to the seas of the Spanish Main and because even the things that had happened in Bridgetown were not enough to teach them to regard every Spaniard as a treacherous cruel dog to be slain at sight they used him with the civility which his own suave urbanity invited He took his meals in the great cabin with Blood and the three officers elected to support him Hagthorpe Wolverstone and Dyke They found Don Diego an agreeable even an amusing companion and their friendly feeling towards him was fostered by his fortitude and brave equanimity in this adversity That Don Diego was not playing fair it was impossible to suspect Moreover there was no conceivable reason why he should not And he had been of the utmost frankness with them He had denounced their mistake in sailing before the wind upon leaving Barbados They should have left the island to leeward heading into the Caribbean and away from the archipelago As it was they would now be forced to pass through this archipelago again so as to make Curacao and this passage was not to be accomplished without some measure of risk to themselves At any point between the islands they might come upon an equal or superior craft whether she were Spanish or English would be equally bad for them and being undermanned they were in no case to fight To lessen this risk as far as possible Don Diego directed at first a southerly and then a westerly course and so taking a line midway between the islands of Tobago and Grenada they won safely through the danger zone and came into the comparative security of the Caribbean Sea If this wind holds he told them that night at supper after he had announced to them their position we should reach Curacao inside three days For three days the wind held indeed it freshened a little on the second and yet when the third night descended upon them they had still made no landfall The Cinco Llagas was ploughing through a sea contained on every side by the blue bowl of heaven Captain Blood uneasily mentioned it to Don Diego It will be for to morrow morning he was answered with calm conviction By all the saints it is always to morrow morning with you Spaniards and to morrow never comes my friend But this to morrow is coming rest assured However early you may be astir you shall see land ahead Don Pedro Captain Blood passed on content and went to visit Jerry Pitt his patient to whose condition Don Diego owed his chance of life For twenty four hours now the fever had left the sufferer and under Peter Blood s dressings his lacerated back was beginning to heal satisfactorily So far indeed was he recovered that he complained of his confinement of the heat in his cabin To indulge him Captain Blood consented that he should take the air on deck and so as the last of the daylight was fading from the sky Jeremy Pitt came forth upon the Captain s arm Seated on the hatch coamings the Somersetshire lad gratefully filled his lungs with the cool night air and professed himself revived thereby Then with the seaman s instinct his eyes wandered to the darkling vault of heaven spangled already with a myriad golden points of light Awhile he scanned it idly vacantly then his attention became sharply fixed He looked round and up at Captain Blood who stood beside him D ye know anything of astronomy Peter quoth he Astronomy is it Faith now I couldn t tell the Belt of Orion from the Girdle of Venus Ah And I suppose all the others of this lubberly crew share your ignorance It would be more amiable of you to suppose that they exceed it Jeremy pointed ahead to a spot of light in the heavens over the starboard bow That is the North Star said he Is it now Glory be I wonder ye can pick it out from the rest And the North Star ahead almost over your starboard bow means that we re steering a course north northwest or maybe north by west for I doubt if we are standing more than ten degrees westward And why shouldn t we wondered Captain Blood You told me didn t you that we came west of the archipelago between Tobago and Grenada steering for Curacao If that were our present course we should have the North Star abeam out yonder On the instant mister Blood shed his laziness He stiffened with apprehension and was about to speak when a shaft of light clove the gloom above their heads coming from the door of the poop cabin which had just been opened It closed again and presently there was a step on the companion Don Diego was approaching Captain Blood s fingers pressed Jerry s shoulder with significance Then he called the Don and spoke to him in English as had become his custom when others were present Will ye settle a slight dispute for us Don Diego said he lightly We are arguing mister Pitt and I as to which is the North Star So The Spaniard s tone was easy there was almost a suggestion that laughter lurked behind it and the reason for this was yielded by his next sentence But you tell me mister Pitt he is your navigant For lack of a better laughed the Captain good humouredly contemptuous Now I am ready to wager him a hundred pieces of eight that that is the North Star And he flung out an arm towards a point of light in the heavens straight abeam He afterwards told Pitt that had Don Diego confirmed him he would have run him through upon that instant Far from that however the Spaniard freely expressed his scorn You have the assurance that is of ignorance Don Pedro and you lose The North Star is this one And he indicated it You are sure But my dear Don Pedro The Spaniard s tone was one of amused protest But is it possible that I mistake Besides is there not the compass Come to the binnacle and see there what course we make His utter frankness and the easy manner of one who has nothing to conceal resolved at once the doubt that had leapt so suddenly in the mind of Captain Blood Pitt was satisfied less easily In that case Don Diego will you tell me since Curacao is our destination why our course is what it is Again there was no faintest hesitation on Don Diego s part You have reason to ask said he and sighed I had hope it would not be observe I have been careless oh of a carelessness very culpable I neglect observation Always it is my way I make too sure I count too much on dead reckoning And so to day I find when at last I take out the quadrant that we do come by a half degree too much south so that Curacao is now almost due north That is what cause the delay But we will be there to morrow The explanation so completely satisfactory and so readily and candidly forthcoming left no room for further doubt that Don Diego should have been false to his parole And when presently Don Diego had withdrawn again Captain Blood confessed to Pitt that it was absurd to have suspected him Whatever his antecedents he had proved his quality when he announced himself ready to die sooner than enter into any undertaking that could hurt his honour or his country New to the seas of the Spanish Main and to the ways of the adventurers who sailed it Captain Blood still entertained illusions But the next dawn was to shatter them rudely and for ever Coming on deck before the sun was up he saw land ahead as the Spaniard had promised them last night Some ten miles ahead it lay a long coast line filling the horizon east and west with a massive headland jutting forward straight before them Staring at it he frowned He had not conceived that Curacao was of such considerable dimensions Indeed this looked less like an island than the main itself Beating out aweather against the gentle landward breeze he beheld a great ship on their starboard bow that he conceived to be some three or four miles off and as well as he could judge her at that distance of a tonnage equal if not superior to their own Even as he watched her she altered her course and going about came heading towards them close hauled A dozen of his fellows were astir on the forecastle looking eagerly ahead and the sound of their voices and laughter reached him across the length of the stately Cinco Llagas There said a soft voice behind him in liquid Spanish is the Promised Land Don Pedro It was something in that voice a muffled note of exultation that awoke suspicion in him and made whole the half doubt he had been entertaining He turned sharply to face Don Diego so sharply that the sly smile was not effaced from the Spaniard s countenance before Captain Blood s eyes had flashed upon it You find an odd satisfaction in the sight of it all things considered said mister Blood Of course The Spaniard rubbed his hands and mister Blood observed that they were unsteady The satisfaction of a mariner Or of a traitor which Blood asked him quietly And as the Spaniard fell back before him with suddenly altered countenance that confirmed his every suspicion he flung an arm out in the direction of the distant shore What land is that he demanded Will you have the effrontery to tell me that is the coast of Curacao He advanced upon Don Diego suddenly and Don Diego step by step fell back Shall I tell you what land it is Shall I His fierce assumption of knowledge seemed to dazzle and daze the Spaniard For still Don Diego made no answer And then Captain Blood drew a bow at a venture or not quite at a venture Such a coast line as that if not of the main itself and the main he knew it could not be must belong to either Cuba or Hispaniola Now knowing Cuba to lie farther north and west of the two it followed he reasoned swiftly that if Don Diego meant betrayal he would steer for the nearer of these Spanish territories That land you treacherous forsworn Spanish dog is the island of Hispaniola Having said it he closely watched the swarthy face now overspread with pallor to see the truth or falsehood of his guess reflected there But now the retreating Spaniard had come to the middle of the quarter deck where the mizzen sail made a screen to shut them off from the eyes of the Englishmen below His lips writhed in a snarling smile Ah perro ingles You know too much he said under his breath and sprang for the Captain s throat Tight locked in each other s arms they swayed a moment then together went down upon the deck the Spaniard s feet jerked from under him by the right leg of Captain Blood The Spaniard had depended upon his strength which was considerable But it proved no match for the steady muscles of the Irishman tempered of late by the vicissitudes of slavery He had depended upon choking the life out of Blood and so gaining the half hour that might be necessary to bring up that fine ship that was beating towards them a Spanish ship perforce since none other would be so boldly cruising in these Spanish waters off Hispaniola But all that Don Diego had accomplished was to betray himself completely and to no purpose This he realized when he found himself upon his back pinned down by Blood who was kneeling on his chest whilst the men summoned by their Captain s shout came clattering up the companion Will I say a prayer for your dirty soul now whilst I am in this position Captain Blood was furiously mocking him But the Spaniard though defeated now beyond hope for himself forced his lips to smile and gave back mockery for mockery Who will pray for your soul I wonder when that galleon comes to lie board and board with you That galleon echoed Captain Blood with sudden and awful realization that already it was too late to avoid the consequences of Don Diego s betrayal of them That galleon Don Diego repeated and added with a deepening sneer Do you know what ship it is I will tell you It is the Encarnacion the flagship of Don Miguel de Espinosa the Lord Admiral of Castile and Don Miguel is my brother It is a very fortunate encounter The Almighty you see watches over the destinies of Catholic Spain There was no trace of humour or urbanity now in Captain Blood His light eyes blazed his face was set He rose relinquishing the Spaniard to his men Make him fast he bade them Truss him wrist and heel but don t hurt him not so much as a hair of his precious head The injunction was very necessary Frenzied by the thought that they were likely to exchange the slavery from which they had so lately escaped for a slavery still worse they would have torn the Spaniard limb from limb upon the spot And if they now obeyed their Captain and refrained it was only because the sudden steely note in his voice promised for Don Diego Valdez something far more exquisite than death You scum You dirty pirate You man of honour Captain Blood apostrophized his prisoner But Don Diego looked up at him and laughed You underrated me He spoke English so that all might hear I tell you that I was not fear death and I show you that I was not fear it You no understand You just an English dog Irish if you please Captain Blood corrected him And your parole you tyke of Spain You think I give my parole to leave you sons of filth with this beautiful Spanish ship to go make war upon other Spaniards Ha Don Diego laughed in his throat You fool You can kill me Pish It is very well I die with my work well done In less than an hour you will be the prisoners of Spain and the Cinco Llagas will go belong to Spain again Captain Blood regarded him steadily out of a face which if impassive had paled under its deep tan About the prisoner clamant infuriated ferocious the rebels convict surged almost literally athirst for his blood Wait Captain Blood imperiously commanded and turning on his heel he went aside to the rail As he stood there deep in thought he was joined by Hagthorpe Wolverstone and Ogle the gunner In silence they stared with him across the water at that other ship She had veered a point away from the wind and was running now on a line that must in the end converge with that of the Cinco Llagas In less than half an hour said Blood presently we shall have her athwart our hawse sweeping our decks with her guns We can fight said the one eyed giant with an oath Fight sneered Blood Undermanned as we are mustering a bare twenty men in what case are we to fight No there would be only one way To persuade her that all is well aboard that we are Spaniards so that she may leave us to continue on our course And how is that possible Hagthorpe asked It isn t possible said Blood If it And then he broke off and stood musing his eyes upon the green water Ogle with a bent for sarcasm interposed a suggestion bitterly We might send Don Diego de Espinosa in a boat manned by his Spaniards to assure his brother the Admiral that we are all loyal subjects of his Catholic Majesty The Captain swung round and for an instant looked as if he would have struck the gunner Then his expression changed the light of inspiration Was in his glance Bedad ye ve said it He doesn t fear death this damned pirate but his son may take a different view Filial piety s mighty strong in Spain He swung on his heel abruptly and strode back to the knot of men about his prisoner Here he shouted to them Bring him below And he led the way down to the waist and thence by the booby hatch to the gloom of the tween decks where the air was rank with the smell of tar and spun yarn Going aft he threw open the door of the spacious wardroom and went in followed by a dozen of the hands with the pinioned Spaniard Every man aboard would have followed him but for his sharp command to some of them to remain on deck with Hagthorpe In the ward room the three stern chasers were in position loaded their muzzles thrusting through the open ports precisely as the Spanish gunners had left them Here Ogle is work for you said Blood and as the burly gunner came thrusting forward through the little throng of gaping men Blood pointed to the middle chaser Have that gun hauled back he ordered When this was done Blood beckoned those who held Don Diego Lash him across the mouth of it he bade them and whilst assisted by another two they made haste to obey he turned to the others To the roundhouse some of you and fetch the Spanish prisoners And you Dyke go up and bid them set the flag of Spain aloft Don Diego with his body stretched in an arc across the cannon s mouth legs and arms lashed to the carriage on either side of it eyeballs rolling in his head glared maniacally at Captain Blood A man may not fear to die and yet be appalled by the form in which death comes to him From frothing lips he hurled blasphemies and insults at his tormentor Foul barbarian Inhuman savage Accursed heretic Will it not content you to kill me in some Christian fashion Captain Blood vouchsafed him a malignant smile before he turned to meet the fifteen manacled Spanish prisoners who were thrust into his presence Approaching they had heard Don Diego s outcries at close quarters now they beheld with horror stricken eyes his plight From amongst them a comely olive skinned stripling distinguished in bearing and apparel from his companions started forward with an anguished cry of Father Writhing in the arms that made haste to seize and hold him he called upon heaven and hell to avert this horror and lastly addressed to Captain Blood an appeal for mercy that was at once fierce and piteous Considering him Captain Blood thought with satisfaction that he displayed the proper degree of filial piety He afterwards confessed that for a moment he was in danger of weakening that for a moment his mind rebelled against the pitiless thing it had planned But to correct the sentiment he evoked a memory of what these Spaniards had performed in Bridgetown Again he saw the white face of that child Mary Traill as she fled in horror before the jeering ruffian whom he had slain and other things even more unspeakable seen on that dreadful evening rose now before the eyes of his memory to stiffen his faltering purpose The Spaniards had shown themselves without mercy or sentiment or decency of any kind stuffed with religion they were without a spark of that Christianity the Symbol of which was mounted on the mainmast of the approaching ship A moment ago this cruel vicious Don Diego had insulted the Almighty by his assumption that He kept a specially benevolent watch over the destinies of Catholic Spain Don Diego should be taught his error Recovering the cynicism in which he had approached his task the cynicism essential to its proper performance he commanded Ogle to kindle a match and remove the leaden apron from the touch hole of the gun that bore Don Diego Then as the younger Espinosa broke into fresh intercessions mingled with imprecations he wheeled upon him sharply Peace he snapped Peace and listen It is no part of my intention to blow your father to hell as he deserves or indeed to take his life at all Having surprised the lad into silence by that promise a promise surprising enough in all the circumstances he proceeded to explain his aims in that faultless and elegant Castilian of which he was fortunately master as fortunately for Don Diego as for himself It is your father s treachery that has brought us into this plight and deliberately into risk of capture and death aboard that ship of Spain Just as your father recognized his brother s flagship so will his brother have recognized the Cinco Llagas So far then all is well But presently the Encarnacion will be sufficiently close to perceive that here all is not as it should be Sooner or later she must guess or discover what is wrong and then she will open fire or lay us board and board Now we are in no case to fight as your father knew when he ran us into this trap But fight we will if we are driven to it We make no tame surrender to the ferocity of Spain He laid his hand on the breech of the gun that bore Don Diego Understand this clearly to the first shot from the Encarnacion this gun will fire the answer I make myself clear I hope White faced and trembling young Espinosa stared into the pitiless blue eyes that so steadily regarded him If it is clear he faltered breaking the utter silence in which all were standing But name of God how should it be clear How should I understand Can you avert the fight If you know a way and if I or these can help you to it if that is what you mean in Heaven s name let me hear it A fight would be averted if Don Diego de Espinosa were to go aboard his brother s ship and by his presence and assurances inform the Admiral that all is well with the Cinco Llagas that she is indeed still a ship of Spain as her flag now announces But of course Don Diego cannot go in person because he is otherwise engaged He has a slight touch of fever shall we say that detains him in his cabin But you his son may convey all this and some other matters together with his homage to your uncle You shall go in a boat manned by six of these Spanish prisoners and I a distinguished Spaniard delivered from captivity in Barbados by your recent raid will accompany you to keep you in countenance If I return alive and without accident of any kind to hinder our free sailing hence Don Diego shall have his life as shall every one of you But if there is the least misadventure be it from treachery or ill fortune I care not which the battle as I have had the honour to explain will be opened on our side by this gun and your father will be the first victim of the conflict He paused a moment There was a hum of approval from his comrades an anxious stirring among the Spanish prisoners Young Espinosa stood before him the colour ebbing and flowing in his cheeks He waited for some direction from his father But none came Don Diego s courage it seemed had sadly waned under that rude test He hung limply in his fearful bonds and was silent Evidently he dared not encourage his son to defiance and presumably was ashamed to urge him to yield Thus he left decision entirely with the youth Come said Blood I have been clear enough I think What do you say Don Esteban moistened his parched lips and with the back of his hand mopped the anguish sweat from his brow His eyes gazed wildly a moment upon the shoulders of his father as if beseeching guidance But his father remained silent Something like a sob escaped the boy I I accept he answered at last and swung to the Spaniards And you you will accept too he insisted passionately For Don Diego s sake and for your own for all our sakes If you do not this man will butcher us all without mercy Since he yielded and their leader himself counselled no resistance why should they encompass their own destruction by a gesture of futile heroism They answered without much hesitation that they would do as was required of them Blood turned and advanced to Don Diego I am sorry to inconvenience you in this fashion but For a second he checked and frowned as his eyes intently observed the prisoner Then after that scarcely perceptible pause he continued but I do not think that you have anything beyond this inconvenience to apprehend and you may depend upon me to shorten it as far as possible Don Diego made him no answer Peter Blood waited a moment observing him then he bowed and stepped back CHAPTER XII DON PEDRO SANGRE The Cinco Llagas and the Encarnacion after a proper exchange of signals lay hove to within a quarter of a mile of each other and across the intervening space of gently heaving sunlit waters sped a boat from the former manned by six Spanish seamen and bearing in her stern sheets Don Esteban de Espinosa and Captain Peter Blood She also bore two treasure chests containing fifty thousand pieces of eight Gold has at all times been considered the best of testimonies of good faith and Blood was determined that in all respects appearances should be entirely on his side His followers had accounted this a supererogation of pretence But Blood s will in the matter had prevailed He carried further a bulky package addressed to a grande of Spain heavily sealed with the arms of Espinosa another piece of evidence hastily manufactured in the cabin of the Cinco Llagas and he was spending these last moments in completing his instructions to his young companion Don Esteban expressed his last lingering uneasiness But if you should betray yourself he cried It will be unfortunate for everybody I advised your father to say a prayer for our success I depend upon you to help me more materially I will do my best God knows I will do my best the boy protested Blood nodded thoughtfully and no more was said until they bumped alongside the towering mass of the Encarnadon Up the ladder went Don Esteban closely followed by Captain Blood In the waist stood the Admiral himself to receive them a handsome self sufficient man very tall and stiff a little older and greyer than Don Diego whom he closely resembled He was supported by four officers and a friar in the black and white habit of saint Dominic Don Miguel opened his arms to his nephew whose lingering panic he mistook for pleasurable excitement and having enfolded him to his bosom turned to greet Don Esteban s companion Peter Blood bowed gracefully entirely at his ease so far as might be judged from appearances I am he announced making a literal translation of his name Don Pedro Sangre an unfortunate gentleman of Leon lately delivered from captivity by Don Esteban s most gallant father And in a few words he sketched the imagined conditions of his capture by and deliverance from those accursed heretics who held the island of Barbados Benedicamus Domino said the friar to his tale Ex hoc nunc et usque in seculum replied Blood the occasional papist with lowered eyes The Admiral and his attending officers gave him a sympathetic hearing and a cordial welcome Then came the dreaded question But where is my brother Why has he not come himself to greet me It was young Espinosa who answered this My father is afflicted at denying himself that honour and pleasure But unfortunately sir uncle he is a little indisposed oh nothing grave merely sufficient to make him keep his cabin It is a little fever the result of a slight wound taken in the recent raid upon Barbados which resulted in this gentleman s happy deliverance Nay nephew nay Don Miguel protested with ironic repudiation I can have no knowledge of these things I have the honour to represent upon the seas His Catholic Majesty who is at peace with the King of England Already you have told me more than it is good for me to know I will endeavour to forget it and I will ask you sirs he added glancing at his officers to forget it also But he winked into the twinkling eyes of Captain Blood then added matter that at once extinguished that twinkle But since Diego cannot come to me why I will go across to him For a moment Don Esteban s face was a mask of pallid fear Then Blood was speaking in a lowered confidential voice that admirably blended suavity impressiveness and sly mockery If you please Don Miguel but that is the very thing you must not do the very thing Don Diego does not wish you to do You must not see him until his wounds are healed That is his own wish That is the real reason why he is not here For the truth is that his wounds are not so grave as to have prevented his coming It was his consideration of himself and the false position in which you would be placed if you had direct word from him of what has happened As your excellency has said there is peace between His Catholic Majesty and the King of England and your brother Don Diego He paused a moment I am sure that I need say no more What you hear from us is no more than a mere rumour Your excellency understands His excellency frowned thoughtfully I understand in part said he Captain Blood had a moment s uneasiness Did the Spaniard doubt his bona fides Yet in dress and speech he knew himself to be impeccably Spanish and was not Don Esteban there to confirm him He swept on to afford further confirmation before the Admiral could say another word And we have in the boat below two chests containing fifty thousand pieces of eight which we are to deliver to your excellency His excellency jumped there was a sudden stir among his officers They are the ransom extracted by Don Diego from the Governor of Not another word in the name of Heaven cried the Admiral in alarm My brother wishes me to assume charge of this money to carry it to Spain for him Well that is a family matter between my brother and myself So it can be done But I must not know He broke off Hum A glass of Malaga in my cabin if you please he invited them whilst the chests are being hauled aboard He gave his orders touching the embarkation of these chests then led the way to his regally appointed cabin his four officers and the friar following by particular invitation Seated at table there with the tawny wine before them and the servant who had poured it withdrawn Don Miguel laughed and stroked his pointed grizzled beard Virgen santisima That brother of mine has a mind that thinks of everything Left to myself I might have committed a fine indiscretion by venturing aboard his ship at such a moment I might have seen things which as Admiral of Spain it would be difficult for me to ignore Both Esteban and Blood made haste to agree with him and then Blood raised his glass and drank to the glory of Spain and the damnation of the besotted James who occupied the throne of England The latter part of his toast was at least sincere The Admiral laughed Sir sir you need my brother here to curb your imprudences You should remember that His Catholic Majesty and the King of England are very good friends That is not a toast to propose in this cabin But since it has been proposed and by one who has such particular personal cause to hate these English hounds why we will honour it but unofficially They laughed and drank the damnation of King James quite unofficially but the more fervently on that account Then Don Esteban uneasy on the score of his father and remembering that the agony of Don Diego was being protracted with every moment that they left him in his dreadful position rose and announced that they must be returning My father he explained is in haste to reach San Domingo He desired me to stay no longer than necessary to embrace you If you will give us leave then sir uncle In the circumstances sir uncle did not insist As they returned to the ship s side Blood s eyes anxiously scanned the line of seamen leaning over the bulwarks in idle talk with the Spaniards in the cock boat that waited at the ladder s foot But their manner showed him that there was no ground for his anxiety The boat s crew had been wisely reticent The Admiral took leave of them of Esteban affectionately of Blood ceremoniously I regret to lose you so soon Don Pedro I wish that you could have made a longer visit to the Encarnacion I am indeed unfortunate said Captain Blood politely But I hope that we may meet again That is to flatter me beyond all that I deserve They reached the boat and she cast off from the great ship As they were pulling away the Admiral waving to them from the taffrail they heard the shrill whistle of the bo sun piping the hands to their stations and before they had reached the Cinco Llagas they beheld the Encarnacion go about under sail She dipped her flag to them and from her poop a gun fired a salute Aboard the Cinco Llagas some one it proved afterwards to be Hagthorpe had the wit to reply in the same fashion The comedy was ended Yet there was something else to follow as an epilogue a thing that added a grim ironic flavour to the whole As they stepped into the waist of the Cinco Llagas Hagthorpe advanced to receive them Blood observed the set almost scared expression on his face I see that you ve found it he said quietly Hagthorpe s eyes looked a question But his mind dismissed whatever thought it held Don Diego he was beginning and then stopped and looked curiously at Blood Noting the pause and the look Esteban bounded forward his face livid Have you broken faith you curs Has he come to harm he cried and the six Spaniards behind him grew clamorous with furious questionings We do not break faith said Hagthorpe firmly so firmly that he quieted them And in this case there was not the need Don Diego died in his bonds before ever you reached the Encarnacion Peter Blood said nothing Died screamed Esteban You killed him you mean Of what did he die Hagthorpe looked at the boy If I am a judge he said Don Diego died of fear Don Esteban struck Hagthorpe across the face at that and Hagthorpe would have struck back but that Blood got between whilst his followers seized the lad Let be said Blood You provoked the boy by your insult to his father I was not concerned to insult said Hagthorpe nursing his cheek It is what has happened Come and look I have seen said Blood He died before I left the Cinco Llagas He was hanging dead in his bonds when I spoke to him before leaving What are you saying cried Esteban Blood looked at him gravely Yet for all his gravity he seemed almost to smile though without mirth If you had known that eh he asked at last For a moment Don Esteban stared at him wide eyed incredulous I don t believe you he said at last Yet you may I am a doctor and I know death when I see it Again there came a pause whilst conviction sank into the lad s mind If I had known that he said at last in a thick voice you would be hanging from the yardarm of the Encarnacion at this moment I know said Blood I am considering it the profit that a man may find in the ignorance of others But you ll hang there yet the boy raved Captain Blood shrugged and turned on his heel But he did not on that account disregard the words nor did Hagthorpe nor yet the others who overheard them as they showed at a council held that night in the cabin This council was met to determine what should be done with the Spanish prisoners Considering that Curacao now lay beyond their reach as they were running short of water and provisions and also that Pitt was hardly yet in case to undertake the navigation of the vessel it had been decided that going east of Hispaniola and then sailing along its northern coast they should make for Tortuga that haven of the buccaneers in which lawless port they had at least no danger of recapture to apprehend It was now a question whether they should convey the Spaniards thither with them or turn them off in a boat to make the best of their way to the coast of Hispaniola which was but ten miles off This was the course urged by Blood himself There s nothing else to be done he insisted In Tortuga they would be flayed alive Which is less than the swine deserve growled Wolverstone And you ll remember Peter put in Hagthorpe that boy s threat to you this morning If he escapes and carries word of all this to his uncle the Admiral the execution of that threat will become more than possible It says much for Peter Blood that the argument should have left him unmoved It is a little thing perhaps but in a narrative in which there is so much that tells against him I cannot since my story is in the nature of a brief for the defence afford to slur a circumstance that is so strongly in his favour a circumstance revealing that the cynicism attributed to him proceeded from his reason and from a brooding over wrongs rather than from any natural instincts I care nothing for his threats You should said Wolverstone The wise thing d be to hang him along o all the rest It is not human to be wise said Blood It is much more human to err though perhaps exceptional to err on the side of mercy We ll be exceptional Oh faugh I ve no stomach for cold blooded killing At daybreak pack the Spaniards into a boat with a keg of water and a sack of dumplings and let them go to the devil That was his last word on the subject and it prevailed by virtue of the authority they had vested in him and of which he had taken so firm a grip At daybreak Don Esteban and his followers were put off in a boat Two days later the Cinco Llagas sailed into the rock bound bay of Cayona which Nature seemed to have designed for the stronghold of those who had appropriated it CHAPTER XIII TORTUGA It is time fully to disclose the fact that the survival of the story of Captain Blood s exploits is due entirely to the industry of Jeremy Pitt the Somersetshire shipmaster In addition to his ability as a navigator this amiable young man appears to have wielded an indefatigable pen and to have been inspired to indulge its fluency by the affection he very obviously bore to Peter Blood He kept the log of the forty gun frigate Arabella on which he served as master or as we should say to day navigating officer as no log that I have seen was ever kept It runs into some twenty odd volumes of assorted sizes some of which are missing altogether and others of which are so sadly depleted of leaves as to be of little use But if at times in the laborious perusal of them they are preserved in the library of mister James Speke of Comerton I have inveighed against these lacunae at others I have been equally troubled by the excessive prolixity of what remains and the difficulty of disintegrating from the confused whole the really essential parts I have a suspicion that Esquemeling though how or where I can make no surmise must have obtained access to these records and that he plucked from them the brilliant feathers of several exploits to stick them into the tail of his own hero Captain Morgan But that is by the way I mention it chiefly as a warning for when presently I come to relate the affair of Maracaybo those of you who have read Esquemeling may be in danger of supposing that Henry Morgan really performed those things which here are veraciously attributed to Peter Blood I think however that when you come to weigh the motives actuating both Blood and the Spanish Admiral in that affair and when you consider how integrally the event is a part of Blood s history whilst merely a detached incident in Morgan s you will reach my own conclusion as to which is the real plagiarist The first of these logs of Pitt s is taken up almost entirely with a retrospective narrative of the events up to the time of Blood s first coming to Tortuga This and the Tannatt Collection of State Trials are the chief though not the only sources of my history so far Pitt lays great stress upon the fact that it was the circumstances upon which I have dwelt and these alone that drove Peter Blood to seek an anchorage at Tortuga He insists at considerable length and with a vehemence which in itself makes it plain that an opposite opinion was held in some quarters that it was no part of the design of Blood or of any of his companions in misfortune to join hands with the buccaneers who under a semi official French protection made of Tortuga a lair whence they could sally out to drive their merciless piratical trade chiefly at the expense of Spain It was Pitt tells us Blood s original intention to make his way to France or Holland But in the long weeks of waiting for a ship to convey him to one or the other of these countries his resources dwindled and finally vanished Also his chronicler thinks that he detected signs of some secret trouble in his friend and he attributes to this the abuses of the potent West Indian spirit of which Blood became guilty in those days of inaction thereby sinking to the level of the wild adventurers with whom ashore he associated I do not think that Pitt is guilty in this merely of special pleading that he is putting forward excuses for his hero I think that in those days there was a good deal to oppress Peter Blood There was the thought of Arabella Bishop and that this thought loomed large in his mind we are not permitted to doubt He was maddened by the tormenting lure of the unattainable He desired Arabella yet knew her beyond his reach irrevocably and for all time Also whilst he may have desired to go to France or Holland he had no clear purpose to accomplish when he reached one or the other of these countries He was when all is said an escaped slave an outlaw in his own land and a homeless outcast in any other There remained the sea which is free to all and particularly alluring to those who feel themselves at war with humanity And so considering the adventurous spirit that once already had sent him a roving for the sheer love of it considering that this spirit was heightened now by a recklessness begotten of his outlawry that his training and skill in militant seamanship clamorously supported the temptations that were put before him can you wonder or dare you blame him that in the end he succumbed And remember that these temptations proceeded not only from adventurous buccaneering acquaintances in the taverns of that evil haven of Tortuga but even from M d Ogeron the governor of the island who levied as his harbour dues a percentage of one tenth of all spoils brought into the bay and who profited further by commissions upon money which he was desired to convert into bills of exchange upon France A trade that might have worn a repellent aspect when urged by greasy half drunken adventurers boucan hunters lumbermen beach combers English French and Dutch became a dignified almost official form of privateering when advocated by the courtly middle aged gentleman who in representing the French West India Company seemed to represent France herself Moreover to a man not excluding Jeremy Pitt himself in whose blood the call of the sea was insistent and imperative those who had escaped with Peter Blood from the Barbados plantations and who consequently like himself knew not whither to turn were all resolved upon joining the great Brotherhood of the Coast as those rovers called themselves And they united theirs to the other voices that were persuading Blood demanding that he should continue now in the leadership which he had enjoyed since they had left Barbados and swearing to follow him loyally whithersoever he should lead them And so to condense all that Jeremy has recorded in the matter Blood ended by yielding to external and internal pressure abandoned himself to the stream of Destiny Fata viam invenerunt is his own expression of it If he resisted so long it was I think the thought of Arabella Bishop that restrained him That they should be destined never to meet again did not weigh at first or indeed ever He conceived the scorn with which she would come to hear of his having turned pirate and the scorn though as yet no more than imagined hurt him as if it were already a reality And even when he conquered this still the thought of her was ever present He compromised with the conscience that her memory kept so disconcertingly active He vowed that the thought of her should continue ever before him to help him keep his hands as clean as a man might in this desperate trade upon which he was embarking And so although he might entertain no delusive hope of ever winning her for his own of ever even seeing her again yet the memory of her was to abide in his soul as a bitter sweet purifying influence The love that is never to be realized will often remain a man s guiding ideal The resolve being taken he went actively to work Ogeron most accommodating of governors advanced him money for the proper equipment of his ship the Cinco Llagas which he renamed the Arabella This after some little hesitation fearful of thus setting his heart upon his sleeve But his Barbados friends accounted it merely an expression of the ever ready irony in which their leader dealt To the score of followers he already possessed he added threescore more picking his men with caution and discrimination and he was an exceptional judge of men from amongst the adventurers of Tortuga With them all he entered into the articles usual among the Brethren of the Coast under which each man was to be paid by a share in the prizes captured In other respects however the articles were different Aboard the Arabella there was to be none of the ruffianly indiscipline that normally prevailed in buccaneering vessels Those who shipped with him undertook obedience and submission in all things to himself and to the officers appointed by election Any to whom this clause in the articles was distasteful might follow some other leader Towards the end of December when the hurricane season had blown itself out he put to sea in his well found well manned ship and before he returned in the following May from a protracted and adventurous cruise the fame of Captain Peter Blood had run like ripples before the breeze across the face of the Caribbean Sea There was a fight in the Windward Passage at the outset with a Spanish galleon which had resulted in the gutting and finally the sinking of the Spaniard There was a daring raid effected by means of several appropriated piraguas upon a Spanish pearl fleet in the Rio de la Hacha from which they had taken a particularly rich haul of pearls There was an overland expedition to the goldfields of Santa Maria on the Main the full tale of which is hardly credible and there were lesser adventures through all of which the crew of the Arabella came with credit and profit if not entirely unscathed And so it happened that before the Arabella came homing to Tortuga in the following May to refit and repair for she was not without scars as you conceive the fame of her and of Peter Blood her captain had swept from the Bahamas to the Windward Isles from New Providence to Trinidad An echo of it had reached Europe and at the Court of saint James s angry representations were made by the Ambassador of Spain to whom it was answered that it must not be supposed that this Captain Blood held any commission from the King of England that he was in fact a proscribed rebel an escaped slave and that any measures against him by His Catholic Majesty would receive the cordial approbation of King James II Don Miguel de Espinosa the Admiral of Spain in the West Indies and his nephew Don Esteban who sailed with him did not lack the will to bring the adventurer to the yardarm With them this business of capturing Blood which was now an international affair was also a family matter Spain through the mouth of Don Miguel did not spare her threats The report of them reached Tortuga and with it the assurance that Don Miguel had behind him not only the authority of his own nation but that of the English King as well It was a brutum fulmen that inspired no terrors in Captain Blood Nor was he likely on account of it to allow himself to run to rust in the security of Tortuga For what he had suffered at the hands of Man he had chosen to make Spain the scapegoat Thus he accounted that he served a twofold purpose he took compensation and at the same time served not indeed the Stuart King whom he despised but England and for that matter all the rest of civilized mankind which cruel treacherous greedy bigoted Castile sought to exclude from intercourse with the New World One day as he sat with Hagthorpe and Wolverstone over a pipe and a bottle of rum in the stifling reek of tar and stale tobacco of a waterside tavern he was accosted by a splendid ruffian in a gold laced coat of dark blue satin with a crimson sash a foot wide about the waist C est vous qu on appelle Le Sang the fellow hailed him Captain Blood looked up to consider the questioner before replying The man was tall and built on lines of agile strength with a swarthy aquiline face that was brutally handsome A diamond of great price flamed on the indifferently clean hand resting on the pummel of his long rapier and there were gold rings in his ears half concealed by long ringlets of oily chestnut hair Captain Blood took the pipe stem from between his lips My name he said is Peter Blood The Spaniards know me for Don Pedro Sangre and a Frenchman may call me Le Sang if he pleases Good said the gaudy adventurer in English and without further invitation he drew up a stool and sat down at that greasy table My name he informed the three men two of whom at least were eyeing him askance it is Levasseur You may have heard of me They had indeed He commanded a privateer of twenty guns that had dropped anchor in the bay a week ago manned by a crew mainly composed of French boucanhunters from Northern Hispaniola men who had good cause to hate the Spaniard with an intensity exceeding that of the English Levasseur had brought them back to Tortuga from an indifferently successful cruise It would need more however than lack of success to abate the fellow s monstrous vanity A roaring quarrelsome hard drinking hard gaming scoundrel his reputation as a buccaneer stood high among the wild Brethren of the Coast He enjoyed also a reputation of another sort There was about his gaudy swaggering raffishness something that the women found singularly alluring That he should boast openly of his bonnes fortunes did not seem strange to Captain Blood what he might have found strange was that there appeared to be some measure of justification for these boasts It was current gossip that even Mademoiselle d Ogeron the Governor s daughter had been caught in the snare of his wild attractiveness and that Levasseur had gone the length of audacity of asking her hand in marriage of her father M d Ogeron had made him the only possible answer He had shown him the door Levasseur had departed in a rage swearing that he would make mademoiselle his wife in the teeth of all the fathers in Christendom and that M d Ogeron should bitterly rue the affront he had put upon him This was the man who now thrust himself upon Captain Blood with a proposal of association offering him not only his sword but his ship and the men who sailed in her A dozen years ago as a lad of barely twenty Levasseur had sailed with that monster of cruelty L Ollonais and his own subsequent exploits bore witness and did credit to the school in which he had been reared I doubt if in his day there was a greater scoundrel among the Brethren of the Coast than this Levasseur And yet repulsive though he found him Captain Blood could not deny that the fellow s proposals displayed boldness imagination and resource and he was forced to admit that jointly they could undertake operations of a greater magnitude than was possible singly to either of them The climax of Levasseur s project was to be a raid upon the wealthy mainland city of Maracaybo but for this he admitted six hundred men at the very least would be required and six hundred men were not to be conveyed in the two bottoms they now commanded Preliminary cruises must take place having for one of their objects the capture of further ships Because he disliked the man Captain Blood would not commit himself at once But because he liked the proposal he consented to consider it Being afterwards pressed by both Hagthorpe and Wolverstone who did not share his own personal dislike of the Frenchman the end of the matter was that within a week articles were drawn up between Levasseur and Blood and signed by them and as was usual by the chosen representatives of their followers These articles contained inter alia the common provisions that should the two vessels separate a strict account must afterwards be rendered of all prizes severally taken whilst the vessel taking a prize should retain three fifths of its value surrendering two fifths to its associate These shares were subsequently to be subdivided among the crew of each vessel in accordance with the articles already obtaining between each captain and his own men For the rest the articles contained all the clauses that were usual among which was the clause that any man found guilty of abstracting or concealing any part of a prize be it of the value of no more than a peso should be summarily hanged from the yardarm All being now settled they made ready for sea and on the very eve of sailing Levasseur narrowly escaped being shot in a romantic attempt to scale the wall of the Governor s garden with the object of taking passionate leave of the infatuated Mademoiselle d Ogeron He desisted after having been twice fired upon from a fragrant ambush of pimento trees where the Governor s guards were posted and he departed vowing to take different and very definite measures on his return That night he slept on board his ship which with characteristic flamboyance he had named La Foudre and there on the following day he received a visit from Captain Blood whom he greeted half mockingly as his admiral The Irishman came to settle certain final details of which all that need concern us is an understanding that in the event of the two vessels becoming separated by accident or design they should rejoin each other as soon as might be at Tortuga Thereafter Levasseur entertained his admiral to dinner and jointly they drank success to the expedition so copiously on the part of Levasseur that when the time came to separate he was as nearly drunk as it seemed possible for him to be and yet retain his understanding Finally towards evening Captain Blood went over the side and was rowed back to his great ship with her red bulwarks and gilded ports touched into a lovely thing of flame by the setting sun He was a little heavy hearted I have said that he was a judge of men and his judgment of Levasseur filled him with misgivings which were growing heavier in a measure as the hour of departure approached He expressed it to Wolverstone who met him as he stepped aboard the Arabella You over persuaded me into those articles you blackguard and it ll surprise me if any good comes of this association The giant rolled his single bloodthirsty eye and sneered thrusting out his heavy jaw We ll wring the dog s neck if there s any treachery So we will if we are there to wring it by then And on that dismissing the matter We sail in the morning on the first of the ebb he announced and went off to his cabin CHAPTER XIV LEVASSEUR S HEROICS It would be somewhere about ten o clock on the following morning a full hour before the time appointed for sailing when a canoe brought up alongside La Foudre and a half caste Indian stepped out of her and went up the ladder He was clad in drawers of hairy untanned hide and a red blanket served him for a cloak He was the bearer of a folded scrap of paper for Captain Levasseur The Captain unfolded the letter sadly soiled and crumpled by contact with the half caste s person Its contents may be roughly translated thus My well beloved I am in the Dutch brig Jongvrow which is about to sail Resolved to separate us for ever my cruel father is sending me to Europe in my brother s charge I implore you come to my rescue Deliver me my well beloved hero Your desolated Madeleine who loves you The well beloved hero was moved to the soul of him by that passionate appeal His scowling glance swept the bay for the Dutch brig which he knew had been due to sail for Amsterdam with a cargo of hides and tobacco She was nowhere to be seen among the shipping in that narrow rock bound harbour He roared out the question in his mind In answer the half caste pointed out beyond the frothing surf that marked the position of the reef constituting one of the stronghold s main defences Away beyond it a mile or so distant a sail was standing out to sea There she go he said There The Frenchman gazed and stared his face growing white The man s wicked temper awoke and turned to vent itself upon the messenger And where have you been that you come here only now with this Answer me The half caste shrank terrified before his fury His explanation if he had one was paralyzed by fear Levasseur took him by the throat shook him twice snarling the while then hurled him into the scuppers The man s head struck the gunwale as he fell and he lay there quite still a trickle of blood issuing from his mouth Levasseur dashed one hand against the other as if dusting them Heave that muck overboard he ordered some of those who stood idling in the waist Then up anchor and let us after the Dutchman Steady Captain What s that There was a restraining hand upon his shoulder and the broad face of his lieutenant Cahusac a burly callous Breton scoundrel was stolidly confronting him Levasseur made clear his purpose with a deal of unnecessary obscenity Cahusac shook his head A Dutch brig said he Impossible We should never be allowed And who the devil will deny us Levasseur was between amazement and fury For one thing there s your own crew will be none too willing For another there s Captain Blood I care nothing for Captain Blood But it is necessary that you should He has the power the weight of metal and of men and if I know him at all he ll sink us before he ll suffer interference with the Dutch He has his own views of privateering this Captain Blood as I warned you Ah said Levasseur showing his teeth But his eyes riveted upon that distant sail were gloomily thoughtful Not for long The imagination and resource which Captain Blood had detected in the fellow soon suggested a course Cursing in his soul and even before the anchor was weighed the association into which he had entered he was already studying ways of evasion What Cahusac implied was true Blood would never suffer violence to be done in his presence to a Dutchman but it might be done in his absence and being done Blood must perforce condone it since it would then be too late to protest Within the hour the Arabella and La Foudre were beating out to sea together Without understanding the change of plan involved Captain Blood nevertheless accepted it and weighed anchor before the appointed time upon perceiving his associate to do so All day the Dutch brig was in sight though by evening she had dwindled to the merest speck on the northern horizon The course prescribed for Blood and Levasseur lay eastward along the northern shores of Hispaniola To that course the Arabella continued to hold steadily throughout the night When day broke again she was alone La Foudre under cover of the darkness had struck away to The northeast with every rag of canvas on her yards Cahusac had attempted yet again to protest against this The devil take you Levasseur had answered him A ship s a ship be she Dutch or Spanish and ships are our present need That will suffice for the men His lieutenant said no more But from his glimpse of the letter knowing that a girl and not a ship was his captain s real objective he gloomily shook his head as he rolled away on his bowed legs to give the necessary orders Dawn found La Foudre close on the Dutchman s heels not a mile astern and the sight of her very evidently flustered the Jongvrow No doubt mademoiselle s brother recognizing Levasseur s ship would be responsible for the Dutch uneasiness They saw the Jongvrow crowding canvas in a futile endeavour to outsail them whereupon they stood off to starboard and raced on until they were in a position whence they could send a warning shot across her bow The Jongvrow veered showed them her rudder and opened fire with her stern chasers The small shot went whistling through La Foudre s shrouds with some slight damage to her canvas Followed a brief running fight in the course of which the Dutchman let fly a broadside Five minutes after that they were board and board the Jongvrow held tight in the clutches of La Foudre s grapnels and the buccaneers pouring noisily into her waist The Dutchman s master purple in the face stood forward to beard the pirate followed closely by an elegant pale faced young gentleman in whom Levasseur recognized his brother in law elect Captain Levasseur this is an outrage for which you shall be made to answer What do you seek aboard my ship At first I sought only that which belongs to me something of which I am being robbed But since you chose war and opened fire on me with some damage to my ship and loss of life to five of my men why war it is and your ship a prize of war From the quarter rail Mademoiselle d Ogeron looked down with glowing eyes in breathless wonder upon her well beloved hero Gloriously heroic he seemed as he stood towering there masterful audacious beautiful He saw her and with a glad shout sprang towards her The Dutch master got in his way with hands upheld to arrest his progress Levasseur did not stay to argue with him he was too impatient to reach his mistress He swung the poleaxe that he carried and the Dutchman went down in blood with a cloven skull The eager lover stepped across the body and came on his countenance joyously alight But mademoiselle was shrinking now in horror She was a girl upon the threshold of glorious womanhood of a fine height and nobly moulded with heavy coils of glossy black hair above and about a face that was of the colour of old ivory Her countenance was cast in lines of arrogance stressed by the low lids of her full dark eyes In a bound her well beloved was beside her flinging away his bloody poleaxe he opened wide his arms to enfold her But she still shrank even within his embrace which would not be denied a look of dread had come to temper the normal arrogance of her almost perfect face Mine mine at last and in spite of all he cried exultantly theatrically truly heroic But she endeavouring to thrust him back her hands against his breast could only falter Why why did you kill him He laughed as a hero should and answered her heroically with the tolerance of a god for the mortal to whom he condescends He stood between us Let his death be a symbol a warning Let all who would stand between us mark it and beware It was so splendidly terrific the gesture of it was so broad and fine and his magnetism so compelling that she cast her silly tremors and yielded herself freely intoxicated to his fond embrace Thereafter he swung her to his shoulder and stepping with ease beneath that burden bore her in a sort of triumph lustily cheered by his men to the deck of his own ship Her inconsiderate brother might have ruined that romantic scene but for the watchful Cahusac who quietly tripped him up and then trussed him like a fowl Thereafter what time the Captain languished in his lady s smile within the cabin Cahusac was dealing with the spoils of war The Dutch crew was ordered into the longboat and bidden go to the devil Fortunately as they numbered fewer than thirty the longboat though perilously overcrowded could yet contain them Next Cahusac having inspected the cargo put a quartermaster and a score of men aboard the Jongvrow and left her to follow La Foudre which he now headed south for the Leeward Islands Cahusac was disposed to be ill humoured The risk they had run in taking the Dutch brig and doing violence to members of the family of the Governor of Tortuga was out of all proportion to the value of their prize He said so sullenly to Levasseur You ll keep that opinion to yourself the Captain answered him Don t think I am the man to thrust my neck into a noose without knowing how I am going to take it out again I shall send an offer of terms to the Governor of Tortuga that he will be forced to accept Set a course for the Virgen Magra We ll go ashore and settle things from there And tell them to fetch that milksop Ogeron to the cabin Levasseur went back to the adoring lady Thither too the lady s brother was presently conducted The Captain rose to receive him bending his stalwart height to avoid striking the cabin roof with his head Mademoiselle rose too Why this she asked Levasseur pointing to her brother s pinioned wrists the remains of Cahusac s precautions I deplore it said he I desire it to end Let M d Ogeron give me his parole I give you nothing flashed the white faced youth who did not lack for spirit You see Levasseur shrugged his deep regret and mademoiselle turned protesting to her brother Henri this is foolish You are not behaving as my friend You Little fool her brother answered her and the little was out of place she was the taller of the twain Little fool do you think I should be acting as your friend to make terms with this blackguard pirate Steady my young cockerel Levasseur laughed But his laugh was not nice Don t you perceive your wicked folly in the harm it has brought already Lives have been lost men have died that this monster might overtake you And don t you yet realize where you stand in the power of this beast of this cur born in a kennel and bred in thieving and murder He might have said more but that Levasseur struck him across the mouth Levasseur you see cared as little as another to hear the truth about himself Mademoiselle suppressed a scream as the youth staggered back under the blow He came to rest against a bulkhead and leaned there with bleeding lips But his spirit was unquenched and there was a ghastly smile on his white face as his eyes sought his sister s You see he said simply He strikes a man whose hands are bound The simple words and more than the words their tone of ineffable disdain aroused the passion that never slumbered deeply in Levasseur And what should you do puppy if your hands were unbound He took his prisoner by the breast of his doublet and shook him Answer me What should you do Tchah You empty windbag You And then came a torrent of words unknown to mademoiselle yet of whose foulness her intuitions made her conscious With blanched cheeks she stood by the cabin table and cried out to Levasseur to stop To obey her he opened the door and flung her brother through it Put that rubbish under hatches until I call for it again he roared and shut the door Composing himself he turned to the girl again with a deprecatory smile But no smile answered him from her set face She had seen her beloved hero s nature in curl papers as it were and she found the spectacle disgusting and terrifying It recalled the brutal slaughter of the Dutch captain and suddenly she realized that what her brother had just said of this man was no more than true Fear growing to panic was written on her face as she stood there leaning for support against the table Why sweetheart what is this Levasseur moved towards her She recoiled before him There was a smile on his face a glitter in his eyes that fetched her heart into her throat He caught her as she reached the uttermost limits of the cabin seized her in his long arms and pulled her to him No no she panted Yes yes he mocked her and his mockery was the most terrible thing of all He crushed her to him brutally deliberately hurtful because she resisted and kissed her whilst she writhed in his embrace Then his passion mounting he grew angry and stripped off the last rag of hero s mask that still may have hung upon his face Little fool did you not hear your brother say that you are in my power Remember it and remember that of your own free will you came I am not the man with whom a woman can play fast and loose So get sense my girl and accept what you have invited He kissed her again almost contemptuously and flung her off No more scowls he said You ll be sorry else Some one knocked Cursing the interruption Levasseur strode off to open Cahusac stood before him The Breton s face was grave He came to report that they had sprung a leak between wind and water the consequence of damage sustained from one of the Dutchman s shots In alarm Levasseur went off with him The leakage was not serious so long as the weather kept fine but should a storm overtake them it might speedily become so A man was slung overboard to make a partial stoppage with a sail cloth and the pumps were got to work Ahead of them a low cloud showed on the horizon which Cahusac pronounced one of the northernmost of the Virgin Islands We must run for shelter there and careen her said Levasseur I do not trust this oppressive heat A storm may catch us before we make land A storm or something else said Cahusac grimly Have you noticed that He pointed away to starboard Levasseur looked and caught his breath Two ships that at the distance seemed of considerable burden were heading towards them some five miles away If they follow us what is to happen demanded Cahusac We ll fight whether we re in case to do so or not swore Levasseur Counsels of despair Cahusac was contemptuous To mark it he spat upon the deck This comes of going to sea with a lovesick madman Now keep your temper Captain for the hands will be at the end of theirs if we have trouble as a result of this Dutchman business For the remainder of that day Levasseur s thoughts were of anything but love He remained on deck his eyes now upon the land now upon those two slowly gaining ships To run for the open could avail him nothing and in his leaky condition would provide an additional danger He must stand at bay and fight And then towards evening when within three miles of shore and when he was about to give the order to strip for battle he almost fainted from relief to hear a voice from the crow s nest above announce that the larger of the two ships was the Arabella Her companion was presumably a prize But the pessimism of Cahusac abated nothing That is but the lesser evil he growled What will Blood say about this Dutchman Let him say what he pleases Levasseur laughed in the immensity of his relief And what about the children of the Governor of Tortuga He must not know He ll come to know in the end Aye but by then morbleu the matter will be settled I shall have made my peace with the Governor I tell you I know the way to compel Ogeron to come to terms Presently the four vessels lay to off the northern coast of La Virgen Magra a narrow little island arid and treeless some twelve miles by three uninhabited save by birds and turtles and unproductive of anything but salt of which there were considerable ponds to the south Levasseur put off in a boat accompanied by Cahusac and two other officers and went to visit Captain Blood aboard the Arabella Our brief separation has been mighty profitable was Captain Blood s greeting It s a busy morning we ve both had He was in high good humour as he led the way to the great cabin for a rendering of accounts The tall ship that accompanied the Arabella was a Spanish vessel of twenty six guns the Santiago from Puerto Rico with a hundred and twenty thousand weight of cacao forty thousand pieces of eight and the value of ten thousand more in jewels A rich capture of which two fifths under the articles went to Levasseur and his crew Of the money and jewels a division was made on the spot The cacao it was agreed should be taken to Tortuga to be sold Then it was the turn of Levasseur and black grew the brow of Captain Blood as the Frenchman s tale was unfolded At the end he roundly expressed his disapproval The Dutch were a friendly people whom it was a folly to alienate particularly for so paltry a matter as these hides and tobacco which at most would fetch a bare twenty thousand pieces But Levasseur answered him as he had answered Cahusac that a ship was a ship and it was ships they needed against their projected enterprise Perhaps because things had gone well with him that day Blood ended by shrugging the matter aside Thereupon Levasseur proposed that the Arabella and her prize should return to Tortuga there to unload the cacao and enlist the further adventurers that could now be shipped Levasseur meanwhile would effect certain necessary repairs and then proceeding south await his admiral at Saltatudos an island conveniently situated in the latitude of eleven deg eleven N for their enterprise against Maracaybo To Levasseur s relief Captain Blood not only agreed but pronounced himself ready to set sail at once No sooner had the Arabella departed than Levasseur brought his ships into the lagoon and set his crew to work upon the erection of temporary quarters ashore for himself his men and his enforced guests during the careening and repairing of La Foudre At sunset that evening the wind freshened it grew to a gale and from that to such a hurricane that Levasseur was thankful to find himself ashore and his ships in safe shelter He wondered a little how it might be faring with Captain Blood out there at the mercy of that terrific storm but he did not permit concern to trouble him unduly CHAPTER XV THE RANSOM In the glory of the following morning sparkling and clear after the storm with an invigorating briny tang in the air from the salt ponds on the south of the island a curious scene was played on the beach of the Virgen Magra at the foot of a ridge of bleached dunes beside the spread of sail from which Levasseur had improvised a tent Enthroned upon an empty cask sat the French filibuster to transact important business the business of making himself safe with the Governor of Tortuga A guard of honour of a half dozen officers hung about him five of them were rude boucan hunters in stained jerkins and leather breeches the sixth was Cahusac Before him guarded by two half naked negroes stood young d Ogeron in frilled shirt and satin small clothes and fine shoes of Cordovan leather He was stripped of doublet and his hands were tied behind him The young gentleman s comely face was haggard Near at hand and also under guard but unpinioned mademoiselle his sister sat hunched upon a hillock of sand She was very pale and it was in vain that she sought to veil in a mask of arrogance the fears by which she was assailed Levasseur addressed himself to M d Ogeron He spoke at long length In the end I trust monsieur said he with mock suavity that I have made myself quite clear So that there may be no misunderstandings I will recapitulate Your ransom is fixed at twenty thousand pieces of eight and you shall have liberty on parole to go to Tortuga to collect it In fact I shall provide the means to convey you thither and you shall have a month in which to come and go Meanwhile your sister remains with me as a hostage Your father should not consider such a sum excessive as the price of his son s liberty and to provide a dowry for his daughter Indeed if anything I am too modest pardi M d Ogeron is reputed a wealthy man M d Ogeron the younger raised his head and looked the Captain boldly in the face I refuse utterly and absolutely do you understand So do your worst and be damned for a filthy pirate without decency and without honour But what words laughed Levasseur What heat and what foolishness You have not considered the alternative When you do you will not persist in your refusal You will not do that in any case We have spurs for the reluctant And I warn you against giving me your parole under stress and afterwards playing me false I shall know how to find and punish you Meanwhile remember your sister s honour is in pawn to me Should you forget to return with the dowry you will not consider it unreasonable that I forget to marry her Levasseur s smiling eyes intent upon the young man s face saw the horror that crept into his glance M d Ogeron cast a wild glance at mademoiselle and observed the grey despair that had almost stamped the beauty from her face Disgust and fury swept across his countenance Then he braced himself and answered resolutely No you dog A thousand times no You are foolish to persist Levasseur spoke without anger with a coldly mocking regret His fingers had been busy tying knots in a length of whipcord He held it up You know this It is a rosary of pain that has wrought the conversion of many a stubborn heretic It is capable of screwing the eyes out of a man s head by way of helping him to see reason As you please He flung the length of knotted cord to one of the negroes who in an instant made it fast about the prisoner s brows Then between cord and cranium the black inserted a short length of metal round and slender as a pipe stem That done he rolled his eyes towards Levasseur awaiting the Captain s signal Levasseur considered his victim and beheld him tense and braced his haggard face of a leaden hue beads of perspiration glinting on his pallid brow just beneath the whipcord Mademoiselle cried out and would have risen but her guards restrained her and she sank down again moaning I beg that you will spare yourself and your sister said the Captain by being reasonable What after all is the sum I have named To your wealthy father a bagatelle I repeat I have been too modest But since I have said twenty thousand pieces of eight twenty thousand pieces it shall be And for what if you please have you said twenty thousand pieces of eight In execrable French but in a voice that was crisp and pleasant seeming to echo some of the mockery that had invested Levasseur s that question floated over their heads Startled Levasseur and his officers looked up and round On the crest of the dunes behind them in sharp silhouette against the deep cobalt of the sky they beheld a tall lean figure scrupulously dressed in black with silver lace a crimson ostrich plume curled about the broad brim of his hat affording the only touch of colour Under that hat was the tawny face of Captain Blood Levasseur gathered himself up with an oath of amazement He had conceived Captain Blood by now well below the horizon on his way to Tortuga assuming him to have been so fortunate as to have weathered last night s storm Launching himself upon the yielding sand into which he sank to the level of the calves of his fine boots of Spanish leather Captain Blood came sliding erect to the beach He was followed by Wolverstone and a dozen others As he came to a standstill he doffed his hat with a flourish to the lady Then he turned to Levasseur Good morning my Captain said he and proceeded to explain his presence It was last night s hurricane compelled our return We had no choice but to ride before it with stripped poles and it drove us back the way we had gone Moreover as the devil would have it the Santiago sprang her mainmast and so I was glad to put into a cove on the west of the island a couple of miles away and we ve walked across to stretch our legs and to give you good day But who are these And he designated the man and the woman Cahusac shrugged his shoulders and tossed his long arms to heaven Voila said he pregnantly to the firmament Levasseur gnawed his lip and changed colour But he controlled himself to answer civilly As you see two prisoners Ah Washed ashore in last night s gale eh Not so Levasseur contained himself with difficulty before that irony They were in the Dutch brig I don t remember that you mentioned them before I did not They are prisoners of my own a personal matter They are French French Captain Blood s light eyes stabbed at Levasseur then at the prisoners M d Ogeron stood tense and braced as before but the grey horror had left his face Hope had leapt within him at this interruption obviously as little expected by his tormentor as by himself His sister moved by a similar intuition was leaning forward with parted lips and gaping eyes Captain Blood fingered his lip and frowned thoughtfully upon Levasseur Yesterday you surprised me by making war upon the friendly Dutch But now it seems that not even your own countrymen are safe from you Have I not said that these that this is a matter personal to me Ah And their names Captain Blood s crisp authoritative faintly disdainful manner stirred Levasseur s quick anger The blood crept slowly back into his blenched face and his glance grew in insolence almost in menace Meanwhile the prisoner answered for him I am Henri d Ogeron and this is my sister D Ogeron Captain Blood stared Are you related by chance to my good friend the Governor of Tortuga He is my father Levasseur swung aside with an imprecation In Captain Blood amazement for the moment quenched every other emotion The saints preserve us now Are you quite mad Levasseur First you molest the Dutch who are our friends next you take prisoners two persons that are French your own countrymen and now faith they re no less than the children of the Governor of Tortuga which is the one safe place of shelter that we enjoy in these islands Levasseur broke in angrily Must I tell you again that it is a matter personal to me I make myself alone responsible to the Governor of Tortuga And the twenty thousand pieces of eight Is that also a matter personal to you It is Now I don t agree with you at all Captain Blood sat down on the cask that Levasseur had lately occupied and looked up blandly I may inform you to save time that I heard the entire proposal that you made to this lady and this gentleman and I ll also remind you that we sail under articles that admit no ambiguities You have fixed their ransom at twenty thousand pieces of eight That sum then belongs to your crews and mine in the proportions by the articles established You ll hardly wish to dispute it But what is far more grave is that you have concealed from me this part of the prizes taken on your last cruise and for such an offence as that the articles provide certain penalties that are something severe in character Ho ho laughed Levasseur unpleasantly Then added If you dislike my conduct we can dissolve the association That is my intention But we ll dissolve it when and in the manner that I choose and that will be as soon as you have satisfied the articles under which we sailed upon this cruise What do you mean I ll be as short as I can said Captain Blood I ll waive for the moment the unseemliness of making war upon the Dutch of taking French prisoners and of provoking the anger of the Governor of Tortuga I ll accept the situation as I find it Yourself you ve fixed the ransom of this couple at twenty thousand pieces and as I gather the lady is to be your perquisite But why should she be your perquisite more than another s seeing that she belongs by the articles to all of us as a prize of war Black as thunder grew the brow of Levasseur However added Captain Blood I ll not dispute her to you if you are prepared to buy her Buy her At the price you have set upon her Levasseur contained his rage that he might reason with the Irishman That is the ransom of the man It is to be paid for him by the Governor of Tortuga No no Ye ve parcelled the twain together very oddly I confess Ye ve set their value at twenty thousand pieces and for that sum you may have them since you desire it but you ll pay for them the twenty thousand pieces that are ultimately to come to you as the ransom of one and the dowry of the other and that sum shall be divided among our crews So that you do that it is conceivable that our followers may take a lenient view of your breach of the articles we jointly signed Levasseur laughed savagely Ah ca Credieu The good jest I quite agree with you said Captain Blood To Levasseur the jest lay in that Captain Blood with no more than a dozen followers should come there attempting to hector him who had a hundred men within easy call But it seemed that he had left out of his reckoning something which his opponent had counted in For as laughing still Levasseur swung to his officers he saw that which choked the laughter in his throat Captain Blood had shrewdly played upon the cupidity that was the paramount inspiration of those adventurers And Levasseur now read clearly on their faces how completely they adopted Captain Blood s suggestion that all must participate in the ransom which their leader had thought to appropriate to himself It gave the gaudy ruffian pause and whilst in his heart he cursed those followers of his who could be faithful only to their greed he perceived and only just in time that he had best tread warily You misunderstand he said swallowing his rage The ransom is for division when it comes The girl meanwhile is mine on that understanding Good grunted Cahusac On that understanding all arranges itself You think so said Captain Blood But if M d Ogeron should refuse to pay the ransom What then He laughed and got lazily to his feet No no If Captain Levasseur is meanwhile to keep the girl as he proposes then let him pay this ransom and be his the risk if it should afterwards not be forthcoming That s it cried one of Levasseur s officers And Cahusac added It s reasonable that Captain Blood is right It is in the articles What is in the articles you fools Levasseur was in danger of losing his head Sacre Dieu Where do you suppose that I have twenty thousand pieces My whole share of the prizes of this cruise does not come to half that sum I ll be your debtor until I ve earned it Will that content you All things considered there is not a doubt that it would have done so had not Captain Blood intended otherwise And if you should die before you have earned it Ours is a calling fraught with risks my Captain Damn you Levasseur flung upon him livid with fury Will nothing satisfy you Oh but yes Twenty thousand pieces of eight for immediate division I haven t got it Then let some one buy the prisoners who has And who do you suppose has it if I have not I have said Captain Blood You have Levasseur s mouth fell open You you want the girl Why not And I exceed you in gallantry in that I will make sacrifices to obtain her and in honesty in that I am ready to pay for what I want Levasseur stared at him foolishly agape Behind him pressed his officers gaping also Captain Blood sat down again on the cask and drew from an inner pocket of his doublet a little leather bag I am glad to be able to resolve a difficulty that at one moment seemed insoluble And under the bulging eyes of Levasseur and his officers he untied the mouth of the bag and rolled into his left palm four or five pearls each of the size of a sparrow s egg There were twenty such in the bag the very pick of those taken in that raid upon the pearl fleet You boast a knowledge of pearls Cahusac At what do you value this The Breton took between coarse finger and thumb the proffered lustrous delicately iridescent sphere his shrewd eyes appraising it A thousand pieces he answered shortly It will fetch rather more in Tortuga or Jamaica said Captain Blood and twice as much in Europe But I ll accept your valuation They are almost of a size as you can see Here are twelve representing twelve thousand pieces of eight which is La Foudre s share of three fifths of the prize as provided by the articles For the eight thousand pieces that go to the Arabella I make myself responsible to my own men And now Wolverstone if you please will you take my property aboard the Arabella He stood up again indicating the prisoners Ah no Levasseur threw wide the floodgates of his fury Ah that no by example You shall not take her He would have sprung upon Captain Blood who stood aloof alert tight lipped and watchful But it was one of Levasseur s own officers who hindered him Nom de Dieu my Captain What will you do It is settled honourably settled with satisfaction to all To all blazed Levasseur Ah ca To all of you you animals But what of me Cahusac with the pearls clutched in his capacious hand stepped up to him on the other side Don t be a fool Captain Do you want to provoke trouble between the crews His men outnumber us by nearly two to one What s a girl more or less In Heaven s name let her go He s paid handsomely for her and dealt fairly with us Dealt fairly roared the infuriated Captain You In all his foul vocabulary he could find no epithet to describe his lieutenant He caught him a blow that almost sent him sprawling The pearls were scattered in the sand Cahusac dived after them his fellows with him Vengeance must wait For some moments they groped there on hands and knees oblivious of all else And yet in those moments vital things were happening Levasseur his hand on his sword his face a white mask of rage was confronting Captain Blood to hinder his departure You do not take her while I live he cried Then I ll take her when you re dead said Captain Blood and his own blade flashed in the sunlight The articles provide that any man of whatever rank concealing any part of a prize be it of the value of no more than a peso shall be hanged at the yardarm It s what I intended for you in the end But since ye prefer it this way ye muckrake faith I ll be humouring you He waved away the men who would have interfered and the blades rang together M d Ogeron looked on a man bemused unable to surmise what the issue either way could mean for him Meanwhile two of Blood s men who had taken the place of the Frenchman s negro guards had removed the crown of whipcord from his brow As for mademoiselle she had risen and was leaning forward a hand pressed tightly to her heaving breast her face deathly pale a wild terror in her eyes It was soon over The brute strength upon which Levasseur so confidently counted could avail nothing against the Irishman s practised skill When with both lungs transfixed he lay prone on the white sand coughing out his rascally life Captain Blood looked calmly at Cahusac across the body I think that cancels the articles between us he said With soulless cynical eyes Cahusac considered the twitching body of his recent leader Had Levasseur been a man of different temper the affair might have ended in a very different manner But then it is certain that Captain Blood would have adopted in dealing with him different tactics As it was Levasseur commanded neither love nor loyalty The men who followed him were the very dregs of that vile trade and cupidity was their only inspiration Upon that cupidity Captain Blood had deftly played until he had brought them to find Levasseur guilty of the one offence they deemed unpardonable the crime of appropriating to himself something which might be converted into gold and shared amongst them all Thus now the threatening mob of buccaneers that came hastening to the theatre of that swift tragi comedy were appeased by a dozen words of Cahusac s Whilst still they hesitated Blood added something to quicken their decision If you will come to our anchorage you shall receive at once your share of the booty of the Santiago that you may dispose of it as you please They crossed the island the two prisoners accompanying them and later that day the division made they would have parted company but that Cahusac at the instances of the men who had elected him Levasseur s successor offered Captain Blood anew the services of that French contingent If you will sail with me again the Captain answered him you may do so on the condition that you make your peace with the Dutch and restore the brig and her cargo The condition was accepted and Captain Blood went off to find his guests the children of the Governor of Tortuga Mademoiselle d Ogeron and her brother the latter now relieved of his bonds sat in the great cabin of the Arabella whither they had been conducted Wine and food had been placed upon the table by Benjamin Captain Blood s negro steward and cook who had intimated to them that it was for their entertainment But it had remained untouched Brother and sister sat there in agonized bewilderment conceiving that their escape was but from frying pan to fire At length overwrought by the suspense mademoiselle flung herself upon her knees before her brother to implore his pardon for all the evil brought upon them by her wicked folly M d Ogeron was not in a forgiving mood I am glad that at least you realize what you have done And now this other filibuster has bought you and you belong to him You realize that too I hope He might have said more but he checked upon perceiving that the door was opening Captain Blood coming from settling matters with the followers of Levasseur stood on the threshold M d Ogeron had not troubled to restrain his high pitched voice and the Captain had overheard the Frenchman s last two sentences Therefore he perfectly understood why mademoiselle should bound up at sight of him and shrink back in fear Mademoiselle said he in his vile but fluent French I beg you to dismiss your fears Aboard this ship you shall be treated with all honour So soon as we are in case to put to sea again we steer a course for Tortuga to take you home to your father And pray do not consider that I have bought you as your brother has just said All that I have done has been to provide the ransom necessary to bribe a gang of scoundrels to depart from obedience to the arch scoundrel who commanded them and so deliver you from all peril Count it if you please a friendly loan to be repaid entirely at your convenience Mademoiselle stared at him in unbelief M d Ogeron rose to his feet Monsieur is it possible that you are serious I am It may not happen often nowadays I may be a pirate But my ways are not the ways of Levasseur who should have stayed in Europe and practised purse cutting I have a sort of honour shall we say some rags of honour remaining me from better days Then on a brisker note he added We dine in an hour and I trust that you will honour my table with your company Meanwhile Benjamin will see monsieur that you are more suitably provided in the matter of wardrobe He bowed to them and turned to depart again but mademoiselle detained him Monsieur she cried sharply He checked and turned whilst slowly she approached him regarding him between dread and wonder Oh you are noble I shouldn t put it as high as that myself said he You are you are And it is but right that you should know all Madelon her brother cried out to restrain her But she would not be restrained Her surcharged heart must overflow in confidence Monsieur for what befell I am greatly at fault This man this Levasseur He stared incredulous in his turn My God Is it possible That animal Abruptly she fell on her knees caught his hand and kissed it before he could wrench it from her What do you do he cried An amende In my mind I dishonoured you by deeming you his like by conceiving your fight with Levasseur a combat between jackals On my knees monsieur I implore you to forgive me Captain Blood looked down upon her and a smile broke on his lips irradiating the blue eyes that looked so oddly light in that tawny face Why child said he I might find it hard to forgive you the stupidity of having thought otherwise As he handed her to her feet again he assured himself that he had behaved rather well in the affair Then he sighed That dubious fame of his that had spread so quickly across the Caribbean would by now have reached the ears of Arabella Bishop That she would despise him he could not doubt deeming him no better than all the other scoundrels who drove this villainous buccaneering trade Therefore he hoped that some echo of this deed might reach her also and be set by her against some of that contempt For the whole truth which he withheld from Mademoiselle d Ogeron was that in venturing his life to save her he had been driven by the thought that the deed must be pleasing in the eyes of Miss Bishop could she but witness it CHAPTER XVI THE TRAP That affair of Mademoiselle d Ogeron bore as its natural fruit an improvement

557-129796-0005	train-other-500	sailed into the great lake of Maracaybo and effected its raid upon that opulent city of the Main The affair did not proceed exactly as was hoped and Blood s force came to find itself in a precarious position
557-129796-0006	train-other-500	This is best explained in the words employed by Cahusac which Pitt has carefully recorded in the course of an altercation that broke out
557-129796-0007	train-other-500	on the steps of the Church of Nuestra Senora del Carmen which Captain Blood had impiously appropriated for the purpose of a corps de garde I have said already that he was a papist only when it suited him
557-129796-0008	train-other-500	The dispute was being conducted by Hagthorpe Wolverstone and Pitt on the one side and Cahusac out of whose uneasiness it all arose on the other Behind them in the sun scorched dusty square
557-129796-0009	train-other-500	sparsely fringed by palms whose fronds drooped listlessly in the quivering heat surged a couple of hundred wild fellows belonging to both parties their own excitement momentarily quelled
557-129796-0010	train-other-500	so that they might listen to what passed among their leaders Cahusac appeared to be having it all his own way and he raised his harsh querulous voice so that all might hear his truculent denunciation He spoke
557-129796-0011	train-other-500	Pitt tells us a dreadful kind of English which the shipmaster however makes little attempt to reproduce His dress was as discordant as his speech It was of a kind to advertise his trade
none	none	 and ludicrously in contrast with the sober garb of Hagthorpe 
557-129796-0012	train-other-500	and the almost foppish daintiness of Jeremy Pitt His soiled and blood stained shirt of blue cotton was open in front to cool his hairy breast and the girdle about the waist of his leather breeches
none	none	 carried an arsenal of pistols and a knife 
557-129796-0013	train-other-500	whilst a cutlass hung from a leather baldrick loosely slung about his body above his countenance broad and flat as a Mongolian s
none	none	 a red scarf was swathed 
557-129796-0014	train-other-500	turban wise about his head Is it that I have not warned you from the beginning that all was too easy he demanded between plaintiveness and fury I am no fool my friends
none	none	 I have eyes me 
557-129796-0015	train-other-500	And I see I see an abandoned fort at the entrance of the lake and nobody there to fire a gun at us when we came in Then I suspect the trap Who would not that had eyes and brain Bah we come on
557-129796-0016	train-other-500	What do we find A city abandoned like the fort a city out of which
none	none	 the people have taken all things of value 
557-129796-0017	train-other-500	Again I warn Captain Blood It is a trap I say We are to come on always to come on without opposition until we find that it is too late to go to sea again that we cannot go back at all
557-129796-0018	train-other-500	But no one will listen to me You all know so much more Name of God Captain Blood he will go on and we go on We go to Gibraltar True that at last after long time we catch the Deputy Governor
557-129796-0019	train-other-500	true we make him pay big ransom for Gibraltar
none	none	 true between that ransom and the loot 
557-129796-0020	train-other-500	we return here with some two thousand pieces of eight But what is it in reality will you tell me Or shall I tell you It is a piece of cheese a piece of cheese in a mousetrap and we are the little mice Goddam And the cats oh
557-129796-0021	train-other-500	the cats they wait for us The cats are those four Spanish ships of war that have come meantime And they wait for us outside the bottle neck of this lagoon
none	none	 Mort de Dieu That is what comes of the damned obstinacy of your fine Captain Blood 
557-129796-0022	train-other-500	Wolverstone laughed Cahusac exploded in fury
none	none	 Ah sangdieu Tu ris animal You laugh Tell me this How do we get out again unless we accept the terms of Monsieur the Admiral of Spain From the buccaneers at the foot of the steps 
557-129796-0023	train-other-500	came an angry rumble of approval The single eye of the gigantic Wolverstone rolled terribly and he clenched his great fists as if to strike the Frenchman who was exposing them to mutiny But Cahusac was not daunted
557-129796-0024	train-other-500	The mood of the men enheartened him You think perhaps this your Captain Blood is the good God That he can make miracles eh He is ridiculous you know this Captain Blood with his grand air and his
557-129796-0025	train-other-500	He checked Out of the church at that moment grand air and all sauntered Peter Blood With him came a tough long legged French sea wolf named Yberville
557-129796-0026	train-other-500	who though still young had already won fame as a privateer commander before the loss of his own ship had driven him to take service under Blood The Captain advanced towards that disputing group
557-129796-0027	train-other-500	leaning lightly upon his long ebony cane his face shaded by a broad plumed hat There was in his appearance nothing of the buccaneer He had much more the air of a lounger
none	none	 in the Mall or the Alameda 
557-129796-0028	train-other-500	the latter rather since his elegant suit of violet taffetas with gold embroidered button holes was in the Spanish fashion But the long stout serviceable rapier thrust up behind by the left hand
557-129796-0029	train-other-500	resting lightly on the pummel corrected the impression That and those steely eyes of his announced the adventurer You find me ridiculous eh Cahusac said he as he came to a halt
none	none	 before the Breton whose anger seemed already to have gone out of him 
557-129796-0030	train-other-500	What then must I find you He spoke quietly almost wearily
none	none	 You will be telling them that we have delayed and that it is the delay that has brought about our danger 
557-129796-0031	train-other-500	But whose is the fault of that delay We have been a month in doing what should have been done
none	none	 and what but for your blundering would have been done inside of a week Ah ca Nom de Dieu Was it my fault that Was it any one else s fault that you ran your ship La Foudre aground on the shoal 
557-129796-0032	train-other-500	in the middle of the lake You would not be piloted You knew your way
none	none	 You took no soundings even The result was that we lost three precious days 
557-129796-0033	train-other-500	in getting canoes to bring off your men and your gear Those three days gave the folk at Gibraltar not only time to hear of our coming but time in which to get away After that and because of it we had to follow the Governor to his infernal island fortress
none	none	 and a fortnight and best part of a hundred lives were lost in reducing it That s how we come to have delayed until this Spanish fleet is fetched 
557-129796-0034	train-other-500	round from La Guayra by a guarda costa and if ye hadn t lost La Foudre and so reduced our fleet from three ships to two we should even now be able to fight our way through with a reasonable hope of succeeding Yet you think it is for you to come hectoring here
none	none	 upbraiding us for a situation that is just the result of your own ineptitude 
557-129796-0035	train-other-500	He spoke with a restraint which I trust you will agree was admirable when I tell you that the Spanish fleet guarding the bottle neck exit of the great Lake of Maracaybo and awaiting there the coming forth of Captain Blood
557-129796-0036	train-other-500	with a calm confidence based upon its overwhelming strength was commanded by his implacable enemy
none	none	 Don Miguel de Espinosa y Valdez 
557-129796-0037	train-other-500	the Admiral of Spain In addition to his duty to his country the Admiral had as you know a further personal incentive arising out of that business aboard the Encarnacion a year ago and the death of his brother
557-129796-0038	train-other-500	Don Diego and with him sailed his nephew Esteban whose vindictive zeal exceeded the Admiral s own Yet knowing all this Captain Blood could preserve his calm in reproving the cowardly frenzy of one for whom the situation
557-129796-0039	train-other-500	had not half the peril with which it was fraught for himself He turned from Cahusac to address the mob of buccaneers who had surged nearer to hear him for he had not troubled to raise his voice
none	none	 I hope that will correct some of the misapprehension that appears to have been disturbing you said he There s no good can come of talking of what s past and done cried Cahusac more sullen now than truculent Whereupon Wolverstone laughed a laugh that was like the neighing of a horse The question is what are we to do now 
557-129796-0040	train-other-500	Sure now there s no question at all said Captain Blood Indeed but there is Cahusac insisted Don Miguel the Spanish Admiral have offer us safe passage to sea if we will depart at once do no damage to the town
557-129796-0041	train-other-500	release our prisoners and surrender all that we took at Gibraltar Captain Blood smiled quietly knowing precisely how much Don Miguel s word was worth It was Yberville who replied in manifest scorn of his compatriot
none	none	 Which argues that even at this disadvantage as he has us the Spanish Admiral is still afraid of us That can be only because he not know our real weakness was the fierce retort And anyway we must accept these terms We have no choice That is my opinion Well it s not mine now said Captain Blood So I ve refused them Refuse Cahusac s broad face grew purple A muttering from the men 
557-129796-0042	train-other-500	behind enheartened him You have refuse You have refuse already and without consulting me
none	none	 Your disagreement could have altered nothing You d have been outvoted for Hagthorpe here was entirely of my own mind Still he went on if you and your own French followers 
557-129796-0043	train-other-500	wish to avail yourselves of the Spaniard s terms we shall not hinder you
none	none	 Send one of your prisoners to announce it to the Admiral 
557-129796-0044	train-other-500	Don Miguel will welcome your decision you may be sure
none	none	 Cahusac glowered at him in silence for a moment 
557-129796-0045	train-other-500	Then having controlled himself
none	none	 he asked in a concentrated voice 
557-129796-0046	train-other-500	Precisely what answer have you make to the Admiral A smile irradiated the face and eyes of Captain Blood I have answered him that unless within four and twenty hours we have his parole to stand out to sea
557-129796-0047	train-other-500	ceasing to dispute our passage or hinder our departure and a ransom of fifty thousand pieces of eight for Maracaybo we shall reduce this beautiful city to ashes and thereafter go out and destroy his fleet
557-129796-0048	train-other-500	The impudence of it left Cahusac speechless
none	none	 But among the English buccaneers in the square there were many who savoured the audacious humour of the trapped dictating terms to the trappers Laughter broke from them It spread into a roar of acclamation for bluff is a weapon dear to every adventurer Presently when they understood it 
557-129796-0049	train-other-500	even Cahusac s French followers were carried off their feet by that wave of jocular enthusiasm until in his truculent obstinacy Cahusac remained the only dissentient He withdrew in mortification
557-129796-0050	train-other-500	Nor was he to be mollified until the following day brought him his revenge This came in the shape of a messenger from Don Miguel with a letter in which the Spanish Admiral solemnly vowed to God that
none	none	 since the pirates had refused his magnanimous offer to permit them to surrender with the honours of war he would now await them at the mouth of the lake there to destroy them on their coming forth He added that should they delay their departure 
557-129796-0051	train-other-500	he would so soon as he was reenforced by a fifth ship the Santo Nino on its way to join him from La Guayra himself come inside to seek them at Maracaybo This time Captain Blood was put out of temper
557-129796-0052	train-other-500	Trouble me no more he snapped at Cahusac who came growling to him again Send word to Don Miguel
none	none	 that you have seceded from me He ll give you safe conduct devil a doubt Then take one of the sloops order your men aboard and put to sea and the devil go with you Cahusac would certainly have adopted that course if only his men had been unanimous in the matter 
557-129796-0053	train-other-500	They however were torn between greed and apprehension If they went they must abandon their share of the plunder which was considerable as well as the slaves and other prisoners they had taken If they did this and Captain Blood
557-129796-0054	train-other-500	should afterwards contrive to get away unscathed and from their knowledge of his resourcefulness the thing however unlikely need not be impossible he must profit by that which they now relinquished This was a contingency too bitter for contemplation
557-129796-0055	train-other-500	And so in the end despite all that Cahusac could say the surrender was not to Don Miguel but to Peter Blood They had come into the venture with him they asserted and they would go out of it with him or not at all
557-129796-0056	train-other-500	That was the message he received from them that same evening by the sullen mouth of Cahusac himself He welcomed it and invited the Breton to sit down and join the council which was even then deliberating upon the means to be employed
none	none	 This council occupied the spacious patio of the Governor s house 
557-129796-0057	train-other-500	which Captain Blood had appropriated to his own uses a cloistered stone quadrangle in the middle of which a fountain played coolly under a trellis of vine Orange trees grew on two sides of it
557-129796-0058	train-other-500	and the still evening air was heavy with the scent of them It was one of those pleasant exterior interiors which Moorish architects had introduced to Spain and the Spaniards had carried with them to the New World
557-129796-0059	train-other-500	Here that council of war composed of six men in all deliberated until late that night upon the plan of action which Captain Blood put forward The great freshwater lake of Maracaybo
557-129796-0060	train-other-500	nourished by a score of rivers from the snow capped ranges that surround it on two sides is some hundred and twenty miles in length and almost the same distance across at its widest It is as has been indicated in the shape of a great bottle
557-129796-0061	train-other-500	having its neck towards the sea at Maracaybo Beyond this neck it widens again and then the two long narrow strips of land known as the islands of Vigilias and Palomas block the channel standing lengthwise across it
none	none	 The only passage out to sea for vessels of any draught lies in the narrow strait between these islands Palomas which is some ten miles in length is unapproachable for half a mile on either side 
557-129796-0062	train-other-500	by any but the shallowest craft save at its eastern end where completely commanding the narrow passage out to sea stands the massive fort which the buccaneers had found deserted upon their coming In the broader water between this passage and the bar
557-129796-0063	train-other-500	the four Spanish ships were at anchor in mid channel The Admiral s Encarnacion which we already know was a mighty galleon of forty eight great guns and eight small Next in importance was the Salvador with thirty six guns
none	none	 the other two the Infanta and the San Felipe 
557-129796-0064	train-other-500	though smaller vessels were still formidable enough with their twenty guns and a hundred and fifty men apiece Such was the fleet of which the gauntlet was to be run by Captain Blood
none	none	 with his own Arabella of forty guns the Elizabeth of twenty six 
557-129796-0065	train-other-500	and two sloops captured at Gibraltar which they had indifferently armed with four culverins each
none	none	 In men they had a bare four hundred survivors of the five hundred odd that had left Tortuga to oppose to fully a thousand Spaniards manning the galleons The plan of action submitted by Captain Blood to that council was a desperate one as Cahusac uncompromisingly pronounced it Why so it is said the Captain But I ve done things more desperate 
557-129796-0066	train-other-500	Complacently he pulled at a pipe that was loaded with that fragrant Sacerdotes tobacco for which Gibraltar was famous and of which
none	none	 they had brought away some hogsheads 
557-129796-0067	train-other-500	And what is more they ve succeeded
none	none	 Audaces fortuna juvat 
557-129796-0068	train-other-500	Bedad they knew their world the old Romans He breathed into his companions and even into Cahusac some of his own spirit of confidence and in confidence all went busily to work For three days from sunrise to sunset
557-129796-0069	train-other-500	the buccaneers laboured and sweated to complete the preparations for the action that was to procure them their deliverance Time pressed They must strike before Don Miguel de Espinosa
none	none	 received the reenforcement of that fifth galleon the Santo Nino 
557-129796-0070	train-other-500	which was coming to join him from La Guayra Their principal operations were on the larger of the two sloops captured at Gibraltar to which vessel was assigned the leading part in Captain Blood s scheme They began by tearing down all bulkheads
none	none	 until they had reduced her to the merest shell and in her sides they broke open so many ports that her gunwale was converted into the semblance of a grating 
557-129796-0071	train-other-500	Next they increased by a half dozen the scuttles in her deck whilst into her hull they packed all the tar and pitch and brimstone that they could find in the town to which they added six barrels of gunpowder placed on end like guns
557-129796-0072	train-other-500	at the open ports on her larboard side On the evening of the fourth day everything being now in readiness all were got aboard and the empty pleasant city of Maracaybo was at last abandoned But they did not weigh anchor until some two hours after midnight
557-129796-0073	train-other-500	Then at last on the first of the ebb they drifted silently down towards the bar with all canvas furled save only their spiltsails which so as to give them steering way were spread to the faint breeze
557-129796-0074	train-other-500	that stirred through the purple darkness of the tropical night
none	none	 The order of their going was as follows 
557-129796-0075	train-other-500	Ahead went the improvised fire ship in charge of Wolverstone with a crew of six volunteers each of whom was to have a hundred pieces of eight over and above his share of plunder as a special reward Next came the Arabella
557-129796-0076	train-other-500	She was followed at a distance by the Elizabeth commanded by Hagthorpe with whom was the now shipless Cahusac and the bulk of his French followers
none	none	 The rear was brought up by the second sloop 
557-129796-0077	train-other-500	and some eight canoes aboard of which had been shipped the prisoners the slaves and most of the captured merchandise The prisoners were all pinioned and guarded by four buccaneers with musketoons
557-129796-0078	train-other-500	who manned these boats in addition to the two fellows who were to sail them Their place was to be in the rear
none	none	 and they were to take no part whatever in the coming fight As the first glimmerings of opalescent dawn dissolved the darkness the straining eyes of the buccaneers were able to make out the tall rigging of the Spanish vessels riding at anchor less than a quarter of a mile ahead Entirely without suspicion as the Spaniards were and rendered confident by their own overwhelming strength 
557-129796-0079	train-other-500	it is unlikely that they used a vigilance keener than their careless habit Certain it is that they did not sight Blood s fleet in that dim light
none	none	 until some time after Blood s fleet had sighted them By the time that they had actively roused themselves Wolverstone s sloop was almost upon them speeding under canvas which had been crowded to her yards the moment the galleons had loomed into view Straight for the Admiral s great ship the Encarnacion did Wolverstone head the sloop then lashing down the helm he kindled from a match that hung ready lighted beside him a great torch of thickly plaited straw that had been steeped in bitumen First it glowed then as he swung it round his head it burst into flame 
557-129796-0080	train-other-500	just as the slight vessel went crashing and bumping and scraping against the side of the flagship whilst rigging became tangled with rigging
none	none	 to the straining of yards and snapping of spars overhead 
557-129796-0081	train-other-500	His six men stood at their posts on the larboard side stark naked each armed with a grapnel four of them on the gunwale two of them aloft At the moment of impact these grapnels were slung to bind the Spaniard to them
none	none	 those aloft being intended to complete and preserve the entanglement of the rigging 
557-129796-0082	train-other-500	Aboard the rudely awakened galleon all was confused hurrying scurrying trumpeting and shouting At first there had been a desperately hurried attempt to get up the anchor but this was abandoned as being already too late
557-129796-0083	train-other-500	and conceiving themselves on the point of being boarded the Spaniards stood to arms to ward off the onslaught Its slowness in coming intrigued them
none	none	 being so different from the usual tactics of the buccaneers Further intrigued were they by the sight of the gigantic Wolverstone speeding naked along his deck with a great flaming torch held high Not until he had completed his work did they begin to suspect the truth that he was lighting slow matches 
557-129796-0084	train-other-500	and then one of their officers rendered reckless by panic
none	none	 ordered a boarding party on to the shop The order came too late Wolverstone had seen his six fellows drop overboard after the grapnels were fixed and then had sped himself to the starboard gunwale Thence he flung his flaming torch down 
557-129796-0085	train-other-500	the nearest gaping scuttle into the hold and thereupon dived overboard in his turn to be picked up presently by the longboat from the Arabella But before that happened the sloop was a thing of fire from which explosions were hurling blazing combustibles
none	none	 aboard the Encarnacion 
557-129796-0086	train-other-500	and long tongues of flame were licking out to consume the galleon beating back those daring Spaniards who too late
none	none	 strove desperately to cut her adrift And whilst the most formidable vessel of the Spanish fleet was thus being put out of action at the outset 
557-129796-0087	train-other-500	Blood had sailed in to open fire upon the Salvador First athwart her hawse he had loosed a broadside that had swept her decks with terrific effect then going on and about
557-129796-0088	train-other-500	he had put a second broadside into her hull at short range Leaving her thus half crippled temporarily at least and keeping to his course he had bewildered the crew of the Infanta by a couple of shots from the chasers on his beak head
557-129796-0089	train-other-500	then crashed alongside to grapple and board her whilst Hagthorpe was doing the like by the San Felipe And in all this time not a single shot had the Spaniards contrived to fire so completely had they been taken by surprise
557-129796-0090	train-other-500	and so swift and paralyzing had been Blood s stroke Boarded now and faced by the cold steel of the buccaneers
none	none	 neither the San Felipe nor the Infanta 
557-129796-0091	train-other-500	offered much resistance The sight of their admiral in flames and the Salvador drifting crippled from the action had so utterly disheartened them that they accounted themselves vanquished and laid down their arms If by a resolute stand the Salvador
557-129796-0092	train-other-500	had encouraged the other two undamaged vessels to resistance the Spaniards might well have retrieved the fortunes of the day But it happened that the Salvador was handicapped in true Spanish fashion by being the treasure ship of the fleet
none	none	 with plate on board to the value of some fifty thousand pieces 
557-129796-0093	train-other-500	Intent above all upon saving this from falling into the hands of the pirates Don Miguel who with a remnant of his crew had meanwhile transferred himself aboard her headed her down towards Palomas and the fort that guarded the passage
557-129796-0094	train-other-500	This fort the Admiral in those days of waiting had taken the precaution secretly to garrison and rearm For the purpose he had stripped the fort of Cojero farther out on the gulf of its entire armament
557-129796-0095	train-other-500	which included some cannon royal of more than ordinary range and power With no suspicion of this Captain Blood gave chase accompanied by the Infanta which was manned now by a prize crew under the command of Yberville
557-129796-0096	train-other-500	The stern chasers of the Salvador desultorily
none	none	 returned the punishing fire of the pursuers 
557-129796-0097	train-other-500	but such was the damage she herself sustained that presently coming under the guns of the fort she began to sink and finally settled down in the shallows with part of her hull above water Thence some in boats and some by swimming
557-129796-0098	train-other-500	the Admiral got his crew ashore on Palomas as best he could And then just as Captain Blood accounted the victory won and that his way out of that trap to the open sea beyond lay clear the fort suddenly revealed its formidable
557-129796-0099	train-other-500	and utterly unsuspected strength With a roar the cannons royal proclaimed themselves and the Arabella staggered under a blow that smashed her bulwarks at the waist and scattered death and confusion among the seamen gathered there
557-129796-0100	train-other-500	Had not Pitt her master himself seized the whipstaff and put the helm hard over to swing her sharply off to starboard she must have suffered still worse from the second volley that followed fast upon the first
none	none	 Meanwhile it had fared even worse with the frailer Infanta 
557-129796-0101	train-other-500	Although hit by one shot only this had crushed her larboard timbers on the waterline starting a leak that must presently have filled her but for the prompt action of the experienced Yberville in ordering her larboard guns to be flung overboard
557-129796-0102	train-other-500	Thus lightened and listing now to starboard he fetched her about
none	none	 and went staggering after the retreating Arabella followed by the fire of the fort 
557-129796-0103	train-other-500	which did them however little further damage Out of range at last they lay to
none	none	 joined by the Elizabeth and the San Felipe to consider their position CHAPTER XVII THE DUPES It was a crestfallen Captain Blood who presided over that hastily summoned council held on the poop deck of the Arabella in the brilliant morning sunshine It was he declared afterwards one of the bitterest moments in his career He was compelled to digest the fact that having conducted the engagement 
557-129797-0000	train-other-500	with a skill of which he might justly be proud having destroyed a force so superior in ships and guns and men that Don Miguel de Espinosa had justifiably deemed it overwhelming
557-129797-0001	train-other-500	his victory was rendered barren by three lucky shots from an unsuspected battery by which they had been surprised And barren must their victory remain until they could reduce the fort that still remained to defend the passage
557-129797-0002	train-other-500	At first Captain Blood was for putting his ships in order and making the attempt there and then But the others dissuaded him from betraying an impetuosity usually foreign to him and born entirely of chagrin and mortification
557-129797-0003	train-other-500	emotions which will render unreasonable the most reasonable of men With returning calm he surveyed the situation
none	none	 The Arabella was no longer in case to put to sea the Infanta was merely kept afloat by artifice and the San Felipe 
557-129797-0004	train-other-500	was almost as sorely damaged by the fire she had sustained from the buccaneers before surrendering Clearly then he was compelled to admit in the end that nothing remained
none	none	 but to return to Maracaybo 
557-129797-0005	train-other-500	there to refit the ships before attempting to force the passage And so back to Maracaybo came those defeated victors of that short terrible fight And if anything had been wanting further to exasperate their leader
557-129797-0006	train-other-500	he had it in the pessimism of which Cahusac did not economize expressions Transported at first to heights of dizzy satisfaction by the swift and easy victory of their inferior force that morning
557-129797-0007	train-other-500	the Frenchman was now plunged back and more deeply than ever into the abyss of hopelessness And his mood infected at least the main body of his own followers It is the end he told Captain Blood This time we are checkmated
none	none	 I ll take the liberty of reminding you that you said the same before Captain Blood answered him as patiently as he could Yet you ve seen what you ve seen and you ll not deny that in ships and guns we are returning stronger than we went Look at our present fleet man 
557-129797-0008	train-other-500	I am looking at it said Cahusac Pish
none	none	 Ye re a white livered cur when all is said 
557-129797-0009	train-other-500	You call me a coward I ll take that liberty The Breton glared at him breathing hard But he had no mind to ask satisfaction for the insult He knew too well the kind of satisfaction
557-129797-0010	train-other-500	that Captain Blood was likely to afford him He remembered the fate of Levasseur So he confined himself to words It is too much You go too far he complained bitterly Look you Cahusac
557-129797-0011	train-other-500	it s sick and tired I am of your perpetual whining and complaining when things are not as smooth as a convent dining table If ye wanted things smooth and easy ye shouldn t have taken to the sea
none	none	 and ye should never ha sailed with me 
557-129797-0012	train-other-500	for with me things are never smooth and easy And that I think is all I have to say to you this morning Cahusac flung away cursing and went to take the feeling of his men Captain Blood went off to give his surgeon s skill to the wounded
none	none	 among whom he remained engaged until late afternoon Then at last he went ashore his mind made up and returned to the house of the Governor to indite a truculent but very scholarly letter 
557-129797-0013	train-other-500	in purest Castilian to Don Miguel I have shown your excellency this morning of what I am capable he wrote Although outnumbered by more than two to one in men in ships and in guns
557-129797-0014	train-other-500	I have sunk or captured the vessels of the great fleet with which you were to come to Maracaybo to destroy us So that you are no longer in case to carry out your boast even when your reenforcements on the Santo Nino reach you from La Guayra
557-129797-0015	train-other-500	From what has occurred you may judge of what must occur I should not trouble your excellency with this letter but that I am a humane man abhorring bloodshed Therefore
557-129797-0016	train-other-500	before proceeding to deal with your fort which you may deem invincible as I have dealt already with your fleet which you deemed invincible I make you purely out of humanitarian considerations this last offer of terms
557-129797-0017	train-other-500	I will spare this city of Maracaybo and forthwith evacuate it leaving behind me the forty prisoners I have taken in consideration of your paying me the sum of fifty thousand pieces of eight
557-129797-0018	train-other-500	and one hundred head of cattle as a ransom thereafter granting me unmolested passage of the bar My prisoners most of whom are persons of consideration I will retain as hostages until after my departure
557-129797-0019	train-other-500	sending them back in the canoes which we shall take with us for that purpose If your excellency should be so ill advised as to refuse these terms and thereby impose upon me the necessity
557-129797-0020	train-other-500	of reducing your fort at the cost of some lives I warn you that you may expect no quarter from us and that I shall begin by leaving a heap of ashes where this pleasant city of Maracaybo now stands The letter written
557-129797-0021	train-other-500	he bade them bring him from among the prisoners the Deputy Governor of Maracaybo who had been taken at Gibraltar Disclosing its contents to him he despatched him with it to Don Miguel
557-129797-0022	train-other-500	His choice of a messenger was shrewd The Deputy Governor was of all men the most anxious for the deliverance of his city the one man who on his own account would plead most fervently for its preservation at all costs
557-129797-0023	train-other-500	from the fate with which Captain Blood was threatening it And as he reckoned so it befell The Deputy Governor added his own passionate pleading to the proposals of the letter But Don Miguel was of stouter heart
557-129797-0024	train-other-500	True his fleet had been partly destroyed and partly captured But then he argued he had been taken utterly by surprise That should not happen again There should be no surprising the fort
557-129797-0025	train-other-500	Let Captain Blood do his worst at Maracaybo there should be a bitter reckoning for him when eventually he decided as sooner or later decide he must to come forth The Deputy Governor was flung into panic He lost his temper
557-129797-0026	train-other-500	and said some hard things to the Admiral But they were not as hard as the thing the Admiral said to him in answer Had you been as loyal to your King in hindering the entrance of these cursed pirates
none	none	 as I shall be in hindering their going forth again we should not now find ourselves in our present straits 
557-129797-0027	train-other-500	So weary me no more with your coward counsels I make no terms with Captain Blood I know my duty to my King and I intend to perform it I also know my duty to myself I have a private score with this rascal
557-129797-0028	train-other-500	and I intend to settle it Take you that message back So back to Maracaybo back to his own handsome house in which Captain Blood had established his quarters
none	none	 came the Deputy Governor with the Admiral s answer And because he had been shamed into a show of spirit by the Admiral s own stout courage in adversity he delivered it as truculently as the Admiral could have desired 
557-129797-0029	train-other-500	And is it like that said Captain Blood with a quiet smile though the heart of him sank at this failure of his bluster
none	none	 Well well it s a pity now that the Admiral s so headstrong It was that way he lost his fleet 
557-129797-0030	train-other-500	which was his own to lose This pleasant city of Maracaybo isn t So no doubt he ll lose it with fewer misgivings I am sorry Waste like bloodshed is a thing abhorrent to me But there ye are
557-129797-0031	train-other-500	I ll have the faggots to the place in the morning and maybe when he sees the blaze to morrow night he ll begin to believe that Peter Blood is a man of his word Ye may go Don Francisco The Deputy Governor went out with dragging feet
557-129797-0032	train-other-500	followed by guards his momentary truculence utterly spent But no sooner had he departed than up leapt Cahusac
none	none	 who had been of the council assembled to receive the Admiral s answer His face was white and his hands shook 
557-129797-0033	train-other-500	as he held them out in protest Death of my life what have you to say now he cried his voice husky And without waiting to hear what it might be he raved on I knew you not frighten the Admiral so easy
none	none	 He hold us entrap and he knows it yet you dream that he will yield himself to your impudent message 
557-129797-0034	train-other-500	Your fool letter it have seal the doom of us all Have ye done quoth Blood quietly as the Frenchman paused for breath No I have not Then spare me the rest It ll be of the same quality devil a doubt
557-129797-0035	train-other-500	and it doesn t help us to solve the riddle that s before us
none	none	 But what are you going to do Is it that you will tell me It was not a question it was a demand How the devil do I know I was hoping you d have some ideas yourself 
557-129797-0036	train-other-500	But since Ye re so desperately concerned to save your skin you and those that think like you are welcome to leave us I ve no doubt at all the Spanish Admiral will welcome the abatement of our numbers
none	none	 even at this late date 
557-129797-0037	train-other-500	Ye shall have the sloop as a parting gift from us and ye can join Don Miguel in the fort for all I care or for all the good ye re likely to be to us in this present pass It is to my men to decide Cahusac retorted swallowing his fury
none	none	 and on that stalked out to talk to them 
557-129797-0038	train-other-500	leaving the others to deliberate in peace Next morning early he sought Captain Blood again He found him alone in the patio pacing to and fro his head sunk on his breast Cahusac
557-129797-0039	train-other-500	mistook consideration for dejection Each of us carries in himself a standard by which to measure his neighbour We have take you at your word Captain he announced between sullenness and defiance Captain Blood paused
557-129797-0040	train-other-500	shoulders hunched hands behind his back and mildly regarded the buccaneer in silence Cahusac explained himself Last night I send one of my men to the Spanish Admiral with a letter
none	none	 I make him offer to capitulate 
557-129797-0041	train-other-500	if he will accord us passage with the honours of war This morning I receive his answer He accord us this on the understanding that we carry nothing away with us
none	none	 My men they are embarking them on the sloop 
557-129797-0042	train-other-500	We sail at once Bon voyage said Captain Blood
none	none	 and with a nod he turned on his heel again to resume his interrupted mediation Is that all that you have to say to me cried Cahusac There are other things said Blood over his shoulder But I know ye wouldn t like them Ha Then it s adieu my Captain Venomously he added It is my belief that we shall not meet again Your belief is my hope said Captain Blood Cahusac flung away obscenely vituperative Before noon he was under way with his followers some sixty dejected men who had allowed themselves to be persuaded by him into that empty handed departure in spite even of all that Yberville could do to prevent it The Admiral kept faith with him and allowed him free passage out to sea which from his knowledge of Spaniards was more than Captain Blood had expected Meanwhile no sooner had the deserters weighed anchor than Captain Blood received word that the Deputy Governor begged to be allowed to see him again Admitted Don Francisco at once displayed the fact that a night s reflection had quickened his apprehensions for the city of Maracaybo and his condemnation of the Admiral s intransigence Captain Blood received him pleasantly Good morning to you Don Francisco I have postponed the bonfire until nightfall It will make a better show in the dark Don Francisco a slight nervous elderly man of high lineage and low vitality came straight to business I am here to tell you Don Pedro that if you will hold your hand for three days I will undertake to raise the ransom you demand which Don Miguel de Espinosa refuses Captain Blood confronted him a frown contracting the dark brows above his light eyes And where will you be raising it quoth he faintly betraying his surprise Don Francisco shook his head That must remain my affair he answered I know where it is to be found and my compatriots must contribute Give me leave for three days on parole and I will see you fully satisfied Meanwhile my son remains in your hands as a hostage for my return And upon that he fell to pleading But in this he was crisply interrupted By the Saints Ye re a bold man Don Francisco to come to me with such a tale to tell me that ye know where the ransom s to be raised and yet to refuse to say D ye think now that with a match between your fingers ye d grow more communicative If Don Francisco grew a shade paler yet again he shook his head That was the way of Morgan and L Ollonais and other pirates But it is not the way of Captain Blood If I had doubted that I should not have disclosed so much The Captain laughed You old rogue said he Ye play upon my vanity do you Upon your honour Captain The honour of a pirate Ye re surely crazed The honour of Captain Blood Don Francisco insisted You have the repute of making war like a gentleman Captain Blood laughed again on a bitter sneering note that made Don Francisco fear the worst He was not to guess that it was himself the Captain mocked That s merely because it s more remunerative in the end And that is why you are accorded the three days you ask for So about it Don Francisco You shall have what mules you need I ll see to it Away went Don Francisco on his errand leaving Captain Blood to reflect between bitterness and satisfaction that a reputation for as much chivalry as is consistent with piracy is not without its uses Punctually on the third day the Deputy Governor was back in Maracaybo with his mules laden with plate and money to the value demanded and a herd of a hundred head of cattle driven in by negro slaves These bullocks were handed over to those of the company who ordinarily were boucan hunters and therefore skilled in the curing of meats and for best part of a week thereafter they were busy at the waterside with the quartering and salting of carcases While this was doing on the one hand and the ships were being refitted for sea on the other Captain Blood was pondering the riddle on the solution of which his own fate depended Indian spies whom he employed brought him word that the Spaniards working at low tide had salved the thirty guns of the Salvador and thus had added yet another battery to their already overwhelming strength In the end and hoping for inspiration on the spot Captain Blood made a reconnaissance in person At the risk of his life accompanied by two friendly Indians he crossed to the island in a canoe under cover of dark They concealed themselves and the canoe in the short thick scrub with which that side of the island was densely covered and lay there until daybreak Then Blood went forward alone and with infinite precaution to make his survey He went to verify a suspicion that he had formed and approached the fort as nearly as he dared and a deal nearer than was safe On all fours he crawled to the summit of an eminence a mile or so away whence he found himself commanding a view of the interior dispositions of the stronghold By the aid of a telescope with which he had equipped himself he was able to verify that as he had suspected and hoped the fort s artillery was all mounted on the seaward side Satisfied he returned to Maracaybo and laid before the six who composed his council Pitt Hagthorpe Yberville Wolverstone Dyke and Ogle a proposal to storm the fort from the landward side Crossing to the island under cover of night they would take the Spaniards by surprise and attempt to overpower them before they could shift their guns to meet the onslaught With the exception of Wolverstone who was by temperament the kind of man who favours desperate chances those officers received the proposal coldly Hagthorpe incontinently opposed it It s a harebrained scheme Peter he said gravely shaking his handsome head Consider now that we cannot depend upon approaching unperceived to a distance whence we might storm the fort before the cannon could be moved But even if we could we can take no cannon ourselves we must depend entirely upon our small arms and how shall we a bare three hundred for this was the number to which Cahusac s defection had reduced them cross the open to attack more than twice that number under cover The others Dyke Ogle Yberville and even Pitt whom loyalty to Blood may have made reluctant loudly approved him When they had done I have considered all said Captain Blood I have weighed the risks and studied how to lessen them In these desperate straits He broke off abruptly A moment he frowned deep in thought then his face was suddenly alight with inspiration Slowly he drooped his head and sat there considering weighing chin on breast Then he nodded muttering Yes and again Yes He looked up to face them Listen he cried You may be right The risks may be too heavy Whether or not I have thought of a better way That which should have been the real attack shall be no more than a feint Here then is the plan I now propose He talked swiftly and clearly and as he talked one by one his officers faces became alight with eagerness When he had done they cried as with one voice that he had saved them That is yet to be proved in action said he Since for the last twenty four hours all had been in readiness for departure there was nothing now to delay them and it was decided to move next morning Such was Captain Blood s assurance of success that he immediately freed the prisoners held as hostages and even the negro slaves who were regarded by the others as legitimate plunder His only precaution against those released prisoners was to order them into the church and there lock them up to await deliverance at the hands of those who should presently be coming into the city Then all being aboard the three ships with the treasure safely stowed in their holds and the slaves under hatches the buccaneers weighed anchor and stood out for the bar each vessel towing three piraguas astern The Admiral beholding their stately advance in the full light of noon their sails gleaming white in the glare of the sunlight rubbed his long lean hands in satisfaction and laughed through his teeth At last he cried God delivers him into my hands He turned to the group of staring officers behind him Sooner or later it had to be he said Say now gentlemen whether I am justified of my patience Here end to day the troubles caused to the subjects of the Catholic King by this infamous Don Pedro Sangre as he once called himself to me He turned to issue orders and the fort became lively as a hive The guns were manned the gunners already kindling fuses when the buccaneer fleet whilst still heading for Palomas was observed to bear away to the west The Spaniards watched them intrigued Within a mile and a half to westward of the fort and within a half mile of the shore that is to say on the very edge of the shoal water that makes Palomas unapproachable on either side by any but vessels of the shallowest draught the four ships cast anchor well within the Spaniards view but just out of range of their heaviest cannon Sneeringly the Admiral laughed Aha They hesitate these English dogs Por Dios and well they may They will be waiting for night suggested his nephew who stood at his elbow quivering with excitement Don Miguel looked at him smiling And what shall the night avail them in this narrow passage under the very muzzles of my guns Be sure Esteban that to night your father will be paid for He raised his telescope to continue his observation of the buccaneers He saw that the piraguas towed by each vessel were being warped alongside and he wondered a little what this manoeuver might portend Awhile those piraguas were hidden from view behind the hulls Then one by one they reappeared rowing round and away from the ships and each boat he observed was crowded with armed men Thus laden they were headed for the shore at a point where it was densely wooded to the water s edge The eyes of the wondering Admiral followed them until the foliage screened them from his view Then he lowered his telescope and looked at his officers What the devil does it mean he asked None answered him all being as puzzled as he was himself After a little while Esteban who kept his eyes on the water plucked at his uncle s sleeve There they go he cried and pointed And there indeed went the piraguas on their way back to the ships But now it was observed that they were empty save for the men who rowed them Their armed cargo had been left ashore Back to the ships they pulled to return again presently with a fresh load of armed men which similarly they conveyed to Palomas And at last one of the Spanish officers ventured an explanation They are going to attack us by land to attempt to storm the fort Of course The Admiral smiled I had guessed it Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad Shall we make a sally urged Esteban in his excitement A sally Through that scrub That would be to play into their hands No no we will wait here to receive this attack Whenever it comes it is themselves will be destroyed and utterly Have no doubt of that But by evening the Admiral s equanimity was not quite so perfect By then the piraguas had made a half dozen journeys with their loads of men and they had landed also as Don Miguel had clearly observed through his telescope at least a dozen guns His countenance no longer smiled it was a little wrathful and a little troubled now as he turned again to his officers Who was the fool who told me that they number but three hundred men in all They have put at least twice that number ashore already Amazed as he was his amazement would have been deeper had he been told the truth that there was not a single buccaneer or a single gun ashore on Palomas The deception had been complete Don Miguel could not guess that the men he had beheld in those piraguas were always the same that on the journeys to the shore they sat and stood upright in full view and that on the journeys back to the ships they lay invisible at the bottom of the boats which were thus made to appear empty The growing fears of the Spanish soldiery at the prospect of a night attack from the landward side by the entire buccaneer force and a force twice as strong as they had suspected the pestilent Blood to command began to be communicated to the Admiral In the last hours of fading daylight the Spaniards did precisely what Captain Blood so confidently counted that they would do precisely what they must do to meet the attack preparations for which had been so thoroughly simulated They set themselves to labour like the damned at those ponderous guns emplaced to command the narrow passage out to sea Groaning and sweating urged on by the curses and even the whips of their officers they toiled in a frenzy of panic stricken haste to shift the greater number and the more powerful of their guns across to the landward side there to emplace them anew so that they might be ready to receive the attack which at any moment now might burst upon them from the woods not half a mile away Thus when night fell although in mortal anxiety of the onslaught of those wild devils whose reckless courage was a byword on the seas of the Main at least the Spaniards were tolerably prepared for it Waiting they stood to their guns And whilst they waited thus under cover of the darkness and as the tide began to ebb Captain Blood s fleet weighed anchor quietly and as once before with no more canvas spread than that which their sprits could carry so as to give them steering way and even these having been painted black the four vessels without a light showing groped their way by soundings to the channel which led to that narrow passage out to sea The Elizabeth and the Infanta leading side by side were almost abreast of the fort before their shadowy bulks and the soft gurgle of water at their prows were detected by the Spaniards whose attention until that moment had been all on the other side And now there arose on the night air such a sound of human baffled fury as may have resounded about Babel at the confusion of tongues To heighten that confusion and to scatter disorder among the Spanish soldiery the Elizabeth emptied her larboard guns into the fort as she was swept past on the swift ebb At once realizing though not yet how he had been duped and that his prey was in the very act of escaping after all the Admiral frantically ordered the guns that had been so laboriously moved to be dragged back to their former emplacements and commanded his gunners meanwhile to the slender batteries that of all his powerful but now unavailable armament still remained trained upon the channel With these after the loss of some precious moments the fort at last made fire It was answered by a terrific broadside from the Arabella which had now drawn abreast and was crowding canvas to her yards The enraged and gibbering Spaniards had a brief vision of her as the line of flame spurted from her red flank and the thunder of her broadside drowned the noise of the creaking halyards After that they saw her no more Assimilated by the friendly darkness which the lesser Spanish guns were speculatively stabbing the escaping ships fired never another shot that might assist their baffled and bewildered enemies to locate them Some slight damage was sustained by Blood s fleet But by the time the Spaniards had resolved their confusion into some order of dangerous offence that fleet well served by a southerly breeze was through the narrows and standing out to sea Thus was Don Miguel de Espinosa left to chew the bitter cud of a lost opportunity and to consider in what terms he would acquaint the Supreme Council of the Catholic King that Peter Blood had got away from Maracaybo taking with him two twenty gun frigates that were lately the property of Spain to say nothing of two hundred and fifty thousand pieces of eight and other plunder And all this in spite of Don Miguel s four galleons and his heavily armed fort that at one time had held the pirates so securely trapped Heavy indeed grew the account of Peter Blood which Don Miguel swore passionately to Heaven should at all costs to himself be paid in full Nor were the losses already detailed the full total of those suffered on this occasion by the King of Spain For on the following evening off the coast of Oruba at the mouth of the Gulf of Venezuela Captain Blood s fleet came upon the belated Santo Nino speeding under full sail to reenforce Don Miguel at Maracaybo At first the Spaniard had conceived that she was meeting the victorious fleet of Don Miguel returning from the destruction of the pirates When at comparatively close quarters the pennon of saint George soared to the Arabella s masthead to disillusion her the Santo Nino chose the better part of valour and struck her flag Captain Blood ordered her crew to take to the boats and land themselves at Oruba or wherever else they pleased So considerate was he that to assist them he presented them with several of the piraguas which he still had in tow You will find said he to her captain that Don Miguel is in an extremely bad temper Commend me to him and say that I venture to remind him that he must blame himself for all the ills that have befallen him The evil has recoiled upon him which he loosed when he sent his brother unofficially to make a raid upon the island of Barbados Bid him think twice before he lets his devils loose upon an English settlement again With that he dismissed the Captain who went over the side of the Santo Nino and Captain Blood proceeded to investigate the value of this further prize When her hatches were removed a human cargo was disclosed in her hold Slaves said Wolverstone and persisted in that belief cursing Spanish devilry until Cahusac crawled up out of the dark bowels of the ship and stood blinking in the sunlight There was more than sunlight to make the Breton pirate blink And those that crawled out after him the remnants of his crew cursed him horribly for the pusillanimity which had brought them into the ignominy of owing their deliverance to those whom they had deserted as lost beyond hope Their sloop had encountered and had been sunk three days ago by the Santo Nino and Cahusac had narrowly escaped hanging merely that for some time he might be a mock among the Brethren of the Coast For many a month thereafter he was to hear in Tortuga the jeering taunt Where do you spend the gold that you brought back from Maracaybo CHAPTER XVIII THE MILAGROSA The affair at Maracaybo is to be considered as Captain Blood s buccaneering masterpiece Although there is scarcely one of the many actions that he fought recorded in such particular detail by Jeremy Pitt which does not afford some instance of his genius for naval tactics yet in none is this more shiningly displayed than in those two engagements by which he won out of the trap which Don Miguel de Espinosa had sprung upon him The fame which he had enjoyed before this great as it already was is dwarfed into insignificance by the fame that followed It was a fame such as no buccaneer not even Morgan has ever boasted before or since In Tortuga during the months he spent there refitting the three ships he had captured from the fleet that had gone out to destroy him he found himself almost an object of worship in the eyes of the wild Brethren of the Coast all of whom now clamoured for the honour of serving under him It placed him in the rare position of being able to pick and choose the crews for his augmented fleet and he chose fastidiously When next he sailed away it was with a fleet of five fine ships in which went something over a thousand men Thus you behold him not merely famous but really formidable The three captured Spanish vessels he had renamed with a certain scholarly humour the Clotho Lachesis and Atropos a grimly jocular manner of conveying to the world that he made them the arbiters of the fate of any Spaniards he should henceforth encounter upon the seas In Europe the news of this fleet following upon the news of the Spanish Admiral s defeat at Maracaybo produced something of a sensation Spain and England were variously and unpleasantly exercised and if you care to turn up the diplomatic correspondence exchanged on the subject you will find that it is considerable and not always amiable And meanwhile in the Caribbean the Spanish Admiral Don Miguel de Espinosa might be said to use a term not yet invented in his day to have run amok The disgrace into which he had fallen as a result of the disasters suffered at the hands of Captain Blood had driven the Admiral all but mad It is impossible if we impose our minds impartially to withhold a certain sympathy from Don Miguel Hate was now this unfortunate man s daily bread and the hope of vengeance an obsession to his mind As a madman he went raging up and down the Caribbean seeking his enemy and in the meantime as an hors d oeuvre to his vindictive appetite he fell upon any ship of England or of France that loomed above his horizon I need say no more to convey the fact that this illustrious sea captain and great gentleman of Castile had lost his head and was become a pirate in his turn The Supreme Council of Castile might anon condemn him for his practices But how should that matter to one who already was condemned beyond redemption On the contrary if he should live to lay the audacious and ineffable Blood by the heels it was possible that Spain might view his present irregularities and earlier losses with a more lenient eye And so reckless of the fact that Captain Blood was now in vastly superior strength the Spaniard sought him up and down the trackless seas But for a whole year he sought him vainly The circumstances in which eventually they met are very curious An intelligent observation of the facts of human existence will reveal to shallow minded folk who sneer at the use of coincidence in the arts of fiction and drama that life itself is little more than a series of coincidences Open the history of the past at whatsoever page you will and there you shall find coincidence at work bringing about events that the merest chance might have averted Indeed coincidence may be defined as the very tool used by Fate to shape the destinies of men and nations Observe it now at work in the affairs of Captain Blood and of some others On the fifteenth September of the year sixteen eighty eight a memorable year in the annals of England three ships were afloat upon the Caribbean which in their coming conjunctions were to work out the fortunes of several persons The first of these was Captain Blood s flagship the Arabella which had been separated from the buccaneer fleet in a hurricane off the Lesser Antilles In somewhere about seventeen deg N Lat and seventy four deg Long she was beating up for the Windward Passage before the intermittent southeasterly breezes of that stifling season homing for Tortuga the natural rendezvous of the dispersed vessels The second ship was the great Spanish galleon the Milagrosa which accompanied by the smaller frigate Hidalga lurked off the Caymites to the north of the long peninsula that thrusts out from the southwest corner of Hispaniola Aboard the Milagrosa sailed the vindictive Don Miguel The third and last of these ships with which we are at present concerned was an English man of war which on the date I have given was at anchor in the French port of saint Nicholas on the northwest coast of Hispaniola She was on her way from Plymouth to Jamaica and carried on board a very distinguished passenger in the person of Lord Julian Wade who came charged by his kinsman my Lord Sunderland with a mission of some consequence and delicacy directly arising out of that vexatious correspondence between England and Spain The French Government like the English excessively annoyed by the depredations of the buccaneers and the constant straining of relations with Spain that ensued had sought in vain to put them down by enjoining the utmost severity against them upon her various overseas governors But these either like the Governor of Tortuga throve out of a scarcely tacit partnership with the filibusters or like the Governor of French Hispaniola felt that they were to be encouraged as a check upon the power and greed of Spain which might otherwise be exerted to the disadvantage of the colonies of other nations They looked indeed with apprehension upon recourse to any vigorous measures which must result in driving many of the buccaneers to seek new hunting grounds in the South Sea To satisfy King James s anxiety to conciliate Spain and in response to the Spanish Ambassador s constant and grievous expostulations my Lord Sunderland the Secretary of State had appointed a strong man to the deputy governorship of Jamaica This strong man was that Colonel Bishop who for some years now had been the most influential planter in Barbados Colonel Bishop had accepted the post and departed from the plantations in which his great wealth was being amassed with an eagerness that had its roots in a desire to pay off a score of his own with Peter Blood From his first coming to Jamaica Colonel Bishop had made himself felt by the buccaneers But do what he might the one buccaneer whom he made his particular quarry that Peter Blood who once had been his slave eluded him ever and continued undeterred and in great force to harass the Spaniards upon sea and land and to keep the relations between England and Spain in a state of perpetual ferment particularly dangerous in those days when the peace of Europe was precariously maintained Exasperated not only by his own accumulated chagrin but also by the reproaches for his failure which reached him from London Colonel Bishop actually went so far as to consider hunting his quarry in Tortuga itself and making an attempt to clear the island of the buccaneers it sheltered Fortunately for himself he abandoned the notion of so insane an enterprise deterred not only by the enormous natural strength of the place but also by the reflection that a raid upon what was nominally at least a French settlement must be attended by grave offence to France Yet short of some such measure it appeared to Colonel Bishop that he was baffled He confessed as much in a letter to the Secretary of State This letter and the state of things which it disclosed made my Lord Sunderland despair of solving this vexatious problem by ordinary means He turned to the consideration of extraordinary ones and bethought him of the plan adopted with Morgan who had been enlisted into the King s service under Charles II It occurred to him that a similar course might be similarly effective with Captain Blood His lordship did not omit the consideration that Blood s present outlawry might well have been undertaken not from inclination but under stress of sheer necessity that he had been forced into it by the circumstances of his transportation and that he would welcome the opportunity of emerging from it Acting upon this conclusion Sunderland sent out his kinsman Lord Julian Wade with some commissions made out in blank and full directions as to the course which the Secretary considered it desirable to pursue and yet full discretion in the matter of pursuing them The crafty Sunderland master of all labyrinths of intrigue advised his kinsman that in the event of his finding Blood intractable or judging for other reasons that it was not desirable to enlist him in the King s service he should turn his attention to the officers serving under him and by seducing them away from him leave him so weakened that he must fall an easy victim to Colonel Bishop s fleet The Royal Mary the vessel bearing that ingenious tolerably accomplished mildly dissolute entirely elegant envoy of my Lord Sunderland s made a good passage to saint Nicholas her last port of call before Jamaica It was understood that as a preliminary Lord Julian should report himself to the Deputy Governor at Port Royal whence at need he might have himself conveyed to Tortuga Now it happened that the Deputy Governor s niece had come to saint Nicholas some months earlier on a visit to some relatives and so that she might escape the insufferable heat of Jamaica in that season The time for her return being now at hand a passage was sought for her aboard the Royal Mary and in view of her uncle s rank and position promptly accorded Lord Julian hailed her advent with satisfaction It gave a voyage that had been full of interest for him just the spice that it required to achieve perfection as an experience His lordship was one of your gallants to whom existence that is not graced by womankind is more or less of a stagnation Miss Arabella Bishop this straight up and down slip of a girl with her rather boyish voice and her almost boyish ease of movement was not perhaps a lady who in England would have commanded much notice in my lord s discerning eyes His very sophisticated carefully educated tastes in such matters inclined him towards the plump the languishing and the quite helplessly feminine Miss Bishop s charms were undeniable But they were such that it would take a delicate minded man to appreciate them and my Lord Julian whilst of a mind that was very far from gross did not possess the necessary degree of delicacy I must not by this be understood to imply anything against him It remained however that Miss Bishop was a young woman and a lady and in the latitude into which Lord Julian had strayed this was a phenomenon sufficiently rare to command attention On his side with his title and position his personal grace and the charm of a practised courtier he bore about him the atmosphere of the great world in which normally he had his being a world that was little more than a name to her who had spent most of her life in the Antilles It is not therefore wonderful that they should have been attracted to each other before the Royal Mary was warped out of saint Nicholas Each could tell the other much upon which the other desired information He could regale her imagination with stories of saint James s in many of which he assigned himself a heroic or at least a distinguished part and she could enrich his mind with information concerning this new world to which he had come Before they were out of sight of saint Nicholas they were good friends and his lordship was beginning to correct his first impressions of her and to discover the charm of that frank straightforward attitude of comradeship which made her treat every man as a brother Considering how his mind was obsessed with the business of his mission it is not wonderful that he should have come to talk to her of Captain Blood Indeed there was a circumstance that directly led to it I wonder now he said as they were sauntering on the poop if you ever saw this fellow Blood who was at one time on your uncle s plantations as a slave Miss Bishop halted She leaned upon the taffrail looking out towards the receding land and it was a moment before she answered in a steady level voice I saw him often I knew him very well Ye don t say His lordship was slightly moved out of an imperturbability that he had studiously cultivated He was a young man of perhaps eight and twenty well above the middle height in stature and appearing taller by virtue of his exceeding leanness He had a thin pale rather pleasing hatchet face framed in the curls of a golden periwig a sensitive mouth and pale blue eyes that lent his countenance a dreamy expression a rather melancholy pensiveness But they were alert observant eyes notwithstanding although they failed on this occasion to observe the slight change of colour which his question had brought to Miss Bishop s cheeks or the suspiciously excessive composure of her answer Ye don t say he repeated and came to lean beside her And what manner of man did you find him In those days I esteemed him for an unfortunate gentleman You were acquainted with his story He told it me That is why I esteemed him for the calm fortitude with which he bore adversity Since then considering what he has done I have almost come to doubt if what he told me of himself was true If you mean of the wrongs he suffered at the hands of the Royal Commission that tried the Monmouth rebels there s little doubt that it would be true enough He was never out with Monmouth that is certain He was convicted on a point of law of which he may well have been ignorant when he committed what was construed into treason But faith he s had his revenge after a fashion That she said in a small voice is the unforgivable thing It has destroyed him deservedly Destroyed him His lordship laughed a little Be none so sure of that He has grown rich I hear He has translated so it is said his Spanish spoils into French gold which is being treasured up for him in France His future father in law M d Ogeron has seen to that His future father in law said she and stared at him round eyed with parted lips Then added M d Ogeron The Governor of Tortuga The same You see the fellow s well protected It s a piece of news I gathered in saint Nicholas I am not sure that I welcome it for I am not sure that it makes any easier a task upon which my kinsman Lord Sunderland has sent me hither But there it is You didn t know She shook her head without replying She had averted her face and her eyes were staring down at the gently heaving water After a moment she spoke her voice steady and perfectly controlled But surely if this were true there would have been an end to his piracy by now If he if he loved a woman and was betrothed and was also rich as you say surely he would have abandoned this desperate life and Why so I thought his lordship interrupted until I had the explanation D Ogeron is avaricious for himself and for his child And as for the girl I m told she s a wild piece fit mate for such a man as Blood Almost I marvel that he doesn t marry her and take her a roving with him It would be no new experience for her And I marvel too at Blood s patience He killed a man to win her He killed a man for her do you say There was horror now in her voice Yes a French buccaneer named Levasseur He was the girl s lover and Blood s associate on a venture Blood coveted the girl and killed Levasseur to win her Pah It s an unsavoury tale I own But men live by different codes out in these parts She had turned to face him She was pale to the lips and her hazel eyes were blazing as she cut into his apologies for Blood They must indeed if his other associates allowed him to live after that Oh the thing was done in fair fight I am told Who told you A man who sailed with them a Frenchman named Cahusac whom I found in a waterside tavern in saint Nicholas He was Levasseur s lieutenant and he was present on the island where the thing happened and when Levasseur was killed And the girl Did he say the girl was present too Yes She was a witness of the encounter Blood carried her off when he had disposed of his brother buccaneer And the dead man s followers allowed it He caught the note of incredulity in her voice but missed the note of relief with which it was blent Oh I don t believe the tale I won t believe it I honour you for that Miss Bishop It strained my own belief that men should be so callous until this Cahusac afforded me the explanation What She checked her unbelief an unbelief that had uplifted her from an inexplicable dismay Clutching the rail she swung round to face his lordship with that question Later he was to remember and perceive in her present behaviour a certain oddness which went disregarded now Blood purchased their consent and his right to carry the girl off He paid them in pearls that were worth more than twenty thousand pieces of eight His lordship laughed again with a touch of contempt A handsome price Faith they re scoundrels all just thieving venal curs And faith it s a pretty tale this for a lady s ear She looked away from him again and found that her sight was blurred After a moment in a voice less steady than before she asked him Why should this Frenchman have told you such a tale Did he hate this Captain Blood I did not gather that said his lordship slowly He related it oh just as a commonplace an instance of buccaneering ways A commonplace said she My God A commonplace I dare say that we are all savages under the cloak that civilization fashions for us said his lordship But this Blood now was a man of considerable parts from what else this Cahusac told me He was a bachelor of medicine That is true to my own knowledge And he has seen much foreign service on sea and land Cahusac said though this I hardly credit that he had fought under de Ruyter That also is true said she She sighed heavily Your Cahusac seems to have been accurate enough Alas You are sorry then She looked at him She was very pale he noticed As we are sorry to hear of the death of one we have esteemed Once I held him in regard for an unfortunate but worthy gentleman Now She checked and smiled a little crooked smile Such a man is best forgotten And upon that she passed at once to speak of other things The friendship which it was her great gift to command in all she met grew steadily between those two in the little time remaining until the event befell that marred what was promising to be the pleasantest stage of his lordship s voyage The marplot was the mad dog Spanish Admiral whom they encountered on the second day out when halfway across the Gulf of Gonaves The Captain of the Royal Mary was not disposed to be intimidated even when Don Miguel opened fire on him Observing the Spaniard s plentiful seaboard towering high above the water and offering him so splendid a mark the Englishman was moved to scorn If this Don who flew the banner of Castile wanted a fight the Royal Mary was just the ship to oblige him It may be that he was justified of his gallant confidence and that he would that day have put an end to the wild career of Don Miguel de Espinosa but that a lucky shot from the Milagrosa got among some powder stored in his forecastle and blew up half his ship almost before the fight had started How the powder came there will never now be known and the gallant Captain himself did not survive to enquire into it Before the men of the Royal Mary had recovered from their consternation their captain killed and a third of their number destroyed with him the ship yawing and rocking helplessly in a crippled state the Spaniards boarded her In the Captain s cabin under the poop to which Miss Bishop had been conducted for safety Lord Julian was seeking to comfort and encourage her with assurances that all would yet be well at the very moment when Don Miguel was stepping aboard Lord Julian himself was none so steady and his face was undoubtedly pale Not that he was by any means a coward But this cooped up fighting on an unknown element in a thing of wood that might at any moment founder under his feet into the depths of ocean was disturbing to one who could be brave enough ashore Fortunately Miss Bishop did not appear to be in desperate need of the poor comfort he was in case to offer Certainly she too was pale and her hazel eyes may have looked a little larger than usual But she had herself well in hand Half sitting half leaning on the Captain s table she preserved her courage sufficiently to seek to calm the octoroon waiting woman who was grovelling at her feet in a state of terror And then the cabin door flew open and Don Miguel himself tall sunburned and aquiline of face strode in Lord Julian span round to face him and clapped a hand to his sword The Spaniard was brisk and to the point Don t be a fool he said in his own tongue or you ll come by a fool s end Your ship is sinking There were three or four men in morions behind Don Miguel and Lord Julian realized the position He released his hilt and a couple of feet or so of steel slid softly back into the scabbard But Don Miguel smiled with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard and held out his hand If you please he said Lord Julian hesitated His eyes strayed to Miss Bishop s I think you had better said that composed young lady whereupon with a shrug his lordship made the required surrender Come you all of you aboard my ship Don Miguel invited them and strode out They went of course For one thing the Spaniard had force to compel them for another a ship which he announced to be sinking offered them little inducement to remain They stayed no longer than was necessary to enable Miss Bishop to collect some spare articles of dress and my lord to snatch up his valise As for the survivors in that ghastly shambles that had been the Royal Mary they were abandoned by the Spaniards to their own resources Let them take to the boats and if those did not suffice them let them swim or drown If Lord Julian and Miss Bishop were retained it was because Don Miguel perceived their obvious value He received them in his cabin with great urbanity Urbanely he desired to have the honour of being acquainted with their names Lord Julian sick with horror of the spectacle he had just witnessed commanded himself with difficulty to supply them Then haughtily he demanded to know in his turn the name of their aggressor He was in an exceedingly ill temper He realized that if he had done nothing positively discreditable in the unusual and difficult position into which Fate had thrust him at least he had done nothing creditable This might have mattered less but that the spectator of his indifferent performance was a lady He was determined if possible to do better now I am Don Miguel de Espinosa he was answered Admiral of the Navies of the Catholic King Lord Julian gasped If Spain made such a hubbub about the depredations of a runagate adventurer like Captain Blood what could not England answer now Will you tell me then why you behave like a damned pirate he asked And added I hope you realize what will be the consequences and the strict account to which you shall be brought for this day s work for the blood you have murderously shed and for your violence to this lady and to myself I offer you no violence said the Admiral smiling as only the man who holds the trumps can smile On the contrary I have saved your lives Saved our lives Lord Julian was momentarily speechless before such callous impudence And what of the lives you have destroyed in wanton butchery By God man they shall cost you dear Don Miguel s smile persisted It is possible All things are possible Meantime it is your own lives that will cost you dear Colonel Bishop is a rich man and you milord are no doubt also rich I will consider and fix your ransom So that you re just the damned murderous pirate I was supposing you stormed his lordship And you have the impudence to call yourself the Admiral of the Navies of the Catholic King We shall see what your Catholic King will have to say to it The Admiral ceased to smile He revealed something of the rage that had eaten into his brain You do not understand he said It is that I treat you English heretic dogs just as you English heretic dogs have treated Spaniards upon the seas you robbers and thieves out of hell I have the honesty to do it in my own name but you you perfidious beasts you send your Captain Bloods your Hagthorpes and your Morgans against us and disclaim responsibility for what they do Like Pilate you wash your hands He laughed savagely Let Spain play the part of Pilate Let her disclaim responsibility for me when your ambassador at the Escurial shall go whining to the Supreme Council of this act of piracy by Don Miguel de Espinosa Captain Blood and the rest are not admirals of England cried Lord Julian Are they not How do I know How does Spain know Are you not liars all you English heretics Sir Lord Julian s voice was harsh as a rasp his eyes flashed Instinctively he swung a hand to the place where his sword habitually hung Then he shrugged and sneered Of course said he it sorts with all I have heard of Spanish honour and all that I have seen of yours that you should insult a man who is unarmed and your prisoner The Admiral s face flamed scarlet He half raised his hand to strike And then restrained perhaps by the very words that had cloaked the retorting insult he turned on his heel abruptly and went out without answering CHAPTER XIX THE MEETING As the door slammed after the departing Admiral Lord Julian turned to Arabella and actually smiled He felt that he was doing better and gathered from it an almost childish satisfaction childish in all the circumstances Decidedly I think I had the last word there he said with a toss of his golden ringlets Miss Bishop seated at the cabin table looked at him steadily without returning his smile Does it matter then so much having the last word I am thinking of those poor fellows on the Royal Mary Many of them have had their last word indeed And for what A fine ship sunk a score of lives lost thrice that number now in jeopardy and all for what You are overwrought ma am I Overwrought She uttered a single sharp note of laughter I assure you I am calm I am asking you a question Lord Julian Why has this Spaniard done all this To what purpose You heard him Lord Julian shrugged angrily Blood lust he explained shortly Blood lust she asked She was amazed Does such a thing exist then It is insane monstrous Fiendish his lordship agreed Devil s work I don t understand At Bridgetown three years ago there was a Spanish raid and things were done that should have been impossible to men horrible revolting things which strain belief which seem when I think of them now like the illusions of some evil dream Are men just beasts Men said Lord Julian staring Say Spaniards and I ll agree He was an Englishman speaking of hereditary foes And yet there was a measure of truth in what he said This is the Spanish way in the New World Faith almost it justifies such men as Blood of what they do She shivered as if cold and setting her elbows on the table she took her chin in her hands and sat staring before her Observing her his lordship noticed how drawn and white her face had grown There was reason enough for that and for worse Not any other woman of his acquaintance would have preserved her self control in such an ordeal and of fear at least at no time had Miss Bishop shown any sign It is impossible that he did not find her admirable A Spanish steward entered bearing a silver chocolate service and a box of Peruvian candies which he placed on the table before the lady With the Admiral s homage he said then bowed and withdrew Miss Bishop took no heed of him or his offering but continued to stare before her lost in thought Lord Julian took a turn in the long low cabin which was lighted by a skylight above and great square windows astern It was luxuriously appointed there were rich Eastern rugs on the floor well filled bookcases stood against the bulkheads and there was a carved walnut sideboard laden with silverware On a long low chest standing under the middle stern port lay a guitar that was gay with ribbons Lord Julian picked it up twanged the strings once as if moved by nervous irritation and put it down He turned again to face Miss Bishop I came out here he said to put down piracy But blister me I begin to think that the French are right in desiring piracy to continue as a curb upon these Spanish scoundrels He was to be strongly confirmed in that opinion before many hours were past Meanwhile their treatment at the hands of Don Miguel was considerate and courteous It confirmed the opinion contemptuously expressed to his lordship by Miss Bishop that since they were to be held to ransom they need not fear any violence or hurt A cabin was placed at the disposal of the lady and her terrified woman and another at Lord Julian s They were given the freedom of the ship and bidden to dine at the Admiral s table nor were his further intentions regarding them mentioned nor yet his immediate destination The Milagrosa with her consort the Hidalga rolling after her steered a south by westerly course then veered to the southeast round Cape Tiburon and thereafter standing well out to sea with the land no more than a cloudy outline to larboard she headed directly east and so ran straight into the arms of Captain Blood who was making for the Windward Passage as we know That happened early on the following morning After having systematically hunted his enemy in vain for a year Don Miguel chanced upon him in this unexpected and entirely fortuitous fashion But that is the ironic way of Fortune It was also the way of Fortune that Don Miguel should thus come upon the Arabella at a time when separated from the rest of the fleet she was alone and at a disadvantage It looked to Don Miguel as if the luck which so long had been on Blood s side had at last veered in his own favour Miss Bishop newly risen had come out to take the air on the quarter deck with his lordship in attendance as you would expect of so gallant a gentleman when she beheld the big red ship that had once been the Cinco Llagas out of Cadiz The vessel was bearing down upon them her mountains of snowy canvas bellying forward the long pennon with the cross of saint George fluttering from her main truck in the morning breeze the gilded portholes in her red hull and the gilded beak head aflash in the morning sun Miss Bishop was not to recognize this for that same Cinco Llagas which she had seen once before on a tragic day in Barbados three years ago To her it was just a great ship that was heading resolutely majestically towards them and an Englishman to judge by the pennon she was flying The sight thrilled her curiously it awoke in her an uplifting sense of pride that took no account of the danger to herself in the encounter that must now be inevitable Beside her on the poop whither they had climbed to obtain a better view and equally arrested and at gaze stood Lord Julian But he shared none of her exultation He had been in his first sea fight yesterday and he felt that the experience would suffice him for a very considerable time This I insist is no reflection upon his courage Look said Miss Bishop pointing and to his infinite amazement he observed that her eyes were sparkling Did she realize he wondered what was afoot Her next sentence resolved his doubt She is English and she comes resolutely on She means to fight God help her then said his lordship gloomily Her captain must be mad What can he hope to do against two such heavy hulks as these If they could so easily blow the Royal Mary out of the water what will they do to this vessel Look at that devil Don Miguel He s utterly disgusting in his glee From the quarter deck where he moved amid the frenzy of preparation the Admiral had turned to flash a backward glance at his prisoners His eyes were alight his face transfigured He flung out an arm to point to the advancing ship and bawled something in Spanish that was lost to them in the noise of the labouring crew They advanced to the poop rail and watched the bustle Telescope in hand on the quarter deck Don Miguel was issuing his orders Already the gunners were kindling their matches sailors were aloft taking in sail others were spreading a stout rope net above the waist as a protection against falling spars And meanwhile Don Miguel had been signalling to his consort in response to which the Hidalga had drawn steadily forward until she was now abeam of the Milagrosa half cable s length to starboard and from the height of the tall poop my lord and Miss Bishop could see her own bustle of preparation And they could discern signs of it now aboard the advancing English ship as well She was furling tops and mainsail stripping in fact to mizzen and sprit for the coming action Thus almost silently without challenge or exchange of signals had action been mutually determined Of necessity now under diminished sail the advance of the Arabella was slower but it was none the less steady She was already within saker shot and they could make out the figures stirring on her forecastle and the brass guns gleaming on her prow The gunners of the Milagrosa raised their linstocks and blew upon their smouldering matches looking up impatiently at the Admiral But the Admiral solemnly shook his head Patience he exhorted them Save your fire until we have him He is coming straight to his doom straight to the yardarm and the rope that have been so long waiting for him Stab me said his lordship This Englishman may be gallant enough to accept battle against such odds But there are times when discretion is a better quality than gallantry in a commander Gallantry will often win through even against overwhelming strength said Miss Bishop He looked at her and noted in her bearing only excitement Of fear he could still discern no trace His lordship was past amazement She was not by any means the kind of woman to which life had accustomed him Presently he said you will suffer me to place you under cover I can see best from here she answered him And added quietly I am praying for this Englishman He must be very brave Under his breath Lord Julian damned the fellow s bravery The Arabella was advancing now along a course which if continued must carry her straight between the two Spanish ships My lord pointed it out He s crazy surely he cried He s driving straight into a death trap He ll be crushed to splinters between the two No wonder that black faced Don is holding his fire In his place I should do the same But even at that moment the Admiral raised his hand in the waist below him a trumpet blared and immediately the gunner on the prow touched off his guns As the thunder of them rolled out his lordship saw ahead beyond the English ship and to larboard of her two heavy splashes Almost at once two successive spurts of flame leapt from the brass cannon on the Arabella s beak head and scarcely had the watchers on the poop seen the shower of spray where one of the shots struck the water near them then with a rending crash and a shiver that shook the Milagrosa from stem to stern the other came to lodge in her forecastle To avenge that blow the Hidalga blazed at the Englishman with both her forward guns But even at that short range between two and three hundred yards neither shot took effect At a hundred yards the Arabella s forward guns which had meanwhile been reloaded fired again at the Milagrosa and this time smashed her bowsprit into splinters so that for a moment she yawed wildly to port Don Miguel swore profanely and then as the helm was put over to swing her back to her course his own prow replied But the aim was too high and whilst one of the shots tore through the Arabella s shrouds and scarred her mainmast the other again went wide And when the smoke of that discharge had lifted the English ship was found almost between the Spaniards her bows in line with theirs and coming steadily on into what his lordship deemed a death trap Lord Julian held his breath and Miss Bishop gasped clutching the rail before her She had a glimpse of the wickedly grinning face of Don Miguel and the grinning faces of the men at the guns in the waist At last the Arabella was right between the Spanish ships prow to poop and poop to prow Don Miguel spoke to the trumpeter who had mounted the quarter deck and stood now at the Admiral s elbow The man raised the silver bugle that was to give the signal for the broadsides of both ships But even as he placed it to his lips the Admiral seized his arm to arrest him Only then had he perceived what was so obvious or should have been to an experienced sea fighter he had delayed too long and Captain Blood had outmanoeuvred him In attempting to fire now upon the Englishman the Milagrosa and her consort would also be firing into each other Too late he ordered his helmsman to put the tiller hard over and swing the ship to larboard as a preliminary to manoeuvring for a less impossible position of attack At that very moment the Arabella seemed to explode as she swept by Eighteen guns from each of her flanks emptied themselves at that point blank range into the hulls of the two Spanish vessels Half stunned by that reverberating thunder and thrown off her balance by the sudden lurch of the ship under her feet Miss Bishop hurtled violently against Lord Julian who kept his feet only by clutching the rail on which he had been leaning Billowing clouds of smoke to starboard blotted out everything and its acrid odour taking them presently in the throat set them gasping and coughing From the grim confusion and turmoil in the waist below arose a clamour of fierce Spanish blasphemies and the screams of maimed men The Milagrosa staggered slowly ahead a gaping rent in her bulwarks her foremast was shattered fragments of the yards hanging in the netting spread below Her beak head was in splinters and a shot had smashed through into the great cabin reducing it to wreckage Don Miguel was bawling orders wildly and peering ever and anon through the curtain of smoke that was drifting slowly astern in his anxiety to ascertain how it might have fared with the Hidalga Suddenly and ghostly at first through that lifting haze loomed the outline of a ship gradually the lines of her red hull became more and more sharply defined as she swept nearer with poles all bare save for the spread of canvas on her sprit Instead of holding to her course as Don Miguel had expected she would the Arabella had gone about under cover of the smoke and sailing now in the same direction as the Milagrosa was converging sharply upon her across the wind so sharply that almost before the frenzied Don Miguel had realized the situation his vessel staggered under the rending impact with which the other came hurtling alongside There was a rattle and clank of metal as a dozen grapnels fell and tore and caught in the timbers of the Milagrosa and the Spaniard was firmly gripped in the tentacles of the English ship Beyond her and now well astern the veil of smoke was rent at last and the Hidalga was revealed in desperate case She was bilging fast with an ominous list to larboard and it could be no more than a question of moments before she settled down The attention of her hands was being entirely given to a desperate endeavour to launch the boats in time Of this Don Miguel s anguished eyes had no more than a fleeting but comprehensive glimpse before his own decks were invaded by a wild yelling swarm of boarders from the grappling ship Never was confidence so quickly changed into despair never was hunter more swiftly converted into helpless prey For helpless the Spaniards were The swiftly executed boarding manoeuvre had caught them almost unawares in the moment of confusion following the punishing broadside they had sustained at such short range For a moment there was a valiant effort by some of Don Miguel s officers to rally the men for a stand against these invaders But the Spaniards never at their best in close quarter fighting were here demoralized by knowledge of the enemies with whom they had to deal Their hastily formed ranks were smashed before they could be steadied driven across the waist to the break of the poop on the one side and up to the forecastle bulkheads on the other the fighting resolved itself into a series of skirmishes between groups And whilst this was doing above another horde of buccaneers swarmed through the hatch to the main deck below to overpower the gun crews at their stations there On the quarter deck towards which an overwhelming wave of buccaneers was sweeping led by a one eyed giant who was naked to the waist stood Don Miguel numbed by despair and rage Above and behind him on the poop Lord Julian and Miss Bishop looked on his lordship aghast at the fury of this cooped up fighting the lady s brave calm conquered at last by horror so that she reeled there sick and faint Soon however the rage of that brief fight was spent They saw the banner of Castile come fluttering down from the masthead A buccaneer had slashed the halyard with his cutlass The boarders were in possession and on the upper deck groups of disarmed Spaniards stood huddled now like herded sheep Suddenly Miss Bishop recovered from her nausea to lean forward staring wild eyed whilst if possible her cheeks turned yet a deadlier hue than they had been already Picking his way daintily through that shambles in the waist came a tall man with a deeply tanned face that was shaded by a Spanish headpiece He was armed in back and breast of black steel beautifully damascened with golden arabesques Over this like a stole he wore a sling of scarlet silk from each end of which hung a silver mounted pistol Up the broad companion to the quarter deck he came toying with easy assurance until he stood before the Spanish Admiral Then he bowed stiff and formally A crisp metallic voice speaking perfect Spanish reached those two spectators on the poop and increased the admiring wonder in which Lord Julian had observed the man s approach We meet again at last Don Miguel it said I hope you are satisfied Although the meeting may not be exactly as you pictured it at least it has been very ardently sought and desired by you Speechless livid of face his mouth distorted and his breathing laboured Don Miguel de Espinosa received the irony of that man to whom he attributed his ruin and more beside Then he uttered an inarticulate cry of rage and his hand swept to his sword But even as his fingers closed upon the hilt the other s closed upon his wrist to arrest the action Calm Don Miguel he was quietly but firmly enjoined Do not recklessly invite the ugly extremes such as you would yourself have practised had the situation been reversed A moment they stood looking into each other s eyes What do you intend by me the Spaniard enquired at last his voice hoarse Captain Blood shrugged The firm lips smiled a little All that I intend has been already accomplished And lest it increase your rancour I beg you to observe that you have brought it entirely upon yourself You would have it so He turned and pointed to the boats which his men were heaving from the boom amidships Your boats are being launched You are at liberty to embark in them with your men before we scuttle this ship Yonder are the shores of Hispaniola You should make them safely And if you ll take my advice sir you ll not hunt me again I think I am unlucky to you Get you home to Spain Don Miguel and to concerns that you understand better than this trade of the sea For a long moment the defeated Admiral continued to stare his hatred in silence then still without speaking he went down the companion staggering like a drunken man his useless rapier clattering behind him His conqueror who had not even troubled to disarm him watched him go then turned and faced those two immediately above him on the poop Lord Julian might have observed had he been less taken up with other things that the fellow seemed suddenly to stiffen and that he turned pale under his deep tan A moment he stood at gaze then suddenly and swiftly he came up the steps Lord Julian stood forward to meet him Ye don t mean sir that you ll let that Spanish scoundrel go free he cried The gentleman in the black corselet appeared to become aware of his lordship for the first time And who the devil may you be he asked with a marked Irish accent And what business may it be of yours at all His lordship conceived that the fellow s truculence and utter lack of proper deference must be corrected I am Lord Julian Wade he announced with that object Apparently the announcement made no impression Are you indeed Then perhaps ye ll explain what the plague you re doing aboard this ship Lord Julian controlled himself to afford the desired explanation He did so shortly and impatiently He took you prisoner did he along with Miss Bishop there You are acquainted with Miss Bishop cried his lordship passing from surprise to surprise But this mannerless fellow had stepped past him and was making a leg to the lady who on her side remained unresponsive and forbidding to the point of scorn Observing this he turned to answer Lord Julian s question I had that honour once said he But it seems that Miss Bishop has a shorter memory His lips were twisted into a wry smile and there was pain in the blue eyes that gleamed so vividly under his black brows pain blending with the mockery of his voice But of all this it was the mockery alone that was perceived by Miss Bishop she resented it I do not number thieves and pirates among my acquaintance Captain Blood said she whereupon his lordship exploded in excitement Captain Blood he cried Are you Captain Blood What else were ye supposing Blood asked the question wearily his mind on other things I do not number thieves and pirates among my acquaintance The cruel phrase filled his brain reechoing and reverberating there But Lord Julian would not be denied He caught him by the sleeve with one hand whilst with the other he pointed after the retreating dejected figure of Don Miguel Do I understand that ye re not going to hang that Spanish scoundrel What for should I be hanging him Because he s just a damned pirate as I can prove as I have proved already Ah said Blood and Lord Julian marvelled at the sudden haggardness of a countenance that had been so devil may care but a few moments since I am a damned pirate myself and so I am merciful with my kind Don Miguel goes free Lord Julian gasped After what I ve told you that he has done After his sinking of the Royal Mary After his treatment of me of us Lord Julian protested indignantly I am not in the service of England or of any nation sir And I am not concerned with any wrongs her flag may suffer His lordship recoiled before the furious glance that blazed at him out of Blood s haggard face But the passion faded as swiftly as it had arisen It was in a level voice that the Captain added If you ll escort Miss Bishop aboard my ship I shall be obliged to you I beg that you ll make haste We are about to scuttle this hulk He turned slowly to depart But again Lord Julian interposed Containing his indignant amazement his lordship delivered himself coldly Captain Blood you disappoint me I had hopes of great things for you Go to the devil said Captain Blood turning on his heel and so departed CHAPTER XX THIEF AND PIRATE Captain Blood paced the poop of his ship alone in the tepid dusk and the growing golden radiance of the great poop lantern in which a seaman had just lighted the three lamps About him all was peace The signs of the day s battle had been effaced the decks had been swabbed and order was restored above and below A group of men squatting about the main hatch were drowsily chanting their hardened natures softened perhaps by the calm and beauty of the night They were the men of the larboard watch waiting for eight bells which was imminent 
884-129800-0000	train-other-500	Captain Blood did not hear them he did not hear anything save the echo of those cruel words
none	none	 which had dubbed him thief and pirate Thief and pirate It is an odd fact of human nature that a man may for years possess the knowledge that a certain thing must be of a certain fashion 
884-129800-0001	train-other-500	and yet be shocked to discover through his own senses that the fact is in perfect harmony with his beliefs When first three years ago at Tortuga
none	none	 he had been urged upon the adventurer s course which he had followed ever since he had known in what opinion 
884-129800-0002	train-other-500	Arabella Bishop must hold him if he succumbed Only the conviction that already she was for ever lost to him by introducing a certain desperate recklessness into his soul
884-129800-0003	train-other-500	had supplied the final impulse to drive him upon his rover s course That he should ever meet her again had not entered his calculations had found no place in his dreams They were he conceived irrevocably
884-129800-0004	train-other-500	and for ever parted Yet in spite of this in spite even of the persuasion that to her this reflection that was his torment could bring no regrets he had kept the thought of her ever before him in all those wild years of filibustering
884-129800-0005	train-other-500	He had used it as a curb
none	none	 not only upon himself 
884-129800-0006	train-other-500	but also upon those who followed him
none	none	 Never had buccaneers been so rigidly held in hand 
884-129800-0007	train-other-500	never had they been so firmly restrained
none	none	 never so debarred from the excesses of rapine and lust that were usual in their kind as those who sailed with Captain Blood It was you will remember 
884-129800-0008	train-other-500	stipulated in their articles
none	none	 that in these as in other matters 
884-129800-0009	train-other-500	they must submit to the commands of their leader And because of the singular good fortune which had attended his leadership he had been able to impose that stern condition of a discipline unknown before among buccaneers
884-129800-0010	train-other-500	How would not these men laugh at him now if he were to tell them that this he had done out of respect for a slip of a girl of whom he had fallen romantically enamoured
none	none	 How would not that laughter swell if he added that this girl had that day informed him that she did not number thieves and pirates among her acquaintance Thief and pirate 
884-129800-0011	train-other-500	How the words clung how they stung and burnt his brain It did not occur to him being no psychologist nor learned in the tortuous workings of the feminine mind
none	none	 that the fact that she should bestow upon him those epithets in the very moment and circumstance of their meeting was in itself curious He did not perceive the problem thus presented 
884-129800-0012	train-other-500	therefore he could not probe it Else he might have concluded that if in a moment
none	none	 in which by delivering her from captivity he deserved her gratitude yet she expressed herself in bitterness it must be because that bitterness was anterior to the gratitude and deep seated She had been moved to it 
884-129800-0013	train-other-500	by hearing of the course he had taken Why
none	none	 It was what he did not ask himself or some ray of light might have come to brighten his dark his utterly evil despondency Surely she would never have been so moved had she not cared 
884-129800-0014	train-other-500	had she not felt that in what he did there was a personal wrong to herself Surely he might have reasoned nothing short of this could have moved her to such a degree of bitterness and scorn as that which she had displayed
884-129800-0015	train-other-500	That is how you will reason Not so however reasoned Captain Blood Indeed that night he reasoned not at all His soul was given up to conflict between the almost sacred love he had borne her
none	none	 in all these years and the evil passion which she had now awakened in him Extremes touch 
884-129800-0016	train-other-500	and in touching may for a space become confused indistinguishable
none	none	 And the extremes of love and hate were to night so confused in the soul of Captain Blood 
884-129800-0017	train-other-500	that in their fusion they made up a monstrous passion Thief and pirate That was what she deemed him without qualification oblivious of the deep wrongs he had suffered
884-129800-0018	train-other-500	the desperate case in which he found himself after his escape from Barbados and all the rest that had gone to make him what he was That he should have conducted his filibustering with hands as clean as were possible to a man engaged in such undertakings
none	none	 had also not occurred to her 
884-129800-0019	train-other-500	as a charitable thought with which to mitigate her judgment of a man she had once esteemed She had no charity for him no mercy
none	none	 She had summed him up 
884-129800-0020	train-other-500	convicted him and sentenced him in that one phrase He was thief and pirate in her eyes nothing more nothing less What then was she What are those who have no charity he asked the stars Well
none	none	 as she had shaped him hitherto so let her shape him now 
884-129800-0021	train-other-500	Thief and pirate she had branded him She should be justified
none	none	 Thief and pirate should he prove 
884-129800-0022	train-other-500	henceforth no more nor less as bowelless as remorseless as all those others who had deserved those names He would cast out the maudlin ideals
884-129800-0023	train-other-500	by which he had sought to steer a course put an end to this idiotic struggle to make the best of two worlds She had shown him clearly to which world he belonged Let him now justify her She was aboard his ship
884-129800-0024	train-other-500	in his power and he desired her He laughed softly
none	none	 jeeringly as he leaned on the taffrail 
884-129800-0025	train-other-500	looking down at the phosphorescent gleam in the ship s wake and his own laughter startled him by its evil note He checked suddenly and shivered
none	none	 A sob broke from him to end that ribald burst of mirth 
884-129800-0026	train-other-500	He took his face in his hands and found a chill moisture on his brow Meanwhile Lord Julian
none	none	 who knew the feminine part of humanity rather better than Captain Blood was engaged in solving the curious problem that had so completely escaped the buccaneer He was spurred to it I suspect by certain vague stirrings of jealousy Miss Bishop s conduct in the perils through which they had come had brought him at last to perceive that a woman may lack the simpering graces of cultured femininity and yet because of that lack be the more admirable He wondered what precisely might have been her earlier relations with Captain Blood and was conscious of a certain uneasiness which urged him now to probe the matter His lordship s pale dreamy eyes had as I have said a habit of observing things and his wits were tolerably acute He was blaming himself now for not having observed certain things before or at least for not having studied them more closely and he was busily connecting them with more recent observations made that very day 
884-129800-0027	train-other-500	He had observed for instance that Blood s ship was named the Arabella and he knew that Arabella was Miss Bishop s name And he had observed all the odd
none	none	 particulars 
884-129800-0028	train-other-500	of the meeting of Captain Blood and Miss Bishop and the curious change that meeting had wrought in each
none	none	 The lady had been monstrously uncivil to the Captain It was a very foolish attitude for a lady in her circumstances to adopt towards a man in Blood s and his lordship could not imagine Miss Bishop as normally foolish 
884-129800-0029	train-other-500	Yet in spite of her rudeness in spite of the fact that she was the niece of a man whom Blood must regard as his enemy Miss Bishop and his lordship had been shown the utmost consideration aboard the Captain s ship
884-129800-0030	train-other-500	A cabin had been placed at the disposal of each to which their scanty remaining belongings and Miss Bishop s woman had been duly transferred They were given the freedom of the great cabin and they had sat down to table with Pitt the master and Wolverstone
884-129800-0031	train-other-500	who was Blood s lieutenant both of whom had shown them the utmost courtesy Also there was the fact that Blood himself had kept almost studiously from intruding upon them
884-129800-0032	train-other-500	His lordship s mind went swiftly but carefully down these avenues of thought observing and connecting Having exhausted them he decided to seek additional information from Miss Bishop For this he must wait until Pitt and Wolverstone should have withdrawn
none	none	 He was hardly made to wait so long for as Pitt rose from table to follow Wolverstone 
884-129800-0033	train-other-500	who had already departed Miss Bishop detained him with a question mister Pitt she asked were you not one of those who escaped from Barbados with Captain Blood I was I too was one of your uncle s slaves
none	none	 And you have been with Captain Blood ever since 
884-129800-0034	train-other-500	His shipmaster always ma am She nodded She was very calm and self contained but his lordship observed that she was unusually pale though considering what she had that day undergone this afforded no matter for wonder
884-129800-0035	train-other-500	Did you ever sail with a Frenchman named Cahusac Cahusac Pitt laughed The name evoked a ridiculous memory Aye
none	none	 He was with us at Maracaybo And another Frenchman named Levasseur 
884-129800-0036	train-other-500	His lordship marvelled at her memory of these names Aye Cahusac was Levasseur s lieutenant until he died Until who died Levasseur
884-129800-0037	train-other-500	He was killed on one of the Virgin Islands two years ago There was a pause Then
none	none	 in an even quieter voice than before 
884-129800-0038	train-other-500	Miss Bishop asked Who killed him Pitt answered readily
none	none	 There was no reason why he should not 
884-129800-0039	train-other-500	though he began to find the catechism intriguing Captain Blood killed him Why Pitt hesitated
none	none	 It was not a tale for a maid s ears 
884-129800-0040	train-other-500	They quarrelled he said shortly Was it about a a lady Miss Bishop relentlessly pursued him You might put it that way What was the lady s name
884-129800-0041	train-other-500	Pitt s eyebrows went up still he answered
none	none	 Miss d Ogeron She was the daughter of the Governor of Tortuga She had gone off with this fellow Levasseur 
884-129800-0042	train-other-500	and and Peter delivered her out of his dirty clutches He was a black hearted scoundrel and deserved what Peter gave him I see And and yet Captain Blood has not married her
none	none	 Not yet laughed Pitt who knew the utter groundlessness of the common gossip in Tortuga which pronounced Mdlle d Ogeron the Captain s future wife 
884-129800-0043	train-other-500	Miss Bishop nodded in silence and Jeremy Pitt turned to depart relieved that the catechism was ended He paused in the doorway to impart a piece of information Maybe it ll comfort you to know that the Captain has altered our course for your benefit
884-129800-0044	train-other-500	It s his intention to put you both ashore on the coast of Jamaica as near Port Royal as we dare venture We ve gone about and if this wind holds ye ll soon be home again mistress Vastly obliging of him
none	none	 drawled his lordship seeing that Miss Bishop made no shift to answer Sombre eyed she sat staring into vacancy 
884-129800-0045	train-other-500	Indeed ye may say so Pitt agreed
none	none	 He s taking risks that few would take in his place 
884-129800-0046	train-other-500	But that s always been his way He went out leaving his lordship pensive those dreamy blue eyes of his intently studying Miss Bishop s face for all their dreaminess his mind increasingly uneasy
none	none	 At length Miss Bishop looked at him and spoke Your Cahusac told you no more than the truth it seems 
884-129800-0047	train-other-500	I perceived that you were testing it said his lordship I am wondering precisely why Receiving no answer he continued to observe her silently his long tapering fingers toying with a ringlet of the golden periwig in which his long face was set
884-129800-0048	train-other-500	Miss Bishop sat bemused her brows knit her brooding glance seeming to study the fine Spanish point that edged the tablecloth At last his lordship broke the silence He amazes me this man said
none	none	 he in his slow languid voice that never seemed to change its level 
884-129800-0049	train-other-500	That he should alter his course for us is in itself matter for wonder but that he should take a risk on our behalf that he should venture into Jamaica waters It amazes me as I have said
884-129800-0050	train-other-500	Miss Bishop raised her eyes and looked at him She appeared to be very thoughtful Then her lip flickered curiously
none	none	 almost scornfully it seemed to him 
884-129800-0051	train-other-500	Her slender fingers drummed the table What is still more amazing is that he does not hold us to ransom
none	none	 said she at last 
884-129800-0052	train-other-500	It s what you deserve Oh and why if you please
none	none	 For speaking to him as you did 
884-129800-0053	train-other-500	I usually call things by their names Do you Stab me I shouldn t boast of it It argues either extreme youth or extreme foolishness His lordship you see belonged to my Lord Sunderland s school of philosophy
884-129800-0054	train-other-500	He added after a moment So does the display of ingratitude A faint colour stirred in her cheeks Your lordship is evidently aggrieved with me I am disconsolate I hope your lordship s grievance is sounder than your views of life
884-129800-0055	train-other-500	It is news to me that ingratitude is a fault only to be found in the young and the foolish I didn t say so ma am There was a tartness in his tone evoked by the tartness she had used If you would do me the honour to listen
884-129800-0056	train-other-500	you would not misapprehend me For if unlike you I do not always say precisely what I think at least I say precisely what I wish to convey To be ungrateful may be human but to display it is childish I
884-129800-0057	train-other-500	I don t think I understand Her brows were knit How have I been ungrateful and to whom To whom To Captain Blood Didn t he come to our rescue Did he Her manner was frigid
884-129800-0058	train-other-500	I wasn t aware that he knew of our presence aboard the Milagrosa His lordship permitted himself the slightest gesture of impatience You are probably aware that he delivered us said he And living as you have done in these savage places of the world
884-129800-0059	train-other-500	you can hardly fail to be aware of what is known even in England that this fellow Blood strictly confines himself to making war upon the Spaniards So that to call him thief and pirate as you did was to overstate the case against him
884-129800-0060	train-other-500	at a time when it would have been more prudent to have understated it Prudence Her voice was scornful What have I to do with prudence Nothing as I perceive But at least study generosity
none	none	 I tell you frankly ma am that in Blood s place I should never have been so nice 
884-129800-0061	train-other-500	Sink me When you consider what he has suffered at the hands of his fellow countrymen you may marvel with me that he should trouble to discriminate between Spanish and English
none	none	 To be sold into slavery Ugh His lordship shuddered 
884-129800-0062	train-other-500	And to a damned colonial planter
none	none	 He checked abruptly I beg your pardon Miss Bishop For the moment You were carried away by your heat in defence of this sea robber 
884-129800-0063	train-other-500	Miss Bishop s scorn was almost fierce His lordship stared at her again Then he half closed his large pale eyes and tilted his head a little I wonder why you hate him so he said softly
884-129800-0064	train-other-500	He saw the sudden scarlet flame upon her cheeks the heavy frown that descended upon her brow
none	none	 He had made her very angry he judged 
884-129800-0065	train-other-500	But there was no explosion She recovered Hate him Lord What a thought I don t regard the fellow at all Then ye should ma am His lordship spoke his thought frankly
none	none	 He s worth regarding He d be an acquisition to the King s navy a man that can do the things he did this morning 
884-129800-0066	train-other-500	His service under de Ruyter wasn t wasted on him That was a great seaman and blister me
none	none	 the pupil s worthy the master if I am a judge of anything 
884-129800-0067	train-other-500	I doubt if the Royal Navy can show his equal To thrust himself deliberately between those two at point blank range and so turn the tables on them
none	none	 It asks courage resource and invention And we land lubbers were not the only ones he tricked by his manoeuvre That Spanish Admiral never guessed the intent until it was too late 
884-129800-0068	train-other-500	and Blood held him in check A great man Miss Bishop
none	none	 A man worth regarding Miss Bishop was moved to sarcasm You should use your influence with my Lord Sunderland to have the King offer him a commission 
884-129800-0069	train-other-500	His lordship laughed softly Faith
none	none	 it s done already I have his commission in my pocket And he increased her amazement by a brief exposition of the circumstances 
884-129800-0070	train-other-500	In that amazement he left her and went in quest of Blood But he was still intrigued
none	none	 If she were a little less uncompromising in her attitude towards Blood 
884-129800-0071	train-other-500	his lordship would have been happier He found the Captain pacing the quarter deck a man mentally exhausted from wrestling with the Devil although of this particular occupation his lordship could have no possible suspicion
none	none	 With the amiable familiarity he used Lord Julian slipped an arm through one of the Captain s and fell into step beside him What s this snapped Blood whose mood was fierce and raw 
884-129800-0072	train-other-500	His lordship was not disturbed I desire sir that we be friends
none	none	 said he suavely 
884-129800-0073	train-other-500	That s mighty condescending of you
none	none	 Lord Julian ignored the obvious sarcasm It s an odd coincidence that we should have been brought together in this fashion considering that I came out to the Indies 
884-129800-0074	train-other-500	especially to seek you Ye re not by any means the first to do that the other scoffed
none	none	 But they ve mainly been Spaniards and they hadn t your luck You misapprehend me completely 
884-129800-0075	train-other-500	said Lord Julian And on that he proceeded to explain himself and his mission
none	none	 When he had done Captain Blood who until that moment had stood still under the spell of his astonishment 
884-129800-0076	train-other-500	disengaged his arm from his lordship s and stood squarely before him Ye re my guest aboard this ship said he
none	none	 and I still have some notion of decent behaviour left me from other days thief and pirate though I may be So I ll not be telling you what I think of you for daring to bring me this offer 
884-129800-0077	train-other-500	or of my Lord Sunderland since he s your kinsman for having the impudence to send it
none	none	 But it does not surprise me at all that one who is a minister of James Stuart s should conceive that every man is to be seduced by bribes into betraying those who trust him 
884-129800-0078	train-other-500	He flung out an arm in the direction of the waist whence came the half melancholy chant of the lounging buccaneers Again you misapprehend me
none	none	 cried Lord Julian between concern and indignation 
884-129800-0079	train-other-500	That is not intended Your followers will be included in your commission
none	none	 And d ye think they ll go with me to hunt their brethren the Brethren of the Coast 
884-129800-0080	train-other-500	On my soul Lord Julian it is yourself does the misapprehending Are there not even notions of honour left in England
none	none	 Oh and there s more to it than that even D ye think I could take a commission of King James s 
884-129800-0081	train-other-500	I tell you I wouldn t be soiling my hands with it thief and pirate s hands though they
none	none	 be Thief and pirate is what you heard Miss Bishop call me to day a 
884-129800-0082	train-other-500	thing of scorn an outcast And who made me that Who made me thief and pirate If you were a rebel his lordship was beginning Ye must know that I was no such thing no rebel at all It wasn t even pretended
884-129800-0083	train-other-500	If it were I could forgive them But not even that cloak could they cast upon their foulness Oh no there was no mistake I was convicted for what I did neither more nor less That bloody vampire Jeffreys bad cess to him sentenced me to death
none	none	 and his worthy master James Stuart afterwards sent me into slavery because I had performed an act of mercy 
884-129800-0084	train-other-500	because compassionately and without thought for creed or politics I had sought to relieve the sufferings of a fellow creature because I had dressed the wounds of a man who was convicted of treason That was all my offence You ll find it in the records
884-129800-0085	train-other-500	And for that I was sold into slavery because by the law of England as administered by James Stuart in violation of the laws of God who harbours or comforts a rebel is himself adjudged guilty of rebellion
884-129800-0086	train-other-500	D ye dream man what it is to be a slave He checked suddenly at the very height of his passion
none	none	 A moment he paused then cast it from him as if it had been a cloak His voice sank again He uttered a little laugh of weariness and contempt 
884-129800-0087	train-other-500	But there I grow hot for nothing at all I explain myself I think and God knows it is not my custom I am grateful to you Lord Julian for your kindly intentions I am so But ye ll understand perhaps
884-129800-0088	train-other-500	Ye look as if ye might Lord Julian stood still
none	none	 He was deeply stricken by the other s words the passionate eloquent outburst that in a few sharp clear cut strokes 
884-129800-0089	train-other-500	had so convincingly presented the man s bitter case against humanity his complete apologia and justification for all that could be laid to his charge His lordship looked at that keen intrepid face gleaming lividly in the light of the great poop lantern
884-129800-0090	train-other-500	and his own eyes were troubled He was abashed He fetched a heavy sigh A
none	none	 pity he said slowly Oh blister me a cursed pity He held out his hand moved to it on a sudden generous impulse But no offence between us Captain Blood 
884-129800-0091	train-other-500	Oh no offence But
none	none	 I m a thief and a pirate 
884-129800-0092	train-other-500	He laughed without mirth and disregarding the proffered hand swung on his heel Lord Julian stood a moment watching the tall figure as it moved away towards the taffrail Then
884-129800-0093	train-other-500	letting his arms fall helplessly to his sides in dejection he departed Just within the doorway of the alley leading to the cabin he ran into Miss Bishop Yet
none	none	 she had not been coming out for her back was towards him and she was moving in the same direction He followed her his mind too full of Captain Blood to be concerned just then with her movements 
884-129800-0094	train-other-500	In the cabin he flung into a chair and exploded with a violence altogether foreign to his nature
none	none	 Damme if ever I met a man I liked better 
884-129800-0095	train-other-500	or even a man I liked as well Yet there s nothing to be done with him So I heard she admitted in a small voice She was very white and she kept her eyes upon her folded hands
none	none	 He looked up in surprise and then sat conning her with brooding glance I wonder now he said presently 
884-129800-0096	train-other-500	if the mischief is of your working Your words have rankled with him He threw them at me again and again He wouldn t take the King s commission
none	none	 he wouldn t take my hand even What s to be done with a fellow like that 
884-129800-0097	train-other-500	He ll end on a yardarm for all his luck And the quixotic fool is running into danger at the present moment on our behalf How she asked him with a sudden startled interest How
none	none	 Have you forgotten that he s sailing to Jamaica 
884-129800-0098	train-other-500	and that Jamaica is the headquarters of the English fleet True your uncle commands it She leaned across the table to interrupt him and he observed that her breathing had grown labored
none	none	 that her eyes were dilating in alarm But there is no hope for him in that she cried Oh don t imagine it He has no bitterer enemy in the world 
884-129800-0099	train-other-500	My uncle is a hard unforgiving man
none	none	 I believe that it was nothing but the hope of taking and hanging Captain Blood 
884-129800-0100	train-other-500	that made my uncle leave his Barbados plantations to accept the deputy governorship of Jamaica Captain Blood doesn t know that of course She paused with a little gesture of helplessness
none	none	 I can t think that it would make the least difference if he did 
884-129800-0101	train-other-500	said his lordship gravely A man who can forgive such an enemy as Don Miguel
none	none	 and take up this uncompromising attitude with me 
884-129800-0102	train-other-500	isn t to be judged by ordinary rules He s chivalrous to the point of idiocy And yet he has been what he has been
none	none	 and done what he has done in these last three years said she but she said it sorrowfully now 
884-129800-0103	train-other-500	without any of her earlier scorn
none	none	 Lord Julian was sententious as I gather that he often was Life can be infernally complex he sighed CHAPTER XXI THE SERVICE OF KING JAMES Miss Arabella Bishop was aroused very early on the following morning by the brazen voice of a bugle and the insistent clanging of a bell in the ship s belfry As she lay awake idly watching the rippled green water that appeared to be streaming past the heavily glazed porthole she became gradually aware of the sounds of swift laboured bustle the clatter of many feet the shouts of hoarse voices and the persistent trundlings of heavy bodies in the ward room immediately below the deck of the cabin Conceiving these sounds to portend a more than normal activity she sat up pervaded by a vague alarm and roused her still slumbering woman In his cabin on the starboard side Lord Julian disturbed by the same sounds was already astir and hurriedly dressing When presently he emerged under the break of the poop he found himself staring up into a mountain of canvas Every foot of sail that she could carry had been crowded to the Arabella s yards to catch the morning breeze Ahead and on either side stretched the limitless expanse of ocean sparkling golden in the sun as yet no more than a half disc of flame upon the horizon straight ahead About him in the waist where all last night had been so peaceful there was a frenziedly active bustle of some threescore men By the rail immediately above and behind Lord Julian stood Captain Blood in altercation with a one eyed giant whose head was swathed in a red cotton kerchief whose blue shirt hung open at the waist As his lordship moving forward revealed himself their voices ceased and Blood turned to greet him Good morning to you he said and added I ve blundered badly so I have I should have known better than to come so close to Jamaica by night But I was in haste to land you Come up here I have something to show you Wondering Lord Julian mounted the companion as he was bidden Standing beside Captain Blood he looked astern following the indication of the Captain s hand and cried out in his amazement There not more than three miles away was land an uneven wall of vivid green that filled the western horizon And a couple of miles this side of it bearing after them came speeding three great white ships They fly no colours but they re part of the Jamaica fleet Blood spoke without excitement almost with a certain listlessness When dawn broke we found ourselves running to meet them We went about and it s been a race ever since But the Arabella s been at sea these four months and her bottom s too foul for the speed we re needing Wolverstone hooked his thumbs into his broad leather belt and from his great height looked down sardonically upon Lord Julian tall man though his lordship was So that you re like to be in yet another sea fight afore ye ve done wi ships my lord That s a point we were just arguing said Blood For I hold that we re in no case to fight against such odds The odds be damned Wolverstone thrust out his heavy jowl We re used to odds The odds was heavier at Maracaybo yet we won out and took three ships They was heavier yesterday when we engaged Don Miguel Aye but those were Spaniards And what better are these Are ye afeard of a lubberly Barbados planter Whatever ails you Peter I ve never known ye scared afore A gun boomed out behind them That ll be the signal to lie to said Blood in the same listless voice and he fetched a sigh Wolverstone squared himself defiantly before his captain I ll see Colonel Bishop in hell or ever I lies to for him And he spat presumably for purposes of emphasis His lordship intervened Oh but by your leave surely there is nothing to be apprehended from Colonel Bishop Considering the service you have rendered to his niece and to me Wolverstone s horse laugh interrupted him Hark to the gentleman he mocked Ye don t know Colonel Bishop that s clear Not for his niece not for his daughter not for his own mother would he forgo the blood what he thinks due to him A drinker of blood he is A nasty beast We knows the Cap n and me We been his slaves But there is myself said Lord Julian with great dignity Wolverstone laughed again whereat his lordship flushed He was moved to raise his voice above its usual languid level I assure you that my word counts for something in England Oh aye in England But this ain t England damme Came the roar of a second gun and a round shot splashed the water less than half a cable s length astern Blood leaned over the rail to speak to the fair young man immediately below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff Bid them take in sail Jeremy he said quietly We lie to But Wolverstone interposed again Hold there a moment Jeremy he roared Wait He swung back to face the Captain who had placed a hand on is shoulder and was smiling a trifle wistfully Steady Old Wolf Steady Captain Blood admonished him Steady yourself Peter Ye ve gone mad Will ye doom us all to hell out of tenderness for that cold slip of a girl Stop cried Blood in sudden fury But Wolverstone would not stop It s the truth you fool It s that cursed petticoat s making a coward of you It s for her that ye re afeard and she Colonel Bishop s niece My God man ye ll have a mutiny aboard and I ll lead it myself sooner than surrender to be hanged in Port Royal Their glances met sullen defiance braving dull anger surprise and pain There is no question said Blood of surrender for any man aboard save only myself If Bishop can report to England that I am taken and hanged he will magnify himself and at the same time gratify his personal rancour against me That should satisfy him I ll send him a message offering to surrender aboard his ship taking Miss Bishop and Lord Julian with me but only on condition that the Arabella is allowed to proceed unharmed It s a bargain that he ll accept if I know him at all It s a bargain he ll never be offered retorted Wolverstone and his earlier vehemence was as nothing to his vehemence now Ye re surely daft even to think of it Peter Not so daft as you when you talk of fighting that He flung out an arm as he spoke to indicate the pursuing ships which were slowly but surely creeping nearer Before we ve run another half mile we shall be within range Wolverstone swore elaborately then suddenly checked Out of the tail of his single eye he had espied a trim figure in grey silk that was ascending the companion So engrossed had they been that they had not seen Miss Bishop come from the door of the passage leading to the cabin And there was something else that those three men on the poop and Pitt immediately below them had failed to observe Some moments ago Ogle followed by the main body of his gun deck crew had emerged from the booby hatch to fall into muttered angrily vehement talk with those who abandoning the gun tackles upon which they were labouring had come to crowd about him Even now Blood had no eyes for that He turned to look at Miss Bishop marvelling a little after the manner in which yesterday she had avoided him that she should now venture upon the quarter deck Her presence at this moment and considering the nature of his altercation with Wolverstone was embarrassing Very sweet and dainty she stood before him in her gown of shimmering grey a faint excitement tinting her fair cheeks and sparkling in her clear hazel eyes that looked so frank and honest She wore no hat and the ringlets of her gold brown hair fluttered distractingly in the morning breeze Captain Blood bared his head and bowed silently in a greeting which she returned composedly and formally What is happening Lord Julian she enquired As if to answer her a third gun spoke from the ships towards which she was looking intent and wonderingly A frown rumpled her brow She looked from one to the other of the men who stood there so glum and obviously ill at ease They are ships of the Jamaica fleet his lordship answered her It should in any case have been a sufficient explanation But before more could be added their attention was drawn at last to Ogle who came bounding up the broad ladder and to the men lounging aft in his wake in all of which instinctively they apprehended a vague menace At the head of the companion Ogle found his progress barred by Blood who confronted him a sudden sternness in his face and in every line of him What s this the Captain demanded sharply Your station is on the gun deck Why have you left it Thus challenged the obvious truculence faded out of Ogle s bearing quenched by the old habit of obedience and the natural dominance that was the secret of the Captain s rule over his wild followers But it gave no pause to the gunner s intention If anything it increased his excitement Captain he said and as he spoke he pointed to the pursuing ships Colonel Bishop holds us We re in no case either to run or fight Blood s height seemed to increase as did his sternness Ogle said he in a voice cold and sharp as steel your station is on the gun deck You ll return to it at once and take your crew with you or else But Ogle violent of mien and gesture interrupted him Threats will not serve Captain Will they not It was the first time in his buccaneering career that an order of his had been disregarded or that a man had failed in the obedience to which he pledged all those who joined him That this insubordination should proceed from one of those whom he most trusted one of his old Barbados associates was in itself a bitterness and made him reluctant to that which instinct told him must be done His hand closed over the butt of one of the pistols slung before him Nor will that serve you Ogle warned him still more fiercely The men are of my thinking and they ll have their way And what way may that be The way to make us safe We ll neither sink nor hang whiles we can help it From the three or four score men massed below in the waist came a rumble of approval Captain Blood s glance raked the ranks of those resolute fierce eyed fellows then it came to rest again on Ogle There was here quite plainly a vague threat a mutinous spirit he could not understand You come to give advice then do you quoth he relenting nothing of his sternness That s it Captain advice That girl there He flung out a bare arm to point to her Bishop s girl the Governor of Jamaica s niece We want her as a hostage for our safety Aye roared in chorus the buccaneers below and one or two of them elaborated that affirmation In a flash Captain Blood saw what was in their minds And for all that he lost nothing of his outward stern composure fear invaded his heart And how he asked do you imagine that Miss Bishop will prove such a hostage It s a providence having her aboard a providence Heave to Captain and signal them to send a boat and assure themselves that Miss is here Then let them know that if they attempt to hinder our sailing hence we ll hang the doxy first and fight for it after That ll cool Colonel Bishop s heat maybe And maybe it won t Slow and mocking came Wolverstone s voice to answer the other s confident excitement and as he spoke he advanced to Blood s side an unexpected ally Some o them dawcocks may believe that tale He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards the men in the waist whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle Although even some o they should know better for there s still a few was on Barbados with us and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop If ye re counting on pulling Bishop s heartstrings ye re a bigger fool Ogle than I ve always thought you was with anything but guns There s no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk Though we had a cargo of Bishop s nieces it wouldn t make him hold his hand Why as I was just telling his lordship here who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what s due to him And if ye weren t a fool Ogle you wouldn t need me to tell you this We ve got to fight my lads How can we fight man Ogle stormed at him furiously battling the conviction which Wolverstone s argument was imposing upon his listeners You may be right and you may be wrong We ve got to chance it It s our only chance The rest of his words were drowned in the shouts of the hands insisting that the girl be given up to be held as a hostage And then louder than before roared a gun away to leeward and away on their starboard beam they saw the spray flung up by the shot which had gone wide They are within range cried Ogle And leaning from the rail Put down the helm he commanded Pitt at his post beside the helmsman turned intrepidly to face the excited gunner Since when have you commanded on the main deck Ogle I take my orders from the Captain You ll take this order from me or by God you ll Wait Blood bade him interrupting and he set a restraining hand upon the gunner s arm There is I think a better way He looked over his shoulder aft at the advancing ships the foremost of which was now a bare quarter of a mile away His glance swept in passing over Miss Bishop and Lord Julian standing side by side some paces behind him He observed her pale and tense with parted lips and startled eyes that were fixed upon him an anxious witness of this deciding of her fate He was thinking swiftly reckoning the chances if by pistolling Ogle he were to provoke a mutiny That some of the men would rally to him he was sure But he was no less sure that the main body would oppose him and prevail in spite of all that he could do taking the chance that holding Miss Bishop to ransom seemed to afford them And if they did that one way or the other Miss Bishop would be lost For even if Bishop yielded to their demand they would retain her as a hostage Meanwhile Ogle was growing impatient His arm still gripped by Blood he thrust his face into the Captain s What better way he demanded There is none better I ll not be bubbled by what Wolverstone has said He may be right and he may be wrong We ll test it It s our only chance I ve said and we must take it The better way that was in Captain Blood s mind was the way that already he had proposed to Wolverstone Whether the men in the panic Ogle had aroused among them would take a different view from Wolverstone s he did not know But he saw quite clearly now that if they consented they would not on that account depart from their intention in the matter of Miss Bishop they would make of Blood s own surrender merely an additional card in this game against the Governor of Jamaica It s through her that we re in this trap Ogle stormed on Through her and through you It was to bring her to Jamaica that you risked all our lives and we re not going to lose our lives as long as there s a chance to make ourselves safe through her He was turning again to the helmsman below when Blood s grip tightened on his arm Ogle wrenched it free with an oath But Blood s mind was now made up He had found the only way and repellent though it might be to him he must take it That is a desperate chance he cried Mine is the safe and easy way Wait He leaned over the rail Put the helm down he bade Pitt Heave her to and signal to them to send a boat A silence of astonishment fell upon the ship of astonishment and suspicion at this sudden yielding But Pitt although he shared it was prompt to obey His voice rang out giving the necessary orders and after an instant s pause a score of hands sprang to execute them Came the creak of blocks and the rattle of slatting sails as they swung aweather and Captain Blood turned and beckoned Lord Julian forward His lordship after a moment s hesitation advanced in surprise and mistrust a mistrust shared by Miss Bishop who like his lordship and all else aboard though in a different way had been taken aback by Blood s sudden submission to the demand to lie to Standing now at the rail with Lord Julian beside him Captain Blood explained himself Briefly and clearly he announced to all the object of Lord Julian s voyage to the Caribbean and he informed them of the offer which yesterday Lord Julian had made to him That offer I rejected as his lordship will tell you deeming myself affronted by it Those of you who have suffered under the rule of King James will understand me But now in the desperate case in which we find ourselves outsailed and likely to be outfought as Ogle has said I am ready to take the way of Morgan to accept the King s commission and shelter us all behind it It was a thunderbolt that for a moment left them all dazed Then Babel was reenacted The main body of them welcomed the announcement as only men who have been preparing to die can welcome a new lease of life But many could not resolve one way or the other until they were satisfied upon several questions and chiefly upon one which was voiced by Ogle Will Bishop respect the commission when you hold it It was Lord Julian who answered It will go very hard with him if he attempts to flout the King s authority And though he should dare attempt it be sure that his own officers will not dare to do other than oppose him Aye said Ogle that is true But there were some who were still in open and frank revolt against the course Of these was Wolverstone who at once proclaimed his hostility I ll rot in hell or ever I serves the King he bawled in a great rage But Blood quieted him and those who thought as he did No man need follow me into the King s service who is reluctant That is not in the bargain What is in the bargain is that I accept this service with such of you as may choose to follow me Don t think I accept it willingly For myself I am entirely of Wolverstone s opinion I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us And even those of you who do not choose to follow me shall share the immunity of all and shall afterwards be free to depart Those are the terms upon which I sell myself to the King Let Lord Julian the representative of the Secretary of State say whether he agrees to them Prompt eager and clear came his lordship s agreement And that was practically the end of the matter Lord Julian the butt now of good humouredly ribald jests and half derisive acclamations plunged away to his cabin for the commission secretly rejoicing at a turn of events which enabled him so creditably to discharge the business on which he had been sent Meanwhile the bo sun signalled to the Jamaica ships to send a boat and the men in the waist broke their ranks and went noisily flocking to line the bulwarks and view the great stately vessels that were racing down towards them As Ogle left the quarter deck Blood turned and came face to face with Miss Bishop She had been observing him with shining eyes but at sight of his dejected countenance and the deep frown that scarred his brow her own expression changed She approached him with a hesitation entirely unusual to her She set a hand lightly upon his arm You have chosen wisely sir she commended him however much against your inclinations He looked with gloomy eyes upon her for whom he had made this sacrifice I owed it to you or thought I did he said She did not understand Your resolve delivered me from a horrible danger she admitted And she shivered at the memory of it But I do not understand why you should have hesitated when first it was proposed to you It is an honourable service King James s he sneered England s she corrected him in reproof The country is all sir the sovereign naught King James will pass others will come and pass England remains to be honourably served by her sons whatever rancour they may hold against the man who rules her in their time He showed some surprise Then he smiled a little Shrewd advocacy he approved it You should have spoken to the crew And then the note of irony deepening in his voice Do you suppose now that this honourable service might redeem one who was a pirate and a thief Her glance fell away Her voice faltered a little in replying If he needs redeeming Perhaps perhaps he has been judged too harshly The blue eyes flashed and the firm lips relaxed their grim set Why if ye think that he said considering her an odd hunger in his glance life might have its uses after all and even the service of King James might become tolerable Looking beyond her across the water he observed a boat putting off from one of the great ships which hove to now were rocking gently some three hundred yards away Abruptly his manner changed He was like one recovering taking himself in hand again If you will go below and get your gear and your woman you shall presently be sent aboard one of the ships of the fleet He pointed to the boat as he spoke She left him and thereafter with Wolverstone leaning upon the rail he watched the approach of that boat manned by a dozen sailors and commanded by a scarlet figure seated stiffly in the stern sheets He levelled his telescope upon that figure It ll not be Bishop himself said Wolverstone between question and assertion No Blood closed his telescope I don t know who it is Ha Wolverstone vented an ejaculation of sneering mirth For all his eagerness Bishop d be none so willing to come hisself He s been aboard this hulk afore and we made him swim for it that time He ll have his memories So he sends a deputy This deputy proved to be an officer named Calverley a vigorous self sufficient fellow comparatively fresh from England whose manner made it clear that he came fully instructed by Colonel Bishop upon the matter of how to handle the pirates His air as he stepped into the waist of the Arabella was haughty truculent and disdainful Blood the King s commission now in his pocket and Lord Julian standing beside him waited to receive him and Captain Calverley was a little taken aback at finding himself confronted by two men so very different outwardly from anything that he had expected But he lost none of his haughty poise and scarcely deigned a glance at the swarm of fierce half naked fellows lounging in a semicircle to form a background Good day to you sir Blood hailed him pleasantly I have the honour to give you welcome aboard the Arabella My name is Blood Captain Blood at your service You may have heard of me Captain Calverley stared hard The airy manner of this redoubtable buccaneer was hardly what he had looked for in a desperate fellow compelled to ignominious surrender A thin sour smile broke on the officer s haughty lips You ll ruffle it to the gallows no doubt he said contemptuously I suppose that is after the fashion of your kind Meanwhile it s your surrender I require my man not your impudence Captain Blood appeared surprised pained He turned in appeal to Lord Julian D ye hear that now And did ye ever hear the like But what did I tell ye Ye see the young gentleman s under a misapprehension entirely Perhaps it ll save broken bones if your lordship explains just who and what I am Lord Julian advanced a step and bowed perfunctorily and rather disdainfully to that very disdainful but now dumbfounded officer Pitt who watched the scene from the quarter deck rail tells us that his lordship was as grave as a parson at a hanging But I suspect this gravity for a mask under which Lord Julian was secretly amused I have the honour to inform you sir he said stiffly that Captain Blood holds a commission in the King s service under the seal of my Lord Sunderland His Majesty s Secretary of State Captain Calverley s face empurpled his eyes bulged The buccaneers in the background chuckled and crowed and swore among themselves in their relish of this comedy For a long moment Calverley stared in silence at his lordship observing the costly elegance of his dress his air of calm assurance and his cold fastidious speech all of which savoured distinctly of the great world to which he belonged And who the devil may you be he exploded at last Colder still and more distant than ever grew his lordship s voice You re not very civil sir as I have already noticed My name is Wade Lord Julian Wade I am His Majesty s envoy to these barbarous parts and my Lord Sunderland s near kinsman Colonel Bishop has been notified of my coming The sudden change in Calverley s manner at Lord Julian s mention of his name showed that the notification had been received and that he had knowledge of it I I believe that he has said Calverley between doubt and suspicion That is that he has been notified of the coming of Lord Julian Wade But but aboard this ship The officer made a gesture of helplessness and surrendering to his bewilderment fell abruptly silent I was coming out on the Royal Mary That is what we were advised But the Royal Mary fell a victim to a Spanish privateer and I might never have arrived at all but for the gallantry of Captain Blood who rescued me Light broke upon the darkness of Calverley s mind I see I understand I will take leave to doubt it His lordship s tone abated nothing of its asperity But that can wait If Captain Blood will show you his commission perhaps that will set all doubts at rest and we may proceed I shall be glad to reach Port Royal Captain Blood thrust a parchment under Calverley s bulging eyes The officer scanned it particularly the seals and signature He stepped back a baffled impotent man He bowed helplessly I must return to Colonel Bishop for my orders he informed them At that moment a lane was opened in the ranks of the men and through this came Miss Bishop followed by her octoroon woman Over his shoulder Captain Blood observed her approach Perhaps since Colonel Bishop is with you you will convey his niece to him Miss Bishop was aboard the Royal Mary also and I rescued her together with his lordship She will be able to acquaint her uncle with the details of that and of the present state of affairs Swept thus from surprise to surprise Captain Calverley could do no more than bow again As for me said Lord Julian with intent to make Miss Bishop s departure free from all interference on the part of the buccaneers I shall remain aboard the Arabella until we reach Port Royal My compliments to Colonel Bishop Say that I look forward to making his acquaintance there CHAPTER XXII HOSTILITIES In the great harbour of Port Royal 
1225-129802-0001	train-other-500	spacious enough to have given moorings to all the ships of all the navies of the world the Arabella rode at anchor Almost she had the air of a prisoner for a quarter of a mile ahead to starboard rose the lofty massive
1225-129802-0002	train-other-500	single round tower of the fort whilst a couple of cables length astern and to larboard rode the six men of war that composed the Jamaica squadron Abeam with the Arabella across the harbour
1225-129802-0003	train-other-500	were the flat fronted white buildings of that imposing city that came down to the very water s edge Behind these the red roofs rose like terraces marking the gentle slope upon which the city was built dominated here by a turret
none	none	 there by a spire and behind these again a range of green hills with for ultimate background a sky that was like a dome of polished steel On a cane day bed that had been set for him on the quarter deck sheltered from the dazzling blistering sunshine by an improvised awning of brown sailcloth 
1225-129802-0004	train-other-500	lounged Peter Blood a calf bound well thumbed copy of Horace s Odes neglected in his hands From immediately below him came the swish of mops and the gurgle of water in the scuppers
none	none	 for it was still early morning 
1225-129802-0005	train-other-500	and under the directions of Hayton the bo sun the swabbers were at work in the waist and forecastle Despite the heat and the stagnant air one of the toilers found breath to croak a ribald buccaneering ditty
none	none	 For we laid her board and board And we put her to the sword And we sank her in the deep blue sea 
1225-129802-0006	train-other-500	So It s heigh ho and heave a ho Who ll sail for the Main with me Blood fetched a sigh and the ghost of a smile played over his lean sun tanned face
1225-129802-0007	train-other-500	Then the black brows came together above the vivid blue eyes and thought swiftly closed the door upon his immediate surroundings Things had not sped at all well with him in the past fortnight since his acceptance of the King s commission
1225-129802-0008	train-other-500	There had been trouble with Bishop from the moment of landing As Blood and Lord Julian had stepped ashore together they had been met by a man who took no pains to dissemble his chagrin at the turn of events and his determination to change it
1225-129802-0009	train-other-500	He awaited them on the mole supported by a group of officers You are Lord Julian Wade I understand was his truculent greeting For Blood at the moment he had nothing beyond a malignant glance
none	none	 Lord Julian bowed I take it I have the honour to address Colonel Bishop Deputy Governor of Jamaica It was almost as if his lordship were giving the Colonel a lesson in deportment The Colonel accepted it 
1225-129802-0010	train-other-500	and belatedly bowed removing his broad hat Then he plunged on You have granted I am told the King s commission to this man His very tone betrayed the bitterness of his rancour
1225-129802-0011	train-other-500	Your motives were no doubt worthy your gratitude to him for delivering you from the Spaniards But the thing itself is unthinkable my lord The commission must be cancelled I
1225-129802-0012	train-other-500	don t think I understand said Lord Julian distantly To be sure you don t
none	none	 or you d never ha done it 
1225-129802-0013	train-other-500	The fellow s bubbled you Why he s first a rebel then an escaped slave and lastly a bloody pirate I ve been hunting him this year past
1225-129802-0014	train-other-500	I assure you sir that I was fully informed of all I do not grant the King s commission lightly Don t you by God
none	none	 And what else do you call this But as His Majesty s Deputy Governor of Jamaica I ll take leave to correct your mistake in my own way Ah And what way may that be There s a gallows waiting for this rascal in Port Royal 
1225-129802-0015	train-other-500	Blood would have intervened at that
none	none	 but Lord Julian forestalled him I see sir that you do not yet quite apprehend the circumstances If it is a mistake to grant Captain Blood a commission the mistake is not mine I am acting upon the instructions of my Lord Sunderland 
1225-129802-0016	train-other-500	and with a full knowledge of all the facts his lordship expressly designated Captain Blood for this commission if Captain Blood could be persuaded to accept it Colonel Bishop s mouth fell open in surprise and dismay
1225-129802-0017	train-other-500	Lord Sunderland designated him he asked amazed Expressly His lordship waited a moment for a reply None coming from the speechless Deputy Governor
1225-129802-0018	train-other-500	he asked a question Would you still venture to describe the matter as a mistake sir And dare you take the risk of correcting it I I had not dreamed
1225-129802-0019	train-other-500	I understand sir Let me present Captain Blood Perforce Bishop must put on the best face he could command But that it was no more than a mask for his fury
1225-129802-0020	train-other-500	and his venom was plain to all From that unpromising beginning matters had not improved
none	none	 rather had they grown worse 
1225-129802-0021	train-other-500	Blood s thoughts were upon this and other things as he lounged there on the day bed He had been a fortnight in Port Royal his ship virtually a unit now in the Jamaica squadron And when the news of it reached Tortuga and the buccaneers who awaited his return
none	none	 the name of Captain Blood which had stood so high among the Brethren of the Coast would become a byword a thing of execration and before all was done his life might pay forfeit 
1225-129802-0022	train-other-500	for what would be accounted a treacherous defection And for what had he placed himself in this position For the sake of a girl who avoided him so persistently and intentionally
1225-129802-0023	train-other-500	that he must assume that she still regarded him with aversion He had scarcely been vouchsafed a glimpse of her in all this fortnight although with that in view for his main object he had daily haunted her uncle s residence and daily braved the unmasked hostility
1225-129802-0024	train-other-500	and baffled rancour in which Colonel Bishop held him Nor was that the worst of it He was allowed plainly to perceive that it was the graceful elegant young trifler from saint James s Lord Julian Wade
1225-129802-0025	train-other-500	to whom her every moment was devoted And what chance had he a desperate adventurer with a record of outlawry against such a rival as that a man of parts moreover as he was bound to admit
1225-129802-0026	train-other-500	You conceive the bitterness of his soul He beheld himself to be as the dog in the fable that had dropped the substance to snatch at a delusive shadow
1225-129802-0027	train-other-500	He sought comfort in a line on the open page before him levius fit patientia
none	none	 quicquid corrigere est nefas 
1225-129802-0028	train-other-500	Sought it but hardly found it A boat that had approached unnoticed from the shore came scraping and bumping against the great red hull of the Arabella
1225-129802-0029	train-other-500	and a raucous voice sent up a hailing shout From the ship s belfry two silvery notes rang clear and sharp
none	none	 and a moment or two later the bo sun s whistle shrilled a long wail 
1225-129802-0030	train-other-500	The sounds disturbed Captain Blood from his disgruntled musings He rose tall active and arrestingly elegant in a scarlet gold laced coat that advertised his new position and slipping the slender volume into his pocket
none	none	 advanced to the carved rail of the quarter deck just as Jeremy Pitt was setting foot upon the companion A note for you from the Deputy Governor said the master shortly as he proffered a folded sheet Blood broke the seal and read 
1225-129802-0031	train-other-500	Pitt loosely clad in shirt and breeches leaned against the rail the while and watched him unmistakable concern imprinted on his fair frank countenance
none	none	 Blood uttered a short laugh and curled his lip 
1225-129802-0032	train-other-500	It is a very peremptory summons he said and passed the note to his friend The young master s grey eyes skimmed it Thoughtfully he stroked his golden beard You ll not go
1225-129802-0033	train-other-500	he said between question and assertion Why not Haven t I been a daily visitor at the fort But it ll be about the Old Wolf that he wants to see you It gives him a grievance at last You know Peter
1225-129802-0034	train-other-500	that it is Lord Julian alone has stood between Bishop and his hate of you If now he can show that What if he can Blood interrupted carelessly Shall I be in greater danger ashore than aboard now that we ve but fifty men left
1225-129802-0035	train-other-500	and they lukewarm rogues who would as soon serve the King as me Jeremy dear lad the Arabella s a prisoner here bedad twixt the fort there and the fleet yonder Don t be forgetting that
1225-129802-0036	train-other-500	Jeremy clenched his hands Why did ye let Wolverstone and the others go he cried with a touch of bitterness You should have seen the danger
1225-129802-0037	train-other-500	How could I in honesty have detained them It was in the bargain
none	none	 Besides how could their staying have helped me And as Pitt did not answer him 
1225-129802-0038	train-other-500	Ye see he said and shrugged I ll be getting my hat and cane and sword and go ashore in the cock boat See it manned for me Ye re going to deliver yourself into Bishop s hands Pitt warned him
1225-129802-0039	train-other-500	Well well maybe he ll not find me quite so easy to grasp as he imagines There s a thorn or two left on me And with a laugh Blood departed to his cabin
none	none	 Jeremy Pitt answered the laugh with an oath A moment he stood irresolute where Blood had left him 
1225-129802-0040	train-other-500	Then slowly reluctance dragging at his feet he went down the companion to give the order for the cock boat If anything should happen to you Peter he said
none	none	 as Blood was going over the side 
1225-129802-0041	train-other-500	Colonel Bishop had better look to himself These fifty lads may be lukewarm at present as you say but sink me they ll be anything but lukewarm if there s a breach of faith And what should be happening to me Jeremy
1225-129802-0042	train-other-500	Sure now I ll be back for dinner so I will Blood climbed down into the waiting boat But laugh though he might he knew as well as Pitt that in going ashore that morning he carried his life in his hands
1225-129802-0043	train-other-500	Because of this it may have been that when he stepped on to the narrow mole
none	none	 in the shadow of the shallow outer wall of the fort 
1225-129802-0044	train-other-500	through whose crenels were thrust the black noses of its heavy guns he gave order that the boat should stay for him at that spot He realized that he might have to retreat in a hurry
1225-129802-0045	train-other-500	Walking leisurely he skirted the embattled wall and passed through the great gates into the courtyard Half a dozen soldiers lounged there
none	none	 and in the shadow cast by the wall Major Mallard the Commandant was slowly pacing He stopped short at sight of Captain Blood and saluted him as was his due but the smile that lifted the officer s stiff mostachios was grimly sardonic Peter Blood s attention however was elsewhere On his right stretched a spacious garden beyond which rose the white house that was the residence of the Deputy Governor In that garden s main avenue 
1225-129802-0046	train-other-500	that was fringed with palm and sandalwood he had caught sight of Miss Bishop alone He crossed the courtyard with suddenly lengthened stride Good morning to ye ma am was his greeting as he overtook her and hat in hand now
none	none	 he added on a note of protest 
1225-129802-0047	train-other-500	Sure it s nothing less than uncharitable to make me run in this heat Why do you run then she asked him coolly standing slim and straight before him
1225-129802-0048	train-other-500	all in white and very maidenly save in her unnatural composure I am pressed she informed him So you will forgive me if I do not stay You were none so pressed until I came he protested
1225-129802-0049	train-other-500	and if his thin lips smiled his blue eyes were oddly hard Since you perceive it sir I wonder that you trouble to be so insistent That crossed the swords between them
none	none	 and it was against Blood s instincts to avoid an engagement 
1225-129802-0050	train-other-500	Faith you explain yourself after a fashion said he But since it was more or less in your service that I donned the King s coat you should suffer it to cover the thief and pirate She shrugged and turned aside
1225-129802-0051	train-other-500	in some resentment and some regret Fearing to betray the latter she took refuge in the former I do my best said she So that ye can be charitable in some ways He laughed softly
1225-129802-0052	train-other-500	Glory be now I should be thankful for so much Maybe I m presumptuous But I can t forget that when I was no better than a slave in your uncle s household in Barbados ye used me with a certain kindness Why not
1225-129802-0053	train-other-500	In those days you had some claim upon my kindness You were just an unfortunate gentleman then And what else would you be calling me now Hardly unfortunate We have heard of your good fortune on the seas
1225-129802-0054	train-other-500	how your luck has passed into a byword And we have heard other things of your good fortune in other directions She spoke hastily
none	none	 the thought of Mademoiselle d Ogeron in her mind And instantly would have recalled the words had she been able 
1225-129802-0055	train-other-500	But Peter Blood swept them lightly aside reading into them none of her meaning as she feared he would Aye a deal of lies devil a doubt
none	none	 as I could prove to you I cannot think why you should trouble to put yourself on your defence she discouraged him 
1225-129802-0056	train-other-500	So that ye may think less badly of me than you do What I think of you can be a very little matter to you sir This was a disarming stroke
1225-129802-0057	train-other-500	He abandoned combat for expostulation Can ye say that now Can ye say that beholding me in this livery of a service I despise Didn t ye tell me that I might redeem the past
1225-129802-0058	train-other-500	It s little enough I am concerned to redeem the past save only in your eyes In my own I ve done nothing at all that I am ashamed of considering the provocation I received Her glance faltered and fell away before his own that was so intent
1225-129802-0059	train-other-500	I I can t think why you should speak to me like this she said with less than her earlier assurance
none	none	 Ah 
1225-129802-0060	train-other-500	now can t ye indeed he cried Sure then I ll be telling ye Oh please There was real alarm in her voice I realize fully what you did and I realize that partly at least
1225-129802-0061	train-other-500	you may have been urged by consideration for myself Believe me I am very grateful I shall always be grateful
none	none	 But if it s also your intention always to think of me as a thief and a pirate faith ye may keep your gratitude for all the good it s like to do me A livelier colour crept into her cheeks There was a perceptible heave of the slight breast that faintly swelled the flimsy bodice of white silk But if she resented his tone and his words 
1225-129802-0062	train-other-500	she stifled her resentment She realized that perhaps she had herself provoked his anger She honestly desired to make amends You are mistaken she began
none	none	 It isn t that But they were fated to misunderstand each other 
1225-129802-0063	train-other-500	Jealousy that troubler of reason had been over busy with his wits as it had with hers What is it then quoth he and added the question Lord Julian She started
1225-129802-0064	train-other-500	and stared at him blankly indignant now Och be frank with me he urged her unpardonably Twill be a kindness so it will For a moment she stood before him with quickened breathing
none	none	 the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks 
1225-129802-0065	train-other-500	Then she looked past him and tilted her chin forward You you are quite insufferable she said I beg that you will let me pass He stepped aside
1225-129802-0066	train-other-500	and with the broad feathered hat which he still held in his hand he waved her on towards the house I ll not be detaining you any longer ma am After all the cursed thing I did for nothing can be undone
1225-129802-0067	train-other-500	Ye ll remember afterwards that it was your hardness drove me She moved to depart then checked and faced him again It was she now who was on her defence her voice quivering with indignation
1225-129802-0068	train-other-500	You take that tone You dare to take that tone she cried astounding him by her sudden vehemence You have the effrontery to upbraid me because I will not take your hands
1225-129802-0069	train-other-500	when I know how they are stained when I know you for a murderer and worse He stared at her open mouthed A murderer I he said at last Must I name your victims
1225-129802-0070	train-other-500	Did you not murder Levasseur Levasseur He smiled a little So they ve told you about that Do you deny it I killed him it is true
1225-129802-0071	train-other-500	I can remember killing another man in circumstances that were very similar That was in Bridgetown on the night of the Spanish raid Mary Traill would tell you of it She was present
none	none	 He clapped his hat on his head with a certain abrupt fierceness and strode angrily away before she could answer or even grasp the full significance of what he had said CHAPTER XXIII HOSTAGES Peter Blood stood in the pillared portico of Government House and with unseeing eyes that were laden with pain and anger stared out across the great harbour of Port Royal to the green hills rising from the farther shore and the ridge of the Blue Mountains beyond showing hazily through the quivering heat He was aroused by the return of the negro who had gone to announce him and following now this slave he made his way through the house to the wide piazza behind it in whose shade Colonel Bishop and my Lord Julian Wade took what little air there was So ye ve come the Deputy Governor hailed him and followed the greeting by a series of grunts of vague but apparently ill humoured import He did not trouble to rise not even when Lord Julian obeying the instincts of finer breeding set him the example From under scowling brows the wealthy Barbados planter considered his sometime slave who hat in hand leaning lightly upon his long beribboned cane revealed nothing in his countenance of the anger which was being steadily nourished by this cavalier reception At last with scowling brow and in self sufficient tones Colonel Bishop delivered himself I have sent for you Captain Blood because of certain news that has just reached me I am informed that yesterday evening a frigate left the harbour having on board your associate Wolverstone and a hundred men of the hundred and fifty that were serving under you His lordship and I shall be glad to have your explanation of how you came to permit that departure Permit quoth Blood I ordered it The answer left Bishop speechless for a moment Then You ordered it he said in accents of unbelief whilst Lord Julian raised his eyebrows Swounds Perhaps you ll explain yourself Whither has Wolverstone gone To Tortuga He s gone with a message to the officers commanding the other four ships of the fleet that is awaiting me there telling them what s happened and why they are no longer to expect me Bishop s great face seemed to swell and its high colour to deepen He swung to Lord Julian You hear that my lord Deliberately he has let Wolverstone loose upon the seas again Wolverstone the worst of all that gang of pirates after himself I hope your lordship begins at last to perceive the folly of granting the King s commission to such a man as this against all my counsels Why this thing is it s just mutiny treason By God It s matter for a court martial Will you cease your blather of mutiny and treason and courts martial Blood put on his hat and sat down unbidden I have sent Wolverstone to inform Hagthorpe and Christian and Yberville and the rest of my lads that they ve one clear month in which to follow my example quit piracy and get back to their boucans or their logwood or else sail out of the Caribbean Sea That s what I ve done But the men his lordship interposed in his level cultured voice This hundred men that Wolverstone has taken with him They are those of my crew who have no taste for King James s service and have preferred to seek work of other kinds It was in our compact my lord that there should be no constraining of my men I don t remember it said his lordship with sincerity Blood looked at him in surprise Then he shrugged Faith I m not to blame for your lordship s poor memory I say that it was so and I don t lie I ve never found it necessary In any case ye couldn t have supposed that I should consent to anything different And then the Deputy Governor exploded You have given those damned rascals in Tortuga this warning so that they may escape That is what you have done That is how you abuse the commission that has saved your own neck Peter Blood considered him steadily his face impassive I will remind you he said at last very quietly that the object in view was leaving out of account your own appetites which as every one knows are just those of a hangman to rid the Caribbean of buccaneers Now I ve taken the most effective way of accomplishing that object The knowledge that I ve entered the King s service should in itself go far towards disbanding the fleet of which I was until lately the admiral I see sneered the Deputy Governor malevolently And if it does not It will be time enough then to consider what else is to be done Lord Julian forestalled a fresh outburst on the part of Bishop It is possible he said that my Lord Sunderland will be satisfied provided that the solution is such as you promise It was a courteous conciliatory speech Urged by friendliness towards Blood and understanding of the difficult position in which the buccaneer found himself his lordship was disposed to take his stand upon the letter of his instructions Therefore he now held out a friendly hand to help him over the latest and most difficult obstacle which Blood himself had enabled Bishop to place in the way of his redemption Unfortunately the last person from whom Peter Blood desired assistance at that moment was this young nobleman whom he regarded with the jaundiced eyes of jealousy Anyway he answered with a suggestion of defiance and more than a suggestion of a sneer it s the most ye should expect from me and certainly it s the most ye ll get His lordship frowned and dabbed his lips with a handkerchief I don t think that I quite like the way you put it Indeed upon reflection Captain Blood I am sure that I do not I am sorry for that so I am said Blood impudently But there it is I m not on that account concerned to modify it His lordship s pale eyes opened a little wider Languidly he raised his eyebrows Ah he said You re a prodigiously uncivil fellow You disappoint me sir I had formed the notion that you might be a gentleman And that s not your lordship s only mistake Bishop cut in You made a worse when you gave him the King s commission and so sheltered the rascal from the gallows I had prepared for him in Port Royal Aye but the worst mistake of all in this matter of commissions said Blood to his lordship was the one that trade this greasy slaver Deputy Governor of Jamaica instead of its hangman which is the office for which he s by nature fitted Captain Blood said his lordship sharply in reproof Upon my soul and honour sir you go much too far You are But here Bishop interrupted him He had heaved himself to his feet at last and was venting his fury in unprintable abuse Captain Blood who had also risen stood apparently impassive for the storm to spend itself When at last this happened he addressed himself quietly to Lord Julian as if Colonel Bishop had not spoken Your lordship was about to say he asked with challenging smoothness But his lordship had by now recovered his habitual composure and was again disposed to be conciliatory He laughed and shrugged Faith here s a deal of unnecessary heat said he And God knows this plaguey climate provides enough of that Perhaps Colonel Bishop you are a little uncompromising and you sir are certainly a deal too peppery I have said speaking on behalf of my Lord Sunderland that I am content to await the result of your experiment But Bishop s fury had by now reached a stage in which it was not to be restrained Are you indeed he roared Well then I am not This is a matter in which your lordship must allow me to be the better judge And anyhow I ll take the risk of acting on my own responsibility Lord Julian abandoned the struggle He smiled wearily shrugged and waved a hand in implied resignation The Deputy Governor stormed on Since my lord here has given you a commission I can t regularly deal with you out of hand for piracy as you deserve But you shall answer before a court martial for your action in the matter of Wolverstone and take the consequences I see said Blood Now we come to it And it s yourself as Deputy Governor will preside over that same court martial So that ye can wipe off old scores by hanging me it s little ye care how ye do it He laughed and added Praemonitus praemunitus What shall that mean quoth Lord Julian sharply I had imagined that your lordship would have had some education He was at pains you see to be provocative It s not the literal meaning I am asking sir said Lord Julian with frosty dignity I want to know what you desire me to understand I ll leave your lordship guessing said Blood And I ll be wishing ye both a very good day He swept off his feathered hat and made them a leg very elegantly Before you go said Bishop and to save you from any idle rashness I ll tell you that the Harbour Master and the Commandant have their orders You don t leave Port Royal my fine gallows bird Damme I mean to provide you with permanent moorings here in Execution Dock Peter Blood stiffened and his vivid blue eyes stabbed the bloated face of his enemy He passed his long cane into his left hand and with his right thrust negligently into the breast of his doublet he swung to Lord Julian who was thoughtfully frowning Your lordship I think promised me immunity from this What I may have promised said his lordship your own conduct makes it difficult to perform He rose You did me a service Captain Blood and I had hoped that we might be friends But since you prefer to have it otherwise He shrugged and waved a hand towards the Deputy Governor Blood completed the sentence in his own way Ye mean that ye haven t the strength of character to resist the urgings of a bully He was apparently at his ease and actually smiling Well well as I said before praemonitus praemunitus I m afraid that ye re no scholar Bishop or ye d know that I means forewarned forearmed Forewarned Ha Bishop almost snarled The warning comes a little late You do not leave this house He took a step in the direction of the doorway and raised his voice Ho there he was beginning to call Then with a sudden audible catch in his breath he stopped short Captain Blood s right hand had reemerged from the breast of his doublet bringing with it a long pistol with silver mountings richly chased which he levelled within a foot of the Deputy Governor s head And forearmed said he Don t stir from where you are my lord or there may be an accident And my lord who had been moving to Bishop s assistance stood instantly arrested Chap fallen with much of his high colour suddenly departed the Deputy Governor was swaying on unsteady legs Peter Blood considered him with a grimness that increased his panic I marvel that I don t pistol you without more ado ye fat blackguard If I don t it s for the same reason that once before I gave ye your life when it was forfeit Ye re not aware of the reason to be sure but it may comfort ye to know that it exists At the same time I ll warn ye not to put too heavy a strain on my generosity which resides at the moment in my trigger finger Ye mean to hang me and since that s the worst that can happen to me anyway you ll realize that I ll not boggle at increasing the account by spilling your nasty blood He cast his cane from him thus disengaging his left hand Be good enough to give me your arm Colonel Bishop Come come man your arm Under the compulsion of that sharp tone those resolute eyes and that gleaming pistol Bishop obeyed without demur His recent foul volubility was stemmed He could not trust himself to speak Captain Blood tucked his left arm through the Deputy Governor s proffered right Then he thrust his own right hand with its pistol back into the breast of his doublet Though invisible it s aiming at ye none the less and I give you my word of honour that I ll shoot ye dead upon the very least provocation whether that provocation is yours or another s Ye ll bear that in mind Lord Julian And now ye greasy hangman step out as brisk and lively as ye can and behave as naturally as ye may or it s the black stream of Cocytus ye ll be contemplating Arm in arm they passed through the house and down the garden where Arabella lingered awaiting Peter Blood s return Consideration of his parting words had brought her first turmoil of mind then a clear perception of what might be indeed the truth of the death of Levasseur She perceived that the particular inference drawn from it might similarly have been drawn from Blood s deliverance of Mary Traill When a man so risks his life for a woman the rest is easily assumed For the men who will take such risks without hope of personal gain are few Blood was of those few as he had proved in the case of Mary Traill It needed no further assurances of his to convince her that she had done him a monstrous injustice She remembered words he had used words overheard aboard his ship which he had named the Arabella on the night of her deliverance from the Spanish admiral words he had uttered when she had approved his acceptance of the King s commission the words he had spoken to her that very morning which had but served to move her indignation All these assumed a fresh meaning in her mind delivered now from its unwarranted preconceptions Therefore she lingered there in the garden awaiting his return that she might make amends that she might set a term to all misunderstanding In impatience she awaited him Yet her patience it seemed was to be tested further For when at last he came it was in company unusually close and intimate company with her uncle In vexation she realized that explanations must be postponed Could she have guessed the extent of that postponement vexation would have been changed into despair He passed with his companion from that fragrant garden into the courtyard of the fort Here the Commandant who had been instructed to hold himself in readiness with the necessary men against the need to effect the arrest of Captain Blood was amazed by the curious spectacle of the Deputy Governor of Jamaica strolling forth arm in arm and apparently on the friendliest terms with the intended prisoner For as they went Blood was chatting and laughing briskly They passed out of the gates unchallenged and so came to the mole where the cock boat from the Arabella was waiting They took their places side by side in the stern sheets and were pulled away together always very close and friendly to the great red ship where Jeremy Pitt so anxiously awaited news You conceive the master s amazement to see the Deputy Governor come toiling up the entrance ladder with Blood following very close behind him Sure I walked into a trap as ye feared Jeremy Blood hailed him But I walked out again and fetched the trapper with me He loves his life does this fat rascal Colonel Bishop stood in the waist his great face blenched to the colour of clay his mouth loose almost afraid to look at the sturdy ruffians who lounged about the shot rack on the main hatch Blood shouted an order to the bo sun who was leaning against the forecastle bulkhead Throw me a rope with a running noose over the yardarm there against the need of it Now don t be alarming yourself Colonel darling It s no more than a provision against your being unreasonable which I am sure ye ll not be We ll talk the matter over whiles we are dining for I trust ye ll not refuse to honour my table by your company He led away the will less cowed bully to the great cabin Benjamin the negro steward in white drawers and cotton shirt made haste by his command to serve dinner Colonel Bishop collapsed on the locker under the stern ports and spoke now for the first time May I ask wha what are your intentions he quavered Why nothing sinister Colonel Although ye deserve nothing less than that same rope and yardarm I assure you that it s to be employed only as a last resource Ye ve said his lordship made a mistake when he handed me the commission which the Secretary of State did me the honour to design for me I m disposed to agree with you so I ll take to the sea again Cras ingens iterabimus aequor It s the fine Latin scholar ye ll be when I ve done with ye I ll be getting back to Tortuga and my buccaneers who at least are honest decent fellows So I ve fetched ye aboard as a hostage My God groaned the Deputy Governor Ye ye never mean that ye ll carry me to Tortuga Blood laughed outright Oh I d never serve ye such a bad turn as that No no All I want is that ye ensure my safe departure from Port Royal And if ye re reasonable I ll not even trouble you to swim for it this time Ye ve given certain orders to your Harbour Master and others to the Commandant of your plaguey fort Ye ll be so good as to send for them both aboard here and inform them in my presence that the Arabella is leaving this afternoon on the King s service and is to pass out unmolested And so as to make quite sure of their obedience they shall go a little voyage with us themselves Here s what you require Now write unless you prefer the yardarm Colonel Bishop heaved himself up in a pet You constrain me with violence he was beginning Blood smoothly interrupted him Sure now I am not constraining you at all I m giving you a perfectly free choice between the pen and the rope It s a matter for yourself entirely Bishop glared at him then shrugging heavily he took up the pen and sat down at the table In an unsteady hand he wrote that summons to his officers Blood despatched it ashore and then bade his unwilling guest to table I trust Colonel your appetite is as stout as usual The wretched Bishop took the seat to which he was commanded As for eating however that was not easy to a man in his position nor did Blood press him The Captain himself fell to with a good appetite But before he was midway through the meal came Hayton to inform him that Lord Julian Wade had just come aboard and was asking to see him instantly I was expecting him said Blood Fetch him in Lord Julian came He was very stern and dignified His eyes took in the situation at a glance as Captain Blood rose to greet him It s mighty friendly of you to have joined us my lord Captain Blood said his lordship with asperity I find your humour a little forced I don t know what may be your intentions but I wonder do you realize the risks you are running And I wonder does your lordship realize the risk to yourself in following us aboard as I had counted that you would What shall that mean sir Blood signalled to Benjamin who was standing behind Bishop Set a chair for his lordship Hayton send his lordship s boat ashore Tell them he ll not be returning yet awhile What s that cried his lordship Blister me D ye mean to detain me Are ye mad Better wait Hayton in case his lordship should turn violent said Blood You Benjamin you heard the message Deliver it Will you tell me what you intend sir demanded his lordship quivering with anger Just to make myself and my lads here safe from Colonel Bishop s gallows I ve said that I trusted to your gallantry not to leave him in the lurch but to follow him hither and there s a note from his hand gone ashore to summon the Harbour Master and the Commandant of the fort Once they are aboard I shall have all the hostages I need for our safety You scoundrel said his lordship through his teeth Sure now that s entirely a matter of the point of view said Blood Ordinarily it isn t the kind of name I could suffer any man to apply to me Still considering that ye willingly did me a service once and that ye re likely unwillingly to do me another now I ll overlook your discourtesy so I will His lordship laughed You fool he said Do you dream that I came aboard your pirate ship without taking my measures I informed the Commandant of exactly how you had compelled Colonel Bishop to accompany you Judge now whether he or the Harbour Master will obey the summons or whether you will be allowed to depart as you imagine Blood s face became grave I m sorry for that said he I thought you would be answered his lordship Oh but not on my own account It s the Deputy Governor there I m sorry for D ye know what Ye ve done Sure now ye ve very likely hanged him My God cried Bishop in a sudden increase of panic If they so much as put a shot across my bows up goes their Deputy Governor to the yardarm Your only hope Colonel lies in the fact that I shall send them word of that intention And so that you may mend as far as you can the harm you have done it s yourself shall bear them the message my lord I ll see you damned before I do fumed his lordship Why that s unreasonable and unreasoning But if ye insist why another messenger will do as well and another hostage aboard as I had originally intended will make my hand the stronger Lord Julian stared at him realizing exactly what he had refused You ll think better of it now that ye understand quoth Blood Aye in God s name go my lord spluttered Bishop and make yourself obeyed This damned pirate has me by the throat His lordship surveyed him with an eye that was not by any means admiring Why if that is your wish he began Then he shrugged and turned again to Blood I suppose I can trust you that no harm will come to Colonel Bishop if you are allowed to sail You have my word for it said Blood And also that I shall put him safely ashore again without delay Lord Julian bowed stiffly to the cowering Deputy Governor You understand sir that I do as you desire he said coldly Aye man aye Bishop assented hastily Very well Lord Julian bowed again and took his departure Blood escorted him to the entrance ladder at the foot of which still swung the Arabella s own cock boat It s good bye my lord said Blood And there s another thing He proffered a parchment that he had drawn from his pocket It s the commission Bishop was right when he said it was a mistake Lord Julian considered him and considering him his expression softened I am sorry he said sincerely In other circumstances began Blood Oh but there Ye ll understand The boat s waiting Yet with his foot on the first rung of the ladder Lord Julian hesitated I still do not perceive blister me if I do why you should not have found some one else to carry your message to the Commandant and kept me aboard as an added hostage for his obedience to your wishes Blood s vivid eyes looked into the other s that were clear and honest and he smiled a little wistfully A moment he seemed to hesitate Then he explained himself quite fully Why shouldn t I tell you It s the same reason that s been urging me to pick a quarrel with you so that I might have the satisfaction of slipping a couple of feet of steel into your vitals When I accepted your commission I was moved to think it might redeem me in the eyes of Miss Bishop for whose sake as you may have guessed I took it But I have discovered that such a thing is beyond accomplishment I should have known it for a sick man s dream I have discovered also that if she s choosing you as I believe she is she s choosing wisely between us and that s why I ll not have your life risked by keeping you aboard whilst the message goes by another who might bungle it And now perhaps ye ll understand Lord Julian stared at him bewildered His long aristocratic face was very pale My God he said And you tell me this I tell you because Oh plague on it so that ye may tell her so that she may be made to realize that there s something of the unfortunate gentleman left under the thief and pirate she accounts me and that her own good is my supreme desire Knowing that she may faith she may remember me more kindly if It s only in her prayers That s all my lord Lord Julian continued to look at the buccaneer in silence In silence at last he held out his hand and in silence Blood took it I wonder whether you are right said his lordship and whether you are not the better man Where she is concerned see that you make sure that I am right Good bye to you Lord Julian wrung his hand in silence went down the ladder and was pulled ashore From the distance he waved to Blood who stood leaning on the bulwarks watching the receding cock boat The Arabella sailed within the hour moving lazily before a sluggish breeze The fort remained silent and there was no movement from the fleet to hinder her departure Lord Julian had carried the message effectively and had added to it his own personal commands CHAPTER XXIV WAR Five miles out at sea from Port Royal whence the details of the coast of Jamaica were losing their sharpness the Arabella hove to and the sloop she had been towing was warped alongside Captain Blood escorted his compulsory guest to the head of the ladder Colonel Bishop who for two hours and more had been in a state of mortal anxiety breathed freely at last and as the tide of his fears receded so that of his deep rooted hate of this audacious buccaneer resumed its normal flow But he practised circumspection If in his heart he vowed that once back in Port Royal there was no effort he would spare no nerve he would not strain to bring Peter Blood to final moorings in Execution Dock at least he kept that vow strictly to himself Peter Blood had no illusions He was not and never would be the complete pirate There was not another buccaneer in all the Caribbean who would have denied himself the pleasure of stringing Colonel Bishop from the yardarm and by thus finally stifling the vindictive planter s hatred have increased his own security But Blood was not of these Moreover in the case of Colonel Bishop there was a particular reason for restraint Because he was Arabella Bishop s uncle his life must remain sacred to Captain Blood And so the Captain smiled into the sallow bloated face and the little eyes that fixed him with a malevolence not to be dissembled A safe voyage home to you Colonel darling said he in valediction and from his easy smiling manner you would never have dreamt of the pain he carried in his breast It s the second time ye ve served me for a hostage Ye ll be well advised to avoid a third I m not lucky to you Colonel as you should be perceiving Jeremy Pitt the master lounging at Blood s elbow looked darkly upon the departure of the Deputy Governor Behind them a little mob of grim stalwart sun tanned buccaneers were restrained from cracking Bishop like a flea only by their submission to the dominant will of their leader They had learnt from Pitt while yet in Port Royal of their Captain s danger and whilst as ready as he to throw over the King s service which had been thrust upon them yet they resented the manner in which this had been rendered necessary and they marvelled now at Blood s restraint where Bishop was concerned The Deputy Governor looked round and met the lowering hostile glances of those fierce eyes Instinct warned him that his life at that moment was held precariously that an injudicious word might precipitate an explosion of hatred from which no human power could save him Therefore he said nothing He inclined his head in silence to the Captain and went blundering and stumbling in his haste down that ladder to the sloop and its waiting negro crew They pushed off the craft from the red hull of the Arabella bent to their sweeps then hoisting sail headed back for Port Royal intent upon reaching it before darkness should come down upon them And Bishop the great bulk of him huddled in the stem sheets sat silent his black brows knitted his coarse lips pursed malevolence and vindictiveness so whelming now his recent panic that he forgot his near escape of the yardarm and the running noose On the mole at Port Royal under the low embattled wall of the fort Major Mallard and Lord Julian waited to receive him and it was with infinite relief that they assisted him from the sloop Major Mallard was disposed to be apologetic Glad to see you safe sir said he I d have sunk Blood s ship in spite of your excellency s being aboard but for your own orders by Lord Julian and his lordship s assurance that he had Blood s word for it that no harm should come to you so that no harm came to him I ll confess I thought it rash of his lordship to accept the word of a damned pirate I have found it as good as another s said his lordship cropping the Major s too eager eloquence He spoke with an unusual degree of that frosty dignity he could assume upon occasion The fact is that his lordship was in an exceedingly bad humour Having written jubilantly home to the Secretary of State that his mission had succeeded he was now faced with the necessity of writing again to confess that this success had been ephemeral And because Major Mallard s crisp mostachios were lifted by a sneer at the notion of a buccaneer s word being acceptable he added still more sharply My justification is here in the person of Colonel Bishop safely returned As against that sir your opinion does not weigh for very much You should realize it Oh as your lordship says Major Mallard s manner was tinged with irony To be sure here is the Colonel safe and sound And out yonder is Captain Blood also safe and sound to begin his piratical ravages all over again I do not propose to discuss the reasons with you Major Mallard And anyway it s not for long growled the Colonel finding speech at last No by He emphasized the assurance by an unprintable oath If I spend the last shilling of my fortune and the last ship of the Jamaica fleet I ll have that rascal in a hempen necktie before I rest And I ll not be long about it He had empurpled in his angry vehemence and the veins of his forehead stood out like whipcord Then he checked You did well to follow Lord Julian s instructions he commended the Major With that he turned from him and took his lordship by the arm Come my lord We must take order about this you and I They went off together skirting the redoubt and so through courtyard and garden to the house where Arabella waited anxiously The sight of her uncle brought her infinite relief not only on his own account but on account also of Captain Blood You took a great risk sir she gravely told Lord Julian after the ordinary greetings had been exchanged But Lord Julian answered her as he had answered Major Mallard There was no risk ma am She looked at him in some astonishment His long aristocratic face wore a more melancholy pensive air than usual He answered the enquiry in her glance So that Blood s ship were allowed to pass the fort no harm could come to Colonel Bishop Blood pledged me his word for that A faint smile broke the set of her lips which hitherto had been wistful and a little colour tinged her cheeks She would have pursued the subject but the Deputy Governor s mood did not permit it He sneered and snorted at the notion of Blood s word being good for anything forgetting that he owed to it his own preservation at that moment At supper and for long thereafter he talked of nothing but Blood of how he would lay him by the heels and what hideous things he would perform upon his body And as he drank heavily the while his speech became increasingly gross and his threats increasingly horrible until in the end Arabella withdrew white faced and almost on the verge of tears It was not often that Bishop revealed himself to his niece Oddly enough this coarse overbearing planter went in a certain awe of that slim girl It was as if she had inherited from her father the respect in which he had always been held by his brother Lord Julian who began to find Bishop disgusting beyond endurance excused himself soon after and went in quest of the lady He had yet to deliver the message from Captain Blood and this he thought would be his opportunity But Miss Bishop had retired for the night and Lord Julian must curb his impatience it amounted by now to nothing less until the morrow Very early next morning before the heat of the day came to render the open intolerable to his lordship he espied her from his window moving amid the azaleas in the garden It was a fitting setting for one who was still as much a delightful novelty to him in womanhood as was the azalea among flowers He hurried forth to join her and when aroused from her pensiveness she had given him a good morrow smiling and frank he explained himself by the announcement that he bore her a message from Captain Blood He observed her little start and the slight quiver of her lips and observed thereafter not only her pallor and the shadowy rings about her eyes but also that unusually wistful air which last night had escaped his notice They moved out of the open to one of the terraces where a pergola of orange trees provided a shaded sauntering space that was at once cool and fragrant As they went he considered her admiringly and marvelled at himself that it should have taken him so long fully to realize her slim unusual grace and to find her as he now did so entirely desirable a woman whose charm must irradiate all the life of a man and touch its commonplaces into magic He noted the sheen of her red brown hair and how gracefully one of its heavy ringlets coiled upon her slender milk white neck She wore a gown of shimmering grey silk and a scarlet rose fresh gathered was pinned at her breast like a splash of blood Always thereafter when he thought of her it was as he saw her at that moment as never I think until that moment had he seen her In silence they paced on a little way into the green shade Then she paused and faced him You said something of a message sir she reminded him thus betraying some of her impatience He fingered the ringlets of his periwig a little embarrassed how to deliver himself considering how he should begin He desired me he said at last to give you a message that should prove to you that there is still something left in him of the unfortunate gentleman that that for which once you knew him That is not now necessary said she very gravely He misunderstood her of course knowing nothing of the enlightenment that yesterday had come to her I think nay I know that you do him an injustice said he Her hazel eyes continued to regard him If you will deliver the message it may enable me to judge To him this was confusing He did not immediately answer He found that he had not sufficiently considered the terms he should employ and the matter after all was of an exceeding delicacy demanding delicate handling It was not so much that he was concerned to deliver a message as to render it a vehicle by which to plead his own cause Lord Julian well versed in the lore of womankind and usually at his ease with ladies of the beau monde found himself oddly constrained before this frank and unsophisticated niece of a colonial planter They moved on in silence and as if by common consent towards the brilliant sunshine where the pergola was intersected by the avenue leading upwards to the house Across this patch of light fluttered a gorgeous butterfly that was like black and scarlet velvet and large as a man s hand His lordship s brooding eyes followed it out of sight before he answered It is not easy Stab me it is not He was a man who deserved well And amongst us we have marred his chances your uncle because he could not forget his rancour you because because having told him that in the King s service he would find his redemption of what was past you would not afterwards admit to him that he was so redeemed And this although concern to rescue you was the chief motive of his embracing that same service She had turned her shoulder to him so that he should not see her face I know I know now she said softly Then after a pause she added the question And you What part has your lordship had in this that you should incriminate yourself with us My part Again he hesitated then plunged recklessly on as men do when determined to perform a thing they fear If I understood him aright if he understood aright himself my part though entirely passive was none the less effective I implore you to observe that I but report his own words I say nothing for myself His lordship s unusual nervousness was steadily increasing He thought then so he told me that my presence here had contributed to his inability to redeem himself in your sight and unless he were so redeemed then was redemption nothing She faced him fully a frown of perplexity bringing her brows together above her troubled eyes He thought that you had contributed she echoed It was clear she asked for enlightenment He plunged on to afford it her his glance a little scared his cheeks flushing Aye and he said so in terms which told me something that I hope above all things and yet dare not believe for God knows I am no coxcomb Arabella He said but first let me tell you how I was placed I had gone aboard his ship to demand the instant surrender of your uncle whom he held captive He laughed at me Colonel Bishop should be a hostage for his safety By rashly venturing aboard his ship I afforded him in my own person yet another hostage as valuable at least as Colonel Bishop Yet he bade me depart not from the fear of consequences for he is above fear nor from any personal esteem for me whom he confessed that he had come to find detestable and this for the very reason that made him concerned for my safety I do not understand she said as he paused Is not that a contradiction in itself It seems so only The fact is Arabella this unfortunate man has the the temerity to love you She cried out at that and clutched her breast whose calm was suddenly disturbed Her eyes dilated as she stared at him I I ve startled you said he with concern I feared I should But it was necessary so that you may understand Go on she bade him Well then he saw in me one who made it impossible that he should win you so he said Therefore he could with satisfaction have killed me But because my death might cause you pain because your happiness was the thing that above all things he desired he surrendered that part of his guarantee of safety which my person afforded him If his departure should be hindered and I should lose my life in what might follow there was the risk that that you might mourn me That risk he would not take Him you deemed a thief and a pirate he said and added that I am giving you his own words always if in choosing between us two your choice as he believed would fall on me then were you in his opinion choosing wisely Because of that he bade me leave his ship and had me put ashore She looked at him with eyes that were aswim with tears He took a step towards her a catch in his breath his hand held out Was he right Arabella My life s happiness hangs upon your answer But she continued silently to regard him with those tear laden eyes without speaking and until she spoke he dared not advance farther A doubt a tormenting doubt beset him When presently she spoke he saw how true had been the instinct of which that doubt was born for her words revealed the fact that of all that he had said the only thing that had touched her consciousness and absorbed it from all other considerations was Blood s conduct as it regarded herself He said that she cried He did that Oh She turned away and through the slender clustering trunks of the bordering orange trees she looked out across the glittering waters of the great harbour to the distant hills Thus for a little while my lord standing stiffly fearfully waiting for fuller revelation of her mind At last it came slowly deliberately in a voice that at moments was half suffocated Last night when my uncle displayed his rancour and his evil rage it began to be borne in upon me that such vindictiveness can belong only to those who have wronged It is the frenzy into which men whip themselves to justify an evil passion I must have known then if I had not already learnt it that I had been too credulous of all the unspeakable things attributed to Peter Blood Yesterday I had his own explanation of that tale of Levasseur that you heard in saint Nicholas And now this this but gives me confirmation of his truth and worth To a scoundrel such as I was too readily brought to believe him the act of which you have just told me would have been impossible That is my own opinion said his lordship gently It must be But even if it were not that would now weigh for nothing What weighs oh so heavily and bitterly is the thought that but for the words in which yesterday I repelled him he might have been saved If only I could have spoken to him again before he went I waited for him but my uncle was with him and I had no suspicion that he was going away again And now he is lost back at his outlawry and piracy in which ultimately he will be taken and destroyed And the fault is mine mine What are you saying The only agents were your uncle s hostility and his own obstinacy which would not study compromise You must not blame yourself for anything She swung to him with some impatience her eyes aswim in tears You can say that and in spite of his message which in itself tells how much I was to blame It was my treatment of him the epithets I cast at him that drove him So much he has told you I know it to be true You have no cause for shame said he As for your sorrow why if it will afford you solace you may still count on me to do what man can to rescue him from this position She caught her breath You will do that she cried with sudden eager hopefulness You promise She held out her hand to him impulsively He took it in both his own I promise he answered her And then retaining still the hand she had surrendered to him Arabella he said very gently there is still this other matter upon which you have not answered me This other matter Was he mad she wondered Could any other matter signify in such a moment This matter that concerns myself and all my future oh so very closely This thing that Blood believed that prompted him that that you are not indifferent to me He saw the fair face change colour and grow troubled once more Indifferent to you said she Why no We have been good friends we shall continue so I hope my lord Friends Good friends He was between dismay and bitterness It is not your friendship only that I ask Arabella You heard what I said what I reported You will not say that Peter Blood was wrong Gently she sought to disengage her hand the trouble in her face increasing A moment he resisted then realizing what he did he set her free Arabella he cried on a note of sudden pain I have friendship for you my lord But only friendship His castle of hopes came clattering down about him leaving him a little stunned As he had said he was no coxcomb Yet there was something that he did not understand She confessed to friendship and it was in his power to offer her a great position one to which she a colonial planter s niece however wealthy could never have aspired even in her dreams This she rejected yet spoke of friendship Peter Blood had been mistaken then How far had he been mistaken Had he been as mistaken in her feelings towards himself as he obviously was in her feelings towards his lordship In that case His reflections broke short To speculate was to wound himself in vain He must know Therefore he asked her with grim frankness Is it Peter Blood Peter Blood she echoed At first she did not understand the purport of his question When understanding came a flush suffused her face I do not know she said faltering a little This was hardly a truthful answer For as if an obscuring veil had suddenly been rent that morning she was permitted at last to see Peter Blood in his true relations to other men and that sight vouchsafed her twenty four hours too late filled her with pity and regret and yearning Lord Julian knew enough of women to be left in no further doubt He bowed his head so that she might not see the anger in his eyes for as a man of honour he took shame in that anger which as a human being he could not repress And because Nature in him was stronger as it is in most of us than training Lord Julian from that moment began almost in spite of himself to practise something that was akin to villainy I regret to chronicle it of one for whom if I have done him any sort of justice you should have been conceiving some esteem But the truth is that the lingering remains of the regard in which he had held Peter Blood were choked by the desire to supplant and destroy a rival He had passed his word to Arabella that he would use his powerful influence on Blood s behalf I deplore to set it down that not only did he forget his pledge but secretly set himself to aid and abet Arabella s uncle in the plans he laid for the trapping and undoing of the buccaneer He might reasonably have urged had he been taxed with it that he conducted himself precisely as his duty demanded But to that he might have been answered that duty with him was but the slave of jealousy in this When the Jamaica fleet put to sea some few days later Lord Julian sailed with Colonel Bishop in Vice Admiral Craufurd s flagship Not only was there no need for either of them to go but the Deputy Governor s duties actually demanded that he should remain ashore whilst Lord Julian as we know was a useless man aboard a ship Yet both set out to hunt Captain Blood each making of his duty a pretext for the satisfaction of personal aims and that common purpose became a link between them binding them in a sort of friendship that must otherwise have been impossible between men so dissimilar in breeding and in aspirations The hunt was up They cruised awhile off Hispaniola watching the Windward Passage and suffering the discomforts of the rainy season which had now set in But they cruised in vain and after a month of it returned empty handed to Port Royal there to find awaiting them the most disquieting news from the Old World The megalomania of Louis XIV had set Europe in a blaze of war The French legionaries were ravaging the Rhine provinces and Spain had joined the nations leagued to defend themselves from the wild ambitions of the King of France And there was worse than this there were rumours of civil war in England where the people had grown weary of the bigoted tyranny of King James It was reported that William of Orange had been invited to come over Weeks passed and every ship from home brought additional news William had crossed to England and in March of that year sixteen eighty nine they learnt in Jamaica that he had accepted the crown and that James had thrown himself into the arms of France for rehabilitation To a kinsman of Sunderland s this was disquieting news indeed It was followed by letters from King William s Secretary of State informing Colonel Bishop that there was war with France and that in view of its effect upon the Colonies a Governor General was coming out to the West Indies in the person of Lord Willoughby and that with him came a squadron under the command of Admiral van der Kuylen to reenforce the Jamaica fleet against eventualities Bishop realized that this must mean the end of his supreme authority even though he should continue in Port Royal as Deputy Governor Lord Julian in the lack of direct news to himself did not know what it might mean to him But he had been very close and confidential with Colonel Bishop regarding his hopes of Arabella and Colonel Bishop more than ever now that political events put him in danger of being retired was anxious to enjoy the advantages of having a man of Lord Julian s eminence for his relative They came to a complete understanding in the matter and Lord Julian disclosed all that he knew There is one obstacle in our path said he Captain Blood The girl is in love with him Ye re surely mad cried Bishop when he had recovered speech You are justified of the assumption said his lordship dolefully But I happen to be sane and to speak with knowledge With knowledge Arabella herself has confessed it to me The brazen baggage By God I ll bring her to her senses It was the slave driver speaking the man who governed with a whip Don t be a fool Bishop His lordship s contempt did more than any argument to calm the Colonel That s not the way with a girl of Arabella s spirit Unless you want to wreck my chances for all time you ll hold your tongue and not interfere at all Not interfere My God what then Listen man She has a constant mind I don t think you know your niece As long as Blood lives she will wait for him Then with Blood dead perhaps she will come to her silly senses Now you begin to show intelligence Lord Julian commended him That is the first essential step And here is our chance to take it Bishop warmed to a sort of enthusiasm This war with France removes all restrictions in the matter of Tortuga We are free to invest it in the service of the Crown A victory there and we establish ourselves in the favour of this new government Ah said Lord Julian and he pulled thoughtfully at his lip I see that you understand Bishop laughed coarsely Two birds with one stone eh We ll hunt this rascal in his lair right under the beard of the King of France and we ll take him this time if we reduce Tortuga to a heap of ashes On that expedition they sailed two days later which would be some three months after Blood s departure taking every ship of the fleet and several lesser vessels as auxiliaries To Arabella and the world in general it was given out that they were going to raid French Hispaniola which was really the only expedition that could have afforded Colonel Bishop any sort of justification for leaving Jamaica at all at such a time His sense of duty indeed should have kept him fast in Port Royal but his sense of duty was smothered in hatred that most fruitless and corruptive of all the emotions In the great cabin of Vice Admiral Craufurd s flagship the Imperator the Deputy Governor got drunk that night to celebrate his conviction that the sands of Captain Blood s career were running out 
1264_129805_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXV 
none	none	THE SERVICE OF KING LOUIS Meanwhile some three months before Colonel Bishop set out to reduce Tortuga Captain Blood bearing hell in his soul had blown into its rockbound harbour ahead of the winter gales and two days ahead of the frigate in which Wolverstone had sailed from Port Royal a day before him 
1264_129805_000005_000000	train-clean-360	In that snug anchorage he found his fleet awaiting him the four ships which had been separated in that gale off the Lesser Antilles and some seven hundred men composing their crews 
none	none	Because they had been beginning to grow anxious on his behalf they gave him the greater welcome 
1264_129805_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Guns were fired in his honour and the ships made themselves gay with bunting The town aroused by all this noise in the harbour emptied itself upon the jetty and a vast crowd of men and women of all creeds and nationalities collected there to be present at the coming ashore of the great buccaneer 
none	none	Ashore he went probably for no other reason than to obey the general expectation 
1264_129805_000006_000001	train-clean-360	His mood was taciturn his face grim and sneering 
none	none	Let Wolverstone arrive as presently he would and all this hero worship would turn to execration His captains Hagthorpe Christian and Yberville were on the jetty to receive him and with them were some hundreds of his buccaneers He cut short their greetings and when they plagued him with questions of where he had tarried he bade them await the coming of Wolverstone who would satisfy their curiosity to a surfeit On that he shook them off and shouldered his way through that heterogeneous throng that was composed of bustling traders of several nations English French and Dutch of planters and of seamen of various degrees of buccaneers who were fruit selling half castes negro slaves some doll tearsheets and dunghill queans from the Old World and all the other types of the human family that converted the quays of Cayona into a disreputable image of Babel Winning clear at last and after difficulties Captain Blood took his way alone to the fine house of M d Ogeron there to pay his respects to his friends the Governor and the Governor s family 
1264_129805_000009_000000	train-clean-360	At first the buccaneers jumped to the conclusion that Wolverstone was following with some rare prize of war but gradually from the reduced crew of the Arabella a very different tale leaked out to stem their satisfaction and convert it into perplexity 
1264_129805_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Partly out of loyalty to their captain partly because they perceived that if he was guilty of defection they were guilty with him and partly because being simple sturdy men of their hands they were themselves in the main a little confused as to what really had happened the crew of the Arabella practised reticence with their brethren in Tortuga during those two days before Wolverstone s arrival 
none	none	But they were not reticent enough to prevent the circulation of certain uneasy rumours and extravagant stories of discreditable adventures discreditable that is from the buccaneering point of view of which Captain Blood had been guilty But that Wolverstone came when he did it is possible that there would have been an explosion When however the Old Wolf cast anchor in the bay two days later it was to him all turned for the explanation they were about to demand of Blood Now Wolverstone had only one eye but he saw a deal more with that one eye than do most men with two and despite his grizzled head so picturesquely swathed in a green and scarlet turban he had the sound heart of a boy and in that heart much love for Peter Blood 
1264_129805_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The sight of the Arabella at anchor in the bay had at first amazed him as he sailed round the rocky headland that bore the fort 
none	none	He rubbed his single eye clear of any deceiving film and looked again Still he could not believe what it saw And then a voice at his elbow the voice of Dyke who had elected to sail with him assured him that he was not singular in his bewilderment In the name of Heaven is that the Arabella or is it the ghost of her The Old Wolf rolled his single eye over Dyke and opened his mouth to speak Then he closed it again without having spoken closed it tightly He had a great gift of caution especially in matters that he did not understand That this was the Arabella he could no longer doubt That being so he must think before he spoke What the devil should the Arabella be doing here when he had left her in Jamaica And was Captain Blood aboard and in command or had the remainder of her hands made off with her leaving the Captain in Port Royal 
1264_129805_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Dyke repeated his question 
1264_129805_000015_000001	train-clean-360	This time Wolverstone answered him 
none	none	Ye ve two eyes to see with and ye ask me who s only got one what it is ye see
1264_129805_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But I see the Arabella 
1264_129805_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course since there she rides 
1264_129805_000018_000001	train-clean-360	What else was you expecting 
1264_129805_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Expecting Dyke stared at him open mouthed 
1264_129805_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Was you expecting to find the Arabella here 
1264_129805_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Wolverstone looked him over in contempt then laughed and spoke loud enough to be heard by all around him 
none	none	Of course What else And he laughed again a laugh that seemed to Dyke to be calling him a fool On that Wolverstone turned to give his attention to the operation of anchoring Anon when ashore he was beset by questioning buccaneers it was from their very questions that he gathered exactly how matters stood and perceived that either from lack of courage or other motive Blood himself had refused to render any account of his doings since the Arabella had separated from her sister ships 
1264_129805_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Wolverstone congratulated himself upon the discretion he had used with Dyke 
none	none	The Captain was ever a modest man he explained to Hagthorpe and those others who came crowding round him
1264_129805_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 It s not his way to be sounding his own praises 
1264_129805_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Why it was like this 
none	none	We fell in with old Don Miguel and when we d scuttled him we took aboard a London pimp sent out by the Secretary of State to offer the Captain the King s commission if so be him d quit piracy and be o good behaviour 
1264_129805_000022_000004	train-clean-360	The Captain damned his soul to hell for answer 
none	none	And then we fell in wi the Jamaica fleet and that grey old devil Bishop in command and there was a sure end to Captain Blood and to every mother s son of us all 
1264_129805_000022_000006	train-clean-360	So I goes to him and accept this poxy commission says I turn King s man and save your neck and ours He took me at my word and the London pimp gave him the King s commission on the spot and Bishop all but choked hisself with rage when he was told of it 
1264_129805_000022_000007	train-clean-360	But happened it had and he was forced to swallow it 
none	none	We were King s men all and so into Port Royal we sailed along o Bishop 
1264_129805_000022_000009	train-clean-360	But Bishop didn t trust us 
none	none	He knew too much But for his lordship the fellow from London he d ha hanged the Captain King s commission and all Blood would ha slipped out o Port Royal again that same night 
1264_129805_000022_000013	train-clean-360	But that hound Bishop had passed the word and the fort kept a sharp lookout 
1264_129805_000022_000014	train-clean-360	In the end though it took a fortnight Blood bubbled him 
none	none	He sent me and most o the men off in a frigate that I bought for the voyage 
1264_129805_000022_000016	train-clean-360	His game as he d secretly told me was to follow and give chase 
none	none	Whether that s the game he played or not I can t tell ye but here he is afore me as I d expected he would be 
1264_129805_000023_000000	train-clean-360	There was a great historian lost in Wolverstone 
1264_129805_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He had the right imagination that knows just how far it is safe to stray from the truth and just how far to colour it so as to change its shape for his own purposes 
1264_129805_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Having delivered himself of his decoction of fact and falsehood and thereby added one more to the exploits of Peter Blood he enquired where the Captain might be found 
1264_129805_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Being informed that he kept his ship Wolverstone stepped into a boat and went aboard to report himself as he put it 
none	none	In the great cabin of the Arabella he found Peter Blood alone and very far gone in drink a condition in which no man ever before remembered to have seen him 
1264_129805_000025_000001	train-clean-360	As Wolverstone came in the Captain raised bloodshot eyes to consider him 
1264_129805_000025_000002	train-clean-360	A moment they sharpened in their gaze as he brought his visitor into focus 
1264_129805_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Then he laughed a loose idiot laugh that yet somehow was half a sneer 
none	none	Ah 
1264_129805_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The Old Wolf said he 
1264_129805_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 Got here at last eh 
none	none	And whatcher gonnerdo wi me eh He hiccoughed resoundingly and sagged back loosely in his chair 
1264_129805_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Old Wolverstone stared at him in sombre silence 
1264_129805_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He had looked with untroubled eye upon many a hell of devilment in his time but the sight of Captain Blood in this condition filled him with sudden grief 
none	none	To express it he loosed an oath 
1264_129805_000027_000003	train-clean-360	It was his only expression for emotion of all kinds 
1264_129805_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Then he rolled forward and dropped into a chair at the table facing the Captain 
none	none	My God Peter what s this Rum said Peter
1264_129805_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Rum from Jamaica He pushed bottle and glass towards Wolverstone 
none	none	Wolverstone disregarded them
1264_129805_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I m asking you what ails you he bawled 
none	none	Rum said Captain Blood again and smiled Jus rum I answer all your queshons Why donjerr answer mine Whatcher gonerdo wi me
1264_129805_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve done it said Wolverstone 
none	none	Thank God ye had the sense to hold your tongue till I came Are ye sober enough to understand me Drunk or sober allus derstand you Then listen And out came the tale that Wolverstone had told 
1264_129805_000035_000001	train-clean-360	The Captain steadied himself to grasp it 
none	none	It ll do as well asertruth said he when Wolverstone had finished And oh no marrer Much obliged to ye Old Wolf faithful Old Wolf But was it worthertrouble I m norrer pirate now never a pirate again S finished He banged the table his eyes suddenly fierce I ll come and talk to you again when there s less rum in your wits said Wolverstone rising
1264_129805_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Meanwhile ye ll please to remember the tale I ve told and say nothing that ll make me out a liar 
none	none	They all believes me even the men as sailed wi me from Port Royal I ve made em If they thought as how you d taken the King s commission in earnest and for the purpose o doing as Morgan did ye guess what would follow Hell would follow said the Captain An tha s all I m fit for Ye re maudlin Wolverstone growled
1264_129805_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 We ll talk again to morrow 
none	none	They did but to little purpose either that day or on any day thereafter while the rains which set in that night endured Soon the shrewd Wolverstone discovered that rum was not what ailed Blood 
1264_129805_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Rum was in itself an effect and not by any means the cause of the Captain s listless apathy 
none	none	There was a canker eating at his heart and the Old Wolf knew enough to make a shrewd guess of its nature 
1264_129805_000040_000004	train-clean-360	He cursed all things that daggled petticoats and knowing his world waited for the sickness to pass 
1264_129805_000041_000000	train-clean-360	But it did not pass 
none	none	When Blood was not dicing or drinking in the taverns of Tortuga keeping company that in his saner days he had loathed he was shut up in his cabin aboard the Arabella alone and uncommunicative 
1264_129805_000041_000002	train-clean-360	His friends at Government House bewildered at this change in him sought to reclaim him 
none	none	Mademoiselle d Ogeron particularly distressed sent him almost daily invitations to few of which he responded 
1264_129805_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Later as the rainy season approached its end he was sought by his captains with proposals of remunerative raids on Spanish settlements But to all he manifested an indifference which as the weeks passed and the weather became settled begot first impatience and then exasperation 
1264_129805_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Christian who commanded the Clotho came storming to him one day upbraiding him for his inaction and demanding that he should take order about what was to do 
none	none	Go to the devil Blood said when he had heard him out 
1264_129805_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Christian departed fuming and on the morrow the Clotho weighed anchor and sailed away setting an example of desertion from which the loyalty of Blood s other captains would soon be unable to restrain their men 
none	none	Sometimes Blood asked himself why had he come back to Tortuga at all Held fast in bondage by the thought of Arabella and her scorn of him for a thief and a pirate he had sworn that he had done with buccaneering Why then was he here That question he would answer with another Where else was he to go 
1264_129805_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Neither backward nor forward could he move it seemed 
none	none	He was degenerating visibly under the eyes of all 
1264_129805_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He had entirely lost the almost foppish concern for his appearance and was grown careless and slovenly in his dress 
none	none	He allowed a black beard to grow on cheeks that had ever been so carefully shaven and the long thick black hair once so sedulously curled hung now in a lank untidy mane about a face that was changing from its vigorous swarthiness to an unhealthy sallow whilst the blue eyes that had been so vivid and compelling were now dull and lacklustre 
1264_129805_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Wolverstone the only one who held the clue to this degeneration ventured once and once only to beard him frankly about it 
none	none	Lord Peter Is there never to be no end to this the giant had growled Will you spend your days moping and swilling cause a white faced ninny in Port Royal ll have none o ye Sblood and ounds If ye wants the wench why the plague doesn t ye go and fetch her 
1264_129805_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The blue eyes glared at him from under the jet black eyebrows and something of their old fire began to kindle in them 
none	none	But Wolverstone went on heedlessly I ll be nice wi a wench as long as niceness be the key to her favour But sink me now if I d rot myself in rum on account of anything that wears a petticoat 
1264_129805_000050_000001	train-clean-360	That s not the Old Wolf s way 
1264_129805_000050_000002	train-clean-360	If there s no other expedition ll tempt you why not Port Royal 
1264_129805_000050_000003	train-clean-360	What a plague do it matter if it is an English settlement 
1264_129805_000050_000004	train-clean-360	It s commanded by Colonel Bishop and there s no lack of rascals in your company d follow you to hell if it meant getting Colonel Bishop by the throat 
1264_129805_000050_000005	train-clean-360	It could be done I tell you 
none	none	We ve but to spy the chance when the Jamaica fleet is away 
1264_129805_000050_000007	train-clean-360	There s enough plunder in the town to tempt the lads and there s the wench for you 
none	none	Shall I sound them on t Blood was on his feet his eyes blazing his livid face distorted Ye ll leave my cabin this minute so ye will or by Heaven it s your corpse ll be carried out of it Ye mangy hound d ye dare come to me with such proposals He fell to cursing his faithful officer with a virulence the like of which he had never yet been known to use 
1264_129805_000052_000001	train-clean-360	And Wolverstone in terror before that fury went out without another word 
1264_129805_000052_000002	train-clean-360	The subject was not raised again and Captain Blood was left to his idle abstraction 
none	none	But at last as his buccaneers were growing desperate something happened brought about by the Captain s friend M d Ogeron One sunny morning the Governor of Tortuga came aboard the Arabella accompanied by a chubby little gentleman amiable of countenance amiable and self sufficient of manner My Captain M d Ogeron delivered himself I bring you M de Cussy the Governor of French Hispaniola who desires a word with you Out of consideration for his friend Captain Blood pulled the pipe from his mouth shook some of the rum out of his wits and rose and made a leg to M de Cussy Serviteur said he M de Cussy returned the bow and accepted a seat on the locker under the stem windows
1264_129805_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 You have a good force here under your command my Captain said he 
none	none	Some eight hundred men And I understand they grow restive in idleness They may go to the devil when they please M de Cussy took snuff delicately I have something better than that to propose said he Propose it then said Blood without interest M de Cussy looked at M d Ogeron and raised his eyebrows a little He did not find Captain Blood encouraging But M d Ogeron nodded vigorously with pursed lips and the Governor of Hispaniola propounded his business
1264_129805_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 News has reached us from France that there is war with Spain 
none	none	That is news is it growled Blood
1264_129805_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I am speaking officially my Captain 
1264_129805_000067_000001	train-clean-360	I am not alluding to unofficial skirmishes and unofficial predatory measures which we have condoned out here 
1264_129805_000067_000002	train-clean-360	There is war formally war between France and Spain in Europe 
none	none	It is the intention of France that this war shall be carried into the New World A fleet is coming out from Brest under the command of M le Baron de Rivarol for that purpose 
1264_129805_000067_000005	train-clean-360	I have letters from him desiring me to equip a supplementary squadron and raise a body of not less than a thousand men to reenforce him on his arrival 
none	none	What I have come to propose to you my Captain at the suggestion of our good friend M d Ogeron is in brief that you enroll your ships and your force under M de Rivarol s flag 
1264_129805_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Blood looked at him with a faint kindling of interest 
1264_129805_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 You are offering to take us into the French service he asked 
1264_129805_000068_000002	train-clean-360	 On what terms monsieur 
1264_129805_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 With the rank of Capitaine de Vaisseau for yourself and suitable ranks for the officers serving under you 
1264_129805_000069_000001	train-clean-360	You will enjoy the pay of that rank and you will be entitled together with your men to one tenth share in all prizes taken 
1264_129805_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 My men will hardly account it generous 
1264_129805_000070_000001	train-clean-360	They will tell you that they can sail out of here to morrow disembowel a Spanish settlement and keep the whole of the plunder 
none	none	Ah yes but with the risks attaching to acts of piracy With us your position will be regular and official and considering the powerful fleet by which M de Rivarol is backed the enterprises to be undertaken will be on a much vaster scale than anything you could attempt on your own account 
1264_129805_000071_000002	train-clean-360	So that the one tenth in this case may be equal to more than the whole in the other 
1264_129805_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Blood considered 
none	none	This after all was not piracy that was being proposed It was honourable employment in the service of the King of France
1264_129805_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I will consult my officers he said and he sent for them 
none	none	They came and the matter was laid before them by M de Cussy himself Hagthorpe announced at once that the proposal was opportune The men were grumbling at their protracted inaction and would no doubt be ready to accept the service which M de Cussy offered on behalf of France Hagthorpe looked at Blood as he spoke Blood nodded gloomy agreement Emboldened by this they went on to discuss the terms Yberville the young French filibuster had the honour to point out to M de Cussy that the share offered was too small 
1264_129805_000074_000004	train-clean-360	For one fifth of the prizes the officers would answer for their men not for less 
none	none	M de Cussy was distressed 
1264_129805_000075_000001	train-clean-360	He had his instructions 
1264_129805_000075_000002	train-clean-360	It was taking a deal upon himself to exceed them 
1264_129805_000075_000003	train-clean-360	The buccaneers were firm 
none	none	Unless M de Cussy could make it one fifth there was no more to be said M de Cussy finally consenting to exceed his instructions the articles were drawn up and signed that very day The buccaneers were to be at Petit Goave by the end of January when M de Rivarol had announced that he might be expected 
1264_129805_000076_000000	train-clean-360	After that followed days of activity in Tortuga refitting the ships boucanning meat laying in stores 
1264_129805_000076_000001	train-clean-360	In these matters which once would have engaged all Captain Blood s attention he now took no part He continued listless and aloof 
none	none	If he had given his consent to the undertaking or rather allowed himself to be swept into it by the wishes of his officers it was only because the service offered was of a regular and honourable kind nowise connected with piracy with which he swore in his heart that he had done for ever 
1264_129805_000076_000003	train-clean-360	But his consent remained passive 
none	none	The service entered awoke no zeal in him He was perfectly indifferent as he told Hagthorpe who ventured once to offer a remonstrance whether they went to Petit Goave or to Hades and whether they entered the service of Louis XIV or of Satan CHAPTER XXVI M de RIVAROL Captain Blood was still in that disgruntled mood when he sailed from Tortuga and still in that mood when he came to his moorings in the bay of Petit Goave In that same mood he greeted M le Baron de Rivarol when this nobleman with his fleet of five men of war at last dropped anchor alongside the buccaneer ships in the middle of February The Frenchman had been six weeks on the voyage he announced delayed by unfavourable weather Summoned to wait on him Captain Blood repaired to the Castle of Petit Goave where the interview was to take place The Baron a tall hawk faced man of forty very cold and distant of manner measured Captain Blood with an eye of obvious disapproval Of Hagthorpe Yberville and Wolverstone who stood ranged behind their captain he took no heed whatever M de Cussy offered Captain Blood a chair A moment M de Cussy I do not think M le Baron has observed that I am not alone Let me present to you sir my companions Captain Hagthorpe of the Elizabeth Captain Wolverstone of the Atropos and Captain Yberville of the Lachesis The Baron stared hard and haughtily at Captain Blood then very distantly and barely perceptibly inclined his head to each of the other three His manner implied plainly that he despised them and that he desired them at once to understand it It had a curious effect upon Captain Blood It awoke the devil in him and it awoke at the same time his self respect which of late had been slumbering A sudden shame of his disordered ill kempt appearance made him perhaps the more defiant There was almost a significance in the way he hitched his sword belt round so that the wrought hilt of his very serviceable rapier was brought into fuller view He waved his captains to the chairs that stood about Draw up to the table lads We are keeping the Baron waiting They obeyed him Wolverstone with a grin that was full of understanding Haughtier grew the stare of M de Rivarol To sit at table with these bandits placed him upon what he accounted a dishonouring equality It had been his notion that with the possible exception of Captain Blood they should take his instructions standing as became men of their quality in the presence of a man of his He did the only thing remaining to mark a distinction between himself and them He put on his hat Ye re very wise now said Blood amiably I feel the draught myself And he covered himself with his plumed castor M de Rivarol changed colour He quivered visibly with anger and was a moment controlling himself before venturing to speak M de Cussy was obviously very ill at ease Sir said the Baron frostily you compel me to remind you that the rank you hold is that of Capitaine de Vaisseau and that you are in the presence of the General of the Armies of France by Sea and Land in America You compel me to remind you further that there is a deference due from your rank to mine I am happy to assure you said Captain Blood that the reminder is unnecessary I am by way of accounting myself a gentleman little though I may look like one at present and I should not account myself that were I capable of anything but deference to those whom nature or fortune may have placed above me or to those who being placed beneath me in rank may labour under a disability to resent my lack of it It was a neatly intangible rebuke M de Rivarol bit his lip Captain Blood swept on without giving him time to reply Thus much being clear shall we come to business M de Rivarol s hard eyes considered him a moment Perhaps it will be best said he He took up a paper I have here a copy of the articles into which you entered with M de Cussy Before going further I have to observe that M de Cussy has exceeded his instructions in admitting you to one fifth of the prizes taken His authority did not warrant his going beyond one tenth That is a matter between yourself and M de Cussy my General Oh no It is a matter between myself and you Your pardon my General The articles are signed So far as we are concerned the matter is closed Also out of regard for M de Cussy we should not desire to be witnesses of the rebukes you may consider that he deserves What I may have to say to M de Cussy is no concern of yours That is what I am telling you my General But nom de Dieu it is your concern I suppose that we cannot award you more than one tenth share M de Rivarol smote the table in exasperation This pirate was too infernally skillful a fencer You are quite certain of that M le Baron that you cannot I am quite certain that I will not Captain Blood shrugged and looked down his nose In that case said he it but remains for me to present my little account for our disbursement and to fix the sum at which we should be compensated for our loss of time and derangement in coming hither That settled we can part friends M le Baron No harm has been done What the devil do you mean The Baron was on his feet leaning forward across the table Is it possible that I am obscure My French perhaps is not of the purest but Oh your French is fluent enough too fluent at moments if I may permit myself the observation Now look you here M le filibustier I am not a man with whom it is safe to play the fool as you may very soon discover You have accepted service of the King of France you and your men you hold the rank and draw the pay of a Capitaine de Vaisseau and these your officers hold the rank of lieutenants These ranks carry obligations which you would do well to study and penalties for failing to discharge them which you might study at the same time They are something severe The first obligation of an officer is obedience I commend it to your attention You are not to conceive yourselves as you appear to be doing my allies in the enterprises I have in view but my subordinates In me you behold a commander to lead you not a companion or an equal You understand me I hope Oh be sure that I understand Captain Blood laughed He was recovering his normal self amazingly under the inspiring stimulus of conflict The only thing that marred his enjoyment was the reflection that he had not shaved I forget nothing I assure you my General I do not forget for instance as you appear to be doing that the articles we signed are the condition of our service and the articles provide that we receive one fifth share Refuse us that and you cancel the articles cancel the articles and you cancel our services with them From that moment we cease to have the honour to hold rank in the navies of the King of France There was more than a murmur of approval from his three captains Rivarol glared at them checkmated In effect M de Cussy was beginning timidly In effect monsieur this is your doing the Baron flashed on him glad to have some one upon whom he could fasten the sharp fangs of his irritation You should be broke for it You bring the King s service into disrepute you force me His Majesty s representative into an impossible position Is it impossible to award us the one fifth share quoth Captain Blood silkily In that case there is no need for beat or for injuries to M de Cussy M de Cussy knows that we would not have come for less We depart again upon your assurance that you cannot award us more And things are as they would have been if M de Cussy had adhered rigidly to his instructions I have proved I hope to your satisfaction M le Baron that if you repudiate the articles you can neither claim our services nor hinder our departure not in honour Not in honour sir To the devil with your insolence Do you imply that any course that were not in honour would be possible to me I do not imply it because it would not be possible said Captain Blood We should see to that It is my General for you to say whether the articles are repudiated The Baron sat down I will consider the matter he said sullenly You shall be advised of my resolve Captain Blood rose his officers rose with him Captain Blood bowed M le Baron said he Then he and his buccaneers removed themselves from the August and irate presence of the General of the King s Armies by Land and Sea in America You conceive that there followed for M de Cussy an extremely bad quarter of an hour M de Cussy in fact deserves your sympathy His self sufficiency was blown from him by the haughty M de Rivarol as down from a thistle by the winds of autumn The General of the King s Armies abused him this man who was Governor of Hispaniola as if he were a lackey M de Cussy defended himself by urging the thing that Captain Blood had so admirably urged already on his behalf that if the terms he had made with the buccaneers were not confirmed there was no harm done M de Rivarol bullied and browbeat him into silence Having exhausted abuse the Baron proceeded to indignities Since he accounted that M de Cussy had proved himself unworthy of the post he held M de Rivarol took over the responsibilities of that post for as long as he might remain in Hispaniola and to give effect to this he began by bringing soldiers from his ships and setting his own guard in M de Cussy s castle Out of this trouble followed quickly Wolverstone coming ashore next morning in the picturesque garb that he affected his head swathed in a coloured handkerchief was jeered at by an officer of the newly landed French troops Not accustomed to derision Wolverstone replied in kind and with interest The officer passed to insult and Wolverstone struck him a blow that felled him and left him only the half of his poor senses Within the hour the matter was reported to M de Rivarol and before noon by M de Rivarol s orders Wolverstone was under arrest in the castle The Baron had just sat down to dinner with M de Cussy when the negro who waited on them announced Captain Blood Peevishly M de Rivarol bade him be admitted and there entered now into his presence a spruce and modish gentleman dressed with care and sombre richness in black and silver his swarthy clear cut face scrupulously shaven his long black hair in ringlets that fell to a collar of fine point In his right hand the gentleman carried a broad black hat with a scarlet ostrich plume in his left hand an ebony cane His stockings were of silk a bunch of ribbons masked his garters and the black rosettes on his shoes were finely edged with gold For a moment M de Rivarol did not recognize him For Blood looked younger by ten years than yesterday But the vivid blue eyes under their level black brows were not to be forgotten and they proclaimed him for the man announced even before he had spoken His resurrected pride had demanded that he should put himself on an equality with the baron and advertise that equality by his exterior I come inopportunely he courteously excused himself My apologies My business could not wait It concerns M de Cussy Captain Wolverstone of the Lachesis whom you have placed under arrest It was I who placed him under arrest said M de Rivarol Indeed But I thought that M de Cussy was Governor of Hispaniola Whilst I am here monsieur I am the supreme authority It is as well that you should understand it Perfectly But it is not possible that you are aware of the mistake that has been made Mistake do you say I say mistake On the whole it is polite of me to use that word Also it is expedient It will save discussions Your people have arrested the wrong man M de Rivarol Instead of the French officer who used the grossest provocation they have arrested Captain Wolverstone It is a matter which I beg you to reverse without delay M de Rivarol s hawk face flamed scarlet His dark eyes bulged Sir you you are insolent But of an insolence that is intolerable Normally a man of the utmost self possession he was so rudely shaken now that he actually stammered M le Baron you waste words This is the New World It is not merely new it is novel to one reared amid the superstitions of the Old That novelty you have not yet had time perhaps to realize therefore I overlook the offensive epithet you have used But justice is justice in the New World as in the Old and injustice as intolerable here as there Now justice demands the enlargement of my officer and the arrest and punishment of yours That justice I invite you with submission to administer With submission snorted the Baron in furious scorn With the utmost submission monsieur But at the same time I will remind M le Baron that my buccaneers number eight hundred your troops five hundred and M de Cussy will inform you of the interesting fact that any one buccaneer is equal in action to at least three soldiers of the line I am perfectly frank with you monsieur to save time and hard words Either Captain Wolverstone is instantly set at liberty or we must take measures to set him at liberty ourselves The consequences may be appalling But it is as you please M le Baron You are the supreme authority It is for you to say M de Rivarol was white to the lips In all his life he had never been so bearded and defied But he controlled himself You will do me the favour to wait in the ante room M le Capitaine I desire a word with M de Cussy You shall presently be informed of my decision When the door had closed the baron loosed his fury upon the head of M de Cussy So these are the men you have enlisted in the King s service the men who are to serve under me men who do not serve but dictate and this before the enterprise that has brought me from France is even under way What explanations do you offer me M de Cussy I warn you that I am not pleased with you I am in fact as you may perceive exceedingly angry The Governor seemed to shed his chubbiness He drew himself stiffly erect Your rank monsieur does not give you the right to rebuke me nor do the facts I have enlisted for you the men that you desired me to enlist It is not my fault if you do not know how to handle them better As Captain Blood has told you this is the New World So so M de Rivarol smiled malignantly Not only do you offer no explanation but you venture to put me in the wrong Almost I admire your temerity But there he waved the matter aside He was supremely sardonic It is you tell me the New World and new worlds new manners I suppose In time I may conform my ideas to this new world or I may conform this new world to my ideas He was menacing on that For the moment I must accept what I find It remains for you monsieur who have experience of these savage by ways to advise me out of that experience how to act M le Baron it was a folly to have arrested the buccaneer captain It would be madness to persist We have not the forces to meet force In that case monsieur perhaps you will tell me what we are to do with regard to the future Am I to submit at every turn to the dictates of this man Blood Is the enterprise upon which we are embarked to be conducted as he decrees Am I in short the King s representative in America to be at the mercy of these rascals Oh by no means I am enrolling volunteers here in Hispaniola and I am raising a corps of negroes I compute that when this is done we shall have a force of a thousand men the buccaneers apart But in that case why not dispense with them Because they will always remain the sharp edge of any weapon that we forge In the class of warfare that lies before us they are so skilled that what Captain Blood has just said is not an overstatement A buccaneer is equal to three soldiers of the line At the same time we shall have a sufficient force to keep them in control For the rest monsieur they have certain notions of honour They will stand by their articles and so that we deal justly with them they will deal justly with us and give no trouble I have experience of them and I pledge you my word for that M de Rivarol condescended to be mollified It was necessary that he should save his face and in a degree the Governor afforded him the means to do so as well as a certain guarantee for the future in the further force he was raising Very well he said Be so good as to recall this Captain Blood The Captain came in assured and very dignified M de Rivarol found him detestable but dissembled it M le Capitaine I have taken counsel with M le Gouverneur From what he tells me it is possible that a mistake has been committed Justice you may be sure shall be done To ensure it I shall myself preside over a council to be composed of two of my senior officers yourself and an officer of yours This council shall hold at once an impartial investigation into the affair and the offender the man guilty of having given provocation shall be punished Captain Blood bowed It was not his wish to be extreme Perfectly M le Baron And now sir you have had the night for reflection in this matter of the articles Am I to understand that you confirm or that you repudiate them M de Rivarol s eyes narrowed His mind was full of what M de Cussy had said that these buccaneers must prove the sharp edge of any weapon he might forge He could not dispense with them He perceived that he had blundered tactically in attempting to reduce the agreed share Withdrawal from a position of that kind is ever fraught with loss of dignity But there were those volunteers that M de Cussy was enrolling to strengthen the hand of the King s General Their presence might admit anon of the reopening of this question Meanwhile he must retire in the best order possible I have considered that too he announced And whilst my opinion remains unaltered I must confess that since M de Cussy has pledged us it is for us to fulfil the pledges The articles are confirmed sir Captain Blood bowed again In vain M de Rivarol looked searchingly for the least trace of a smile of triumph on those firm lips The buccaneer s face remained of the utmost gravity Wolverstone was set at liberty that afternoon and his assailant sentenced to two months detention Thus harmony was restored But it had been an unpromising beginning and there was more to follow shortly of a similar discordant kind Blood and his officers were summoned a week later to a council which sat to determine their operations against Spain M de Rivarol laid before them a project for a raid upon the wealthy Spanish town of Cartagena Captain Blood professed astonishment Sourly invited by M de Rivarol to state his grounds for it he did so with the utmost frankness Were I General of the King s Armies in America said he I should have no doubt or hesitation as to the best way in which to serve my Royal master and the French nation That which I think will be obvious to M de Cussy as it is to me is that we should at once invade Spanish Hispaniola and reduce the whole of this fruitful and splendid island into the possession of the King of France That may follow said M de Rivarol It is my wish that we begin with Cartagena You mean sir that we are to sail across the Caribbean on an adventurous expedition neglecting that which lies here at our very door In our absence a Spanish invasion of French Hispaniola is possible If we begin by reducing the Spaniards here that possibility will be removed We shall have added to the Crown of France the most coveted possession in the West Indies The enterprise offers no particular difficulty it may be speedily accomplished and once accomplished it would be time to look farther afield That would seem the logical order in which this campaign should proceed He ceased and there was silence M de Rivarol sat back in his chair the feathered end of a quill between his teeth Presently he cleared his throat and asked a question Is there anybody else who shares Captain Blood s opinion None answered him His own officers were overawed by him Blood s followers naturally preferred Cartagena because offering the greater chance of loot Loyalty to their leader kept them silent You seem to be alone in your opinion said the Baron with his vinegary smile Captain Blood laughed outright He had suddenly read the Baron s mind His airs and graces and haughtiness had so imposed upon Blood that it was only now that at last he saw through them into the fellow s peddling spirit Therefore he laughed there was really nothing else to do But his laughter was charged with more anger even than contempt He had been deluding himself that he had done with piracy The conviction that this French service was free of any taint of that was the only consideration that had induced him to accept it Yet here was this haughty supercilious gentleman who dubbed himself General of the Armies of France proposing a plundering thieving raid which when stripped of its mean transparent mask of legitimate warfare was revealed as piracy of the most flagrant M de Rivarol intrigued by his mirth scowled upon him disapprovingly Why do you laugh monsieur Because I discover here an irony that is supremely droll You M le Baron General of the King s Armies by Land and Sea in America propose an enterprise of a purely buccaneering character whilst I the buccaneer am urging one that is more concerned with upholding the honour of France You perceive how droll it is M de Rivarol perceived nothing of the kind M de Rivarol in fact was extremely angry He bounded to his feet and every man in the room rose with him save only M de Cussy who sat on with a grim smile on his lips He too now read the Baron like an open book and reading him despised him M le filibustier cried Rivarol in a thick voice it seems that I must again remind you that I am your superior officer My superior officer You Lord of the World Why you are just a common pirate But you shall hear the truth for once and that before all these gentlemen who have the honour to serve the King of France It is for me a buccaneer a sea robber to stand here and tell you what is in the interest of French honour and the French Crown Whilst you the French King s appointed General neglecting this are for spending the King s resources against an outlying settlement of no account shedding French blood in seizing a place that cannot be held only because it has been reported to you that there is much gold in Cartagena and that the plunder of it will enrich you It is worthy of the huckster who sought to haggle with us about our share and to beat us down after the articles pledging you were already signed If I am wrong let M de Cussy say so If I am wrong let me be proven wrong and I will beg your pardon Meanwhile monsieur I withdraw from this council I will have no further part in your deliberations I accepted the service of the King of France with intent to honour that service I cannot honour that service by lending countenance to a waste of life and resources in raids upon unimportant settlements with plunder for their only object The responsibility for such decisions must rest with you and with you alone I desire M de Cussy to report me to the Ministers of France For the rest monsieur it merely remains for you to give me your orders I await them aboard my ship and anything else of a personal nature that you may feel I have provoked by the terms I have felt compelled to use in this council M le Baron I have the honour to wish you good day He stalked out and his three captains although they thought him mad rolled after him in loyal silence M de Rivarol was gasping like a landed fish The stark truth had robbed him of speech When he recovered it was to thank Heaven vigorously that the council was relieved by Captain Blood s own act of that gentleman s further participation in its deliberations Inwardly M de Rivarol burned with shame and rage The mask had been plucked from him and he had been held up to scorn he the General of the King s Armies by Sea and Land in America Nevertheless it was to Cartagena that they sailed in the middle of March Volunteers and negroes had brought up the forces directly under M de Rivarol to twelve hundred men With these he thought he could keep the buccaneer contingent in order and submissive They made up an imposing fleet led by M de Rivarol s flagship the Victorieuse a mighty vessel of eighty guns Each of the four other French ships was at least as powerful as Blood s Arabella which was of forty guns Followed the lesser buccaneer vessels the Elizabeth Lachesis and Atropos and a dozen frigates laden with stores besides canoes and small craft in tow Narrowly they missed the Jamaica fleet with Colonel Bishop which sailed north for Tortuga two days after the Baron de Rivarol s southward passage CHAPTER XXVII CARTAGENA Having crossed the Caribbean in the teeth of contrary winds it was not until the early days of April that the French fleet hove in sight of Cartagena and M de Rivarol summoned a council aboard his flagship to determine the method of assault It is of importance messieurs he told them that we take the city by surprise not only before it can put itself into a state of defence but before it can remove its treasures inland I propose to land a force sufficient to achieve this to the north of the city to night after dark And he explained in detail the scheme upon which his wits had laboured He was heard respectfully and approvingly by his officers scornfully by Captain Blood and indifferently by the other buccaneer captains present For it must be understood that Blood s refusal to attend councils had related only to those concerned with determining the nature of the enterprise to be undertaken Captain Blood was the only one amongst them who knew exactly what lay ahead Two years ago he had himself considered a raid upon the place and he had actually made a survey of it in circumstances which he was presently to disclose The Baron s proposal was one to be expected from a commander whose knowledge of Cartagena was only such as might be derived from maps Geographically and strategically considered it is a curious place It stands almost four square screened east and north by hills and it may be said to face south upon the inner of two harbours by which it is normally approached The entrance to the outer harbour which is in reality a lagoon some three miles across lies through a neck known as the Boca Chica or Little Mouth and defended by a fort A long strip of densely wooded land to westward acts here as a natural breakwater and as the inner harbour is approached another strip of land thrusts across at right angles from the first towards the mainland on the east Just short of this it ceases leaving a deep but very narrow channel a veritable gateway into the secure and sheltered inner harbour Another fort defends this second passage East and north of Cartagena lies the mainland which may be left out of account But to the west and northwest this city so well guarded on every other side lies directly open to the sea It stands back beyond a half mile of beach and besides this and the stout Walls which fortify it would appear to have no other defences But those appearances are deceptive and they had utterly deceived M de Rivarol when he devised his plan It remained for Captain Blood to explain the difficulties when M de Rivarol informed him that the honour of opening the assault in the manner which he prescribed was to be accorded to the buccaneers Captain Blood smiled sardonic appreciation of the honour reserved for his men It was precisely what he would have expected For the buccaneers the dangers for M de Rivarol the honour glory and profit of the enterprise It is an honour which I must decline said he quite coldly Wolverstone grunted approval and Hagthorpe nodded Yberville who as much as any of them resented the superciliousness of his noble compatriot never wavered in loyalty to Captain Blood The French officers there were six of them present stared their haughty surprise at the buccaneer leader whilst the Baron challengingly fired a question at him How You decline it sir You decline to obey orders do you say I understood M le Baron that you summoned us to deliberate upon the means to be adopted Then you understood amiss M le Capitaine You are here to receive my commands I have already deliberated and I have decided I hope you understand Oh I understand laughed Blood But I ask myself do you And without giving the Baron time to set the angry question that was bubbling to his lips he swept on You have deliberated you say and you have decided But unless your decision rests upon a wish to destroy my buccaneers you will alter it when I tell you something of which I have knowledge This city of Cartagena looks very vulnerable on the northern side all open to the sea as it apparently stands Ask yourself M le Baron how came the Spaniards who built it where it is to have been at such trouble to fortify it to the south if from the north it is so easily assailable That gave M de Rivarol pause The Spaniards Blood pursued are not quite the fools you are supposing them Let me tell you messieurs that two years ago I made a survey of Cartagena as a preliminary to raiding it I came hither with some friendly trading Indians myself disguised as an Indian and in that guise I spent a week in the city and studied carefully all its approaches On the side of the sea where it looks so temptingly open to assault there is shoal water for over half a mile out far enough out I assure you to ensure that no ship shall come within bombarding range of it It is not safe to venture nearer land than three quarters of a mile But our landing will be effected in canoes and piraguas and open boats cried an officer impatiently In the calmest season of the year the surf will hinder any such operation And you will also bear in mind that if landing were possible as you are suggesting that landing could not be covered by the ships guns In fact it is the landing parties would be in danger from their own artillery If the attack is made by night as I propose covering will be unnecessary You should be ashore in force before the Spaniards are aware of the intent You are assuming that Cartagena is a city of the blind that at this very moment they are not conning our sails and asking themselves who we are and what we intend But if they feel themselves secure from the north as you suggest cried the Baron impatiently that very security will lull them Perhaps But then they are secure Any attempt to land on this side is doomed to failure at the hands of Nature Nevertheless we make the attempt said the obstinate Baron whose haughtiness would not allow him to yield before his officers If you still choose to do so after what I have said you are of course the person to decide But I do not lead my men into fruitless danger If I command you the Baron was beginning But Blood unceremoniously interrupted him M le Baron when M de Cussy engaged us on your behalf it was as much on account of our knowledge and experience of this class of warfare as on account of our strength I have placed my own knowledge and experience in this particular matter at your disposal I will add that I abandoned my own project of raiding Cartagena not being in sufficient strength at the time to force the entrance of the harbour which is the only way into the city The strength which you now command is ample for that purpose But whilst we are doing that the Spaniards will have time to remove great part of the wealth this city holds We must take them by surprise Captain Blood shrugged If this is a mere pirating raid that of course is a prime consideration It was with me But if you are concerned to abate the pride of Spain and plant the Lilies of France on the forts of this settlement the loss of some treasure should not really weigh for much M de Rivarol bit his lip in chagrin His gloomy eye smouldered as it considered the self contained buccaneer But if I command you to go to make the attempt he asked Answer me monsieur let us know once for all where we stand and who commands this expedition Positively I find you tiresome said Captain Blood and he swung to M de Cussy who sat there gnawing his lip intensely uncomfortable I appeal to you monsieur to justify me to the General M de Cussy started out of his gloomy abstraction He cleared his throat He was extremely nervous In view of what Captain Blood has submitted Oh to the devil with that snapped Rivarol It seems that I am followed by poltroons Look you M le Capitaine since you are afraid to undertake this thing I will myself undertake it The weather is calm and I count upon making good my landing If I do so I shall have proved you wrong and I shall have a word to say to you to morrow which you may not like I am being very generous with you sir He waved his hand regally You have leave to go It was sheer obstinacy and empty pride that drove him and he received the lesson he deserved The fleet stood in during the afternoon to within a mile of the coast and under cover of darkness three hundred men of whom two hundred were negroes the whole of the negro contingent having been pressed into the undertaking were pulled away for the shore in the canoes piraguas and ships boats Rivarol s pride compelled him however much he may have disliked the venture to lead them in person The first six boats were caught in the surf and pounded into fragments before their occupants could extricate themselves The thunder of the breakers and the cries of the shipwrecked warned those who followed and thereby saved them from sharing the same fate By the Baron s urgent orders they pulled away again out of danger and stood about to pick up such survivors as contrived to battle towards them Close upon fifty lives were lost in the adventure together with half a dozen boats stored with ammunition and light guns The Baron went back to his flagship an infuriated but by no means a wiser man Wisdom not even the pungent wisdom experience thrusts upon us is not for such as M de Rivarol His anger embraced all things but focussed chiefly upon Captain Blood In some warped process of reasoning he held the buccaneer chiefly responsible for this misadventure He went to bed considering furiously what he should say to Captain Blood upon the morrow He was awakened at dawn by the rolling thunder of guns Emerging upon the poop in nightcap and slippers he beheld a sight that increased his unreasonable and unreasoning fury The four buccaneer ships under canvas were going through extraordinary manoeuvre half a mile off the Boca Chica and little more than half a mile away from the remainder of the fleet and from their flanks flame and smoke were belching each time they swung broadside to the great round fort that guarded that narrow entrance The fort was returning the fire vigorously and viciously But the buccaneers timed their broadsides with extraordinary judgment to catch the defending ordnance reloading then as they drew the Spaniards fire they swung away again not only taking care to be ever moving targets but further to present no more than bow or stern to the fort their masts in line when the heaviest cannonades were to be expected Gibbering and cursing M de Rivarol stood there and watched this action so presumptuously undertaken by Blood on his own responsibility The officers of the Victorieuse crowded round him but it was not until M de Cussy came to join the group that he opened the sluices of his rage And M de Cussy himself invited the deluge that now caught him He had come up rubbing his hands and taking a proper satisfaction in the energy of the men whom he had enlisted Aha M de Rivarol he laughed He understands his business eh this Captain Blood He ll plant the Lilies of France on that fort before breakfast The Baron swung upon him snarling He understands his business eh His business let me tell you M de Cussy is to obey my orders and I have not ordered this Par la Mordieu When this is over I ll deal with him for his damned insubordination Surely M le Baron he will have justified it if he succeeds Justified it Ah parbleu Can a soldier ever justify acting without orders He raved on furiously his officers supporting him out of their detestation of Captain Blood Meanwhile the fight went merrily on The fort was suffering badly Yet for all their manoeuvring the buccaneers were not escaping punishment The starboard gunwale of the Atropos had been hammered into splinters and a shot had caught her astern in the coach The Elizabeth was badly battered about the forecastle and the Arabella s maintop had been shot away whilst towards the end of that engagement the Lachesis came reeling out of the fight with a shattered rudder steering herself by sweeps The absurd Baron s fierce eyes positively gleamed with satisfaction I pray Heaven they may sink all his infernal ships he cried in his frenzy But Heaven didn t hear him Scarcely had he spoken than there was a terrific explosion and half the fort went up in fragments A lucky shot from the buccaneers had found the powder magazine It may have been a couple of hours later when Captain Blood as spruce and cool as if he had just come from a levee stepped upon the quarter deck of the Victoriense to confront M de Rivarol still in bedgown and nightcap I have to report M le Baron that we are in possession of the fort on Boca Chica The standard of France is flying from what remains of its tower and the way into the outer harbour is open to your fleet M de Rivarol was compelled to swallow his fury though it choked him The jubilation among his officers had been such that he could not continue as he had begun Yet his eyes were malevolent his face pale with anger You are fortunate M Blood that you succeeded he said It would have gone very ill with you had you failed Another time be so good as to await my orders lest you should afterwards lack the justification which your good fortune has procured you this morning Blood smiled with a flash of white teeth and bowed I shall be glad of your orders now General for pursuing our advantage You realize that speed in striking is the first essential Rivarol was left gaping a moment Absorbed in his ridiculous anger he had considered nothing But he made a quick recovery To my cabin if you please he commanded peremptorily and was turning to lead the way when Blood arrested him With submission my General we shall be better here You behold there the scene of our coming action It is spread before you like a map He waved his hand towards the lagoon the country flanking it and the considerable city standing back from the beach If it is not a presumption in me to offer a suggestion He paused M de Rivarol looked at him sharply suspecting irony But the swarthy face was bland the keen eyes steady Let us hear your suggestion he consented Blood pointed out the fort at the mouth of the inner harbour which was just barely visible above the waving palms on the intervening tongue of land He announced that its armament was less formidable than that of the outer fort which they had reduced but on the other hand the passage was very much narrower than the Boca Chica and before they could attempt to make it in any case they must dispose of those defences He proposed that the French ships should enter the outer harbour and proceed at once to bombardment Meanwhile he would land three hundred buccaneers and some artillery on the eastern side of the lagoon beyond the fragrant garden islands dense with richly bearing fruit trees and proceed simultaneously to storm the fort in the rear Thus beset on both sides at once and demoralized by the fate of the much stronger outer fort he did not think the Spaniards would offer a very long resistance Then it would be for M de Rivarol to garrison the fort whilst Captain Blood would sweep on with his men and seize the Church of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa plainly visible on its hill immediately eastward of the town Not only did that eminence afford them a valuable and obvious strategic advantage but it commanded the only road that led from Cartagena to the interior and once it were held there would be no further question of the Spaniards attempting to remove the wealth of the city That to M de Rivarol was as Captain Blood had judged that it would be the crowning argument Supercilious until that moment and disposed for his own pride s sake to treat the buccaneer s suggestions with cavalier criticism M de Rivarol s manner suddenly changed He became alert and brisk went so far as tolerantly to commend Captain Blood s plan and issued orders that action might be taken upon it at once It is not necessary to follow that action step by step Blunders on the part of the French marred its smooth execution and the indifferent handling of their ships led to the sinking of two of them in the course of the afternoon by the fort s gunfire But by evening owing largely to the irresistible fury with which the buccaneers stormed the place from the landward side the fort had surrendered and before dusk Blood and his men with some ordnance hauled thither by mules dominated the city from the heights of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa At noon on the morrow shorn of defences and threatened with bombardment Cartagena sent offers of surrender to M de Rivarol Swollen with pride by a victory for which he took the entire credit to himself the Baron dictated his terms He demanded that all public effects and office accounts be delivered up that the merchants surrender all moneys and goods held by them for their correspondents the inhabitants could choose whether they would remain in the city or depart but those who went must first deliver up all their property and those who elected to remain must surrender half and become the subjects of France religious houses and churches should be spared but they must render accounts of all moneys and valuables in their possession Cartagena agreed having no choice in the matter and on the next day which was the fifth of April M de Rivarol entered the city and proclaimed it now a French colony appointing M de Cussy its Governor Thereafter he proceeded to the Cathedral where very properly a Te Deum was sung in honour of the conquest This by way of grace whereafter M de Rivarol proceeded to devour the city The only detail in which the French conquest of Cartagena differed from an ordinary buccaneering raid was that under the severest penalties no soldier was to enter the house of any inhabitant But this apparent respect for the persons and property of the conquered was based in reality upon M de Rivarol s anxiety lest a doubloon should be abstracted from all the wealth that was pouring into the treasury opened by the Baron in the name of the King of France Once the golden stream had ceased he removed all restrictions and left the city in prey to his men who proceeded further to pillage it of that part of their property which the inhabitants who became French subjects had been assured should remain inviolate The plunder was enormous In the course of four days over a hundred mules laden with gold went out of the city and down to the boats waiting at the beach to convey the treasure aboard the ships

none	none	THE HONOUR OF M DE RIVAROL During the capitulation and for some time after Captain Blood and the greater portion of his buccaneers had been at their post on the heights of Nuestra Senora de la Poupa utterly in ignorance of what was taking place Blood although the man chiefly if not solely responsible for the swift reduction of the city which was proving a veritable treasure house was not even shown the consideration of being called to the council of officers which with M de Rivarol determined the terms of the capitulation 
1283_129808_000002_000000	train-clean-360	This was a slight that at another time Captain Blood would not have borne for a moment 
1283_129808_000002_000001	train-clean-360	But at present in his odd frame of mind and its divorcement from piracy he was content to smile his utter contempt of the French General 
none	none	Not so however his captains and still less his men 
1283_129808_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Resentment smouldered amongst them for a while to flame out violently at the end of that week in Cartagena 
1283_129808_000002_000004	train-clean-360	It was only by undertaking to voice their grievance to the Baron that their captain was able for the moment to pacify them 
none	none	That done he went at once in quest of M de Rivarol 
1283_129808_000003_000000	train-clean-360	He found him in the offices which the Baron had set up in the town with a staff of clerks to register the treasure brought in and to cast up the surrendered account books with a view to ascertaining precisely what were the sums yet to be delivered up 
1283_129808_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The Baron sat there scrutinizing ledgers like a city merchant and checking figures to make sure that all was correct to the last peso 
1283_129808_000003_000002	train-clean-360	A choice occupation this for the General of the King s Armies by Sea and Land 
1283_129808_000003_000003	train-clean-360	He looked up irritated by the interruption which Captain Blood s advent occasioned 
none	none	M le Baron the latter greeted him
1283_129808_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 I must speak frankly and you must suffer it 
1283_129808_000004_000002	train-clean-360	My men are on the point of mutiny 
none	none	M de Rivarol considered him with a faint lift of the eyebrows Captain Blood I too will speak frankly and you too must suffer it 
1283_129808_000006_000001	train-clean-360	If there is a mutiny you and your captains shall be held personally responsible 
none	none	The mistake you make is in assuming with me the tone of an ally whereas I have given you clearly to understand from the first that you are simply in the position of having accepted service under me Your proper apprehension of that fact will save the waste of a deal of words 
1283_129808_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Blood contained himself with difficulty 
none	none	One of these fine days he felt that for the sake of humanity he must slit the comb of this supercilious arrogant cockerel
1283_129808_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 You may define our positions as you please said he 
1283_129808_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 But I ll remind you that the nature of a thing is not changed by the name you give it I am concerned with facts chiefly with the fact that we entered into definite articles with you 
1283_129808_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Those articles provide for a certain distribution of the spoil 
1283_129808_000008_000003	train-clean-360	My men demand it 
1283_129808_000008_000004	train-clean-360	They are not satisfied 
1283_129808_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Of what are they not satisfied demanded the Baron 
none	none	Of your honesty M de Rivarol 
1283_129808_000011_000000	train-clean-360	A blow in the face could scarcely have taken the Frenchman more aback He stiffened and drew himself up his eyes blazing his face of a deathly pallor 
1283_129808_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The clerks at the tables laid down their pens and awaited the explosion in a sort of terror 
none	none	For a long moment there was silence 
1283_129808_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Then the great gentleman delivered himself in a voice of concentrated anger 
1283_129808_000012_000002	train-clean-360	 Do you really dare so much you and the dirty thieves that follow you 
1283_129808_000012_000003	train-clean-360	God s Blood 
none	none	You shall answer to me for that word though it entail a yet worse dishonour to meet you Faugh
1283_129808_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I will remind you said Blood that I am speaking not for myself but for my men 
1283_129808_000013_000001	train-clean-360	It is they who are not satisfied they who threaten that unless satisfaction is afforded them and promptly they will take it 
none	none	Take it said Rivarol trembling in his rage
1283_129808_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Let them attempt it and 
1283_129808_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Now don t be rash 
none	none	My men are within their rights as you are aware They demand to know when this sharing of the spoil is to take place and when they are to receive the fifth for which their articles provide
1283_129808_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 God give me patience 
1283_129808_000016_000001	train-clean-360	How can we share the spoil before it has been completely gathered 
1283_129808_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 My men have reason to believe that it is gathered and anyway they view with mistrust that it should all be housed aboard your ships and remain in your possession 
1283_129808_000017_000001	train-clean-360	They say that hereafter there will be no ascertaining what the spoil really amounts to 
1283_129808_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But name of Heaven I have kept books 
1283_129808_000018_000001	train-clean-360	They are there for all to see 
1283_129808_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 They do not wish to see account books 
none	none	Few of them can read 
1283_129808_000019_000002	train-clean-360	They want to view the treasure itself 
1283_129808_000019_000003	train-clean-360	They know you compel me to be blunt that the accounts have been falsified 
none	none	Your books show the spoil of Cartagena to amount to some ten million livres 
1283_129808_000019_000005	train-clean-360	The men know and they are very skilled in these computations that it exceeds the enormous total of forty millions 
1283_129808_000019_000006	train-clean-360	They insist that the treasure itself be produced and weighed in their presence as is the custom among the Brethren of the Coast 
1283_129808_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I know nothing of filibuster customs The gentleman was disdainful 
1283_129808_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 But you are learning quickly 
1283_129808_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean you rogue 
1283_129808_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I am a leader of armies not of plundering thieves 
1283_129808_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh but of course Blood s irony laughed in his eyes 
none	none	Yet whatever you may be I warn you that unless you yield to a demand that I consider just and therefore uphold you may look for trouble and it would not surprise me if you never leave Cartagena at all nor convey a single gold piece home to France Ah pardieu 
1283_129808_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Am I to understand that you are threatening me 
none	none	Come come M le Baron 
1283_129808_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I warn you of the trouble that a little prudence may avert 
1283_129808_000025_000002	train-clean-360	You do not know on what a volcano you are sitting You do not know the ways of buccaneers 
none	none	If you persist Cartagena will be drenched in blood and whatever the outcome the King of France will not have been well served 
1283_129808_000026_000000	train-clean-360	That shifted the basis of the argument to less hostile ground 
none	none	Awhile yet it continued to be concluded at last by an ungracious undertaking from M de Rivarol to submit to the demands of the buccaneers 
1283_129808_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He gave it with an extreme ill grace and only because Blood made him realize at last that to withhold it longer would be dangerous 
1283_129808_000026_000003	train-clean-360	In an engagement he might conceivably defeat Blood s followers 
1283_129808_000026_000004	train-clean-360	But conceivably he might not 
1283_129808_000026_000005	train-clean-360	And even if he succeeded the effort would be so costly to him in men that he might not thereafter find himself in sufficient strength to maintain his hold of what he had seized 
none	none	The end of it all was that he gave a promise at once to make the necessary preparations and if Captain Blood and his officers would wait upon him on board the Victorieuse to morrow morning the treasure should be produced weighed in their presence and their fifth share surrendered there and then into their own keeping Among the buccaneers that night there was hilarity over the sudden abatement of M de Rivarol s monstrous pride 
1283_129808_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But when the next dawn broke over Cartagena they had the explanation of it 
none	none	The only ships to be seen in the harbour were the Arabella and the Elizabeth riding at anchor and the Atropos and the Lachesis careened on the beach for repair of the damage sustained in the bombardment 
1283_129808_000028_000003	train-clean-360	The French ships were gone 
none	none	They had been quietly and secretly warped out of the harbour under cover of night and three sails faint and small on the horizon to westward was all that remained to be seen of them The absconding M de Rivarol had gone off with the treasure taking with him the troops and mariners he had brought from France He had left behind him at Cartagena not only the empty handed buccaneers whom he had swindled but also M de Cussy and the volunteers and negroes from Hispaniola whom he had swindled no less 
1283_129808_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The two parties were fused into one by their common fury and before the exhibition of it the inhabitants of that ill fated town were stricken with deeper terror than they had yet known since the coming of this expedition 
none	none	Captain Blood alone kept his head setting a curb upon his deep chagrin He had promised himself that before parting from M de Rivarol he would present a reckoning for all the petty affronts and insults to which that unspeakable fellow now proved a scoundrel had subjected him
1283_129808_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 We must follow he declared 
1283_129808_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Follow and punish 
1283_129808_000032_000000	train-clean-360	At first that was the general cry 
1283_129808_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Then came the consideration that only two of the buccaneer ships were seaworthy and these could not accommodate the whole force particularly being at the moment indifferently victualled for a long voyage 
none	none	The crews of the Lachesis and Atropos and with them their captains Wolverstone and Yberville renounced the intention 
1283_129808_000032_000003	train-clean-360	After all there would be a deal of treasure still hidden in Cartagena 
1283_129808_000032_000004	train-clean-360	They would remain behind to extort it whilst fitting their ships for sea 
1283_129808_000032_000005	train-clean-360	Let Blood and Hagthorpe and those who sailed with them do as they pleased 
none	none	Then only did Blood realize the rashness of his proposal and in attempting to draw back he almost precipitated a battle between the two parties into which that same proposal had now divided the buccaneers And meanwhile those French sails on the horizon were growing less and less 
1283_129808_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Blood was reduced to despair 
1283_129808_000033_000002	train-clean-360	If he went off now Heaven knew what would happen to the town the temper of those whom he was leaving being what it was 
1283_129808_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Yet if he remained it would simply mean that his own and Hagthorpe s crews would join in the saturnalia and increase the hideousness of events now inevitable 
1283_129808_000033_000004	train-clean-360	Unable to reach a decision his own men and Hagthorpe s took the matter off his hands eager to give chase to Rivarol 
1283_129808_000033_000005	train-clean-360	Not only was a dastardly cheat to be punished but an enormous treasure to be won by treating as an enemy this French commander who himself had so villainously broken the alliance 
1283_129808_000034_000000	train-clean-360	When Blood torn as he was between conflicting considerations still hesitated they bore him almost by main force aboard the Arabella 
1283_129808_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Within an hour the water casks at least replenished and stowed aboard the Arabella and the Elizabeth put to sea upon that angry chase 
none	none	When we were well at sea and the Arabella s course was laid writes Pitt in his log I went to seek the Captain knowing him to be in great trouble of mind over these events 
1283_129808_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I found him sitting alone in his cabin his head in his hands torment in the eyes that stared straight before him seeing nothing 
1283_129808_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 What now 
none	none	Peter cried the young Somerset mariner Lord man what is there here to fret you 
1283_129808_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Surely t isn t the thought of Rivarol 
1283_129808_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Blood thickly 
1283_129808_000038_000001	train-clean-360	And for once he was communicative 
1283_129808_000038_000002	train-clean-360	It may well be that he must vent the thing that oppressed him or be driven mad by it 
1283_129808_000038_000003	train-clean-360	And Pitt after all was his friend and loved him and so a proper man for confidences 
1283_129808_000038_000004	train-clean-360	 But if she knew 
1283_129808_000038_000005	train-clean-360	if she knew 
none	none	If she knew O God 
1283_129808_000038_000007	train-clean-360	I had thought to have done with piracy thought to have done with it for ever 
none	none	Yet here have I been committed by this scoundrel to the worst piracy that ever I was guilty of 
1283_129808_000038_000009	train-clean-360	Think of Cartagena 
1283_129808_000038_000010	train-clean-360	Think of the hell those devils will be making of it now 
1283_129808_000038_000011	train-clean-360	And I must have that on my soul 
1283_129808_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay Peter t isn t on your soul but on Rivarol s 
none	none	It is that dirty thief who has brought all this about 
1283_129808_000039_000002	train-clean-360	What could you have done to prevent it 
1283_129808_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I would have stayed if it could have availed 
none	none	It could not and you know it 
1283_129808_000041_000001	train-clean-360	So why repine 
1283_129808_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 There is more than that to it groaned Blood 
none	none	What now What remains Loyal service with the English was made impossible for me 
1283_129808_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Loyal service with France has led to this and that is equally impossible hereafter What to live clean I believe the only thing is to go and offer my sword to the King of Spain 
1283_129808_000043_000000	train-clean-360	But something remained the last thing that he could have expected something towards which they were rapidly sailing over the tropical sunlit sea 
1283_129808_000043_000001	train-clean-360	All this against which he now inveighed so bitterly was but a necessary stage in the shaping of his odd destiny 
1283_129808_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Setting a course for Hispaniola since they judged that thither must Rivarol go to refit before attempting to cross to France the Arabella and the Elizabeth ploughed briskly northward with a moderately favourable wind for two days and nights without ever catching a glimpse of their quarry 
none	none	The third dawn brought with it a haze which circumscribed their range of vision to something between two and three miles and deepened their growing vexation and their apprehension that M de Rivarol might escape them altogether Their position then according to Pitt s log was approximately seventy five deg thirty W Long by seventeen deg forty five N Lat so that they had Jamaica on their larboard beam some thirty miles to westward and indeed away to the northwest faintly visible as a bank of clouds appeared the great ridge of the Blue Mountains whose peaks were thrust into the clear upper air above the low lying haze 
1283_129808_000045_000002	train-clean-360	The wind to which they were sailing very close was westerly and it bore to their ears a booming sound which in less experienced ears might have passed for the breaking of surf upon a lee shore 
1283_129808_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Guns said Pitt who stood with Blood upon the quarter deck 
1283_129808_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Blood nodded listening 
1283_129808_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Ten miles away perhaps fifteen somewhere off Port Royal I should judge Pitt added 
none	none	Then he looked at his captain
1283_129808_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 Does it concern us he asked 
1283_129808_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Guns off Port Royal that should argue Colonel Bishop at work 
1283_129808_000048_000001	train-clean-360	And against whom should he be in action but against friends of ours I think it may concern us 
1283_129808_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Anyway we ll stand in to investigate 
1283_129808_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Bid them put the helm over 
1283_129808_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Close hauled they tacked aweather guided by the sound of combat which grew in volume and definition as they approached it 
1283_129808_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Thus for an hour perhaps 
1283_129808_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Then as telescope to his eye Blood raked the haze expecting at any moment to behold the battling ships the guns abruptly ceased 
1283_129808_000050_000000	train-clean-360	They held to their course nevertheless with all hands on deck eagerly anxiously scanning the sea ahead 
1283_129808_000050_000001	train-clean-360	And presently an object loomed into view which soon defined itself for a great ship on fire 
1283_129808_000050_000002	train-clean-360	As the Arabella with the Elizabeth following closely raced nearer on their north westerly tack the outlines of the blazing vessel grew clearer Presently her masts stood out sharp and black above the smoke and flames and through his telescope Blood made out plainly the pennon of saint George fluttering from her maintop 
1283_129808_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 An English ship he cried 
none	none	He scanned the seas for the conqueror in the battle of which this grim evidence was added to that of the sounds they had heard and when at last as they drew closer to the doomed vessel they made out the shadowy outlines of three tall ships some three or four miles away standing in toward Port Royal the first and natural assumption was that these ships must belong to the Jamaica fleet and that the burning vessel was a defeated buccaneer and because of this they sped on to pick up the three boats that were standing away from the blazing hulk But Pitt who through the telescope was examining the receding squadron observed things apparent only to the eye of the trained mariner and made the incredible announcement that the largest of these three vessels was Rivarol s Victorieuse 
1283_129808_000053_000000	train-clean-360	They took in sail and hove to as they came up with the drifting boats laden to capacity with survivors 
none	none	And there were others adrift on some of the spars and wreckage with which the sea was strewn who must be rescued CHAPTER XXIX THE SERVICE OF KING WILLIAM One of the boats bumped alongside the Arabella and up the entrance ladder came first a slight spruce little gentleman in a coat of mulberry satin laced with gold whose wizened yellow rather peevish face was framed in a heavy black periwig His modish and costly apparel had nowise suffered by the adventure through which he had passed and he carried himself with the easy assurance of a man of rank Here quite clearly was no buccaneer He was closely followed by one who in every particular save that of age was his physical opposite corpulent in a brawny vigorous way with a full round weather beaten face whose mouth was humourous and whose eyes were blue and twinkling He was well dressed without fripperies and bore with him an air of vigorous authority As the little man stepped from the ladder into the waist whither Captain Blood had gone to receive him his sharp ferrety dark eyes swept the uncouth ranks of the assembled crew of the Arabella And where the devil may I be now he demanded irritably Are you English or what the devil are you Myself I have the honour to be Irish sir My name is Blood Captain Peter Blood and this is my ship the Arabella all very much at your service Blood shrilled the little man O Sblood A pirate He swung to the Colossus who followed him A damned pirate van der Kuylen Rend my vitals but we re come from Scylla to Charybdis So said the other gutturally and again So Then the humour of it took him and he yielded to it Damme What s to laugh at you porpoise spluttered mulberry coat A fine tale this ll make at home Admiral van der Kuylen first loses his fleet in the night then has his flagship fired under him by a French squadron and ends all by being captured by a pirate I m glad you find it matter for laughter Since for my sins I happen to be with you I m damned if I do There s a misapprehension if I may make so bold as to point it out put in Blood quietly You are not captured gentlemen you are rescued When you realize it perhaps it will occur to you to acknowledge the hospitality I am offering you It may be poor but it is the best at my disposal The fierce little gentleman stared at him Damme Do you permit yourself to be ironical he disapproved him and possibly with a view to correcting any such tendency proceeded to introduce himself I am Lord Willoughby King William s Governor General of the West Indies and this is Admiral van der Kuylen commander of His Majesty s West Indian fleet at present mislaid somewhere in this damned Caribbean Sea King William quoth Blood and he was conscious that Pitt and Dyke who were behind him now came edging nearer sharing his own wonder And who may be King William and of what may he be King What s that In a wonder greater than his own Lord Willoughby stared back at him At last I am alluding to His Majesty King William III William of Orange who with Queen Mary has been ruling England for two months and more There was a moment s silence until Blood realized what he was being told D ye mean sir that they ve roused themselves at home and kicked out that scoundrel James and his gang of ruffians Admiral van der Kuylen nudged his lordship a humourous twinkle in his blue eyes His bolitics are fery sound I dink he growled His lordship s smile brought lines like gashes into his leathery cheeks Slife hadn t you heard Where the devil have you been at all Out of touch with the world for the last three months said Blood Stab me You must have been And in that three months the world has undergone some changes Briefly he added an account of them King James was fled to France and living under the protection of King Louis wherefore and for other reasons England had joined the league against her and was now at war with France That was how it happened that the Dutch Admiral s flagship had been attacked by M de Rivarol s fleet that morning from which it clearly followed that in his voyage from Cartagena the Frenchman must have spoken some ship that gave him the news After that with renewed assurances that aboard his ship they should be honourably entreated Captain Blood led the Governor General and the Admiral to his cabin what time the work of rescue went on The news he had received had set Blood s mind in a turmoil If King James was dethroned and banished there was an end to his own outlawry for his alleged share in an earlier attempt to drive out that tyrant It became possible for him to return home and take up his life again at the point where it was so unfortunately interrupted four years ago He was dazzled by the prospect so abruptly opened out to him The thing so filled his mind moved him so deeply that he must afford it expression In doing so he revealed of himself more than he knew or intended to the astute little gentleman who watched him so keenly the while Go home if you will said his lordship when Blood paused You may be sure that none will harass you on the score of your piracy considering what it was that drove you to it But why be in haste We have heard of you to be sure and we know of what you are capable upon the seas Here is a great chance for you since you declare yourself sick of piracy Should you choose to serve King William out here during this war your knowledge of the West Indies should render you a very valuable servant to His Majesty s Government which you would not find ungrateful You should consider it Damme sir I repeat it is a great chance you are given That your lordship gives me Blood amended I am very grateful But at the moment I confess I can consider nothing but this great news It alters the shape of the world I must accustom myself to view it as it now is before I can determine my own place in it Pitt came in to report that the work of rescue was at an end and the men picked up some forty five in all safe aboard the two buccaneer ships He asked for orders Blood rose I am negligent of your lordship s concerns in my consideration of my own You ll be wishing me to land you at Port Royal At Port Royal The little man squirmed wrathfully on his seat Wrathfully and at length he informed Blood that they had put into Port Royal last evening to find its Deputy Governor absent He had gone on some wild goose chase to Tortuga after buccaneers taking the whole of the fleet with him Blood stared in surprise a moment then yielded to laughter He went I suppose before news reached him of the change of government at home and the war with France He did not snapped Willoughby He was informed of both and also of my coming before he set out Oh impossible So I should have thought But I have the information from a Major Mallard whom I found in Port Royal apparently governing in this fool s absence But is he mad to leave his post at such a time Blood was amazed Taking the whole fleet with him pray remember and leaving the place open to French attack That is the sort of Deputy Governor that the late Government thought fit to appoint an epitome of its misrule damme He leaves Port Royal unguarded save by a ramshackle fort that can be reduced to rubble in an hour Stab me It s unbelievable The lingering smile faded from Blood s face Is Rivarol aware of this he cried sharply It was the Dutch Admiral who answered him Vould he go dere if he were not M de Rivarol he take some of our men prisoners Berhabs dey dell him Berhabs he make dem tell Id is a great obbordunidy His lordship snarled like a mountain cat That rascal Bishop shall answer for it with his head if there s any mischief done through this desertion of his post What if it were deliberate eh What if he is more knave than fool What if this is his way of serving King James from whom he held his office Captain Blood was generous Hardly so much It was just vindictiveness that urged him It s myself he s hunting at Tortuga my lord But I m thinking that while he s about it I d best be looking after Jamaica for King William He laughed with more mirth than he had used in the last two months Set a course for Port Royal Jeremy and make all speed We ll be level yet with M de Rivarol and wipe off some other scores at the same time Both Lord Willoughby and the Admiral were on their feet But you are not equal to it damme cried his lordship Any one of the Frenchman s three ships is a match for both yours my man In guns aye said Blood and he smiled But there s more than guns that matter in these affairs If your lordship would like to see an action fought at sea as an action should be fought this is your opportunity Both stared at him But the odds his lordship insisted Id is imbossible said van der Kuylen shaking his great head Seamanship is imbordand Bud guns is guns If I can t defeat him I can sink my own ships in the channel and block him in until Bishop gets back from his wild goose chase with his squadron or until your own fleet turns up And what good will that be pray demanded Willoughby I ll be after telling you Rivarol is a fool to take this chance considering what he s got aboard He carried in his hold the treasure plundered from Cartagena amounting to forty million livres They jumped at the mention of that colossal sum He has gone into Port Royal with it Whether he defeats me or not he doesn t come out of Port Royal with it again and sooner or later that treasure shall find its way into King William s coffers after say one fifth share shall have been paid to my buccaneers Is that agreed Lord Willoughby His lordship stood up and shaking back the cloud of lace from his wrist held out a delicate white hand Captain Blood I discover greatness in you said he Sure it s your lordship has the fine sight to perceive it laughed the Captain Yes yes Bud how vill you do id growled van der Kuylen Come on deck and it s a demonstration I ll be giving you before the day s much older CHAPTER XXX THE LAST FIGHT OF THE ARABELLA VHY do you vait my friend growled van der Kuylen Aye in God s name snapped Willoughby It was the afternoon of that same day and the two buccaneer ships rocked gently with idly flapping sails under the lee of the long spit of land forming the great natural harbour of Port Royal and less than a mile from the straits leading into it which the fort commanded It was two hours and more since they had brought up thereabouts having crept thither unobserved by the city and by M de Rivarol s ships and all the time the air had been aquiver with the roar of guns from sea and land announcing that battle was joined between the French and the defenders of Port Royal That long inactive waiting was straining the nerves of both Lord Willoughby and van der Kuylen You said you vould show us zome vine dings Vhere are dese vine dings Blood faced them smiling confidently He was arrayed for battle in back and breast of black steel I ll not be trying your patience much longer Indeed I notice already a slackening in the fire But it s this way now there s nothing at all to be gained by precipitancy and a deal to be gained by delaying as I shall show you I hope Lord Willoughby eyed him suspiciously Ye think that in the meantime Bishop may come back or Admiral van der Kuylen s fleet appear Sure now I m thinking nothing of the kind What I m thinking is that in this engagement with the fort M de Rivarol who s a lubberly fellow as I ve reason to know will be taking some damage that may make the odds a trifle more even Sure it ll be time enough to go forward when the fort has shot its bolt Aye aye The sharp approval came like a cough from the little Governor General I perceive your object and I believe ye re entirely right Ye have the qualities of a great commander Captain Blood I beg your pardon for having misunderstood you And that s very handsome of your lordship Ye see I have some experience of this kind of action and whilst I ll take any risk that I must I ll take none that I needn t But He broke off to listen Aye I was right The fire s slackening It ll mean the end of Mallard s resistance in the fort Ho there Jeremy He leaned on the carved rail and issued orders crisply The bo sun s pipe shrilled out and in a moment the ship that had seemed to slumber there awoke to life Came the padding of feet along the decks the creaking of blocks and the hoisting of sail The helm was put over hard and in a moment they were moving the Elizabeth following ever in obedience to the signals from the Arabella whilst Ogle the gunner whom he had summoned was receiving Blood s final instructions before plunging down to his station on the main deck Within a quarter of an hour they had rounded the head and stood in to the harbour mouth within saker shot of Rivarol s three ships to which they now abruptly disclosed themselves Where the fort had stood they now beheld a smoking rubbish heap and the victorious Frenchman with the lily standard trailing from his mastheads was sweeping forward to snatch the rich prize whose defences he had shattered Blood scanned the French ships and chuckled The Victorieuse and the Medusa appeared to have taken no more than a few scars but the third ship the Baleine listing heavily to larboard so as to keep the great gash in her starboard well above water was out of account You see he cried to van der Kuylen and without waiting for the Dutchman s approving grunt he shouted an order Helm hard a port The sight of that great red ship with her gilt beak head and open ports swinging broadside on must have given check to Rivarol s soaring exultation Yet before he could move to give an order before he could well resolve what order to give a volcano of fire and metal burst upon him from the buccaneers and his decks were swept by the murderous scythe of the broadside The Arabella held to her course giving place to the Elizabeth which following closely executed the same manoeuver And then whilst still the Frenchmen were confused panic stricken by an attack that took them so utterly by surprise the Arabella had gone about and was returning in her tracks presenting now her larboard guns and loosing her second broadside in the wake of the first Came yet another broadside from the Elizabeth and then the Arabella s trumpeter sent a call across the water which Hagthorpe perfectly understood On now Jeremy cried Blood Straight into them before they recover their wits Stand by there Prepare to board Hayton the grapnels And pass the word to the gunner in the prow to fire as fast as he can load He discarded his feathered hat and covered himself with a steel head piece which a negro lad brought him He meant to lead this boarding party in person Briskly he explained himself to his two guests Boarding is our only chance here We are too heavily outgunned Of this the fullest demonstration followed quickly The Frenchmen having recovered their wits at last both ships swung broadside on and concentrating upon the Arabella as the nearer and heavier and therefore more immediately dangerous of their two opponents volleyed upon her jointly at almost the same moment Unlike the buccaneers who had fired high to cripple their enemies above decks the French fifed low to smash the hull of their assailant The Arabella rocked and staggered under that terrific hammering although Pitt kept her headed towards the French so that she should offer the narrowest target For a moment she seemed to hesitate then she plunged forward again her beak head in splinters her forecastle smashed and a gaping hole forward that was only just above the water line Indeed to make her safe from bilging Blood ordered a prompt jettisoning of the forward guns anchors and water casks and whatever else was moveable Meanwhile the Frenchmen going about gave the like reception to the Elizabeth The Arabella indifferently served by the wind pressed forward to come to grips But before she could accomplish her object the Victorieuse had loaded her starboard guns again and pounded her advancing enemy with a second broadside at close quarters Amid the thunder of cannon the rending of timbers and the screams of maimed men the half necked Arabella plunged and reeled into the cloud of smoke that concealed her prey and then from Hayton went up the cry that she was going down by the head Blood s heart stood still And then in that very moment of his despair the blue and gold flank of the Victorieuse loomed through the smoke But even as he caught that enheartening glimpse he perceived too how sluggish now was their advance and how with every second it grew more sluggish They must sink before they reached her Thus with an oath opined the Dutch Admiral and from Lord Willoughby there was a word of blame for Blood s seamanship in having risked all upon this gambler s throw of boarding There was no other chance cried Blood in broken hearted frenzy If ye say it was desperate and foolhardy why so it was but the occasion and the means demanded nothing less I fail within an ace of victory But they had not yet completely failed Hayton himself and a score of sturdy rogues whom his whistle had summoned were crouching for shelter amid the wreckage of the forecastle with grapnels ready Within seven or eight yards of the Victorieuse when their way seemed spent and their forward deck already awash under the eyes of the jeering cheering Frenchmen those men leapt up and forward and hurled their grapnels across the chasm Of the four they flung two reached the Frenchman s decks and fastened there Swift as thought itself was then the action of those sturdy experienced buccaneers Unhesitatingly all threw themselves upon the chain of one of those grapnels neglecting the other and heaved upon it with all their might to warp the ships together Blood watching from his own quarter deck sent out his voice in a clarion call Musketeers to the prow The musketeers at their station at the waist obeyed him with the speed of men who know that in obedience is the only hope of life Fifty of them dashed forward instantly and from the ruins of the forecastle they blazed over the heads of Hayton s men mowing down the French soldiers who unable to dislodge the irons firmly held where they had deeply bitten into the timbers of the Victorieuse were themselves preparing to fire upon the grapnel crew Starboard to starboard the two ships swung against each other with a jarring thud By then Blood was down in the waist judging and acting with the hurricane speed the occasion demanded Sail had been lowered by slashing away the ropes that held the yards The advance guard of boarders a hundred strong was ordered to the poop and his grapnel men were posted and prompt to obey his command at the very moment of impact As a result the foundering Arabella was literally kept afloat by the half dozen grapnels that in an instant moored her firmly to the Victorieuse Willoughby and van der Kuylen on the poop had watched in breathless amazement the speed and precision with which Blood and his desperate crew had gone to work And now he came racing up his bugler sounding the charge the main host of the buccaneers following him whilst the vanguard led by the gunner Ogle who had been driven from his guns by water in the gun deck leapt shouting to the prow of the Victorieuse to whose level the high poop of the water logged Arabella had sunk Led now by Blood himself they launched themselves upon the French like hounds upon the stag they have brought to bay After them went others until all had gone and none but Willoughby and the Dutchman were left to watch the fight from the quarter deck of the abandoned Arabella For fully half an hour that battle raged aboard the Frenchman Beginning in the prow it surged through the forecastle to the waist where it reached a climax of fury The French resisted stubbornly and they had the advantage of numbers to encourage them But for all their stubborn valour they ended by being pressed back and back across the decks that were dangerously canted to starboard by the pull of the water logged Arabella The buccaneers fought with the desperate fury of men who know that retreat is impossible for there was no ship to which they could retreat and here they must prevail and make the Victorieuse their own or perish And their own they made her in the end and at a cost of nearly half their numbers Driven to the quarter deck the surviving defenders urged on by the infuriated Rivarol maintained awhile their desperate resistance But in the end Rivarol went down with a bullet in his head and the French remnant numbering scarcely a score of whole men called for quarter Even then the labours of Blood s men were not at an end The Elizabeth and the Medusa were tight locked and Hagthorpe s followers were being driven back aboard their own ship for the second time Prompt measures were demanded Whilst Pitt and his seamen bore their part with the sails and Ogle went below with a gun crew Blood ordered the grapnels to be loosed at once Lord Willoughby and the Admiral were already aboard the Victorieuse As they swung off to the rescue of Hagthorpe Blood from the quarter deck of the conquered vessel looked his last upon the ship that had served him so well the ship that had become to him almost as a part of himself A moment she rocked after her release then slowly and gradually settled down the water gurgling and eddying about her topmasts all that remained visible to mark the spot where she had met her death As he stood there above the ghastly shambles in the waist of the Victorieuse some one spoke behind him I think Captain Blood that it is necessary I should beg your pardon for the second time Never before have I seen the impossible made possible by resource and valour or victory so gallantly snatched from defeat He turned and presented to Lord Willoughby a formidable front His head piece was gone his breastplate dinted his right sleeve a rag hanging from his shoulder about a naked arm He was splashed from head to foot with blood and there was blood from a scalp wound that he had taken matting his hair and mixing with the grime of powder on his face to render him unrecognizable But from that horrible mask two vivid eyes looked out preternaturally bright and from those eyes two tears had ploughed each a furrow through the filth of his cheeks CHAPTER XXXI HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR When the cost of that victory came to be counted it was found that of three hundred and twenty buccaneers who had left Cartagena with Captain Blood a bare hundred remained sound and whole The Elizabeth had suffered so seriously that it was doubtful if she could ever again be rendered seaworthy and Hagthorpe who had so gallantly commanded her in that last action was dead Against this on the other side of the account stood the facts that with a far inferior force and by sheer skill and desperate valour Blood s buccaneers had saved Jamaica from bombardment and pillage and they had captured the fleet of M de Rivarol and seized for the benefit of King William the splendid treasure which she carried It was not until the evening of the following day that van der Kuylen s truant fleet of nine ships came to anchor in the harbour of Port Royal and its officers Dutch and English were made acquainted with their Admiral s true opinion of their worth Six ships of that fleet were instantly refitted for sea There were other West Indian settlements demanding the visit of inspection of the new Governor General and Lord Willoughby was in haste to sail for the Antilles And meanwhile he complained to his Admiral I am detained here by the absence of this fool of a Deputy Governor So said van der Kuylen But vhy should dad dedam you That I may break the dog as he deserves and appoint his successor in some man gifted with a sense of where his duty lies and with the ability to perform it Aha But id is not necessary you remain for dat And he vill require no insdrucshons dis one He vill know how to make Port Royal safe bedder nor you or me You mean Blood Of gourse Could any man be bedder You haf seen vhad he can do You think so too eh Egad I had thought of it and rip me why not He s a better man than Morgan and Morgan was made Governor Blood was sent for He came spruce and debonair once more having exploited the resources of Port Royal so to render himself He was a trifle dazzled by the honour proposed to him when Lord Willoughby made it known It was so far beyond anything that he had dreamed and he was assailed by doubts of his capacity to undertake so onerous a charge Damme snapped Willoughby Should I offer it unless I were satisfied of your capacity If that s your only objection It is not my lord I had counted upon going home so I had I am hungry for the green lanes of England He sighed There will be apple blossoms in the orchards of Somerset Apple blossoms His lordship s voice shot up like a rocket and cracked on the word What the devil Apple blossoms He looked at van der Kuylen The Admiral raised his brows and pursed his heavy lips His eyes twinkled humourously in his great face So he said Fery boedical My lord wheeled fiercely upon Captain Blood You ve a past score to wipe out my man he admonished him You ve done something towards it I confess and you ve shown your quality in doing it That s why I offer you the governorship of Jamaica in His Majesty s name because I account you the fittest man for the office that I have seen Blood bowed low Your lordship is very good But Tchah There s no but to it If you want your past forgotten and your future assured this is your chance And you are not to treat it lightly on account of apple blossoms or any other damned sentimental nonsense Your duty lies here at least for as long as the war lasts When the war s over you may get back to Somerset and cider or your native Ireland and its potheen but until then you ll make the best of Jamaica and rum Van der Kuylen exploded into laughter But from Blood the pleasantry elicited no smile He remained solemn to the point of glumness His thoughts were on Miss Bishop who was somewhere here in this very house in which they stood but whom he had not seen since his arrival Had she but shown him some compassion And then the rasping voice of Willoughby cut in again upbraiding him for his hesitation pointing out to him his incredible stupidity in trifling with such a golden opportunity as this He stiffened and bowed My lord you are in the right I am a fool But don t be accounting me an ingrate as well If I have hesitated it is because there are considerations with which I will not trouble your lordship Apple blossoms I suppose sniffed his lordship This time Blood laughed but there was still a lingering wistfulness in his eyes It shall be as you wish and very gratefully let me assure your lordship I shall know how to earn His Majesty s approbation You may depend upon my loyal service If I didn t I shouldn t offer you this governorship Thus it was settled Blood s commission was made out and sealed in the presence of Mallard the Commandant and the other officers of the garrison who looked on in round eyed astonishment but kept their thoughts to themselves Now ve can aboud our business go said van der Kuylen We sail to morrow morning his lordship announced Blood was startled And Colonel Bishop he asked He becomes your affair You are now the Governor You will deal with him as you think proper on his return Hang him from his own yardarm He deserves it Isn t the task a trifle invidious wondered Blood Very well I ll leave a letter for him I hope he ll like it Captain Blood took up his duties at once There was much to be done to place Port Royal in a proper state of defence after what had happened there He made an inspection of the ruined fort and issued instructions for the work upon it which was to be started immediately Next he ordered the careening of the three French vessels that they might be rendered seaworthy once more Finally with the sanction of Lord Willoughby he marshalled his buccaneers and surrendered to them one fifth of the captured treasure leaving it to their choice thereafter either to depart or to enrol themselves in the service of King William A score of them elected to remain and amongst these were Jeremy Pitt Ogle and Dyke whose outlawry like Blood s had come to an end with the downfall of King James They were saving old Wolverstone who had been left behind at Cartagena the only survivors of that band of rebels convict who had left Barbados over three years ago in the Cinco Llagas On the following morning whilst van der Kuylen s fleet was making finally ready for sea Blood sat in the spacious whitewashed room that was the Governor s office when Major Mallard brought him word that Bishop s homing squadron was in sight That is very well said Blood I am glad he comes before Lord Willoughby s departure The orders Major are that you place him under arrest the moment he steps ashore Then bring him here to me A moment He wrote a hurried note That to Lord Willoughby aboard Admiral van der Kuylen s flagship Major Mallard saluted and departed Peter Blood sat back in his chair and stared at the ceiling frowning Time moved on Came a tap at the door and an elderly negro slave presented himself Would his excellency receive Miss Bishop His excellency changed colour He sat quite still staring at the negro a moment conscious that his pulses were drumming in a manner wholly unusual to them Then quietly he assented He rose when she entered and if he was not as pale as she was it was because his tan dissembled it For a moment there was silence between them as they stood looking each at the other Then she moved forward and began at last to speak haltingly in an unsteady voice amazing in one usually so calm and deliberate I I Major Mallard has just told me Major Mallard exceeded his duty said Blood and because of the effort he made to steady his voice it sounded harsh and unduly loud He saw her start and stop and instantly made amends You alarm yourself without reason Miss Bishop Whatever may lie between me and your uncle you may be sure that I shall not follow the example he has set me I shall not abuse my position to prosecute a private vengeance On the contrary I shall abuse it to protect him Lord Willoughby s recommendation to me is that I shall treat him without mercy My own intention is to send him back to his plantation in Barbados She came slowly forward now I I am glad that you will do that Glad above all for your own sake She held out her hand to him He considered it critically Then he bowed over it I ll not presume to take it in the hand of a thief and a pirate said he bitterly You are no longer that she said and strove to smile Yet I owe no thanks to you that I am not he answered I think there s no more to be said unless it be to add the assurance that Lord Julian Wade has also nothing to apprehend from me That no doubt will be the assurance that your peace of mind requires For your own sake yes But for your own sake only I would not have you do anything mean or dishonouring Thief and pirate though I be She clenched her hand and made a little gesture of despair and impatience Will you never forgive me those words I m finding it a trifle hard I confess But what does it matter when all is said Her clear hazel eyes considered him a moment wistfully Then she put out her hand again I am going Captain Blood Since you are so generous to my uncle I shall be returning to Barbados with him We are not like to meet again ever Is it impossible that we should part friends Once I wronged you I know And I have said that I am sorry Won t you won t you say good bye He seemed to rouse himself to shake off a mantle of deliberate harshness He took the hand she proffered Retaining it he spoke his eyes sombrely wistfully considering her You are returning to Barbados he said slowly Will Lord Julian be going with you Why do you ask me that she confronted him quite fearlessly Sure now didn t he give you my message or did he bungle it No He didn t bungle it He gave it me in your own words It touched me very deeply It made me see clearly my error and my injustice I owe it to you that I should say this by way of amend I judged too harshly where it was a presumption to judge at all He was still holding her hand And Lord Julian then he asked his eyes watching her bright as sapphires in that copper coloured face Lord Julian will no doubt be going home to England There is nothing more for him to do out here But didn t he ask you to go with him He did I forgive you the impertinence A wild hope leapt to life within him And you Glory be ye ll not be telling me ye refused to become my lady when Oh You are insufferable She tore her hand free and backed away from him I should not have come Good bye She was speeding to the door He sprang after her and caught her Her face flamed and her eyes stabbed him like daggers These are pirate s ways I think Release me Arabella he cried on a note of pleading Are ye meaning it Must I release ye Must I let ye go and never set eyes on ye again Or will ye stay and make this exile endurable until we can go home together Och ye re crying now What have I said to make ye cry my dear I I thought you d never say it she mocked him through her tears Well now ye see there was Lord Julian a fine figure of a There was never never anybody but you Peter They had of course a deal to say thereafter so much indeed that they sat down to say it whilst time sped on and Governor Blood forgot the duties of his office He had reached home at last His odyssey was ended And meanwhile Colonel Bishop s fleet had come to anchor and the Colonel had landed on the mole a disgruntled man to be disgruntled further yet He was accompanied ashore by Lord Julian Wade A corporal s guard was drawn up to receive him and in advance of this stood Major Mallard and two others who were unknown to the Deputy Governor one slight and elegant the other big and brawny Major Mallard advanced Colonel Bishop I have orders to arrest you Your sword sir By order of the Governor of Jamaica said the elegant little man behind Major Mallard Bishop swung to him The Governor Ye re mad He looked from one to the other I am the Governor You were said the little man dryly But we ve changed that in your absence You re broke for abandoning your post without due cause and thereby imperiling the settlement over which you had charge It s a serious matter Colonel Bishop as you may find Considering that you held your office from the Government of King James it is even possible that a charge of treason might lie against you It rests with your successor entirely whether ye re hanged or not Bishop rapped out an oath and then shaken by a sudden fear Who the devil may you be he asked I am Lord Willoughby Governor General of His Majesty s colonies in the West Indies You were informed I think of my coming The remains of Bishop s anger fell from him like a cloak He broke into a sweat of fear Behind him Lord Julian looked on his handsome face suddenly white and drawn But my lord began the Colonel Sir I am not concerned to hear your reasons his lordship interrupted him harshly I am on the point of sailing and I have not the time The Governor will hear you and no doubt deal justly by you He waved to Major Mallard and Bishop a crumpled broken man allowed himself to be led away To Lord Julian who went with him since none deterred him Bishop expressed himself when presently he had sufficiently recovered This is one more item to the account of that scoundrel Blood he said through his teeth My God what a reckoning there will be when we meet Major Mallard turned away his face that he might conceal his smile and without further words led him a prisoner to the Governor s house the house that so long had been Colonel Bishop s own residence He was left to wait under guard in the hall whilst Major Mallard went ahead to announce him Miss Bishop was still with Peter Blood when Major Mallard entered His announcement startled them back to realities You will be merciful with him You will spare him all you can for my sake Peter she pleaded To be sure I will said Blood But I m afraid the circumstances won t She effaced herself escaping into the garden and Major Mallard fetched the Colonel His excellency the Governor will see you now said he and threw wide the door Colonel Bishop staggered in and stood waiting At the table sat a man of whom nothing was visible but the top of a carefully curled black head Then this head was raised and a pair of blue eyes solemnly regarded the prisoner Colonel Bishop made a noise in his throat and paralyzed by amazement stared into the face of his excellency the Deputy Governor of Jamaica which was the face of the man he had been hunting in Tortuga to his present undoing The situation was best expressed to Lord Willoughby by van der Kuylen as the pair stepped aboard the Admiral s flagship Id is fery boedigal he said his blue eyes twinkling Cabdain Blood is fond of boedry you remember de abble blossoms So Ha ha End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK
