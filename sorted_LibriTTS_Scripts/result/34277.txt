forehead into a thoughtful frown as she drew aside the window curtains of her boudoir and tried to look out into the opaque blackness of a November fog in London Behind her was cheerfulness in front uncertainty Electric lights a nice fire reflected from gleaming brass the luxury of carpets and upholstery formed an alluring contrast to the dull yellow glare of a solitary lamp in the outer obscurity But Lady Dyke was a strong minded woman There was no trace of doubt in the wrinkled brows and reflective eyes She held back the curtains with her left hand buttoning a glove at the wrist with the other Fog or no fog she would venture forth and she was already dressed for the weather in tailor made costume and winter toque She was annoyed but not disconcerted by the fog Too long had she allowed herself to take things easily The future was as murky as the atmosphere the past was dramatically typified by the pleasant surroundings on which she resolutely turned her back Lady Dyke was quite determined as to her actions and a dull November night was a most unlikely agent to restrain her from following the course she had mapped out Moving to the light again she took from her pocket a long closely written letter Its details were familiar to her but her face hardened as she hastily ran through it in order to find a particular passage At last she gained her object to make quite sure of an address Then she replaced the document stood undecided for a moment and touched an electric bell James she said to the answering footman I am going out Yes milady Sir Charles is not at home No milady I am going to Richmond to see missus Talbot I shall probably not return in time for dinner Tell Sir Charles not to wait for me Shall I order the carriage for your ladyship Will you listen to me and remember what I have said Yes milady James ran downstairs opened the door bowed as Lady Dyke passed into Portman Square and then confidentially informed Buttons that the missus was in a rare old wax about something She nearly jumped down my bloomin throat when I asked her if she would have the carriage he said Her ladyship s mood did not soften when she drifted from the fixed tenure of Wensley House Portman Square into the chaos of Oxford Street and fog at five point thirty on a November evening Though not a true London particular the fog was chilly exasperating tedious People bumped against each other without apology buses crunched through the traffic with deadly precision pair horse vans swept around corners with magnificent carelessness In the result Lady Dyke who meant to walk as she was somewhat in advance of the time she had fixed on for this very important engagement took a hansom In her present mood slight things annoyed her Usually the London cab horse is a thoughtful animal he refuses to hurry when he falls he lies contented secure in the knowledge that for five blissful minutes he will be at complete rest But this misguided quadruped flew as though oats and meadow grass awaited him at Victoria Station on the Underground Railway He raced down Park Lane skidded past Hyde Park Corner and grated the off wheel of the hansom against the kerb outside the station within eight minutes In other words her ladyship if she would obey the directions contained in the voluminous letter was compelled to kill time As she stepped from the vehicle and halted beneath a lamp to take a florin from her purse a tall ulster wrapped gentleman walking rapidly into Victoria Street caught a glimpse of her face and well proportioned form Instantly his hat was off This is an unexpected pleasure Lady Dyke Can I be of any service She bit her lip not unobserved but the law of Society forced her features into a bright smile Oh mister Bruce is it you I am going to see my sister at Richmond Isn t the weather horrid I shall be so glad if you will put me into the right train mister Claude Bruce barrister and man about town whose clean cut features and dark deep set eyes made him as readily recognizable knew that she would have been much better pleased had he passed without greeting Like the footman he wondered why she did not drive in her carriage rather than travel by the Underground Railway on such a night He guessed that she was perturbed that her voluble explanation was a disguise He reflected that he could ill afford any delay in dressing for a distant dinner that good manners oft entail inconvenience but of course he said Delighted Have you any wraps No I am just going for a chat and shall be home early He bought her a first class ticket noting as an odd coincidence that it bore the number of the year nineteen oh three descended to the barrier found that the next train for Richmond passed through in ten minutes fumed inwardly for an instant explained his presence to the ticket collector and paced the platform with his companion Having condemned the fog and the last play and the latest book they were momentarily silent The newspaper placards on Smith Son s bookstall announced that a Great Society Scandal was on the tapis The Duke in the Box formed a telling line and the eyes of both people chanced on it simultaneously Thought the woman He is a man of the world and an experienced lawyer Shall I tell him Thought the man She wants to take me into her confidence and I am too busy to be worried by some small family squabble Said she Are you much occupied at the Courts just now mister Bruce No he replied not exactly My practice is more consultive than active Many people seek my advice about matters of little interest never thinking that they would best serve their ends by acting decisively and promptly themselves Lady Dyke set her lips She could be both prompt and decisive She resolved to keep her troubles whatever they were locked in the secrecy of her own heart and when she next spoke of some trivial topic the barrister knew that he had been spared a recital He regretted it afterwards At any other moment in his full and useful life he would have encouraged her rather than the reverse Even now a few seconds too late he was sorry He strove to bring her back to the verge of explanations but failed for her ladyship was a proud self reliant personage one who would never dream of risking a rebuff A train came with Richmond staring at them from the smoke and steam of the engine Good bye he said Good bye Shall I see you again soon I fear not It is probable that I shall leave for the South of France quite early And she was gone Her companion rushed to the street and almost ran to his Victoria Street chambers It was six o clock He had to dress and drive all the way to Hampstead for dinner at seven point thirty At ten minutes past nine Sir Charles Dyke entered Wensley House A handsome quiet gentlemanly man was Sir Charles He was rich a Guardsman until the baronetcy devolved upon him a popular figure in Society esteemed a trifle fast prior to his marriage but sobered down by the cares of a great estate and a vast fortune His wife and he were not well matched in disposition She was too earnest too prim for the easy going baronet He respected her that was all A man of his nature found it impossible to realize that the depths of passion are frequently coated over with ice Their union was irreproachable like their marriage settlements but there are more features in matrimony than can be disposed of by broad seals and legal phrases Unfortunately they were childless and were thus deprived of the one great bond which unites when others may fail Sir Charles was hurried if not flurried His boots were muddy and his clothes splashed by the mire of passing vehicles I fear I am very late for dinner he said to the footman who took his hat and overcoat But I shall not be five minutes in dressing Tell her ladyship Milady is not at home Sir Charles Not at home Milady went out at half past five saying that she was going to Richmond to see Lady Edith Talbot and that you were not to wait dinner if she was late in returning Sir Charles was surprised He looked steadily at the man as he said Are you quite sure of her ladyship s orders Quite sure Sir Charles Did she drive No Sir Charles She would not order the carriage when I suggested it The baronet somewhat perplexed hesitated a moment Then he appeared to dismiss the matter as hardly worth discussion saying as he went up stairs Dinner almost immediately James During the solitary meal he was preoccupied but ate more than usual in the butler s judgment Finding his own company distasteful he discussed the November Handicap with the butler and ultimately sent for an evening paper Opening it the first words that caught his eye were Murder in the West End He read the paragraph the record of some tragic orgy and turned to the butler A lot of these beastly crimes have occurred recently Thompson Yes Sir Charles There s bin three since the beginning of the month After a pause Did you hear that her ladyship had gone to Richmond Yes Sir Charles Do you know how she went No Sir Charles I wanted to see her to night very particularly Order the brougham in ten minutes I am going to the Travellers Club I shall be home soon say eleven o clock when her ladyship arrives The baronet was driven to and from the club by his own coachman but on returning to Wensley House was told that his wife was still absent No telegram or message No Sir Charles I suppose she will stay with her sister all night and I shall have a note in the morning to say so Just like a woman Now if I did that James there would be no end of a row Anxiety and that sort of thing Call me at eight point thirty An hour later Sir Charles Dyke left the library and went to bed At breakfast next morning the master of the house rapidly scanned the letters near his plate for the expected missive from his wife There was none A maid was waiting He sent her to call the butler Look here Thompson he cried her ladyship has not written Don t you think I had better wire It s curious to say the least going off to Richmond in this fashion in a beastly fog too Thompson was puzzled He had examined the letters an hour earlier But he agreed that a telegram was the thing Sir Charles wrote Expected to hear from you Will you be home to lunch Want to see you about some hunters and addressed it to his wife at her sister s residence There he said turning to his coffee and sole That will fetch her We are off to Leicestershire next week Thompson By the way I am going to a sale at Tattersall s Send a groom there with her ladyship s answer when it comes He had not been long at the sale yard when a servant arrived with a telegram Ah the post office people are quick this morning he said smiling He opened the envelope and read Want to see you at once DICK He was so surprised by the unexpected nature of the message that he read the words aloud mechanically But he soon understood and smiled again Go back quickly he said to the man and tell Thompson to send along the next telegram A consignment of Waterford hunters was being sold at the time and the baronet was checking the animals descriptions on the catalogue when he was cheerily addressed Hallo Dyke preparing for the shires eh Wheeling round the baronet shook hands with Claude Bruce Yes that is I am looking out for a couple of nice mannered ones for my wife I have six eating their heads off at Market Harborough now Bruce hesitated Will Lady Dyke hunt this season he asked Well hardly that But she likes to dodge about the lanes with the parson and the doctor I only inquired because she told me last night that she would probably winter in the South of France Told you last night South of France Sir Charles Dyke positively gasped in his amazement Why yes I met her at Victoria She was going to Richmond to see her sister she said I am jolly glad to hear it Glad Why Because I have not seen her myself since yesterday morning She went off mysteriously late in the afternoon leaving a message with the servants Naturally I am glad to hear from you that she got into the train all right I put her in the carriage myself Have you not heard from her No I wired this morning and expect an answer at any moment But what is this about the South of France We go to Leicestershire next week I can t say of course Your wife seemed to be a little upset about something She only mentioned her intention casually in fact when I asked if we would meet soon The other laughed a little oddly in the opinion of his astute observer and dismissed the matter by the remark that the expected message from his wife would soon clear the slight mystery attending her movements during the past eighteen hours The two men set themselves to the congenial task of criticizing the horses trotting up and down the straw covered track and Sir Charles had purchased a nice half bred animal for forty guineas when his groom again saluted him Please sir said the man here s another telegram and Thompson told me to ask if it was the right one Sir Charles frowned at the interruption a second horse of a suitable character was even then under the hammer but he tore open the envelope At once his agitation became so marked that Bruce cried Good heavens Dyke what is it No bad news I hope The other by a strong effort regained his self control No no he stammered it is all right all right She has gone somewhere else See This is from her sister missus Talbot Still I wish Alice would consider my natural anxiety a little Bruce read I opened your message Alice not here I have not seen her for over a week What do you mean by wire Am coming to town at once EDITH The baronet s pale face and strained voice betrayed the significance of the thought underlying the simple question What do you make of it Claude Bruce too was very grave The thing looks queer he said though the explanation may be trifling Come I will help you Let us reach your house It is the natural centre for inquiries They hailed a hansom and whirled off to Portman Square They did not say much Each man felt that the affair might not end so happily and satisfactorily as he hoped CHAPTER II INSPECTOR WHITE Lady Dyke had disappeared Whether dead or alive and if alive whether detained by force or absent of her own unfettered volition this handsome and well known leader of Society had vanished utterly from the moment when Claude Bruce placed her in a first class carriage of a Metropolitan Richmond train at Victoria Station At first her husband and relatives hoped against hope that some extraordinary tissue of events had contributed to the building up of a mystery which would prove to be no mystery Yet the days fled and there was no trace of her whereabouts At the outset the inquiry was confined to the circle of friends and relatives Telegrams and letters in every possible direction suggested by this comparatively restricted field showed conclusively that not only had Lady Dyke not been seen but no one had the slightest clue to the motives which might induce her to leave her home purposely So far as her distracted husband could ascertain she did not owe a penny in the world She was a rich woman in her own right and her banking account was in perfect order She was a woman of the domestic temperament always in close touch with her family and those who knew her best scouted the notion of any petty intrigue which would move her by fear or passion to abandon all she held dear The stricken baronet confided the search only to his friend Bruce He brokenly admitted that he had not sufficiently appreciated his wife while she was with him She was of a superior order to me Claude he said I am hardly a home bird Her ideals were lofty and humanitarian Too often I was out of sympathy with her and laughed at her notions But believe me we never had the shadow of a serious dispute Perhaps I went my own way a little selfishly but at the time I thought that she on her part was somewhat straight laced I appreciate her merits when it is too late But you must not assume even yet that she is dead The barrister was certain that some day the mystery would be elucidated She is I feel that I shall never see her on earth again Oh nonsense Dyke Far more remarkable occurrences have been satisfactorily cleared up It is very good of you old chap to take this cheering view Only you see I know my wife s character so well She would die a hundred times if it were possible rather than cause the misery to her people and myself which if living she knows must ensue from this terrible uncertainty as to her fate Scotland Yard is still sanguine This good natured friend was evidently making a conversation Oh naturally But something tells me that my wife is dead whether by accident or design it is impossible to say The police will cling to the belief that she is in hiding in order to conceal their own inability to find her A highly probable theory Are your servants to be trusted Y es They have all been with us some years Why do you ask Because I am anxious that nothing of this should get into the papers I have caused paragraphs to be inserted in the fashionable intelligence columns that Lady Dyke has gone to visit some friends in the Midlands For her own sake if she be living it is best to choke scandal at its source Well Bruce I leave everything to you Make such arrangements as you think fit The barrister s mobile face softened with pity as he looked at his afflicted friend In four days Sir Charles Dyke had aged many years in appearance No one who was acquainted with him in the past would have imagined that the loss of his wife could so affect him I have done all that was possible yet it is very little said Bruce after a pause You are aware that I am supposed to be an adept at solving curious or criminal investigations of an unusual class But in this case partly I suspect because I myself am the last person who to our common knowledge saw Lady Dyke alive on Tuesday night I am faced by a dead wall of impenetrable fact through which my intellect cannot pierce Yet I am sure that some day this wretched business will be intelligible I will find her if living I will find her murderer if she be dead Not often did Claude Bruce allow his words to so betray his thoughts Both men were absorbed by the thrilling sensations of the moment and they were positively startled when a servant suddenly announced Inspector White of Scotland Yard A short thick set man entered He was absolutely round in every part His sturdy rotund frame was supported on stout well moulded legs His bullet head with close cropped hair gave a suggestion of strength to his rounded face and a pair of small bright eyes looked suspiciously on the world from beneath well arched eyebrows Two personalities more dissimilar than those of Claude Bruce and Inspector White could hardly be brought together in the same room People who are fond of tracing resemblances to animals in human beings would liken the one to a grey hound the other to a bull dog Yet they were both masters in the art of detecting crime the barrister subtle analytic introspective the policeman direct pertinacious self confident Bruce lost all interest in a case when the hidden trail was laid bare mister White regarded investigation as so many hours on duty until his man was transported or hanged The detective was well acquainted with his unprofessional colleague and had already met Sir Charles in the early stages of his present quest I have an important clue he said smiling with assurance What is it The baronet was for the moment aroused from his despondent lethargy Her ladyship did not go to Richmond on Tuesday night Inspector White did not wait for Bruce to speak but the barrister nodded with the air of one who knew already that Lady Dyke had not gone to Richmond mister White continued Thanks to mister Bruce s remembrance of the number of the ticket we traced it at once in the clearing office It was given up at Sloan Square immediately after the Richmond train passed through Bruce nodded again He was obstinately silent so the detective questioned him directly By this means the inquiry is narrowed to a locality Eh mister Bruce Yes said the barrister turning to poke the fire mister White was sure that his acuteness was displeasing to his clever rival He smiled complacently and went on The ticket collector remembers her quite well as the giving up of a Richmond ticket was unusual at this station She passed straight out into the square and from that point we lost sight of her You do mister White said Bruce Well sir it is a great thing to have localized her movements at that hour isn t it Yes it is To save time I may tell you that Lady Dyke returned to the station entered the refreshment room ordered a glass of wine which she hardly touched sat down and waited some fifteen minutes Then she quitted the room crossed the square asked a news vendor where Raleigh Mansions were and gave him sixpence for the information His hearers were astounded Heavens Claude how did you learn all this cried the baronet Thus far it was simplicity itself On Wednesday evening when no news could be obtained from your relatives I started from Victoria intending to call at every station until I found the place where she left the train The railway clearing officer was too slow mister White Naturally the hours being identical in the same week the first ticket collector I spoke to gave me the desired clue The rest was a mere matter of steady inquiry Then you are the man whom the police are now searching for blurted out the detective From the railway official s description Possibly Pray mister White let me see the details of my appearance as circulated through the force It would be interesting The inspector was saved from further indiscretions by Sir Charles Dyke s plaintive question Why did you not tell me these things sooner Claude What good was there in torturing you All that I have ascertained is the A B C of our search We are at a loss for the motive of your wife s disappearance Victoria Sloane Square or Richmond does it matter which My belief is that she intended to go to Richmond that night Why otherwise should she make to the footman and myself the same unvarying statement Perhaps she did go there But these houses Raleigh Mansions What of them Ah there we may be forwarded a stage But there are six main entrances and no hall porters There are twelve flats at each number seventy two in all and all occupied That means seventy two separate inquiries into the history and attributes of a vastly larger number of persons in order to find some possible connection with Lady Dyke and her purposely concealed visit She may have remained in one of those flats five minutes She may be in one of them yet Anyhow I have taken the necessary steps to obtain the fullest knowledge of the inhabitants of Raleigh Mansions Scotland Yard appears to be an unnecessary institution mister Bruce snapped the detective By no means It is most useful to me once I have discovered a criminal And it amuses me Listen Claude and you mister White pleaded the baronet I implore you to keep me informed in future of developments in your search The knowledge that progress is being made will sustain me Promise I ask you I promise readily enough answered Bruce I only stipulate that you prepare yourself for many disappointments Even a highly skilled detective like Inspector White will admit that the failures are more frequent than the successes True enough sir But I must be going gentlemen mister White was determined to work the new vein of Raleigh Mansions thoroughly before even his superiors were aware of its significance in the hunt for her lost ladyship When the detective went out there was silence for some time Dyke was the first to speak Have you formed any sort of theory even a wildly speculative one he asked No none whatever The utter absence of motive is the most puzzling element of the whole situation Whom can my wife have known at Raleigh Mansions What sort of places are they Quite fashionable but not too expensive The absence of elevators and doorkeepers cheapens them I am sorry now that I mentioned them to White Why He will disturb every one of the residents by injudicious inquiries Each housemaid who opens a door will be to him a suspicious individual each butcher s boy an accomplice each tenant a principal in the abduction of your wife If I have a theory of any sort it is that the first reliable news will come from Richmond There cannot be the slightest doubt that she was going there on Tuesday night It will be very odd if you should prove to be right said Sir Charles Again they were interrupted by the footman this time the bearer of a telegram which he handed to his master The latter opened it and read What is the matter Are you ill I certainly am angry DICK He frowned with real annoyance crumpling up the message and throwing it in the fire People bothering one at such a time he growled Soon afterwards Bruce left him True to the barrister s prophecy Inspector White made life miserable to the denizens of Raleigh Mansions He visited them at all hours and in some instances several times Although in accordance with his instructions he never mentioned Lady Dyke s name he so pestered the occupants with questions concerning a lady of her general appearance that half a dozen residents wrote complaining letters to the company which owned the mansions and the secretary lodged a protest at Scotland Yard Respectable citizens object to detectives prowling about particularly when they insinuate questions concerning indefinite ladies in tailor made dresses and fur toques At the end of a week mister White was nonplussed and even Claude Bruce confessed that his more carefully conducted inquiries had yielded no result Towards the end of the month a sensational turn was given to events The body of a woman terribly disfigured from long immersion in the water and other causes was found in the Thames at Putney It had been discovered under peculiar circumstances A drain pipe emptying into the river beneath the surface was moved by reason of some sanitary alterations and the workmen intrusted with the task were horrified at finding a corpse tightly wedged beneath it Official examination revealed that although the body had been in the water fully three weeks the cause of death was not drowning The woman had been murdered beyond a shadow of a doubt A sharp iron spike was driven into her brain with such force that a portion of it had broken off and remained imbedded in the skull If this were not sufficient there were other convincing proofs of foul play Although her skirt and coat were of poor quality her linen was of a class that could only be worn by some one who paid as much for a single under garment as most women do for a good costume but there were no laundry marks such as usual upon it On the feet were a pair of strong walking boots bearing the stamped address of a fashionable boot maker in the West End Among a list of customers to whom the tradesman supplied footgear of this size and character appeared the name of Lady Dyke Not very convincing testimony but sufficient to bring Sir Charles to the Putney mortuary in the endeavor to identify the remains as those of his missing wife In this he utterly failed Not only was this poor misshapen lump of distorted humanity wholly unlike Lady Alice but the color of her hair was different Her ladyship s maid called to identify the linen even the police admitted the outer clothes were not Lady Dyke s was so upset at the repulsive nature of her task that she went into hysterics protesting loudly that it could not be her mistress she was looking at Bruce differed from both of them He quietly urged Sir Charles to consider the fact that a great many ladies give a helping hand to Nature in the matter of hair tints The chemical action of water would The baronet nearly lost his temper Really Bruce you carry your theories too far he cried My wife had none of these vanities I am sure this is not she The mere thought that such a thing could be possible makes me ill Let us get away quick So a coroner s jury found an open verdict and the poor unknown was buried in a pauper s grave The newspapers dismissed the incident with a couple of paragraphs though the iron spike planted in the skull afforded good material for a telling headline and within a couple of days the affair was forgotten But Claude Bruce barrister and amateur detective was quite sure in his own mind that the nameless woman was Alice Lady Dyke He was so certain though identification of the body was impossible that he bitterly resented the scant attention given the matter by the authorities and he swore solemnly that he would not rest until he had discovered her destroyer and brought the wretch to the bar of justice CHAPTER III THE LADY S MAID The first difficulty experienced by the barrister in his self imposed task was the element of mystery purposely contributed by Lady Dyke herself To a man of his quick perception sharpened and clarified by his legal training it was easy to arrive at the positive facts underlying the trivial incidents of his meeting with the missing lady at Victoria Station Briefly stated his summary was this Lady Dyke intended to go to Richmond at a later hour than that at which his unexpected presence had caused her to set out She had resolved upon a secret visit to some one who lived in Raleigh Mansions Sloane Square some person whom she knew so slightly as to be unacquainted with the exact address and as the result of this visit she desired subsequently to see her sister at Richmond Sir Charles Dyke was apparently in no way concerned with her movements nor had she thought fit to consult him beyond the mere politeness of announcing her probable absence from home at the dinner hour To one of Bruce s analytical powers the problem would be more simple were it in a popular sense more complex In these days it is a strange thing for a woman of assured position in society to be suddenly spirited out of the world without leaving trace or sign He approached his inquiry with less certainty owing to Lady Dyke s own negative admissions than if she had been swallowed up by an earthquake and he were asked to determine her fate by inference and deduction It must be remembered that he was sure she was dead murdered and that her body had been lodged by human agents beneath an old drain pipe at Putney What possible motive could any one have in so foully killing a beautiful high minded and charming woman whose whole life was known to her associates whom the breath of scandal had never touched The key of the mystery might be found at Raleigh Mansions but Bruce decided that this branch of his quest could wait until other transient features were cleared up He practically opened the campaign of investigation at Putney Mild weather had permitted the workmen to conclude their operations the day before the barrister reached the spot where the body had been found that is to say some forty eight hours after he had resolved neither to pause nor deviate in his search until the truth was laid bare A large house untenanted occupied the bank a house with solid front facing the road and a lawn running from the drawing room windows to the river Down the right side of the grounds the boundary was sharply marked by a narrow lane probably a disused ferry road and access to this thoroughfare was obtained from the lawn by a garden gate A newly marked seam in the roadway showed the line of the drainage work and Bruce did not glance at the point where the pipe entered the Thames as the structural features here were recent He went to the office of the contractor who had carried out the alterations An elderly foreman readily answered his questions Yes sir I was in charge of the men who were on the job It was an easy business Just an outlet for rain from the road An old fashioned affair been there thirty or forty years I should think all the pipes were crumbling away Why were the repairs effected at this moment Well sir the house was empty quite a while You see it used to be a school a place where young gents were prepared for the army It was closed about a year ago and it isn t everybody as wants so many bedrooms I do hear as how the new tenant has sixteen children The incoming people have not yet arrived No sir Can you tell me the name of the schoolmaster Oh yes When I was younger I have done a lot of carpenter s work for him He was the Reverend Septimus Childe Bruce made a note of the name and next sought the local police inspector No nothing fresh said the latter in reply to a query concerning the woman found drowned I suppose these things are soon lost sight of said Bruce casually Sometimes they are and sometimes they aren t It s wonderful occasionally how a matter gets cleared up after years Of course we keep all the records of a case so that the affair can be looked into if anything turns up Ah that brings me to the most important object of my visit A small piece of iron was found imbedded in the woman s skull The inspector smiled as he admitted the fact May I see it I want either the loan of it for a brief period or an exact model Again the policeman grinned I don t mind telling you that you are too late sir Too late How too late It s been gone to Scotland Yard for the best part of a week So others besides the barrister thought that the Putney incident required more attention than had been bestowed upon it Bruce concluded his round by a visit to the surgeon who gave evidence at the inquest The doctor had no manner of doubt that the woman had been murdered before being placed in the water the state of the lungs being proof positive on that point It was equally indisputable that she was put to death by malice aforethought Oh yes A small iron spike was absolutely wedged into the brain through the hardest part of the skull What was the nature of the injuries that caused death This piece of iron penetrated the occipital bone at the lowest part and injured the cerebellum damaging all the great nerve centres at the base of the brain Would death ensue instantly Yes Such a blow would have the effect of a high voltage electric current Complete paralysis of the nerve centres means death Then I take it that great force must have been used Not so much perhaps as the nature of the wound seems to imply but considerable sufficient at any rate to break the piece of iron It was broken you say Was it cast iron Yes of good quality Off some ornament or design I should imagine But it snapped off inside the head at the moment of the occurrence Curious is it not for a person to be killed in such a manner by such an instrument I have never before met such a case Were it not for the way in which the body was jammed beneath a hidden drain pipe and the effective means taken to destroy the identity I should have inclined to the belief that some strange accident had happened At any rate the murderer must have committed the crime on the spur of the moment and seized upon the first weapon to hand You say she was forcibly placed where found Yes the workmen s description left no other idea Could not the tide have done this Hardly One cannot be quite emphatic as such odd things do happen But it seems to be almost impossible for the tide at Putney to pack a body beneath a jutting drain pipe in such a manner that the waist or narrowest part should be beneath the pipe and the body remain securely held Yet it is not so marvellous as the coincidence that this particular drain should need repairs at the precise period when this tragedy happened Quite so It is exceedingly strange Are you interested in the case Have you reason to believe that this poor woman I hardly know broke in the barrister I have no data to go upon but I feel convinced that I shall ultimately establish her identity You doctor can help me much by telling me your surmises in addition to the known facts The medico looked thoughtfully through the window before he exclaimed I am certain that the woman found in the Thames came from the upper walks of life Notwithstanding the disfiguring effects of the water and rough usage any medical man can rapidly appreciate the caste of his subject She was I should say a woman of wealth and refinement one who led an orderly well regulated life whose surroundings were normal and healthy Bruce thanked his informant and hurried back to London A telegram to Inspector White preceded him He had not long reached his Victoria street chambers when the detective was announced He soon made known his wishes I want you to give me that small piece of iron found in the head of the woman at Putney he said If necessary I will return it in twenty four hours mister White s face showed some little sign of annoyance It is against the rules he began but Bruce curtly interrupted him Very well I will make direct application to the Commissioner I was going to say mister Bruce that although not strictly in accordance with orders I will make an exception in your case And the detective slowly produced the piece de conviction from a large pocket book In sober fact the police officer was somewhat jealous of the clever lawyer who saw so quickly through complexities that puzzled his slower brain He was in nowise anxious to help the barrister in his inquiries though keenly wishful to benefit by his discoveries and follow out his theories when they were defined with sufficient clearness Bruce did not at first take the proffered article Let me understand mister White he said Do you object to my presence in this inquiry Are you going to hinder me or help me It will save much future misunderstanding if we have this point settled now The detective flushed at this direct inquiry I will be candid with you mister Bruce It is true I have been vexed at times when you have overreached me but I regret it immediately It is foolish of me to try and solve problems by your methods Kindly forget my momentary disinclination to hand over the only genuine link in the case In what case In the case of Lady Dyke s disappearance Ah Then you think it is in some way connected with the woman found at Putney I am sure of it The woman at Putney whether Lady Dyke herself or not I cannot tell wore some of her ladyship s clothes When we have ascertained the means and the manner of the death of the woman buried at Putney we shall not be far from learning what has become of Lady Dyke How have you identified the clothes I managed to gain the confidence of the lady s maid who gave evidence at the inquest She of course is quite positive that the body was not that of her mistress but when I had examined some of Lady Dyke s linen I no longer doubted the fact If you knew all this how comes it that more did not transpire at the coroner s inquiry In such affairs an inquest is rather a hindrance to the police It is better to lull the guilty person or persons into the belief that the crime has passed into oblivion They know as well as we do that Lady Dyke is buried at Putney We have failed to establish her identity by the evidence of the husband and servants The linen and clothes our sole effective testimony remain in our possession so taking everything into consideration I prefer that matters should remain as they are for the present Really mister White I congratulate you You will perhaps pardon me for saying that some of your colleagues do not usually take so sensible a view The policeman smiled at the compliment I am learning your method mister Bruce he said As he spoke Smith entered with a note endorsed Urgent It was in the handwriting of Sir Charles Dyke and even the imperturbable barrister could not resist an exclamation of amazement when he read MY DEAR BRUCE My wife s maid has vanished She has not been near the house for three days The thing came to my ears owing to gossip amongst the servants There is something maddening about these occurrences I really cannot stand any more Do come to see me there s a good fellow Well I m jiggered said the detective The blessed girl must have been spirited away a few hours after I saw her Maybe mister Bruce we are all wrong Has she gone to join her mistress Possibly in the next world Nothing would shake the barrister s belief that Alice Lady Dyke was dead CHAPTER IV NO sixty one RALEIGH MANSIONS Really the maid deserved to have her ears pulled People in her walk in life should not ape their betters Lady Dyke owing to her position was entitled to some degree of oddity or mystery in her behavior But for a lady s maid to so upset the entire household at Wensley House Portman Square was intolerable Sir Charles became if possible more miserable the butler fumed the housekeeper said that the girl was always a forward minx and the footman winked at Buttons as much as to say that he knew a good deal if he liked to talk The police were as greatly baffled by this latter incident as by its predecessor The movements of the maid were quite unknown No one could tell definitely when she left the house Her fellow servants described the dress she probably wore as all her other belongings were in her bedroom but beyond the fact that her name was Jane Harding and that she had not returned to her home in Lincolnshire the police could find no further clue So in brief Jane Harding quickly joined Lady Dyke in the limbo of forgetfulness Bruce however forgot nothing Indeed he rejoiced at this new development The greater the apparent mystery he communed the less it is in reality We now have two tracks to follow They are both hidden it is true but when we find one it will probably intersect the other The new year was a few days old when Bruce made his first step through the bewildering maze which seemed to bar progress on every side He received a report from the man a pensioned police officer who had conducted a painstaking search into the history and occupation of every inhabitant of Raleigh Mansions Two items the barrister fastened on to at once At No twelve top floor right entrance by first door on Sloane Square side is a small flat occupied by a man named Sydney H Corbett He passes as an American but is probably an Englishman who has resided in the United States He does not mix with other Americans in London and is of irregular habits He frequents race meetings and sporting clubs is reported to belong to a Piccadilly club where high play is the rule and has no definite occupation He occasionally visits a lady who lives at No sixty one same mansions ground floor and sixth door They have been heard to quarrel seriously and the dispute appears always to have concerned money Corbett went to Monte Carlo early in December His address there is Hotel du Cercle and the local post office has a supply of stamped and addressed envelopes in which to forward his correspondence At No sixty one as already described resides missus Gwendoline Hillmer She lives in good style rents a brougham and a victoria and is either a wealthy widow or maintained by some one of means She dresses well and goes out a good deal to theatres but otherwise leads a rather lonely life Her most frequent visitor is or was a gentleman who looked like an officer in the Guards and much less often the aforesaid Sydney H Corbett Her servants except the maid live out The maid who is a sort of companion is talkative but does not know much or if she does will not speak Bruce weighed these statements very carefully They did not contain any positive facts that promised well for the elucidation of Lady Dyke s visit to the mansions on that fateful November evening but the absolute colorlessness of the reports concerning the other occupants rendered them quite impossible of individual distinction After an hour of puzzled thought the barrister finally decided upon a course of action He would see missus Gwendoline Hillmer and trust to luck in the way of discoveries A quiet smile lit up his handsome regular features as he proceeded to array himself in the most fashionable clothes he possessed paying the utmost attention to every detail in a manner that amazed his valet When at last that worthy was despatched to the nearest florist s for a boutonniere he communicated his bewilderment to the hall porter My guv nor s going out on the mash he said confidentially I thought he would never look at a woman but bless you Jim we re all alike When the day comes we all rush after a petticoat It was nearly six o clock when Bruce walked down Victoria Street For some reason he did not call a hansom and it was almost with a start that he found himself purchasing a ticket to Sloane Square at the Underground Railway office At this precise hour and place he had last seen Lady Alice on earth The memory nerved him to his purpose A few minutes later he pressed the electric bell of No sixty one Raleigh Mansions As he listened to the slight jar of the indicator within he smiled at the apparent fatuity of his mission He had one card perhaps a weak one to play it was true but he hoped that circumstances might prevent this from being tabled too early in the game The door opened and a youthful housemaid stood before him the simple wonder in her eyes showing that such visitors were rare Is missus Hillmer at home he said I ll see sir if you give me your name Surely you know whether or not she is at home The girl stammered and blushed at this unexpected query Well sir she said my mistress is in but I do not know if she can receive any one She is dressed to go out Ah that s better Now take her my card and say that while I will not detain her my business is very important This with a sweet smile that put the flurried maid entirely at her ease The girl withdrew after hesitating for a moment to decide the important question as to whether or not she should close the door in his face Another smile and she did not He was thus free to note the luxurious and tasteful air of the general appointments for the entrance hall usually reveals much of the characteristics of the inmates Here was every evidence of refinement and wealth All the display had not been lavished on the drawing room As he waited conscious of the fact that his colloquy with the servant had been overheard a lady crossed from one room to the other at the end of the passage Her smart but simple dress and the quick scrutiny she gave him as though discovering his presence accidentally caused him to believe rightly as it transpired that this was the maid companion described by his assistant Not only had she obviously made her appearance in order to look at him but the housemaid had carried his message to a different section of the flat The girl returned My mistress will see you in a few minutes she said Will you kindly step into the dining room He followed her sat down in a position where the strong glare of the electric lamps would fall on any one who stood opposite and waited developments The furniture was solid and appropriate the carpet rich and the pictures engravings for the most part excellent This pleasant room warmed by a cheerful fire impressed Bruce as a place much used by the household Books and work baskets were scattered about and a piano littered with music filled a corner There were a few photographs of persons and places but he had not time to examine these before the lady of the house entered Her appearance for some reason inexplicable to the barrister himself took him by surprise She was tall graceful extremely good looking and dressed in a style of quiet elegance Just the sort of woman one would expect to find in such a well appointed abode yet more refined in manner than Bruce from his knowledge of the world thought he would meet judging by the hasty inferences drawn from his subordinate s report She was self possessed too With calm tone and slightly elevated eyebrows she said You wish to see me I understand Yes Allow me first to apologize for the hour at which I have called No apology is necessary But I am going out Perhaps you will be good enough not to detain me longer than is absolutely necessary She stood between the table and the door Bruce who had risen at her entrance was at the other side of the room Her words no less than her attitude showed that she desired the interview to be brief But the barrister resolved that he would not be repelled so coolly Advancing with a bow and that fascinating smile of his he said pulling forward a chair Won t you be seated The lady looked at him She saw a man of fine physique and undoubted good breeding She hesitated There was no reason to be rude to him so she sat down Claude drew a chair to the other side of the hearthrug and commenced I have ventured to seek this interview for the purpose of making some inquiries I thought so Are you a policeman The words were blurted out impetuously a trifle complainingly but Bruce gave no sign of the interest they had for him Good gracious no he cried Why should you think that Because two detectives have been bothering me and every other person in these mansions about some mysterious lady who called here two months ago They don t know where she called nor will they state her name as if any one could possibly know anything about it So I naturally thought you were on the same errand Confound that rascal White growled he to himself But missus Hillmer went on If that is not your business would you mind telling me what it is Now Bruce s alert brain had been actively engaged during the last few seconds This woman was not the clever specious adventuress he had half expected to meet It seemed more than ever unlikely that she could have any knowledge of Lady Dyke or the causes that led to her disappearance He was tempted to frame some excuse and take his departure But the certainty that his missing friend had visited Raleigh Mansions and the necessity there was for exploiting every line of inquiry impelled him to adopt this last resource It is not concerning a missing lady but concerning a missing gentleman that I have come to see you The shot went home Why for the life of him he could not tell but his companion was manifestly disturbed at his words Oh she said Then after a little pause May I ask his name Certainly He is known as mister Sydney H Corbett She gave a slight gasp Why do you put it in that way Is not that his right name I have reason to believe it is not missus Hillmer was so obviously distressed that Bruce inwardly reviled himself for causing her so much unnecessary suffering In all probability the source of her emotion had not the remotest bearing upon his quest Then came the pertinent query after a glance at his card which she still held in her hand Who are you mister mister Claude Bruce I am a member of the Bar of the Inner Temple My chambers are No seven Paper Buildings and my private residence is given there And why are you interested in mister Sydney Corbett Ah in that respect I am at this moment unable to enlighten you Unable or unwilling He indulged in a quiet piece of fencing Really missus Hillmer he said I am not here as in any sense hostile to you I merely want some detailed information with regard to this gentleman information which you may be able to give me That is all All this time he knew that the woman was scrutinizing him narrowly trying to weigh him up as it were not because she feared him but rather to discover the true motive of his presence Personally he had never faced a more difficult task than this make believe investigation He could have laughed at the apparent want of connection between Lady Dyke s ill fated visit to Raleigh Mansions and this worrying of a beautiful pleasant mannered woman who was surely neither a principal nor an accomplice in a ghastly crime Well I suppose I may consider myself in the hands of counsel Tell me what it is you want to know missus Hillmer pouted with the air of a child about to undergo a scolding Are you acquainted with mister Corbett s present address he said No I have neither seen him nor heard from him since early in November Can you be more precise about the period Yes perhaps She arose took from a drawer in the sideboard a packet of bills receipted he observed searched through them and found the document she sought I purchased a few articles about that time she explained and the account for them is dated November fifteen I had not seen my She blushed became confused laughed a little and went on I had not seen mister Corbett for at least a week before that date say November eighth or ninth Lady Dyke disappeared on the evening of the sixth Bruce swallowed his astonishment at the odd coincidence of dates for he said with an encouraging laugh Out with it missus Hillmer You were about to describe mister Corbett correctly when you recollected yourself missus Hillmer still coloring and becoming saucily cheerful cried Why should I trouble myself when you of course know all that I can tell you and probably more He is my brother and a pretty tiresome sort of relation too I am obliged for your confidence In return I am free to state that your brother is now in the South of France As you are here mister Bruce she said I may as well get some advice gratis Can people writ him in the South of France Can they ask me to pay his debts Under ordinary circumstances they can do neither Certainly not the latter I hope not But they sometimes come very near to it as I know to my cost Indeed How missus Hillmer hesitated Her smile was a trifle scornful and her color rose again as she answered People are not averse to taking advantage of circumstances I have had some experience of this trait in debt collectors already But they must be careful You as a legal man must know that demands urged on account of personal reasons may come very near to levying blackmail Surely missus Hillmer you do not suspect me of being a dun Perish the thought You could never be in debt to me Very nice of you Don t you represent those people on Leadenhall Street then What people Messrs Dodge company No why do you ask Because my brother entered into what he called a deal with them He underwrote some shares in a South African mine as a nominal affair he told me and now they want him to pay for them because the company is not supported by the public No I do not represent Dodge company Is there something else then Whom do you represent To be as precise as permissible I may say that my inquiries in no sense affect financial matters What then Well there is a woman in the case missus Hillmer was evidently both relieved and interested No you don t say she said Tell me all about it I never knew Bertie to be much taken up with the fair sex I am all curiosity Who is she He did not take advantage of the mention of a name which in no way stood for Sydney Besides perhaps the initial stood for Herbert He resolved to try another tack Glancing at his watch he said It is nearly seven o clock I have already detained you an unconscionable time You were going out Permit me to call again and we can discuss matters at leisure He rose and the lady sighed You were just beginning to be entertaining I was only going to dine at a restaurant I am quite tired of being alone Was it a hint He would see Are you dining by yourself then missus Hillmer I hardly know I may bring my maid Claude now made up his mind May I venture he said after such an informal introduction to ask you to dine with me at the Prince s Restaurant and afterwards perhaps to look in at the Jollity Theatre The lady was unfeignedly pleased She arranged to call for him in her brougham within twenty minutes and Bruce hurried off to Victoria Street in a hansom to dress for this unexpected branch of the detective business When he told his valet to telephone to the restaurant and the theatre respectively for a reserved table and a couple of stalls that worthy chuckled When his master entered a brougham in which was seated a fur wrapped lady the valet grinned broadly I knew it he said The guv nor s on the mash Now who would ever have thought it of him CHAPTER V AT THE JOLLITY THEATRE By tacit consent Claude and his fair companion dropped for the hour the roles of inquisitor and witness They were both excellent talkers they were mutually interested and there was in their present escapade a spice of that romance not so lacking in the humdrum life of London as is generally supposed to be the case Bruce did not ask himself what tangible result he expected from this quaint outcome of his visit to Sloane Square It was too soon yet He must trust to the vagaries of chance to elucidate many things now hidden Meanwhile a good dinner a bright theatre and the society of a smart nice looking woman were more than tolerable substitutes for progress As a partial explanation of his somewhat eccentric behavior he volunteered a lively account of a recent cause celebre in which he had taken a part but the details of which had been rigidly kept from the public He more than hinted that mister Sydney Corbett had figured prominently in the affair and missus Hillmer laughed with unrestrained mirth at the unwonted appearance of her brother in the character of a Lothario Tell me said Bruce confidentially when a couple of glasses of Moet eighty nine had consolidated friendly relations what sort of a fellow is this brother of yours Not in any sense a bad boy but a trifle wild He will not live an ordinary life and at times he has been hard pressed to live at all As a matter of fact it is this scrape he blundered into with Messrs Dodge company that induced him to masquerade temporarily under an assumed name Then what is his real name Ah now you are pumping me again I refuse to tell But there are generally serious reasons when a man disguises himself in such fashion The reason he gave me was that he dreaded being writted for liability regarding the shares I mentioned to you It was good enough Now you come with this story of meddling with somebody else s wife Surely this is an additional reason I supplied him with funds until we quarrelled and then he went off in a huff What did you quarrel about That concerns me only missus Hillmer was so emphatic that Bruce dropped the subject When they drove to the theatre missus Hillmer on alighting at the entrance said to her coachman You may return home now and bring Dobson to meet me at eleven point fifteen May I venture to inquire who Dobson is said Claude Certainly Dobson is my maid This woman puzzled him the more he saw of her He was now quite positive that she lived on the fringe of Society Her status was at the best dubious Yet he had never heard of her before nor met her in public None of his friends were known to her and she mentioned no one beyond those popular personages who are connu of all the world She was obviously wealthy and refined with more than a spice of unconventionality At times too beneath her habitual expressions of lively and vivacious interest there was a touch of melancholy For an instant her face grew sad when her eyes rested on a typical family party of father mother and two girls who occupied seats in the row of stalls directly in front of her For some reason Bruce felt sorry for missus Hillmer He regretted that the exigencies of his quest forced him to make her his dupe and he resolved that if by any chance her scapegrace brother were concerned in Lady Dyke s death missus Hillmer should if possible be spared personal humiliation or disgrace Indeed he had formed such a favorable opinion of her that he had made up his mind to conduct his future investigations without causing her to assist involuntarily in putting a halter around her relative s neck Nevertheless it was impossible to avoid getting some further information as the lady herself paved the way for it Her comments betrayed such an accurate acquaintance with the technique of the stage that he said to her You must have acted a good deal No she said not very much But I was stage struck when young But you have not appeared in public Yes some six years ago I worked so hard that I fell ill and then then I got married Do you go out much to theatres nowadays Very little It is lonely by oneself and there are so few plays worth seeing Bruce wondered why she insisted so strongly upon the isolation of her existence In his new found sympathy he forebore to question and she continued When I do visit a theatre I amuse myself mostly by silent criticism of the actors and actresses Not that I could do better than many of them or half so well but it passes the time I hope you do not regard killing time as your main occupation It is so I fear however hard I may strive otherwise And again that shadow of regret darkened the fair face Some one in front turned round and glared at them angrily for the famous comedian mister Prospect Ricks was singing his deservedly famous song It was all because I buttoned up her boots so the conversation dropped for the moment Claude focussed his opera glasses on the stage While his eyes wandered idly over the pretty faces and shapely limbs of the coryphees his brain was busy piecing together all that he had heard The odd coincidence of the dates of Lady Dyke s murder and the speedy departure of the self styled Sydney Corbett for the Riviera would require a good deal of explanation by the latter gentleman True it was not the barrister s habit to jump at conclusions There might be a perfectly valid motive for the journey If the man did not desire his whereabouts to be known why did he leave his address at the post office And then what possible reason could Lady Dyke have in visiting him voluntarily and secretly at his chambers in Raleigh Mansions This virtuous and high principled lady could have nothing in common with a careless adventurer taking the most lenient view of his sister s description of him And as Bruce s subtle brain strove vainly to match the queer fragments of the puzzle his keen eyes roved over the stage in aimless activity Suddenly they paused His power of vision and mental analysis were alike inadequate to the new and startling fact which had obtruded itself unasked and unsought for upon his sight Among the least prominent of the chorus girls posturing and moving with the stiffness and visible anxiety of the novice who is not yet accustomed to the glare of the footlights upon undraped limbs was one in whose every gesture Bruce took an absorbing interest He was endowed in full measure with that prime requisite in the detection of criminals an unusually good memory for faces together with the artistic faculty of catching the true expression Hence it was that after the whirl of a dancing chorus had for a few seconds brought this particular member of the company close to the proscenium Bruce became quite sure of having developed at least one branch of his inquiry within measurable distance of its conclusion The girl on the stage was Jane Harding Lady Dyke s maid When her features first flashed upon his conscious gaze he could hardly credit the discovery But each instant of prolonged scrutiny placed the fact beyond doubt Not even the make up and the elaborate wig could conceal the contour of her pretty if insipid face and a slight trick she had of drooping the left eyelid when thinking confirmed him in his belief So astounded was he at this sequel to his visit to the theatre that he utilized every opportunity of a full stage to examine still further the appearance and style of this strange apparition When the curtain fell and Jane Harding had vanished he was brought back to actuality by missus Hillmer s voice Fie mister Bruce You are taking altogether too much notice of one of the fair ladies in front Which one is it The tall standard bearer or the little girl who pirouettes so gracefully Neither I assure you I was taken up by wondering how a young woman manages to secure employment in a theatre for the first time I think I can tell you Influence goes a long way Talent occasionally counts Then a well known agent may for a nominal fee get an opening for a handsome well built girl who has taken lessons from either himself or some of his friends in dancing or singing or both Is such a thing possible for a domestic servant It all depends upon the domestic servant s circle of acquaintances As a rule I should say not A theatre like this requires a higher average of intelligence This and more Bruce well knew but he was only making conversation while he thought intently almost fiercely upon the latest phase of his strange quest During the third act he devoted more time to missus Hillmer If that sprightly dame were a little astonished at the celerity with which he conducted her to her carriage and the waiting Dobson it was banished by the nice way in which he thanked her for the pleasure she had conferred The enjoyment has been mostly on my side she cried as he stood near the window of her brougham Come to see me again soon He bowed and would have said something if an imperious policeman had not ordered the coachman to make way for the next vehicle So missus Hillmer was whisked into the traffic From force of habit he glanced casually at the crowd struggling through the exit of the theatre and he caught sight of mister White who too late averted his round eyes and strove to shield his portly form in the portico of a neighboring restaurant He did not want to be bothered by the detective just then He lit a cigarette and mister White slid off quietly into the stream of traffic finally crossing the road and jumping on to a Charing Cross bus So said Claude to himself White has been watching Raleigh Mansions and watching me too Pon my honor I shouldn t wonder if he suspected me of the murder I m glad I saw him just now For the next couple of hours I wish to be free from his interference Waiting a few moments to make sure that White had not detailed an aide de camp to continue the surveillance he buttoned his overcoat to the chin tilted his hat forward and strolled round to the stage door of the Jollity Theatre CHAPTER VI MISS MARIE LE MARCHANT The uncertain rays of a weak lamp struggling through panes dulled by dirt and black letters cast a fitful light about the precincts of the stage door Elderly women and broken down men slovenly and unkempt kept furtive guard over the exit waiting for the particular super to come forth who would propose the expected adjournment to a favorite public house Some smart broughams a four wheeler and a few hansoms formed a close line along the pavement which was soon crowded with the hundred odd hangers on of a theatre scene shifters gasmen limelight men members of the orchestra dressers and attendants mingling with the small stream of artistes constantly pouring out into the cold night after a casual inquiry for letters at the office of the doorkeeper This being a fashionable place of amusement there were not wanting several representatives of the gilded youth some obviously ginger bread or unleavened imitations others callow specimens of the genuine article Bruce paid little heed to them as they impudently peered beneath each broad leafed and high feathered hat to discover the charmer honored by their chivalrous attentions Yet the presence of this brigade of light headed cavaliers helped the barrister far more than he could have foreseen or even hoped At last the ex lady s maid appeared dressed in a showy winter costume and jaunty toque She was on very friendly terms with two older girls on whom the stage had set its ineffaceable seal and the reason was soon apparent Come along she cried her words being evidently intended to have an effect on others in the throng less favored than those whom she addressed let us get into a hansom and go to Scott s for supper Here cabby She was on the step of a hansom when a tall good looking boy faultlessly dressed and with something of Sandhurst or Woolwich in his carriage darted forward Hello Millie he said to one of Jane Harding s companions How are you A couple of fellows have come up with me for the night Let s all go and have something to eat at the Duke s thereby indicating a well known club usually patronized by higher class artistes than this trio After a series of introductions by Christian names among which Bruce failed to catch the word Jane the party went off in three hansoms a pair in each Claude was not a member of the Duke s though he had often been there But there was a man close at hand who was a member of everything in London that in any way pertained to things theatrical Every one knew Billy Sadler and Billy Sadler knew every one A brief run in a cab to a theatre a restaurant and another restaurant revealed the large hearted Billy drinking a whisky and soda and relating to a friend with great gusto and much gesticulation the very latest quarrel between the stage manager and the leading lady He hailed Claude with enthusiasm Pon my soul Bruce old chap haven t seen you for an age Where have you bin An what s the little game now mister Sadler was fully aware of the barrister s penchant for investigating mysteries The two had often foregathered in the past Are you busy said Bruce Not a bit By bye Jack See you at luncheon to morrow at the Gorgonzola Well what is it I want you to come with me to the Duke s There s a young lady there I m interested in Billy squeezed round in the hansom which was now bowling across a corner of Trafalgar Square You he cried After a girl Is she in the profession Is mamma frightened about her angel The correct figure for a breach just now my boy is five thou Oh it s nothing serious I will tell you all about it when matters have cleared a bit It is a mere item in a really big story But here we are Take me straight to the supper room As they entered the comfortable brightly lit club the strains of a band came pleasantly to their ears and in a minute they were installed at a corner table in the splendid room devoted to the most cheery of all gatherings a Bohemian meal when the labors of the night are past Bruce soon marked his quarry Jane Harding was in great form eating drinking and talking at the same time Who is that Billy he said indicating the girl Sadler carefully balanced his pince nez on his well defined nose gazed and laughed Goodness knows She s a new comer and not much at the best Do you know where she carries a banner At the Jollity Oh then here s our man for a Mephistophelian gentleman was passing at the moment Say Rosenheim who s the new coryphee over there Mephistopheles halted looked at Jane and laughed too Her name is Miss Marie le Marchant but as she happened to be born in London she pronounces it Mahrie Lee Mahshuns with the accent on the Mahs Anything else you would like to know Yes I m stuck on her Where did you pick her up She s a housemaid or something of the sort Came into money Wants to knock em on the stige The rest is easy Has she been with you long put in Claude as their informant was the under manager of the Jollity mister Rosenheim glanced at him Sadler he knew had no interest in the girl and the barrister did not quite possess the juvenile appearance that warranted such solicitude She joined us just before Christmas What s up Is she really worth a lot of oof I should imagine not laughed Bruce and mister Rosenheim joined another group Supper ended Marie and Millie and eke Flossie attended by their swains discussed coffee and cognac in the foyer Chance separated Miss le Marchant as she may now be known momentarily from the others and Bruce darted forward Good evening he said I am delighted to meet you here The girl recognized him instantly She would have denied her identity but her nerve failed her before those steadfast penetrating eyes Moreover it was not an ill thing for such a well bred well dressed man to acknowledge her so openly Good evening mister Bruce she said with a smile of assurance though her voice faltered a little He resolved to make the situation easy We have not met for such a long time he said and I am simply dying to have a talk with you I am sure your friends will pardon me if I carry you off for five minutes to a quiet corner With a simper Miss le Marchant took his proffered arm and they went off to an unoccupied table Now Jane Harding said he with some degree of sternness in his manner be good enough to explain to me why you are passing under a false name and the reasons which led you to leave Sir Charles Dyke s house in such a particularly disagreeable way Disagreeable I only left in a hurry Who had any right to stop me No one in a sense except that Sir Charles Dyke may feel inclined to prosecute you For what mister Bruce This emancipated servant girl was not such a simpleton as she looked It was necessary to frighten her and at the same time to force her to admit the facts with reference to her sensational flight from Wensley House You must know he said that Sir Charles Dyke can proceed against you in the County Court to recover wages in lieu of notice and this would be far from pleasant for you in your new surroundings Yes I know that But why should Sir Charles Dyke or you or any other gentleman want to destroy a poor girl s prospects in that fashion Surely you must feel that some explanation is due to us for your extraordinary behavior No I don t feel a bit like it But why did you go away To suit myself Could you not have given notice Why was it necessary to create a further scandal in addition to the disappearance of your unfortunate mistress I am sorry for that It was thoughtless I admit If I had to act over again I should have done differently But what does it matter now It matters this much that the police must be informed of your existence as they are searching for you believing that you are in some way mixed up with Lady Dyke s death The girl started violently and she flushed rather with anger than alarm Bruce thought as he watched her narrowly The police indeed she snorted what have the police to do with me A nice thing you re saying mister Bruce I am merely telling you the naked truth All right Tell them I don t care a pin for them or you Have you anything else to say because I wish to join my friends The girl s language and attitude mystified him more than any preceding feature of this remarkable investigation She was of course far better educated than he had imagined and the difference between the hysterical witness at the coroner s inquiry and this pert self possessed young woman was phenomenal Rather than risk an open rupture the barrister temporized If you are anxious to quarrel with me by all means do so he said but that was not my motive in speaking to you here to night Miss le Marchant shot a suspicious glance at him Then what was your motive she said Chiefly to reassure my friend your former master concerning you and perhaps to learn the cause of your very strange conduct Why should Sir Charles bother his head about me As I have told you Because of the coincidence between your departure and Lady Oh yes I know that Then she added testily I was a fool not to manage differently So you refuse me an explanation No I don t I have no reason to do so I came in for some money and as I have longed all my life to be an actress I could not wait an hour a moment before I before I Before you tried to gratify your impulse Yes that is what I wanted to say But why not at least have written to Sir Charles telling him of your intentions The fair Marie was silent for a moment The question confused her I hardly know she replied Will you write to him now I don t see why I should Indeed Not even when it was you who gave some of your mistress s underclothing to mister White by which means he was able to identify the body found at Putney as that of Lady Dyke mister White told you that did he He did Then you had better get him to give you all further information mister Bruce as not another word will you get out of me She bounced up fiery red pluming herself for the fray Will you not communicate with Sir Charles he said utterly baffled by Miss le Marchant s uncompromising attitude Perhaps I will and perhaps I won t mister White indeed And she ran off to join her friends The barrister drove quietly homewards This was his summary of the evening s events I have found two women When I know all about them I shall be able to lay my hand on the person who killed Lady Dyke CHAPTER VII IN THE CITY Messrs Dodge company of Leadenhall Street possessed business premises of greater pretensions than Bruce had pictured to himself from missus Hillmer s description of their transactions with her brother Not only were their offices commodious and well situated but a liberal display of gold lettering intermingled with official brass plates marking the registering offices of many companies gave evidence of some degree of importance whether fictitious or otherwise Bruce could not determine as he scrutinized the exterior of the building on the following morning Moreover workmen were even then busy in substituting the title Dodge Son company limited for Messrs Dodge Company the suggestive nature of the latter designation having perhaps proved a stumbling block in the way of the guileless investor When the barrister entered the office a busy place a hive of many clerks and adorned with gigantic maps of the Rand West Australia Cripple Creek and Klondike he asked for mister Dodge His card procured him ready admission He was shown into an elaborately upholstered apartment of considerable size At the farther end seated in front of a gorgeous American desk was a young man who ostentatiously finished a letter and then motioned the barrister to a seat Bruce was curious on the question of the age of the head of the firm Are you mister Dodge or the son he said with the utmost gravity The other was taken back by this unexpected method of opening the conversation It annoyed him I am the representative of the firm sir and fully able to deal with your business whatever it may be he replied No doubt But it will simplify matters if I know exactly to whom I am addressing myself After an uneasy shuffling in his seat he could not guess what this keen faced earnest eyed lawyer might want the representative of Messrs Dodge Son company Limited explained that he was Dodge and the name of the firm had been adopted for general purposes Then there is no son I take it Yes there is sir this with a snort of anger How old is he What the Dickens has that got to do with it Will you kindly tell me what you want sir as my time is fully occupied Just now I want to know how old the son is This calm persistence irritated mister Dodge beyond endurance Three years confound you and his sister is four months Can I oblige you with any more details concerning my family affairs Having purposely raised this man to boiling point by this harmless method of examination Claude tackled the real business in hand He was quite sure that a financial sharper in a temper was far more likely to blurt out the truth than if he were approached in a matter of fact manner To begin with he explained never taking his eyes off the furious face of mister Dodge I have called to ask for information with regard to your dealings with mister Sydney H Corbett of Raleigh Mansions Sloane Square I never heard of him in my life You have evidently come to the wrong office mister Bruce Are you quite sure Well nearly so However I can tell you in a moment as it is impossible for me to carry every name connected with several companies in my memory mister Dodge recovered his temper now that he saw a chance of disconcerting his caustic visitor He touched an electric bell and told the answering youth to send mister Hawkins My correspondence clerk he explained loftily when Hawkins entered Are we in communication with any one named Sydney H Corbett mister Hawkins No sir Have you ever heard the name No sir That will do You may go You see you have come to the wrong shop mister Bruce Yes so I see The barrister kept looking at the back of mister Dodge s head but made no move mister Dodge became puzzled Now mister Bruce he cried you know the age of my son and the extent of my information about mister Corbett Is there anything else in which I may be of service Yes You do a great deal of underwriting mostly for the flotation of gold mining companies Y yes That is a branch of our business I am interested in this class of undertaking and I was given to understand that mister Corbett has had some dealings with you in a similar respect for a considerable sum of money The name is absolutely unknown to me Of course So I gather I am sorry to hear it Several clients of mine have money to invest in that way and I naturally came to a firm whose name apparently figured largely in the transactions of mister Corbett It was good to see the manner in which mister Dodge metaphorically kicked himself for his previous attitude His emotion was painful For quite an appreciable time he could not trust his sentiments to words At last he struggled to express himself Really mister Bruce if you had only put things differently Don t you see it rather upset me when you came in and began jawing about the youngsters And then you spring mister Corbett s name on me a man of whom I have no sort of knowledge It must have been my firm of which your friends heard There is absolutely no other Dodge in Leadenhall Street Indeed we are the only financial Dodges that is er Messrs Dodge Son company Limited are the only firm of the name dealing with financial matters in the city By this time Bruce had assured himself that mister Dodge did not know mister Corbett s identity and if missus Hillmer s brother had changed his name to conceal himself from Dodge it was likely to be successful Anyhow I am here mister Dodge he said cheerfully so I may as well enter into negotiations with you Have you any good things in hand at this moment Some of the best We are just waiting for the market to ease a bit and we shall have at least five splendid properties to place before the public By the way do you smoke Bruce did smoke and mister Dodge produced a box of excellent cigars Then he warmed to his work Here is the prospectus of the Golden Halo Mine capital Lone hundred fifty thousand for which the vendors are asking Lone hundred forty thousand in cash with a working capital of Lten thousand The ore now in sight is estimated to produce two millions sterling and the mine is not one tenth developed We are offering underwriters ten per cent in cash and there is not the slightest risk as the shares will stand at a high premium within a few days after the lists It sounds most promising said Bruce but my principals are more interested in taking up concerns which have been already established but in which for want of sufficient capital the vendors shares have by a process of reconstruction come into the market If you have anything of that kind The very thing interrupted Dodge excitedly The Springbok Mine will just suit em After all is said and done Golden Halos are a bit in the air between you and me But the Springbok is a genuine article It was capitalized for a quarter of a million and the directors went to allotment on a subscription list of about Lfourteen thousand This money has been expended but twice the amount is necessary to develop the property properly A call was made on the shares but no one paid up and there is a talk of compulsory reconstruction Believe me money put into it now will yield two hundred per cent in dividends within twelve months There is a whiff of scent on this trail said Claude to himself He added aloud That looks promising Can you give me details By all means Here is the original prospectus Bruce glanced through the document which dealt with the Springbok claims on the Rand with more candor than is usually exhibited in such compilations Judging from the reports of several mining engineers of repute it really looked as if this time mister Dodge were speaking with some degree of accuracy This reads well said Bruce What proportion of share capital is falling in on the reconstruction scheme I hold fifty thousand shares myself cried Dodge and though my money is locked up just now I am so convinced about this mine that I will manage to pay the call myself Roughly speaking there are one hundred and fifty thousand shares to be underwritten at say three shillings each And who are the present holders The barrister asked the question in the most unconcerned way imaginable yet upon the answer depended the whole success or otherwise of this hitherto unproductive mission mister Dodge was manifestly anxious I take it that we are talking with a definite view to business he said The barrister hesitated Even in the detection of a crime a man does not care to tell a deliberate lie and Dodge s attitude so far had been candid enough The Springbok Mine honestly looked to be a good speculative investment so he resolved to place the proposition before one or two friends who dealt with similar matters and who were fully able to look after their own interests Yes he answered I am here for that purpose If my principals like this thing they will go in for it Then here is the vendors list said mister Dodge taking a foolscap sheet from a drawer Claude perused it nonchalantly His quick eyes took in each name and address out of half a dozen and rejected all as being in no way connected with the man whose antecedents he was seeking Yet where possible he left nothing to chance Have you any objection to a copy being made he asked mister Dodge hummed doubtfully You see went on the barrister it is best to be quite candid with people whom you wish to bring into risky if apparently high promising ventures I presume these gentlemen are moneyless If so it is a factor in favor of your scheme Should any of them be men of means my principals would naturally ask why they did not themselves underwrite the shares mister Dodge was convinced From that point of view he cried emphatically they are above suspicion Jot them down sir The barrister armed himself with the necessary documents and they parted with mutual good wishes It was only after reflection that mister Dodge saw how remarkably little he had got out of the interview He was a jolly smart chap communed the company promoter I wonder what he was really after And who the dickens is mister Sydney H Corbett Anyhow the Springbok business is quite above board How can I raise the wind for my little lot If mister Bruce had probed more deeply mister Dodge s holding he would have been saved much future perturbation But clever as he was he did not know all the methods of financial juggling practised by experts on the Stock Exchange A hansom brought him quickly to Portman Square In fulfilment of his promise he was about to place Sir Charles Dyke in possession of his recent discoveries When the door of Wensley House opened the butler Thompson who happened to be in the hall anticipated the footman s answer to Bruce s inquiry Sir Chawles left yesterday for Bournemouth sir E was that hovercome by the weather an his trouble that e has gone for a few days rest at the seaside If you called sir I was to tell you e would be glad to see you there should you find it convenient to run down And sir you ll never guess who came ere this morning as bold as brass Jane Harding Now ow upon earth can you it upon things that way sir It was er er very self And you ought to ave seen her airs Thompson sez she is Sir Chawles at ome No e isn t sez I but you re wanted at the polis station She was in a keb and she ad asked a butcher s boy to pull the bell so im and the cabby larfed Thompson she said very red in the face I ll ave you dismissed for your impidence An off she went Did you ever ear anythink like it sir No Thompson Miss Harding is certainly a cool hand Bruce walked to his chambers and his stroll through the parks was engrossed by one subject of thought It was not missus Hillmer nor Corbett nor Dodge who troubled him What puzzled him more than all else was the impidence of Jane Harding CHAPTER VIII THE HOTEL DU CERCLE Bruce did not go to Bournemouth He quitted London by the next mail and after a wearisome journey of thirty six hours found himself in the garden courtyard of the Hotel du Cercle at Monte Carlo Refreshed by a bath and an excellent dejeuner he decided to go quietly to work and search the visitors book for himself without asking any questions The Hotel du Cercle was a popular resort and it took him some time largely devoted to the elucidation of hieroglyphic signatures before he was quite satisfied that no one even remotely suggestive of the name of Sydney H Corbett had recorded his presence in the hotel since the first week in November The barrister for the first time began to doubt missus Hillmer Twice had her statements not been verified by facts It was with an expression of keen annoyance at his own folly in trusting so much to a favorable impression that he turned to the hotel clerk to ask if the name of mister Sydney H Corbett was familiar to him The courteous Frenchman screwed up his forehead into a reflective frown before he answered But yes monsieur Me I have not seen the gentleman but he exists There have been letters two three letters Ah letters Has he received them The attendant examined a green baize covered board decorated with diamonds of tape in which was stuck an assortment of letters mostly addressed to American tourists They were here They have gone Then he has taken them Yes cried Bruce but surely you know something about him Nothing This hall is open to all the world Do you tell me that any one can come here and take any letters which may be stuck in that rack Will the gentleman be pleased to consider Many persons give their address here days and weeks before they come to arrive Some persons in the manner of Monte Carlo do not wish their names to be known of everybody We cannot distinguish We do not allow the address of the hotel to be used improperly if we know it but there are no complaints The barrister did not argue the matter further He only said Perhaps you can tell me thus far as I am very anxious to meet mister Corbett About how long is it since the last letter came for him But certainly It came yesterday It was re addressed from some place in London If possible with the next one I will keep watch for mister Corbett So missus Hillmer had not misled him The so called Corbett was in Monte Carlo but had possibly disguised himself under another name Again did Bruce consult the hotel register this time with the aid of the vendors list in the Springbok Mine but without result There was nothing for it but to familiarize himself with Monte Carlo and its habitues awaiting developments in the chase of Corbett In January when London alternates between fog and sleet it is not an intolerable thing to remain in forced idleness amid the sunshine and flowers of the Riviera There are two ways of doing Monte Carlo You may live riotously lose your substance at the Casino and go home on a free ticket supplied by the proprietors of the gambling saloons or you may enjoy to the utmost the keen air magnificent scenery fine promenades and excellent music the two latter provided by the same benevolent agency It is needless to say which of these alternatives appealed to Claude Bruce Being a rich man it was of no consequence to him to lose a few louis in backing the red for a five minutes bit of excitement Being a sensible one he then quitted the Casino and went for a stroll in the gardens Fashion backed by the doctors has decreed that no longer shall the northern littoral of the Mediterranean be the only haven of rest for those afflicted with pulmonary complaints Weak chested and consumptive people are now banished to the windless and icy altitudes of Switzerland so of recent years a walk through Nice Mentone or Monte Carlo itself is not such a depressing experience as it was when every second person encountered was a hopeless invalid A pigeon shooting match was in progress and as Bruce fell in with a friend who took a prominent part in local life the two entered the club grounds to watch the contest At the moment a handsome well set up young Englishman was shooting off a tie with a Russian count A very pretty girl with a delicate and refined beauty enhanced by a pleasant expression was taking a most unfeminine interest in the slaughter of the pigeons by the Englishman Her eyes spoke her thoughts It was as if they said I do not want the birds to be killed but I want a certain person to win Nine birds each had been grassed and the Russian was growing impatient The Englishman was cool his fair backer keenly excited The Count fired and missed his tenth Up rose the Englishman s bird and the girl could not restrain an impetuous Now So the Englishman missed also Amidst the buzz of comment which arose Bruce said to his companion What s going on This is the final tie in the International It is a big prize and each man has backed himself heavily The two are Albert Mensmore and Count Bischkoff The girl has taken all the nerve out of Mensmore Bar accident he is a goner The cynic was right In the thirteenth round the count alone scored and smiled largely in response to his antagonist s quiet congratulations As for the girl it was with difficulty she restrained her tears I think that we have witnessed a tragedy said Bruce s acquaintance as they walked off and the barrister agreed with him He was sorry for Mensmore and his pretty supporter Mayhap the loss of the match meant a great deal to both of them That night he learned by chance that Mensmore lived at the Hotel du Cercle He met him in the billiard room and tried to inveigle him into conversation But the young fellow was too miserable to respond to his advances Beyond a mere civil acknowledgement of some slight act of politeness Bruce could not draw him out Next morning he saw Mensmore again If the man looked haggard the previous evening his appearance now was positively startling that is to one of Bruce s powers of observation Ninety nine men out of a hundred would have seen that Mensmore had not slept well Bruce was assured that for some reason the other s brain was dominated by some overwhelming idea and one which might eventuate in a tragic manner were it to be allowed to go unchecked For some reason he took a good deal of interest in his unfortunate fellow countryman and determined to help him if the opportunity presented itself It came with dramatic rapidity During dinner he noticed that Mensmore was in such a state of mental disturbance that he ate and drank with the air of one who is feverishly wasting rather than replenishing his strength Soon after eight o clock at the hour when frequenters of the Casino go there in order to secure a seat for the evening s play Mensmore quitted the dining room Bruce followed him unobstrusively and was just in time to see him enter the lift The barrister waited in the hall having first secured his hat and overcoat from the bureau where he happened to have left them Even while he noted the descending lift in which he could see Mensmore who had donned a light covert coat the breast of which bulged somewhat on the left side the hotel clerk came to him triumphantly holding a letter And now monsieur cried the clerk we shall see what we shall see The missive was addressed to the mysterious Sydney H Corbett and had been forwarded by the Sloane Square Post Office With a clang the door of the lift swung open and Mensmore hastened out Bruce had to decide instantly between the chance of seeing Corbett with his own eyes and pursuing the fanciful errand he had mapped out in imagination with reference to the stranger who so interested him Thank you he said to the clerk I am going to the Casino for an hour you will greatly oblige me by keeping a sharp lookout for any one who claims the letter Monsieur it shall have my utmost regard The barrister had not erred in his surmise as to Mensmore s destination The young man walked straight across the square and entered the grounds of the famous Casino Indoors an excellent band was playing a selection from The Geisha The spacious foyer was fast filling with a fashionable throng without the silver radiance of the moon lighting up gardens rocks buildings and sea might well have added the last link to the pleasant bondage that would keep any one from the gambling saloon that night but Mensmore heeded none of these things He passed the barrier closely followed by Bruce crossed the foyer and disappeared through the baize doors that guard the magnificent room in which roulette is played Round several of the tables a fairly considerable crowd had gathered already The more the merrier is the rule of the Casino There is something curiously fascinating for the gambler in the presence of others It would seem to be an almost ridiculous thing for a man to stalk solemnly up to a deserted board and stake his money on the chances of the game merely for the edification of the officials in charge Bruce entered the room soon after Mensmore and saw the latter elbowing his way to a seat about to be vacated by a stout Spanish lady who had rapidly lost the sum she allowed herself to stake each day She was one of those numerous players who bring to the Casino a certain amount daily and systematically stop playing when they have either lost their money or won a previously determined maximum This method in fact when combined with a careful system is the only one whereby even a rich individual can indulge in a costly pastime and at the same time escape speedy ruin With a fair share of luck it may be made to pay with continuous bad fortune the loss is spread over such a period that common sense has some opportunity to rescue the victim before it is too late Claude took up a position from which he could note the actions of the stranger in whom he was so interested At first Mensmore staked nothing He placed a small pile of gold in front of him he seemed to listen expectantly to the croupier s monotonous cry Vingt sept rouge impair passe or Dixhuit noir pair manque and so on while the little ivory ball whirred around the disc and the long rakes with unerring skill drew in or pushed forward the sums lost or won The dominant expression of Mensmore s face as he sat and listened was one of disappointment Something for which he waited did not happen At last with a tightening of his lips and a gathering sternness in his eyes he placed five louis on the red the number previously called being thirteen Black won For the next three attempts each time with a five louis stake on the board Mensmore backed the red but still black won Next to him an Italian betting in notes of a thousand francs each had quadrupled his first bet by backing the black Both men rose simultaneously the Italian grinning delightedly at a smart Parisienne who joyously nodded her congratulations the Englishman quiet utterly unmoved but slightly pallid He passed out into the foyer and stopped to light a cigarette Bruce noticed that his hand was steady and that all the air of excitement had gone These were ill signs There is no man so calm as he who has deliberately resolved to take his own life That Mensmore was ruined that he was hopelessly in love with a woman whom he could not marry and that he was about to commit suicide Bruce was as certain as though the facts had been proved by a coroner But this thing should not happen if he could prevent it The band was now playing one of Waldteufel s waltzes Mensmore listened to the fascinating melody for a moment He hesitated at the door of the writing room but he went out puffing furiously at his cigarette A guard looked at him as he turned to the right of the entrance and made for the shaded terraces overlooking the sea A silent Englishman thought the man and he caught sight of Bruce also smoking preoccupied and solitary Another silent Englishman Mon Dieu What miserable lives these English lead And so the two vanished into the blackness of the foliage while within the brilliantly lighted building the frou frou of silk mingled with soft laughter and the sweet strains of music If it be true that extremes meet then this was a night for a tragedy CHAPTER IX BREAKING THE BANK There were not many people in this part of the Casino gardens A few love making couples and a handful of others who preferred the chilly quietude of Nature to the throng of the interior promenade made up the occupants of the winding paths that cover the seaward slope At last Mensmore halted There was no one in front and he turned to look if the terrace were clear behind him He caught sight of Bruce but did not recognize him and leant against a low wall ostensibly to gaze at the sea until the other had passed Claude came up to him and cried cheerily Hello Is that you mister Mensmore Isn t it a lovely night Mensmore startled at being thus unexpectedly addressed by name wheeled about stared at the new comer and said very stiffly Yes but I felt rather seedy in the Casino so I came here to be alone Of course answered the barrister You look a little out of sorts Perhaps got a chill eh It is dangerous weather here particularly on these heavenly evenings Come back with me to the hotel and have a stiff brandy and soda It will brace you up Mensmore flushed a little at this persistence I tell you he growled that I only require to be left in peace and I shall soon recover from my indisposition I am awfully obliged to you but But you wish me to walk on and mind my own business Not exactly that old chap Please don t think me rude I am very sorry but I can t talk much to night So I understand That is why I think it is best for you to have company even such disagreeable companionship as my own Confound it man cried the other now thoroughly irritated tell me which way you are going and I will take the other Why on earth cannot you take a polite hint and leave me to myself It is precisely because I am good at taking a hint that I positively refuse to leave you until you are safely landed at your hotel Indeed I may stick to you then for some hours The devil take you What do you mean Exactly what I say If you don t quit this instant I will punch your head for you Ah You are recovering already But before you start active exercise take your overcoat off That revolver in the breast pocket might go off accidentally you know Besides as I shall hit back I might fetch my knuckles against it and that would be hardly fair Otherwise I can do as much in the punching line as you can any day This reply utterly disconcerted Mensmore Look here he said avoiding Bruce s steadfast gaze what are you talking about What has it got to do with you anyhow Oh a great deal My business principally consists in looking after other people s affairs Just now it is my definite intention to prevent you from blowing out your brains or what passes for them Then all I can say is that I wish you were in Jericho It is your own fault if you get into trouble over this matter Had you gone about your business I would have waited As it is It so happened that the guard having nothing better to do strolled along the terraces by the same path that Mensmore and Bruce had followed The first sight that met his astonished eyes when in the flood of moonlight he discovered their identity was the spectacle of these two springing at each other like a pair of wild cats Parbleu he shouted the solitary ones are fighting He ran forward drawing his short sword ready to stick the weapon into either of the combatants if the majesty of the law in his own person were not at once respected In reality the affair was simple enough Mensmore made an ineffectual attempt to draw his revolver and Bruce pinioned him before he could get his hand up to his pocket Both men were equally matched and it was difficult to say how the struggle might have ended had not the sword brandishing guard appeared on the scene Claude even in this excited situation kept his senses Mensmore blind with rage and the madness of one who would voluntarily plunge into the Valley of the Shadow took heed of naught save the effort to rid himself of the restraining clutch Put away your sword Seize his arms from behind He is a suicide shouted the barrister to the gesticulating and shrieking Frenchman Fortunately Bruce was an excellent linguist The man caught Mensmore s arms put a knee in the small of his back and doubled him backwards with a force that nearly dislocated his spine In the same instant Claude secured the revolver which he promptly pocketed It is well he said to the guard Here is a louis Say nothing but leave us Monsieur understands that the honor of a French policeman I understand that if there is any report made of this affair to the authorities you will be dismissed for negligence Had this lunatic been left to your care he would now have been lying here dead Do you doubt me The guard hesitated Monsieur mentioned a louis he said for Bruce s finger and thumb had returned the coin to his waistcoat pocket This transaction satisfactorily ended Bruce accosted Mensmore who was awkwardly twisting himself to see if his backbone were all right You are not hurt I hope It is matterless Why could you not let me finish the business in my own way Because the world has some use for a man like you Because you are a moral coward and require support from a stronger nature Because I did not want to think of that girl crying her eyes out to morrow when she read of your death or heard of it as she assuredly would have done Mensmore though still furious at his fellow countryman s interference was visibly amazed at this final reference What do you know about her he cried Nothing save what my eyes tell me They seem to tell you a remarkable lot about my affairs Possibly Meanwhile I want you to give me your word of honor that you will not make any further attempt on your life during the next seven days The word of honor of a disgraced man Will you accept it Most certainly You are a queer chap and no mistake Very well I give it At the same time I cannot help dying of starvation I lost my last cent to night at roulette I am hopelessly involved in debts which I cannot pay I have no prospects and no friends You are not doing me a kindness my dear fellow in keeping me alive even for seven days You might have obtained your fare to London from the authorities of the Casino Hardly I lost very little at roulette I am not such a fool My losses are nearly all in bets over the pigeon shooting match which I ought to have won I was backing myself at a game where I was apparently sure to succeed Until you were beaten by a woman s voice Yes wizard I am too dazed to wonder at you sufficiently Yet I would have lost fifty times for her sake though it was for her sake that I wanted to win Come let us smoke Sit down and tell me all about it They took the nearest seat lighting cigarettes The guard watching them from the shade of a huge palm tree murmured Holy Virgin what madmen are these English They move apart unknown they fight they fraternize they consume tobacco all within five minutes And he lovingly felt for the louis to assure himself that he was not dreaming There is not much to tell said Mensmore who had quite recovered his self control and was now trying to sum up the man who had so curiously entered his life at the moment when he had decided to do away with it I came here being a poor chap living mostly on my wits to go in for the pigeon shooting tournaments I won several and was in fair funds Then I fell in love The girl is rich well connected and all that sort of thing She is the first good influence that has crossed my life so I thought that perhaps my luck was now going to turn I backed myself for all I was worth and more to win the championship If it came off I should have won over Lthree thousand As it is I owe Lfive hundred which must be paid on Monday My total assets after I settled my hotel bill and sent a cheque to a chum who took some of my bets in his own name was Lsixteen Now I have nothing So you see Yes interrupted Bruce it is a hard case But death is no settlement Nobody gets paid and everybody is worried My dear fellow my life is in your keeping for seven days After that I presume I take myself in charge again The barrister took thought for a while before he inquired Why did you go to the Casino to night if you did not patronize the tables as a rule The other colored somewhat and laughed sarcastically Just a final bit of folly I dreamt that my luck had turned Dreamt Yes last night Three times did I imagine that I was playing roulette and that after a certain number whether thirteen or twenty three I was uncertain turned up there was a run of seventeen on the red The funny thing is that I had an impression that the number was twenty three but with a doubt that it might be thirteen I remember during a sub conscious state in the third dream resolving to listen and look more carefully to discover the exact number But again things got blurred The only clear point was that the run of seventeen on the red commenced at once Well Well I took my remaining cash went to the Casino became a bit impatient when neither number turned up for quite a while and when thirteen appeared I backed the red But four times it was the black that won So I saw Have you been keeping guard over me Yes in a sort of way You are a queer chap I can t help saying that I am obliged to you But it won t do any good I am absolutely dead broke Now listen to me I will pay your fare back to London and give you something to live on until I return a week hence Then you must come to see me and I will help you into some sort of situation But you must once and for all abandon this notion of suicide What about my debts Confound your debts Tell people to wait until you are able to pay them And and the girl If she is worth having she will give you a chance of making a living sufficient to enable you to marry her She is of age I suppose and can marry any one she likes Mensmore puffed his cigarette in silence for fully a minute Then he said You are a very decent sort mister Bruce Claude Bruce is my name Well mister Bruce you propose to hand me Lten for my railway fare and say Lfive for my existence until we meet again in London in exchange for which you purchase the rights in my life indefinitely accidents and reasonable wear and tear excepted Exactly Make it Ltwenty with five louis down and I accept Why the stipulation I want to back my dream The number is twenty three It evidently was not thirteen I want to see that thing through I will back the red after twenty three turns up and if I lose I shall be quite satisfied What if I refuse Then I don t care a bit what happens during the next seven days After that au revoir should we happen to meet across the divide Please make up your mind quickly That run on the red may come and go while we are sitting here Bruce opened his pocket book Here he said with a smile I will give you four hundred francs You will reach the maximum more quickly if you are right Mensmore s face lit up with excitement By Jove you are a brick he said So you really trust me Yes Then give me back my revolver Without a word Bruce handed him the weapon Mensmore extracted the cartridges and threw them into a clump of shrubs Come he cried come with me to the Casino You will see something This is not my own luck it is borrowed Come quick They raced off Bruce himself being more fired with the zest of the thing than he cared to admit Within the Casino all the tables were now crowded but Mensmore hurried to that at which he sat during his earlier visit It was here that I played in my dream he whispered soon after I came to it He edged through the onlookers closely followed by Bruce Neither cared for the scowls and injured looks cast at them by the people whom they forced out of the way The Italian the winner of half an hour ago had come back like a moth to the candle Now he was getting his wings singed At last with a groan he hastily rose but as a final effort flung the maximum six thousand francs on the black The disc whirled and slowly slackened pace the ball rested in one of the little squares and the croupier s monotonous words came Vingt trois rouge impair et passe Out bounced the Italian and Mensmore seized his chair turning to Bruce with white face as he murmured You hear Twenty three The barrister nodded and placed his hands on Mensmore s shoulders as though to steady him Mensmore staked his ten louis on the red They became twenty then forty Another whirl and they were eighty A fourth made them one hundred and sixty Mensmore was now so agitated that the table and the players swam before his eyes But Bruce under the stress of exciting circumstances had the gift of remaining preternaturally cool At the fifth coup the sum to Mensmore s credit was Ltwo hundred fifty six He would have left it all on the table had not Bruce withdrawn Lsixteen in notes as the maximum is Ltwo hundred forty When Mensmore won the sixth and seventh coups a buzz of animated interest passed around the board People began to note the run on the red together with the fact that a man was staking the maximum each time Even the croupiers cast fleeting glances at the new comer when several times in succession the long rake pushed across the table the little pile of money and notes Thenceforth Mensmore sat in a state of stupor more pronounced now that he was playing and awake than when he dreamt he was playing Each time he mechanically staked the maximum and received back twice as much while the eager onlookers now burst into cries of wonder that brought others running from all parts of the room But Bruce did not lose count When the red had turned up seventeen times and the amount to Mensmore s credit was Lthree thousand one hundred twenty eight he shook the latter violently as he was about to shove forward another maximum and of his own volition placed the money on the black Douze noir pair et manque sang out the croupier and Bruce hissed into Mensmore s ear Get up at once His strangely made acquaintance obeyed gathered up his gold and notes fastened them securely in an inner pocket and the pair quitted the Casino amid extravagant protestations of good will and friendship from all the voluble foreigners present having attracted not a little attention from the less demonstrative Americans and English in the room It was some time before the roulette tables began their orderly round again for Mensmore s sensational performance was in everybody s mouth The highest recorded sum is twenty three on the black but a run of eighteen on the red is sufficiently remarkable to keep Monte Carlo in talk for a week Albert Mensmore certainly could not complain that the events of the particular evening were dull For one hour at least he lived in the fire that consumes for he stepped back from the porch of dishonored death to find himself the possessor of a sum more than sufficient for his reasonable requirements The pace was rapid and almost fatal CHAPTER X SOME GOOD RESOLUTIONS Once safe in the seclusion of Claude s sitting room Mensmore almost collapsed The strain had been a severe one and now he had to pay the penalty by way of reaction The barrister forced him to swallow a stiff brandy and soda and then wished him to retire to rest but the other protested with some show of animation Let me talk for goodness sake he cried I cannot be alone You have seen me through a lot of trouble to night Stick to me for another hour there s a good fellow With pleasure Perhaps it is the best thing you can do after all Let us see how much you have won Bruce made a calculation on a sheet of paper and said Exclusive of the original stake of ten louis you ought to have Lthree thousand one hundred twenty eight Mensmore pulled out of his pocket the crumpled bundle of notes and bills Claude s notes were among them and he tossed them across the table with a smile There s your capital I will see if the total is all right before we go shares Claude nodded and Mensmore began to jot down the items of his valuable package He bothered with the figures for some time but could not get them right Finally he tossed everything over to the other saying No matter how I count I can t get this calculation straight Seventeen coups beginning with ten louis work out at Lthree thousand one hundred twenty eight all right enough But in this lot there is Lthree thousand three hundred sixty eight and they don t pay twice at the Casino The barrister thought for a moment and then laughed heartily I remember now he said I kept careful count of the series of seventeen or eighteen to be exact On my own account as you were too dazed to notice anything I put a maximum on the black Your dream turned up trumps as the series stopped and black won Hence the odd Ltwo hundred forty Then that is yours said the other gravely I will take Leleven twenty eight to square all my debts and we go shares in the balance a thousand each if you think that fair If not I will gladly hand over the lot after paying my debts I mean Mensmore s seriousness impressed the barrister more than any other incident of that dramatic evening You forget he replied that I told you I had money in plenty for my own needs You must keep every farthing except my own Leight which you do not now need No Please do not argue I will consent to no other course This turn of Fortune s wheel should provide you with sufficient capital to branch out earnestly in your career whatever it be I will ask my interest in different manner I can never repay you in gratitude at any rate And there is another who will be thankful to you when she knows Ask anything you like Make any stipulation you please I agree to it It is a bargain Sign this Bruce took a sheet of notepaper bearing the crest of the Hotel du Cercle dated it and wrote I promise that for the space of twelve months I will not make a bet of any sort or gamble at any game of chance When Mensmore read the document his face fell a little Won t you except pigeon shooting he said I am sure to beat that Russian next time I can allow no exceptions But why limit me for twelve months Because if in that time you do not gain sense enough to stop risking your happiness even your life upon the turn of a card or the flight of a bird the sooner thereafter you shoot yourself the less trouble you will bring upon those connected with you You are a rum chap murmured Mensmore and you put matters pretty straight too However here goes You don t bar me from entering for sweepstakes He signed the paper and tossed it over to Bruce while the latter did not comment upon the limitation of his intentions imposed by Mensmore s final sentence The man undoubtedly was a good shot and during his residence in the Riviera he might pick up some valuable prizes And now said the barrister may I ask as a friend to what use you intend to put your newly found wealth Oh that is simple enough I have to pay Lfive hundred which I lost in bets over that beastly unlucky match Then I have a splendid spec into which I will now be able to place about Ltwo thousand a thing which I have good reason to believe will bring me in at least ten thou within the year and there is nearly a thousand pounds to go on with And all thanks to you Never mind thanking me I am only too glad to have taken such a part in the affair I will not forget this night as long as I live Nor I Just think of it I might be lying in the gardens now or in some mortuary with half my head blown off Tell me said Bruce between the contemplative puffs of a cigar what induced you to think of suicide It was a combination of circumstances replied the other You must understand that I was somewhat worried about financial and family matters when I came to Monte Carlo It was not to gamble in a sense that I remained here I have loafed about the world a good deal but I may honestly say I never made a fool of myself at cards or backing horses At most kinds of sport I am fairly proficient and in pigeon shooting which goes on here extensively I am undoubtedly an expert For instance all this season I have kept myself in funds simply by means of these competitions His hearer nodded approvingly Well in the midst of my minor troubles I must needs go and fall over head and ears in love a regular bad case She is the first woman I ever spoke two civil words to We met at a picnic along the Corniche Road and she sat upon me so severely that I commenced to defend myself by showing that I was not such a surly brute as I looked By Jove in a week we were engaged The barrister indulged in a judicial frown No It s none of your silly sentimental affairs in which people part and meet months afterwards with polite inquiries after each other s health I am not made that way neither is Phil Phyllis is her name you know This is for life I am just bound up in her and she would go through fire and water for me But she is rich the only daughter of a Midland iron master with tons of money Her people are awfully nice and I think they approve of me though they have no idea that Phil and I are engaged He paused to gulp down a strong decoction of brandy and soda The difficult part of his story was coming You can quite believe he continued that I did not want to ask her father Sir William Browne he was knighted by the late Queen for his distinguished municipal services to give his daughter to a chap who hadn t a cent He supposes I am fairly well off living as I do and I can t bear acting under false pretences I hate it like poison though in this world a man often has to do what he doesn t like However this time I determined to be straight and above board It was a very odd fact but I just wanted Lthree thousand to enable me to make a move which I tell you ought to result in a very fair sum of money sufficient at any rate to render it a reasonable proposition for Phil and me to get married Claude was an appreciative listener These love stories of real life are often so much more dramatic than the fictions of the novel or the stage The opportunity came to my mind in this big tournament I had no difficulty of getting odds in six or seven to one to far more than I was able to pay if I lost Phil came into the scheme with me she knows all about me you know and we both regarded it as a certainty Then the collapse came She wanted to get the money from her mother to enable me to pay up but I would not hear of it I pretended that I could raise the wind some other way The fact is I was wild with myself and with my luck generally Then there was the disgrace of failing to settle on Monday combined with the general excitement of that dream and a fearfully disturbed night To make a long story short I thought the best thing to do was to try a final plunge and if it failed to quit I even took steps to make Phil believe I was a bad lot so that she might not fret too much after me Mensmore s voice was a little unsteady in this last sentence The barrister tried to cheer him by a little bit of raillery I hope you have not succeeded too well he laughed Oh it is all right now I mean that I left her some papers which would bring things to her knowledge that unexplained by me would give any one a completely false impression The subject was evidently a painful one so Bruce did not pursue it About this speculation of yours he said Are you sure it s all right and that you will not lose your money It is as certain as any business can be It is a matter I thoroughly understand but I will tell you all about it If you will pardon me a moment I will bring you the papers as I should like to have your advice and it is early yet You don t want to go to bed I suppose Not for hours Mensmore rose but before he reached the door a gentle tap heralded the appearance of the hall porter There is a letter for the gentleman Monsieur is not in his room He is reported to be here so I bring it Mensmore took the note read it with a smile and a growing flush and handed it to the barrister saying Under the circumstances I think you ought to see this Isn t she a brick The tiny missive ran Dearest One You must forgive me but we are both so miserable about that wretched money that I told mother everything She likes you and though she gave me a blowing up she has promised to give me Lfive hundred to morrow We can never thank her sufficiently Do come around and see me for a minute I will be in the verandah until eleven Ever yours PHYLLIS Claude returned the note Luck you re the luckiest fellow in the South of France he said Why here s the mother plotting with the daughter on your behalf Sir William hasn t the ghost of a chance Off you go to that blessed verandah When Mensmore had quitted the hotel Bruce descended to the bureau to take up the threads of his neglected quest The letter to Sydney H Corbett was still unclaimed and he thought he was justified in examining it On the reverse of the envelope was the embossed stamp of an electric lighting company so the contents were nothing more important than a bill An hour later Mensmore joined him in the billiard room radiant and excited Great news he said I squared everything with Lady Browne Told her I was only chaffing Phil about the five hundred because she spoiled my aim by shrieking out Sir William has chartered a steam yacht to go for a three weeks cruise along the Gulf of Genoa and the Italian coast They have put him up to ask me in the morning to join the party Great Scott what a night I m having They parted soon afterwards and next morning Bruce was informed that his friend had gone out early leaving word that he had been summoned to breakfast at the Grand Hotel where Sir William Browne was staying During the afternoon Mensmore came to him like a whirlwind We re off to day he said By the way where shall I find you in London The barrister gave him his address and Mensmore handing him a card said My permanent address is given here the Orleans Club saint James s But I will look you up first I shall be in town early in March And you Oh I shall be home much sooner Good bye and don t let your good luck spoil you No fear Wait until you know Phyllis She would keep any fellow all right once he got his chance as I have done Good bye and and God bless you During the next three days Bruce devoted himself sedulously to the search for Corbett He inquired in every possible and impossible place but the man had utterly vanished Nor did he come to claim his letter at the Hotel du Cercle It remained stuck on the baize covered board until it was covered with dust and the clerk of the bureau had grown weary of watching people who scrutinized the receptacle for their correspondence Others came and asked for Corbett sharp featured men with imperials and long moustaches the interest taken in the man was great but unrequited He never appeared At last the season ended the hotel was closed and the mysterious letter was shot into the dustbin CHAPTER XI THEORIES Bruce announced his departure from Monte Carlo by a telegram to his valet Nevertheless he did not expect to find that useful adjunct to his small household Smith and his wife comprised the barrister s menage standing on the platform at Charing Cross when the mail train from the Continent steamed into the station Smith who had his doubts about this sudden trip to the Riviera was relieved when he saw his master was alone Sir Charles Dyke called this afternoon sir he explained I told Sir Charles about your wire sir and he is very anxious that you should dine with him to night You can dress at Portman Square and if I come with you Yes I understand Bundle everything into a four wheeler Sir Charles thought you might come sir so he sent his carriage London looked dull but familiar as they rolled across Leicester Square and up Regent Street Your true Cockney knows that he is out of his latitude when the sky is blue overhead Let him hear the tinkle of the hansoms bells through a dim fog laden atmosphere and he knows where he is There is but one London and Cockneydom is the order of Melchisedek Claude s heart was glad within him to be home again even though the band was just gathering in the Casino gardens and the lights of Monaco were beginning to gleam over the moon lit expanse of the Mediterranean At Wensley House the traveller was warmly welcomed by the baronet who seemed to have somewhat recovered his health and spirits Nevertheless Bruce was distressed to note the ineffaceable signs of the suffering Sir Charles Dyke had undergone since the disappearance of his wife He had aged quite ten years in appearance Deep lines of sorrowful thought had indented his brow his face was thinner his eyes had acquired a wistful look his air was that of a man whose theory of life had been forcibly reversed At first both men fought shy of the topic uppermost in their minds but the after dinner cigar brought the question to Dyke s lips And now Claude have you any further news concerning my wife s death The barrister noted the struggle before the final word came The husband had then resigned all hope I have none he answered That is to say I have nothing definite I promised to tell you everything I did so I will keep my promise but you will of course differentiate between facts and theories The baronet nodded an agreement In the first place said Bruce let me ask you whether or not you have seen Jane Harding the missing maid Yes It seems that she called here twice before she caught me at home At first she was very angry about a squabble there had been between Thompson and herself I refused to listen to it Then she told me how you had found her at some theatre and she volunteered an explanation of her extraordinary behavior She said that she had unexpectedly come into a large sum of money and that it had turned her head She was sorry for the trouble her actions had caused so under the circumstances I allowed her to take away certain clothes and other belongings she had left here Did she ask for these things Yes Made quite a point of it Did you see them No So you do not know whether they were of any value or the usual collection of rubbish found in servants boxes I have not the slightest notion Have they ever been thoroughly examined by any one Pon my honor I believe not Now that you remind me of it I think the girl seemed rather anxious on that point I remember my housekeeper telling me that Harding had asked her if her clothes had been ransacked by the detectives And what did the housekeeper say She will tell you herself Let us have her up Don t trouble her If I remember aright the police did not examine Jane Harding s room They simply took your report and the statements of the other servants while the housekeeper was responsible for the partial search made through the girl s boxes for some clue that might lead to her discovery That is so The barrister smoked in silence for a few minutes until Sir Charles broke out rather querulously I suppose I did wrong in letting Harding take her traps No said Bruce It is I who am to blame There is something underhanded about this young woman s conduct The story about the sudden wealth is all bunkum in one sense That she did receive a bequest or gift of a considerable sum cannot be doubted That she at once decided to go on the stage is obvious But what is the usual course for a servant to pursue in such cases Would she not have sought first to glorify herself in the sight of her fellow servants and even of her employers Would there not have been the display of a splendid departure in a hansom with voluble directions to the driver for the benefit of the footman As it was Jane Harding acted suddenly precipitately under the stress of some powerful emotion I cannot help believing that her departure from this house had some connection however remote with Lady Dyke s disappearance Good heavens Claude you never told me this before True but when we last met I had not the pleasure of Miss Marie le Marchant s acquaintance I wish to goodness I had rummaged her boxes before she carried them off And I sincerely echo your wish said Sir Charles testily It always seems somehow that I am to blame You must not take that view I really wonder Dyke that you have not closed up your town house and gone off to Scotland for the fag end of the shooting season You won t hunt I know but a quiet life on the moors would bring you right away from associations which must have bitter memories for you I would have done so but I cannot tear myself away while there is the slightest chance of the mystery attending my wife s fate being unravelled I feel that I must remain here near you You are the only man who can solve the riddle if it ever be solved By the way what of Raleigh Mansions The baronet obviously nerved himself to ask the question The reason was patent His wife s inexplicable visit to that locality was in some way connected with her fate and the common sense view was that some intrigue lay hidden behind the impenetrable wall of ignorance that shrouded her final movements Bruce hesitated for a moment Was there any need to bring missus Hillmer s name into the business At any rate he could fully answer Sir Charles without mentioning her at this juncture The only person in Raleigh Mansions who interests me just now is one who to use a convenient bull is not there Yes This person occupies a flat in No twelve his name is Sydney H Corbett and he left his residence for the Riviera two days after your wife was lost Now who on earth can he be I am as sure as a man may be of anything that no one of that name was in the remotest way connected with either my wife or myself for the last let me see six years at any rate Possibly But you cannot say that Lady Dyke may not have met him previously The baronet winced at the allusion as though a whip had struck him For heaven s sake Claude he cried do not harbor suspicions against her I cannot bear it I tell you my whole soul revolts at the idea I would rather be suspected of having killed her myself than listen to a word whispered against her good name I sympathize with you but you must not jump at me in that fashion One hypothesis is as wildly impossible as the other I did not say that Lady Dyke went to Raleigh Mansions on account of some present or bygone transgression of her own I would as soon think of my mother in such a connection But a pure good woman will often do on behalf of others what she will not do for herself Really Dyke you must not be unjust to me especially when you force me to tell you what may prove to be mere theories Others What others I cannot say I wish I could If I once lay hold of the reason that brought Lady Dyke to Raleigh Mansions I will within twenty four hours tell you who murdered her Of that I am as certain as that the sun will rise to morrow And the barrister poked the fire viciously to give vent to the annoyance that his friend s outburst had provoked Pardon me Bruce Do not forget how I have suffered what I am suffering and try to bear with me I never valued my wife while she lived It is only now that I feel the extent of my loss If my own life would only restore her to me for an instant I would cheerfully give it If ever man meant his words this man did His agitation moved the kindly hearted barrister to rise and place a gentle hand on his shoulder I am sorry Dyke he said that the conversation has taken this turn These speculative guesses at potential clues distress you If you took my advice you would not worry about events until at least something tangible turns up Perhaps it is best so murmured the other In any event it is of little consequence I cannot live long Oh nonsense You are good for another fifty years Come shake off this absurd depression You can do no good by it I wish now I had taken you with me to Monte Carlo The fresh air would have braced you up while I hunted for Corbett Did you find him No but I dropped in for an adventure that would cheer the soul of any depressed author searching vainly for an idea for a short story What was it Claude who possessed no mean skill as a raconteur gave him the history of the Casino incident and the thrilling denouement so interested the baronet that he lit another cigar Did you ascertain the names of the parties he said Oh yes You will respect their identity as the sensational side of the affair had better now be buried in oblivion though of course all the world knows about the way we scooped the bank The lady is a daughter of Sir William Browne a worthy knight from Warwickshire and her rather rapid swain is a youngster named Mensmore Mensmore shouted the baronet A youngster you say and Sir Charles bounced upright in his excitement Why yes a man of twenty five No more than twenty eight I can swear Do you know him Albert Mensmore That s the man beyond doubt Dyke hastily poured out some whiskey and water and swallowed it Then he spoke with a faint smile You didn t know Bruce he said that you vividly described the attempted self murder of a man I know intimately What an extraordinary thing Yet I never remember hearing you mention his name Probably not I have hardly seen him since my marriage We were schoolboys together though I was so much his senior that we did not chum together until later when we met a good deal on the turf Then he went off roughing it in the States It must be he It is just one of his pranks And he is going to marry eh Is she a nice girl The baronet was thoroughly excited He talked fast and helped himself liberally to stimulants Yes unusually so But I cannot help marvelling at this coincidence It has upset you Not a bit I was interested in your yarn and naturally I was unprepared for the startling fact that an old friend of mine filled the chief part What a fellow you are Claude for always turning up at the right time I have never been in a tight place personally but if I were I suppose you would come along and show me the way out Sit down again and give me all the details I am full of curiosity Bruce had never before seen Sir Charles in such a hysterical mood The anguish of the past three months had changed the careless jovial baronet into a fretful wayward being who had lost control of his emotions Undoubtedly he required some powerful tonic The barrister resolved to see more of him in the future and not to cease urging him until he had started on a long sea voyage or taken up some hobby that would keep his mind from brooding upon the everlasting topic of his wife s strange death Dyke s fitful disposition manifested itself later After he had listened with keen attention to all that Bruce had told him concerning Mensmore and Phyllis Browne he suddenly swerved back to the one engrossing thought What are you going to do about Corbett he asked Find him But how People are always tied to a centre by a string and no matter how long the string may be it contracts sooner or later Corbett will turn up at Raleigh Mansions and before very many weeks have passed if I mistake not And then Then he will have to answer me a few pertinent questions But suppose he knows nothing whatever about the business In that case I must confess the clue is more tangled than ever It would be curious if Corbett and Jane Harding were in any way associated If they were it would take much to convince me that one or both could not supply at least some important information bearing on my on our quest If mister White even knew as much as I do about them he would arrest them at sight Oh he s a thick headed chap is White By the way that reminds me He got hold of the maid it seems before she had bolted and made her give him some of my wife s clothes By that means he established some sort of a theory about About a matter on which we differ put in Bruce quietly Let us talk of something else The other moved restlessly in his chair but yielded For the remainder of the evening they discussed questions irrelevant to the course of this narrative It was late when they separated but Bruce found Smith sitting up for him at home That faithful servitor bustled about stirring the fire and turning up the lights Finally he nervously addressed his master Pardon me sir but there was a policeman here asking about you to night sir A policeman Well sir a detective mister White of Scotland Yard I knew him sir though he did not think it He came about ten o clock and asked where you were Did you tell him Well sir and Smith shifted from one foot to the other I thought it best to let him know the truth sir Good gracious Smith he is not going to handcuff me You did quite right What did he say Nothing sir except that he would call again He wouldn t leave his name but I know d him all right Thank you Good night It was unnecessary that you should have remained up But I am obliged to you all the same The barrister laughed as he went to his room Really he said to himself still highly amused White will cap all his previous feats by trying to arrest me I suspect he has thought of it for a long time And mister White had thought of it CHAPTER XII WHO CORBETT WAS Inexorable Fate is a favorite phrase with the makers of books but Fate being feminine according to the best authorities is also somewhat fickle in disposition Not only is she not invariably inexorable but at times she delights to play with her poor subjects to dazzle them with surprise as it were to stupefy them with the sense of their sheer inability to foresee or understand her vagaries It was Bruce s turn to receive the sharpest lesson in this respect that he ever remembered At breakfast the next morning he selected from a packet of unimportant letters one which required immediate attention The financiers to whom he had written in conformity with his implied promise to mister Dodge had replied favorably with reference to the reconstruction of the Springbok Mine They informed Bruce confidentially that a thoroughly reliable man in Johannesburg to whom they had cabled reported very strongly in favor of the property They would await his written statement before finally committing themselves Meanwhile if Messrs Dodge Son company Limited were anxious to get the business advanced a stage there was no reason why he Bruce should not assure them that subject to the first satisfactory report being confirmed his clients would underwrite the shares The whole thing would thus go through in about three weeks As for Bruce himself they proposed to give him a commission of five per cent in fully paid shares for the introduction Well I never he laughed Now who would have thought such a thing possible Why if that rascal Dodge is right and this company is really a sound undertaking my share of the deal will be Lten thousand It seems wildly incredible yet my friends know what they are writing about as a rule An hour later he was in the city A smart brougham stood in front of the now thoroughly renovated offices of Dodge Son company Limited and out of it at the moment the barrister detached himself from the chaos of Leadenhall Street stepped the head of the firm He was making up the steps when Claude cried Hello mister Dodge how is the junior partner Dodge stopped focussed Bruce with his sharp eyes and smiled Oh it is you is it The young un is all right thanks Are you coming in That was my intention Come along then I was hoping I would see you one of these days Has business improved recently inquired Bruce as they entered the inner office Yes somewhat but money is very tight still However we generally look for a spurt early in the New Year Why do you ask No valid reason A mere hazard Was it because you saw me drive up in a carriage mister Dodge I never dreamt that self consciousness was a failing of the members of the Stock Exchange Then that was the cause I guessed it I have been making inquiries about you mister Bruce and there is no use in trying to fool you not a bit Have you another Springbok proposition on hand No bar chaffing You were the man who ferreted out the truth about that West Australian combination when everybody else had failed And now I think of it you made me talk a lot the last time you were here However I am ready Fire away I will tell you the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me Sh s sh Do not perjure yourself for the sake of alliteration Besides it is I who have come to talk this time About Springboks Yes The people I mentioned to you at my previous visit are prepared to underwrite the shares provided that their agent s report is as favorable in its entirety as a telegraphic summary leads them to believe Eh That s good news When will they be in a position to complete As soon as they hear from South Africa by post Say three weeks So long But suppose I get an offer from some other quarter in the meantime I cannot keep the proposal open indefinitely I have not asked you to do so mister Dodge Let me see three shillings per share on say two hundred thousand shares is Lthirty thousand It is a good deal of money If any one likes to hand you a cheque for that amount without preliminary investigation take it by all means The notion tickled Dodge immensely All right mister Bruce When people of that sort turn up we don t sell em Springboks in the City But there is no harm in you telling me your clients names Not in the least They are the Anglo African Finance Corporation mister Dodge whistled By Jove they re the best backing I could have This is a good turn mister Bruce and I shan t forget it You see we re a young firm and association with well known houses is good for us in every sense I m jolly glad now that Springboks are all right It would never have done for me to introduce them to a risky piece of business I am really much obliged to you And now how do we stand Kindly explain How much com do you want Nothing mister Dodge moved his chair backward several feet in sheer amazement Nothing my dear sir Nonsense It is a big affair Shall we say one per cent in cash or two in shares I am not very well off just now or Pray don t trouble yourself I have already secured my commission five per cent in fully paid shares But the people who put up the money don t pay for the privilege as a rule That I know quite well This case is different I am not nor ever have been a financial go between Didn t you come to see me about the deal in the first instance It was Bruce s turn to hesitate Not exactly he said I really wanted to know something about mister Corbett and the Springbok business arose out of it Ah that chap Corbett I have been thinking about him I wonder who he can be Anyhow I owe him my best wishes as the mention of his name has had such excellent results Well that is all said Bruce rising Yes thanks I must now see about raising the money to pay my own call I am interested in fifty thousand shares you know Then you require some Lseven thousand five hundred Yes But that will be easy when I can say that the Anglo African Finance people are with me Besides this morning queer you should call immediately afterwards I have had some wholly unexpected news Indeed mister Dodge was in a talkative vein and Bruce was in no hurry The very best went on Dodge gleefully You see there is another man in this affair with me I thought he was as stony broke as I am myself speaking confidentially you know when he suddenly writes to me saying that he had won a pot of money at Monte Carlo and could spare me Ltwo thousand What s the matter Beastly trying weather isn t it Try a nip of brandy For once in his life the self possessed barrister had blanched at a sudden revelation But this was too much He felt as though a meteorite had fallen on his head Nevertheless he grappled with the situation Ill No he cried How stupid of me I have forgotten my morning smoke May I light a cigar With pleasure You know these Try one You were saying That s all This young fellow Mensmore his name is got mixed up with me over a Californian mine I thought he had lots of coin so when Springboks came along he and I went shares in underwriting them The public didn t feed so we were loaded I tried all I knew to get him to pay up but he absolutely couldn t And now at the very moment affairs look promising he writes offering Ltwo thousand More than that he says if necessary he can get the remainder of his half Lseventeen fifty from somebody Where is his letter mister Dodge looked on his table Oh here it is Addressed from Yacht White Heather if you please Quite swell eh Sir William Browne That s the covey I think I will let Sir William have em It s a good solid sort of name to have on the share register I would if I were you said Bruce hardly conscious of his surroundings If you think so I will By Jove this has been a good morning for me Come and have lunch No thanks I have a lot to attend to By the way where did Mensmore live I don t know His address was always at the Orleans Club Somehow Bruce reached the street and a hansom As the vehicle rolled off westward he crouched in a corner and tried to wrestle with the problem that befogged his brain Was Albert Mensmore Sydney H Corbett Was he missus Hillmer s brother The Bertie she had spoken of meant Albert as well as a hypothetical Herbert Mensmore was an old schoolfellow of Sir Charles Dyke s In all probability he knew Lady Dyke as well He lived in Raleigh Mansions under an assumed name and quitted his abode two days after the murder Every circumstance pointed to the terrible assumption that at Mensmore s hands the unfortunate lady met her death And Bruce had sworn to avenge her memory He laughed with savage mirth as he reflected that he himself had helped this man to escape the punishment of Providence self inflicted It was indeed pitifully amusing to think how the clever detective had used his powers to befool himself The very openness of the clue had helped to conceal it the more effectually Were it not for Dodge and his Springboks he might have gone on indefinitely covering up the criminal s tracks by his own friendly actions The situation was maddening intolerable Bruce wanted to seize the reins and flog the horse into a mad gallop through the traffic as a relief to his feelings Blissfully unconscious of the living volcano he carried within the cabby on the perch did not indulge in any such illegal antics He quietly drove along the Embankment and delivered his seething fare at his Victoria street chambers Quite oblivious of commonplace affairs the barrister threw a shilling to the driver and darted out The man gazed at his Majesty s image with the air of one who had never before seen such a coin It might have been a Greek obolus so utter was his blank astonishment But Bruce was across the pavement and cabby had to find words else it would be too late Here guv nor he yelled what the ballyhooley do you call this What s the matter was the impatient query Matter The cabman looked towards the sky to see if the heavens were falling Matter in a higher key as a crowd began to gather I tykes him from Leaden all Street to Victoria E gives me a bob an e arsks me wot s the matter I d been on the ranks four bloomin hours Oh there you are and Bruce threw him half a crown before he disappeared up the steps mister White was watching for Bruce s arrival He wondered why the barrister was so perturbed and resolved to strike while the iron was hot So he too vanished into the interior CHAPTER XIII A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE If any one calls I am out cried Claude to his factotum as he crossed the entrance hall of his well appointed flat and flung open the door of his library The guv nor s in a tantrum observed Smith to his wife and he settled himself to renew the perusal of Grand National training reports He had just noticed the interesting fact that last year s winner had jumped in for the last mile in a gallop given to a rank outsider when the electric bell upset his calculations My master is out he said as he opened the door to find mister White standing on the mat He was about to close the door again but the detective planted his foot against the jamb Your master is not out he answered I saw him come in a minute since Tell him mister White wants to see him Smith s dignity was superb My master may be hin he cried but e told me to say e was hout to callers The aspirates supplied emphasis Tell him what I say at once and mister White gave him his best accessory after the crime glance I don t see why I should snarled Smith but the squabble ended when Bruce s voice was heard Show him in Smith but admit nobody else With an air of armed neutrality Smith ushered the representative of Scotland Yard into the library You re not looking very well sir said White his round eyes fixed on Bruce with all their power Was it to ask about my health that you came No sir not exactly But I haven t seen you for quite a while and as we are both interested in the same matter I thought I would look you up and compare notes Bruce was annoyed by the interruption He wanted to think not to be bothered by official theories He looked hard at mister White wondering whether he should tell him all he knew and wash his own hands clear of the investigation in future But there was a second picture before his eyes He saw Phyllis Browne s face not as it was that day at the Tir aux Pigeons but with the light of happiness in it with the joyousness of requited and undisturbed love with the glow reflected from dancing waves and the tremulous smile of innocent pleasure It was hard to believe that such a woman could place her heartfelt trust in a man who was possibly a cold blooded murderer Such a combination was unnatural and horrible Already Bruce was beginning to doubt the evidence of his analytical senses mister White meanwhile flattered himself by the thought that the other was trying to read his thoughts by looking at him fixedly I have been away from home said Bruce at last I had occasion to go to the South of France I thought so I was sure of it How do you manage always to get ahead of us mister White was enthusiastic in his admiring divination You have heard about Sydney H Corbett said the barrister still keeping that inscrutable calculating gaze upon the policeman Yes I am on his track We may be slow but we are sure in Scotland Yard May I ask what luck you have had sir In what respect As if you didn t go to Monte Carlo to find Corbett yourself Really mister Bruce the scent is too hot this time You might as well give a View halloa if you have seen him Seen Sydney H Corbett you mean That is the gentleman For an instant Mensmore s future trembled in the balance Bruce almost framed the words which would have led to his immediate arrest at the next port touched by the White Heather But the memory of Phyllis Browne of her agony of the fearful scandal that must fly through Society on the Riviera restrained him There was no hurry He must have time to think I certainly went to Monte Carlo to discover the identity of that interesting personage but I came back mister White as wise as I went The only trace I found of him was an undelivered letter awaiting him at the Hotel du Cercle A letter Wasn t he there mister White s face notwithstanding its official decorum betrayed its disappointment This was an unlooked for check He had been there Other letters came for him earlier and he had received them But the hotel people Did not know him In fact there cannot be the slightest doubt that mister Corbett concealed his identity at Monte Carlo under another name It doesn t matter much growled the detective We will nab him all the same if he had fifty names Possibly But it is wonderful how a man may be under your very nose and yet you may miss him During the next few minutes neither man spoke Bruce smiled cynically at the thought that he was actually shielding Lady Alice s probable slayer from the minions of the law He marvelled at himself for his irresolution Nevertheless he would wait Mensmore could not escape him now Perhaps the business might be managed without the dramatic features which would accompany an immediate arrest And there were some things that required explanation If his Monte Carlo acquaintance really killed Lady Dyke then he was the strangest criminal whom Bruce had ever encountered during the course of his varied career The policeman misinterpreted his expression You can t laugh at us this time mister Bruce he cried Scotland Yard and yourself evolved the same theory eh And we can t fly off to the South of France as readily as you Your skill is profound no doubt Indeed I wonder at it considering the mysterious way in which the missing man left his address at the post office The other reddened That was simple enough I know but we were on his track before that By watching me when I visited his sister You saw me outside the Jollity Theatre then Of course What did you expect mister White recovered his placidity There s no use quarrelling about it he laughed I did get that wrinkle from you But how on earth were we to know what to do when there were seventy one flats occupied by respectable people and one closed for months the caretaker told us I hope you have ceased your surveillance so far as I am concerned Honor bright sir I won t do it again Besides we must lay hands on Corbett sooner or later What steps are you taking The Monte Carlo police are making inquiries They have his description It has also gone to America Why America Because he spent some time there He only returned from the States early last year His sister has not seen him for years and a rare old row they had when he turned up He had not much money so she helped him and he settled down for a time in the same mansions as herself Who told you all this missus Hillmer and a precious lot of trouble she gave me She is a clever woman that It was rather too bad to pester her about it poor lady I only followed your lead sir This was so true that Claude changed the conversation What sort of man is Corbett Have you his description Yes Here it is mister White produced a copy of the Police Gazette a publication never seen by the public but of a large circulation among the police of the United Kingdom The details were fairly accurate as to Mensmore s personal appearance but there was no photograph Oddly enough Bruce was pleased on noting this serious deficiency You did not secure his picture No missus Hillmer declared that she had not a single photograph of her brother in her possession Did she tell you his real name the barrister had almost said but he deflected the question Did she give you any hint as to a possible cause for this apparently unnecessary crime Not a word Then you did not mention Lady Dyke to her No Sir Charles has always implored me to keep his wife s name out of my inquiries until it became absolutely impossible to conceal it in view of a public prosecution He wants to know definitely when that time comes Why The detective did not reply for a moment When he spoke he leaned forward and subdued his voice I am as sure as I am sitting here sir that Sir Charles will not live if any disgrace should come to be attached to his wife s memory Do you mean that he will kill himself I do He has changed a great deal since this affair happened He is not the same man He appears to be always mooning about her And people say that they were not so devoted to one another when she was alive Again did the barrister switch off their talk from an unpleasant topic This description of Corbett is not much use he said It applies to every athletic young Englishman of good physique and gentlemanly appearance Quite true I don t depend on that for his arrest but it will be valuable for identification Blue eyes light brown hair fresh clear complexion well modelled nose and chin Some of these things can be changed by tricks but not all For instance there would be no use in smoking a man with black eyes and irregular features Smoking him Oh that s our way of putting it Following him it means Suppose the French police don t succeed in catching him We will get him at Raleigh Mansions He is sure to think that Lady Dyke s fate has never been determined and he will return when the inquiry has blown over to all appearance You have quite made up your mind then that Sydney H Corbett is the murderer It looks uncommonly like it At any rate he knows something about it If not why did he bolt to France two days after the crime Why has he concealed his identity Why does he take pains to receive his correspondence in the manner he has adopted And by Jove suppose he isn t in Monte Carlo at all but in London all the time The inspector glowed with his sudden inspiration but Bruce kept him to the lower level of realities Corbett is or was in Monte Carlo Of that you may be sure He and none other got the letters sent to the Hotel du Cercle I cannot for the life of me imagine why he did not take the last one But let us look at what we know Lady Dyke we will say went to Corbett s chambers secretly and of her own accord That may be taken as fairly established Thence there is a blank in our intelligence until she appears as a hardly recognizable corpse stuffed by hands beneath an old drain pipe in the Thames at Putney How do you fill up that gap mister White Simply enough Corbett or some other person persuaded her to voluntarily accompany him to Putney She was killed there and not in London It would be almost a matter of impossibility for any man to have conveyed her lifeless body from Raleigh Mansions to Putney without attracting some notice One man could not do it Several might but it is madness to imagine that a number of people would join together for the purpose of killing this poor lady The seemingly impossible is often accomplished Do you really believe then that she met her death in London I have quite an open mind on the question You forget that she had resolved early that day to visit her sister at Richmond and Putney is on the direct road What more reasonable than to assume Beware of assumptions You are assuming all the time that Corbett was a principal in her murder Very well mister Bruce Then I ask you straight out if you don t agree with me I do not This declaration astounded the barrister himself Often the mere utterance of one s thoughts is a surprise Speech seems to stiffen the wavering outlines of reflection and the new creation may differ essentially from its embryo It was so with Bruce in this instance Ever since mister White s arrival had aroused him from the positive stupor caused by the stock broker s unwitting revelation Claude Bruce had been slowly but definitely deciding that Mensmore did not kill Lady Dyke He had seen him unprepared facing death as preferable to dishonor At such moments a man s soul is laid bare With the shadow of a crime upon his conscience Mensmore s actions could not have been so genuine and straightforward as they undoubtedly were Mensmore of course might in some way be bound up with the mystery surrounding Lady Dyke s movements His very utterance in Bruce s room at the Hotel du Cercle implied as much That was another matter It would receive his Bruce s most earnest attention But the major hypothesis so quickly jumped at by the police needed much more substantiation than it had yet obtained That it was plausible was demonstrated by the barrister s readiness to adopt it at the outset Even now that his impulse to fasten the crime on Mensmore had weakened he wondered at his eagerness to defend him The detective was even more surprised I don t see how you can take that view he cried Corbett s behavior is to say the least unaccountable If he is an innocent man then he must be a foolish one Besides why should he necessarily be innocent This is the first gleam of light we have had in a very dark business and I mean to follow it up The vindictive emphasis of his tone showed that the detective was annoyed at the other s impassive attitude He even went so far as to dimly evolve a theory that the barrister wished to throw him off Corbett s trail on account of his sympathy for missus Hillmer but Claude rapidly dispelled this notion You are here I suppose to ask my advice in pursuance of our understanding that we are working together in the matter as it were he said Well something of the kind sir Then I recommend that we see the inside of that closed flat in Raleigh Mansions at the earliest moment Do you mean by a search warrant Certainly not Do you want the whole neighborhood to know of it You have probably heard of locks being picked before to day You and I and none other must have a quiet look around the place without anyone being the wiser mister White hesitated but the prospect was attractive I think I can manage it he said smiling reflectively Will six this evening suit Admirably Then I will call for you After a parting glance at Smith who returned it nose in air the inspector ran down the stairs murmuring Blest if I can understand mister Bruce But this is a good move We may learn something CHAPTER XIV NO twelve RALEIGH MANSIONS When the door of Corbett s or Mensmore s flat swung open before the skilful application of a skeleton key a gust of cold air swept from the interior blackness and whirled an accumulation of dust down the stairs It is curious how a disused house seems to bottle up as it were an atmospheric accumulation which always seeks to escape at the first available moment Emptiness is more than a mere word it has life and the power of growth A residence closed for a week is less depressing than if it has not been inhabited for a month If the period of neglect be lengthened into a year the sense of dreariness is magnified immeasurably In this instance the mysterious abode might have been the abiding place of disembodied spirits so cold was its aspect so uninviting the dim vista that sprung into uncertain vision under the flickering rays of a wax vesta struck by the detectives But neither the policeman nor his companion was a nervous subject They entered at once closed the door by its latch and aided by other matches found the switch of the electric light In this brighter radiance the indefinable vanished The flat became a cosy fairly well appointed bachelor s diggings neglected and untidy yet not without a semblance of comfort which only needed the presence of a sturdy housemaid and a fire to be converted into the ordinary chambers with which the locality abounds Their first care was to draw down all the blinds the neglect of which housewifely proceeding argued the careless departure of a mere male when the place was vacated A rapid preliminary survey followed and drew from Bruce the remark Furnished by a woman but occupied by a man mister White agreed but he didn t know why so he put a tentative question on the point Don t you see said Bruce that the carpets match the upholstery of the furniture that the beds have valances that the spare bedroom for a guest is even more elaborate than that used by the tenant that care has been taken in fitting up the kitchen and taste displayed in the selection of pieces of bric a brac Only a woman attends to these things On the other hand a card tray has been used as a receptacle for a cigar ash the pictures no woman ever buys a picture have been picked up promiscuously from shops where they sell sporting prints and the sides of the mantelpieces are chipped by having feet propped against them There are plenty of other signs but these suffice Thenceforth the two men devoted themselves to their task each after his kind The representative of Scotland Yard hunted for documents photographs torn envelopes he looked at the covers of books to see if they were inscribed he opened every drawer ransacked every corner peered into the interior of jars pots and ovens appraised the value of furniture noted its age and was specially zealous in studying the appearance of the only bedroom which had been occupied so far as he could judge Bruce having given a casual glance around entered the sitting room selected the most comfortable chair and proceeded to envelope himself in smoke He had not spent two minutes in Mensmore s flat before he made a striking discovery The dwelling consisted of a central passage dividing two equal portions from the other That on the right contained a drawing room and a large bedroom with dressing room attached On the left were another bedroom a dining room a kitchen and a store room At the end of the passage which terminated in the transverse corridor were the bathroom a pantry and a small room empty now but apparently designed for a servant s bedroom The furniture as has been stated was good in quality and sufficient for its purposes But the fact which immediately impressed this skilled observer was that the arrangement of the sitting room differed essentially from the other details of the flat The same care had not been taken in the disposition of the articles They had been dumped down anyhow without taste or regard for suitable position The carpet had not been bought for this special apartment like the carpets elsewhere A handsome ebony cabinet stood in the wrong place The blue china ornaments obviously intended to fill its shelves were littered about the mantelpiece or on small tables while the Satsuma ware meant for the over mantel was stiffly disposed on the cabinet Small matters these but Bruce thought them more fruitful of accurate theory than the detective s hunt for a written history of the crime So as he smoked he mused and examined The drawing room was the last place to be furnished he thought The usual course It remained empty for some time probably The rest of the flat was arranged by a woman missus Hillmer in all likelihood before the arrival of her brother Then he came and tackled the vacant room The history of the place is as plain as though I were present More than that a woman missus Hillmer again let us say fixed upon these latter purchases but without measurements She did not personally see to their adaptability and she certainly did not supervise their final arrangement Now why was that Again these things are more worn than those in the other rooms Were they bought second hand If so why A woman thinks most of her drawing room It is the last place in which she would economize mister White entered anxious and puzzled Found anything inquired Claude without looking at him Not a rag not a piece of old newspaper with a date on it A lot of papers were burned in the kitchen grate but from the remnants I judge that they were mostly bills The place has been systematically cleared eh It looks like it Going to hunt here Yes You don t seem to take much interest in the premises mister Bruce though you persuaded me to do a bit of house breaking in order to get here I find the quietude good for thought mister White Be good enough not to make more noise than is absolutely necessary The other sniffed He was disappointed He hoped for something tangible from this visit and the outlook was far from promising This room appears to have been lived in a good deal he growled That is one way of looking at it Is there any other way His voice snapped out the question as if he held the barrister personally responsible for his failure to gain a clue No mister White I should have guessed your point of view exactly My point of view indeed Do you want me to draw up another chair and light a pipe Should we be enlightened by tobacco smoke I cannot trust your tobacco Try a cigar The detective angrily thumped a Chesterfield lounge to see if it betrayed aught suspicious At that instant Bruce s glance rested on the fireplace The grate contained the ashes of a fire a fire not long lighted This combined with the undrawn blinds argued a departure early in the morning He went to Monte Carlo by the day Channel service mused Bruce He may have departed a few hours after Lady Dyke s death as missus Hillmer was not certain as to the exact date Somehow the few cinders attracted him They had perchance witnessed a tragedy Suddenly he stopped smoking He was so startled by something he had seen that the policeman must have noticed his agitation were not the detective at that instant intently screwing his eyes to peer behind the back of the elaborate cabinet On the hearth was a handsome Venetian fender Into each end was loosely socketed a beautifully moulded piece of ironwork to hold the fire irons That on the left was whole but from that on the right a small spike had been broken off By comparison with its fellow the missing portion was identical with the bit of iron found imbedded in the skull of the murdered woman Of this damning fact Bruce had no manner of doubt though the incriminatory article itself was then locked in a drawer in his own residence He did not move He sat as one transfixed What a weapon for such a deed Was ever more outlandish instrument used with murderous intent The entire bracket could easily be detached from the fender and would no doubt inflict a terrible blow But why seize this clumsy device when it actually supported a heavy brass poker The thing savored of madness of the wild vagary of a homicidal maniac It was incomprehensible strange beyond belief Yet as Bruce pictured the final scene in that tragedy as he saw the ill fated lady stagger helplessly to the ground before a treacherous and crushing stroke a fierce light leaped into his face and his lips set tight with unflinching purpose Had Mensmore been within reach at that moment he would assuredly have been lodged in a felon s cell forthwith No excuse no palliation would be accepted The man who could so foully slay a gentle kindly high minded woman deserved the utmost rigor of the law no matter what the circumstances that led to the commission of the crime It was not often that Bruce allowed impulse to master reason so utterly In strange altruistic mood he asked himself why he did not spring from his chair and tearing the bracket from its supports exhibit it to his fellow worker while he gave in a few passionate sentences the information that would set the French police to scour the Mediterranean littoral until they found the White Heather Of what matter to him was the suffering of a sister or sweetheart Did the man who killed Lady Dyke reck of these things Yes he would do it But a cry of triumph from the detective arrested the fateful words even as they trembled on his lips Here s a find was the shout Thinking is all very well mister Bruce but hard work is better What do you make of that That was a letter which in the manner known to many a puzzled householder had slipped down behind a drawer in the cabinet to be crushed against the wardrobe at the back and lie there forgotten and unnoticed Even in his perturbed state the barrister could not help glancing at the crumpled document first noting the date October fifteenth of the year just closed with the superscription Mountain Butts Wyoming There was no envelope It was addressed to Dear Bertie and ran as follows Your welcome note and its draft for fifty dollars came to hand last week My sisters and I can never forget your generosity We know you are hard up and that you can ill spare these frequent gifts or loans as you are pleased to call them You and I have been in many a tight place old chap and I never knew you to fail either with hand or heart And when we drifted into this ranch on my advice and nearly starved to death it was you who were bold enough to cut yourself adrift so that you might make something to keep the pot boiling But the tide is turning You know my failing this time I will try not to be too sanguine There have been big gold discoveries in this country It is now firmly believed that all our land is auriferous and the scoundrel who sold us this beggarly ranch has tried to upset our title Thanks to your foresight he was knocked out at the first round So I may soon have big news for you By Jove won t it be a change if we both become rich And won t we all have a time in Paris However I must not promise too much I have been taught caution by repeated failures Write by return and say if this reaches you all right Your faithful friend SYDNEY H CORBETT What do you think of that cried the detective when Bruce had slowly mastered the contents of the letter Think I am too dazed to think We can now learn all about him from America About whom About Corbett of course Then did Corbett travel by the same mail as this letter in order to murder Lady Dyke It is dated October fifteenth and she was killed November sixth It takes twelve days at the quickest for a letter to come here from Wyoming And Corbett the writer of it not the receiver must have travelled in the same steamer or its immediate successor mister White s face fell but he stuck to his point Anyhow Corbett was here about that time I have seen the secretary to the company that owns these flats Corbett took the rooms for six months from September first When asked for references he gave his sister s name and as she banks with the National and she has always paid her rent for five years it was good enough Still I must confess that Corbett could hardly be in Wyoming in October if he lived here in September and in November The barrister answered between his set teeth Yes it is rather puzzling Perhaps the letter was left there as a plant An elaborate one It must have been conceived a month before the murder But suppose it never came from Wyoming We have no proof that it was written in America We have proof of nothing at present Well mister Bruce have you a theory This is the place where you ought to shine you know I have no theory I must think for hours for days before I see my way clear Clear to what sir To telling you how when and where to arrest the murderer of Lady Dyke So this find of mine is of great importance Undoubtedly I remember its contents sufficiently but you will let me see it again if necessary With pleasure sir And that reminds me You never returned that small bit of iron to me You recollect I lent it to you some time since Perfectly Come with me I will model it in wax and give it to you All right sir but as we are here I may as well continue my search I may drop on something else of value Bruce resumed his seat and did not stir until the detective had completely rummaged the cabinet The reading of that queer epistle from Corbett to Bertie from the real Simon Pure to the sham one from one man to his double had stopped him at the very threshold of disclosure The document impressed him as being genuine If so who on earth was Corbett and why had Mensmore taken his name if that was the solution of the tangle Whatever the explanation he would not jump to a conclusion The web had closed too securely round Mensmore to allow of escape Hence Bruce could bide his time Another week might solve many elements in the case now indistinct and nebulous He would wait The detective finally satisfied himself there was nothing else in the cabinet He approached the fireplace peered into every vase on the over mantel picked with his penknife at the back of the frame to feel for other letters and in doing so several times kicked the fender The barrister vaguely wondered whether the man of method would note the missing portion of the iron dog Surely he thought he will see it now as mister White bent to examine the ashes and actually took the poker from the very support itself in order to rake among the cinders The other even scrutinized the fire irons but the too obvious fact that so to speak stared him in the face escaped notice He was quite wrapped up in his theory that Lady Dyke had been killed at Putney and not in Sloane Square At last he quitted the room and walked off to the small apartments at the end of the main corridor Instantly Bruce sprang forward fell on his knees and intently examined the iron rest with a strong lens It bore no unusual signs in the locality of the break Taking some wax from his pocket he took a slight impression of the fracture When mister White returned he found the barrister sitting in his chair still smoking and with set face and fixed eyes Soon afterwards they quitted the flat carefully leaving all things as they found them They said little on their way to Victoria Street for Bruce was trying to explain Mensmore s attitude at Monte Carlo and the detective was considering the best use to which he could put that all important letter Besides mister White attributed his companion s silence to annoyance Had not he White laid hands on the only direct piece of evidence yet discovered as to Corbett s identity and this in defiance of Bruce s spoken philosophy He could afford to be generous and not to worry his amateur colleague with questions Thus they reached the barrister s chambers Bruce asked the other to sit down for a moment while he obtained a model of the small lump of iron He took it into his bedroom fitted in into the wax impression obtained at Raleigh Mansions and noted that the two coincided perfectly He handed the bit of iron to White without comment The latter said It had better remain in my keeping now sir but if you want to see it again of course I will be glad I shall never want it again said Bruce and his voice was harsh and cold for he had seldom experienced such a strain as the last hours had given him It is an accursed thing It has caused one death already and may cause others I sincerely hope it will cause a man to be hanged cried the detective for this affair is the warmest I have ever tackled However I ll get him as sure as his name s Corbett if he has forty aliases and as many addresses Smith let mister White out The latter halting for a moment at the door said quietly Is your name Corbett No it ain t any more than yours is Black See Each man thought he had had his joke so they were better friends thenceforth but mister White was thoughtful as he passed into the street This is a funny business he communed There isn t enough evidence against Corbett to hang a cat yet I think he s the man And Bruce is a queer chap Was he cut up about me finding the letter or has he got some notion in his head He s as close as an oyster I wonder if he did dine at Hampstead on the evening of the murder as he said at the inquest I must inquire into it CHAPTER XV missus HILLMER HESITATES I wonder if I shall have such exciting times to day as I had yesterday said Bruce to himself as he unfolded his Times next morning at breakfast Affairs had so jumbled themselves together in his brain the previous evening that he had abandoned all effort to elucidate them He retired to rest earlier than usual to sleep soundly save for a vivid dream in which he was being tried for his life the chief witnesses against him being missus Hillmer Phyllis Browne and Jane Harding the latter varying her evidence by entertaining the Court with a song and dance The weather too had improved It was clear frosty and sunlit one of those delightful days of winter that serve as cheerful remembrances during periods of seemingly interminable fog overhead and slush beneath During a quiet meal he read the news and with the invaluable morning smoke settled himself cosily into an armchair to consider procedure In the first place he carefully weighed those utterances of Mensmore at Monte Carlo which he could recall and which seemed by the light of later knowledge to bear upon the case Mensmore had alluded to family troubles to worries and anxieties that practically drove him from England Some of these no doubt referred to the Springbok speculation Others again might have meant missus Hillmer or some other presently unknown relative But in Mensmore s manner there was nothing that savored of a greater secrecy than the natural reticence of a gentleman in discussing domestic affairs with a stranger This man had practically been snatched from death At such a moment it was inconceivable that he could cloak the remorse of a murderer by the simulation of more honorable motives in themselves sufficiently distressing to cause him deliberately to choose suicide as the best way of ending his difficulties The policeman had summarized the testimony against Corbett as insufficient to curtail the remarkable powers of endurance of a cat But to Bruce the case against Mensmore alias Corbett stood in clearer perspective Now that he calmly reasoned the matter he felt that the balance of probabilities swung away from the hypothesis that Mensmore was the actual slayer of Lady Dyke and towards the theory that he was in some way bound up with her death whether knowingly or unknowingly it was at present impossible to say The new terror to Bruce was mister White Why if that animated truncheon knew what I know of this business he would arrest Mensmore forthwith If he did what would result A scandal a thorough exposure possibly the ruin of Mensmore s love making if he be an innocent man That must be stopped But how without forewarning Mensmore himself and he may be guilty Chance may favor White as it favored me in disclosing the identity of the missing Corbett And what of the real Corbett What on earth has he got to do with it and why has Mensmore taken his name If ever I get to the bottom of this business I may well congratulate myself The sole result of all my labor thus far may be summed up in a sentence I have not yet come face to face with the man whom I can honestly suspect as Lady Dyke s murderer Not much my boy Claude uttered the last sentence aloud startling Smith who was clearing the table Beg pardon sir cried Smith Oh nothing I was only expressing an opinion I thought perhaps sir you was thinkin of mister White What of him Your remark sir hexactly hexpresses my hopinion of im Smith was not a badly educated man but the least excitement produced an appalling derangement of the letter h in his vocabulary mister White is a sharp fellow in his own way Smith Maybe but why should e come pokin round ere pryin into your little affairs deecur My what Sorry sir but that s what a French maid I once knew called em Flirtations sir Mashes Smith have you been drinking Me sir Well explain yourself I never flirted with a woman in my life That s what I told im sir My master s a regular saint says I a sort of middle aged ankyrite But mister White e wouldn t ave it at no price Come now Smith says e your guv nor s pretty deep E s a toff e is an knows lots of lydies titled lydies Very like says I but e doesn t mash em Then what price that lydy who called for im in a keb afore e went away An who s e gone to Monte Carlo with This was durin your absence sir Go on Smith Anything else Well sir that rather flung me out of my stride as the sayin is as I ad seen the lydy in question An mister White as a nasty way of putting you on your oath so to speak But I never owned up Claude laughed Excellent mister White has a keen nose for false scents I have already told him to let my affairs alone He means no harm But the reference to a lydy in a keb had suggested an immediate plan of action to the barrister He would call to see missus Hillmer He wrote a note asking her if he might come to tea that afternoon and sent it by a boy messenger In return he received this answer missus Hillmer will be at home at four o clock if mister Bruce cares to call then Whew he whistled What s in the wind there This is an uncommonly stiff invitation That rascal White has upset her I ll be bound I must choke him off somehow Suppose he were to find that damaged bracket He would have Mensmore under trial at the Old Bailey in double quick time After I leave missus Hillmer I must visit No twelve again and carry off that pair of brackets before White discovers them as he will haunt the place in future Bruce had a set of skeleton keys in his possession They were in his pocket when he approached Raleigh Mansions at the appointed hour The same trim maid opened the door for him and ushered him into the drawing room On the occasion of his first visit he was taken to the dining room It was a small matter but Bruce paid heed to such missus Hillmer appeared very stately and undemonstrative She greeted him coldly seated herself at a distance and said in a cold well controlled voice I did not expect the honor of another visit from you mister Bruce Why not There was a fight brewing and he would let the enemy open fire The glitter in her eyes showed that the batteries were ready to be unmasked He was not mistaken Why not Because I believed you to be a gentleman Once you had stooped to sending your myrmidons to pester me I imagined that you would keep yourself in the background There was an indignant ring in her words as she concluded When a woman is angry her own speech acts as a trumpet call and fires her blood missus Hillmer began as she intended in icy disdain She ended in tremulous anger You allude to mister White said the barrister looking steadily at her Yes that is the man Some hireling from Scotland Yard How could you so meanly induce my confidence at our first meeting I have never been so deceived in a man in my life and I have had a surfeit of bitter experience already Brother and sister are alike They have led queer lives mused Bruce Aloud he said Your experience missus Hillmer should at least lead you not to condemn any one unheard May I explain that which is to you incomprehensible at this moment justly so I admit Explanations I am a child in the hands of such as you How can I hope to fathom your real intent Presumably if I accept your apologies now it will be a prelude to further visits by impudent police officers I am not here to apologize missus Hillmer What then pray To plead with you For Heaven s sake do not distrust me It may ruin those whom you hold dear Listen to me first and try to believe me afterwards He was so thoroughly in earnest so impressive in manner that she did not know what to make of him In her despair she adopted a woman s chief resource her eyes filled with tears But he anticipated her Now missus Hillmer he cried let us act like sensible people Compose yourself order in some tea and after an interlude I will tell you all about it Candor is an indispensable element of confidence missus Hillmer rose made an effort to choke back her agitation went out and called to the maid for tea She returned in a few moments When they were alone Bruce said with a smile A little poudre de ris is an excellent corrective for signs of grief The lady blushed and there was a perceptible return to her former pleasant manner You are incorrigible I fear she cried Not a bit Impressionable rather Now I am going to startle you considerably so be prepared And do not jump at conclusions Though startling my news is not alarming All may yet end well missus Hillmer was manifestly anxious but she promised to try to understand him fully before she formed any judgment Then said he I can clear the air a good deal by a simple statement mister White is no agent of mine and I have seen your brother Albert Mensmore at Monte Carlo missus Hillmer gave a little gasp of surprise You have seen Bertie Yes your brother is he not My half brother to be exact My father was married twice I I am the elder of the two by four years Apart from the compliment you do not look it But what you say explains the total absence of likeness between you Possibly People said we each resembled our mother And Bertie you know has led a somewhat adventurous career He roughed it a good deal in America But what has all this got to do with detectives and recent inquiries and that sort of thing Much The last time we met I told you that your brother was mixed up in some little affair with a lady missus Hillmer laughed a trifle constrainedly If you knew Bertie as well as I do you would not harbor suspicions concerning him He never had a love affair in his life Indeed he is something of a woman hater No doubt he was But he has changed his opinions He is in love and is engaged to be married to a very charming girl Thus far his beliefs and his good fortune have pulled against each other Bertie engaged to be married Good gracious Who is she And how can he support a wife He is poor and in debt and he won t even let me help him I have stated the facts nevertheless The lady is a daughter of Sir William Browne and they are now yachting with a large party in the Mediterranean Are her people against the match Is that why this Scotland Yard man No Mensmore is on board Sir William s yacht But there is another lady missing from her home for nearly three months who is believed to be dead murdered the police say and with whom your brother was in some indefinable way associated Do they dare to say that Bertie killed her missus Hillmer s color rose and her eyes flashed fire again They say nothing They are simply doing their duty in trying to discover the truth And you may take it from me as an undoubted fact that the last place this lady visited before her death was one of the flats in these mansions All present indications point to your brother s residence as being that place Now I pray you be calm and try to help me for I have acted in this matter as your friend and as your brother s friend At this very moment I am concealing his identity and his whereabouts from the police who are searching for him under the assumed name of Corbett If he is guilty of this crime then I must hand him over to justice for the murdered woman was a dear and good friend of mine If he is innocent as indeed I believe him to be I will strive to help him and save his good name from the tarnish of being arrested on such an odious charge During this recital missus Hillmer became deathly pale Her agitation was the greater inasmuch as she forcibly controlled herself But she could not remain seated She sprang to the window and looked out in the vain effort to seek inspiration from the gathering gloom of the street Then she turned and spoke very slowly I think I understand I must have faith in you mister Bruce Who was the lady The barrister thought deeply before replying He had previously decided upon this supreme step but he hesitated now that it was imminent There was no help for it Her name said he is one which is well known to the world Lady Dyke wife of Sir Charles Dyke is missing from her home since the evening of November six last She met with a violent death that night and I not the police have good reason to believe that she was killed in your brother s residence missus Hillmer flung herself on a lounge buried her white face in her hands and moaned in a perfect agony of terror Oh my God What shall I do What shall I do This outburst astounded Bruce He did not know what to make of it His intelligence had certainly taken his hearer by surprise What interpretation was he to place upon her words and her unrestrained actions Now missus Hillmer he began but she broke in vehemently running to him and clutching him by the arm He is innocent mister Bruce He must be innocent He could not lift his finger to any woman You must save him do you hear save him or you will have his blood on your soul It was true then that you came here to hunt for him Save him if you hope for mercy yourself when you are dying In her passion she shook him violently and for an instant they looked intently at each other the woman tensely piteous entreating the man amazed and questioning Do you not see he said at last that your vehemence reveals your thoughts For anything you know to the contrary your brother may have committed the crime Nay it requires but slight knowledge of human nature to read your suspicions lest it be true At this moment I am convinced that you are in your heart less sceptical than I of his guilt missus Hillmer flung herself again upon the lounge silent tearful torn with violent emotion which she vainly tried to suppress He tried to reason with her It will perhaps serve to clear up a mystery that deepens each moment if you place your trust in me he said Tell me fully and openly any cause you may have for fearing that your brother may be implicated in this terrible business I ask you to adopt this course in all faith I have seen your brother under most trying circumstances I have been with him at an hour when it would be impossible for him to conceal his burden if the weight of Lady Dyke s death lay upon him Yet I think him innocent I think that chance has contributed to gather evidence against him If I can learn even a portion of the truth it will enable me to quickly dispel the barrier of uncertainty that now hinders progress What is it you want to know missus Hillmer s voice was hollow and broken The barrister was shocked at the effect of his revelation but he was forced to go on with the disagreeable task he had undertaken Do you mean he asked that you will answer my questions So far as I can Would it not be better to tell me in your own words what you have to say missus Hillmer looked up and the agony in her face filled him with keen pity Oh Heaven help me to do what is right she cried Your prayer will surely be answered I am certain of that A great wrong has been committed by some one and the innocent must not suffer to shield the guilty missus Hillmer bowed her head and did not utter a word for some minutes She appeared to be reasoning out some plan of action in a dazed fashion When decision came she said in low tones You must leave me now mister Bruce I must have time When I am ready I shall send for you He knew instinctively that it was hopeless to plead with her Frivolous volatile women of her stamp often betray unusual strength of character in a supreme crisis You are adopting an unwise course he said sadly Maybe But I must be alone I am not deceiving you When I have determined something which is not now clear to me I will send for you It may be that I shall speak It may be that I shall be silent In either case I only can judge and suffer Tell me one thing at least missus Hillmer before we part Did you know of Lady Dyke s death before to day She came to him and looked him straight in the face and said I did not On my soul I did not Then he passed into the hall and even the shock of this painful interview did not prevent him from noting the flitting of a shadow past a distant doorway as some one hurried into the interior of a room In their excitement they forgot that their voices might attract attention and ladies maids are proverbially inquisitive CHAPTER XVI FOXEY The keen cold air of the streets soon restored the man to his habitual calm He felt that a quiet stroll would do him good As he walked he pondered and the more critically he examined missus Hillmer s change of attitude the less he understood it For some ridiculous reason he communed the woman believes her brother guilty Now I shall have endless trouble at getting at the truth She will not be candid She will only tell me that which she thinks will help him and conceal that which she considers damaging That is a woman s way all the world over And a desperately annoying way it is Perhaps I was to blame in springing this business too hastily upon her But there I like missus Hillmer and I hate using her as one juggles with a self conceited witness In future I shall trouble her no more A casual glance into the interior of Sloane Square Station gave him a glimpse of the barrier and he recognized the collector who had taken Lady Dyke s ticket on that fatal night when she quitted the Richmond train Rather as a relief than for other cause he entered into conversation with the official Do you remember me he said Can t say as I do sir The man examined his questioner with quick suspicion The forgotten season dodge would not work with him Maybe you remember these said Bruce producing his cigar case Now wot s the gyme said the collector to himself But he smiled and answered Do you mean by the look of em sir Good laughed Claude Take three or four home with you Meanwhile I am sure you remember me coming to see you last November concerning a lady who alighted here from Victoria one foggy evening and handed you a ticket to Richmond Of course I do sir And the cigars are all right There was a lot of fuss about that lydy Did she ever turn up Not exactly That is to say she died shortly after you saw her No Well of all the rummy goes She was a fine looking woman too as well as I rec llect Looked fit for another fifty year Wot appened to er I don t know I wish I did An ave you been on the unt ever since guv nor Yes ever since She s dead you s y Yes But ow d you know she s dead if you ain t seen er since I have seen her I saw her dead body at Putney At Putney Well I m blowed A roar from beneath the slamming of many doors and the quick rush of a crowd up the steps announced the arrival of a train Pardon sir said the man this is the five point forty one Mansion House But don t go aw y There s somethin Tickets if you please In a minute the collector had ended his task While sorting his bundles of pasteboards he said Nobody ever tell d me that before An you ain t the only one on er track Are you in the police No I thought not But some other chaps who kem ere was None of em ever said the lydy was dead Why what matter Oh nothin but two eads is better n one if they re only sheep s eads Undoubtedly The rule is all the more reliable when one of them belongs to a shrewd chap like you The collector grinned He understood that he was being flattered for a purpose yet he liked it That s one w y of lookin at it he said but if this affair s pertickler why all I can s y is it s worth somethin to somebody Certainly Here s a sovereign for a start If you can tell me anything really worth knowing I will add four more to it Now that s talkin I m off duty at eight o clock an I can t ave a chat now because I expect the inspector any minute Suppose you call and see me in Victoria Street at nine Right you are sir Bruce gave the man his address and recrossed the square Few people were abroad so he walked straight to the first door of Raleigh Mansions and made his way to the fourth floor Had he been a moment later he must have seen missus Hillmer closely wrapped up leave her residence unattended Her carriage was not in waiting She walked to the cabstand in the square and called a hansom driving back up Sloane Street Her actions indicated a desire to be unobserved even by her servants as in the usual course of events the housemaid would have brought a cab to the door But the barrister steadily climbing up the stairs could not guess what was happening in the street He soon opened Mensmore s door and noted as an idle fact that the expected gust of cold air was absent There was no light on this landing so he was in pitch darkness once he had passed the doorway There was no need to strike a match however as he remembered the exact position of the electric switchboard on the left beyond the dining room door He stepped cautiously forward and stretched forth his hand to grope for the lever With a quick rush some two or three assailants flung themselves upon him and after a fierce gasping struggle for Bruce was a strong man he was borne to the floor face downwards with one arm beneath him and the other pinioned behind his back Look sharp Jim shouted a breathless voice Turn on the light and close the door We ve got him safe enough They had Two large hands were clutched round his neck a knee was firmly embedded in the small of his back another hand gripped his left wrist like a vice while some one sat on his legs He could not have been collared more effectually by a Rugby International team The third man found the electric light and turned it on Now get up said some one and don t give us any more trouble It s no use The barrister who had had his wind knocked out of him rose to his knees Then as the light fell upon the horrified face of mister White he vainly essayed to keep up the pretence of indignation Once fairly on his feet he nearly collapsed with laughter He leaned against the wall and as his breath came again he laughed until his sides ached Meanwhile the detective was crimson with rage and annoyance His two assistants did not know what to make of the affair What s wrong Jim said one at last Isn t this Corbett No of course it s not was his angry growl Then who the is it Oh ask me another How on earth could I guess mister Bruce that you d come letting yourself in here with a latchkey Claude was still holding his sore ribs and could not answer but the policeman who had questioned White caught the name He recognized it and grinned at his companion What did you want here anyhow snarled the infuriated detective as he realized that his great coup would be retailed with embellishments through every police station in the metropolis I w wanted you to ar r rest me W White roared Claude I s said you would and you have Confound it how could you know I was here You were sure to wait here for a man who probably will not return for months Was I indeed Well you have yourself to blame if you are hurt I hope my mates did not treat you too badly What cried the one who had not yet spoken He gave me such a punch on the bread basket that I ve only just recovered my speech I think we re about quits said the other surveying a torn waistcoat and broken watch chain I shall be black and blue all over to morrow said Bruce but if you are satisfied I am Come mister White bring your friends and we will open a bottle of wine We all want it Corbett won t be here to night Just now he is in Wyoming How do you know By intuition I am seldom mistaken But why didn t you call out just now when you came in I hadn t a chance You were on me like a thousand of bricks I must confess that if Corbett were in my shoes he would be a doomed man White didn t know whether to believe Bruce or not He was genuinely angry at the incident but the barrister did not want to convert him into an enemy and he vaguely felt that a catastrophe was imminent and a false move by the police might do irretrievable mischief Well inspector he said I must confess that this time you have got the better of me I did not know you were here I looked in for the purpose of quietly studying the ground as it were and I was never more taken by surprise in my life Moreover your plan was a very clever one in view of the fact that Corbett might return at any moment The detective became more amiable at this praise from the famous amateur for Bruce s achievements were well known to his two colleagues I suppose you wondered what had happened he said with a smile I thought my last hour had come I am only sorry that Corbett himself did not have the experience Do you really believe he is in the States sir I am sure of it Then he must have returned there since he wrote that letter That is the only solution of the difficulty Hum It s a pity Why I would sooner prefer to arrest him on this side To get him by extradition is a slow affair and probably means a trip across the Atlantic Good humor being now restored the party quitted the flat and adjourned to a neighboring hotel where the barrister started White on the full true and particular account of his pursuit and capture of the Winchmore Hill burglars an exploit which was the pride of the detective s life At the end of a bottle of champagne and a cigar they all parted excellent friends but Bruce did not attempt to revisit Raleigh Mansions that night Instead he partook of a quiet meal at a restaurant and hurried to his chambers to await the advent of the ticket collector Punctual to the hour this new witness arrived and was admitted by Smith in obedience with previous instructions The man was somewhat awed by the surroundings and the appearance of a servant in livery but Bruce quickly put him at his ease Come sit near the fire Do you drink whisky and soda That box contains your favorite cigars Now tell me all you know about this business I can t s y as I know anythink about it sir but by puttin two and two together it makes four sometimes not always Quite right You re a philosopher Let me hear the two two s We will see about the addition afterwards Well sir this yer lydy was a missin early in November She tykes a ticket at Victoria Station on the District for Richmond she gives it up to me at Sloane Square arsks a newsboy

I hope you will not follow Foxey s example said Bruce rising Ow do you mean sir Because I am going to keep my word Here are the four sovereigns I owe you In your case your two and two have made five Thank you sir You re a brick No fear of me meltin this little lot The missus will be on em like a bird w en I tell her And the man spat upon the coins with evident relish as he handled them One word

use to you sir The greatest It has solved a puzzle However I will see you again Good bye Don t forget to write Cornhill is the direct line from Leadenhall Street mused Claude when he was alone Any one coming to Sloane Square from Dodge company s office would pass through it Upon my word things look very black against Mensmore Yet I cannot believe it CHAPTER XVII A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION Bruce now had several lines of inquiry open Apart from the main and vital question as to the exact method of Lady Dyke s death and the identity of the person responsible for it a number of important matters required attention Why had Jane Harding quitted her situation so suddenly Whence did she obtain the money that enabled her to blossom forth as Marie le Marchant Who was Sydney H Corbett Why did Mensmore adopt a false name and in any case why adopt the name of Corbett Why did missus Hillmer exhibit such sudden terror lest her brother might be guilty Whom did missus Hillmer marry Was her husband alive or dead Was the man who conveyed Lady Dyke s body from Raleigh Mansions to Putney responsible also for her death Finally why did he select that particular portion of the Thames banks for the bestowal of his terrible burden Many other minor features suggested themselves for careful attention but the barrister knew that if he elucidated some of the major questions the rest would answer themselves The last query promised to yield a good crop of information should it be satisfactorily dealt with Turning to his notes he found that the former owner of the Putney house was a tutor or preparatory schoolmaster named the reverend Septimus Childe Could it be that this was the school in which both Sir Charles Dyke and Mensmore were fellow students If so Bruce failed to see why he should not forthwith place the whole of the facts in his possession at the service of the police and allow the law to take its course On this supposition the case against Mensmore was very black not indeed incapable of explanation for circumstantial evidence occasionally plays strange pranks with logic but of such a grave nature that no private individual would be justified in keeping his knowledge to himself The deduction was intensely disagreeable but Bruce resolved to coerce his thoughts and do that which was right irrespective of consequences He did not possess a Clergy List No letter came from missus Hillmer so he walked across the Park to his club in Pall Mall to consult the appropriately bound black and white volume which gives reference to the many degrees of the Church of England Septimus Childe was a distinctive though simple name And it was not there There was not a Childe with a final e in the whole book Without that important letter as his informant might be mistaken there were several Close scrutiny of each man s designation and duties convinced him that though any of these might be one of the particular Childe s children none answered to the description of the gentleman he sought Of course he could always apply to Sir Charles Dyke but he dreaded approaching the grief stricken baronet on this matter Now there was no help for it The barrister was beginning to feel impatient at the constant difficulties which barred progress in each direction After all it was a small thing merely to ask his friend if he ever knew a reverend gentleman named Childe Bruce was sure that Sir Charles would not be acquainted with mister Childe and also with the fact that the Putney house had served as his school for it would be strange beyond credence if it were so that he had not mentioned it The weather was still clear and cold and a wintry sun made walking pleasant Claude on quitting his club set out again on foot He crossed saint James s Square Jermyn Street and Piccadilly and made his way to Oxford Street up New Bond Street Not often did he frequent these fashionable thoroughfares and he had an excellent reason When walking he was given to abstraction and seldom saw his acquaintances if he encountered them in unusual quarters He would thus cut dead a woman at whose house he had dined the previous evening or when he was in practice at the Bar fail to notice the salutation of his own leader To Claude himself this short coming was intolerable consciousness of it when in the West made him the most alert man in the crowd to note anybody whom he knew except on the rare occasions when he forgot his failing This morning Bond Street was pleasantly full People were beginning to return to town Parliament re assembled in a few days and he passed many who were on his visiting list Outside a well known costumer s he saw a brougham into which a lady had just been assisted by the commissionaire It is no uncommon thing to recognize an acquaintance by the color of his horse or the peculiar cut of the coachman s whiskers This time Bruce knew the driver as well as the equipage but the lady was not missus Hillmer Instantly he was at the door with his hat lifted he assumed an expression of polite regret as he saw Dobson the maid in her mistress s place Sorry he said I knew the carriage and thought that missus Hillmer was inside She is well I trust Not very sir answered the maid with an angry pout Indeed what is the matter Madame is going away and has put us all on board wages Dobson had some of the privileges of a companion and resented this relegation to the servants hall Going away cried Bruce A sudden departure eh The girl was arranging some parcels on the seat in front of her She was not disinclined for a conversation with this good looking gentleman so she smiled archly as she said Didn t you know sir I thought you would know all about it What he might have ascertained by a longer chat the barrister could not tell for an interruption occurred The coachman was more loyal to his mistress than the maid Beg pardon sir he cried but the missus told us to hurry and he whipped his steed into the passing stream of carriages More complications murmured Claude missus Hillmer contemplates a bolt Shall I pay her another visit and surprise her No confound it I will not Let her go and let things take their course Not in the most amiable frame of mind at this discovery he pursued his walk to Portman Square Sir Charles Dyke was at home He always was now For goodness sake mister Bruce whispered Thompson in the hall try to persuade Sir Charles to quit smokin and readin and thinkin He sits all day in the library and ardly has anything to eat Claude reproached himself for having neglected his resolution to stir his friend into something like animation He was wondering what he should do in the matter when the baronet rose at his entrance saying with a weary smile Well old fellow what news The other suddenly decided to throw all questioning to the winds for the moment I have come to bring you out I won t hear of a refusal Let us walk to the club and have lunch and a game of billiards Sir Charles protested He had slept badly and was tired All the more reason that you should sleep well to night Come now be advised You will allow yourself to become a hopeless invalid if you go on in this way Dyke unwillingly consented and they left the house The older man brightened up considerably amidst the bustle of the streets His color returned he talked with some degree of cheerfulness and even laughed as he said I never understood you were a doctor Claude in addition to your other varied acquirements For the first time since since November last I feel hungry Why don t you take my advice and go away for some shooting It is not too late even now to go after a hare I will think of it I wonder who we shall meet at the club Lots of fellows no doubt And by the way you must be prepared for one little difficulty Suppose they ask about your wife The baronet s momentary gaiety vanished He stopped short and clutched Bruce s arm Don t you see he almost moaned that this is the reason I have remained indoors for so long What shall I say You must make the best of it Say off handedly you don t know where she is either with relations or in Italy Anything will do and it will create a false impression I am sick of false impressions I cannot do it You must The stronger will prevailed and they entered the doors of the Imperial where of course Dyke was hailed at once by a dozen men Hallo Charlie Been seedy Good gracious Dyke have you had influenza I ve missed you for months now I come to think of it I haven t seen your wife for quite a time How is she In the multitude of questions there was safety Sir Charles answered vaguely and a chance arrival created a diversion by announcing that the favorite had broken down in his preparation for the Grand National Later in the afternoon the two found themselves ensconced in a quiet corner of the smoking room Bruce seized the opportunity You told me he said that Mensmore and you were at school together Did I said the baronet Yes don t you remember I get mixed up in thinking about things But it is all right We were Whereabouts Oh a private establishment kept by an old chap called Septimus Childe Lucky Number was our nickname for him Bruce betrayed no surprise at this startlingly simple statement He said casually I mean where was the school situated At Brighton in my time But afterwards he shifted to some place near London something to do with examinations I fancy But don t you know where How should I I was at Sandhurst then I believe the old boy is dead Why do you ask Oh it has something to do with the inquiry I won t trouble you now with the details Go on I can stand it But where is the good in paining you needlessly That stage has passed old chap My wife s memory has almost become a dream to me Well it is an extraordinary thing but that place where that house at Putney you know must have been the new school of the reverend Septimus Childe How did you learn that I have known it for months ever since the inquest And you did not tell me True but at the time it seemed of no consequence Now that Mensmore turns out to be a pupil of his and probably passed the remainder of his early school days at that very establishment the incident assumes a degree of importance Sir Charles looked earnestly at his friend as he put his next question Tell me Claude do you seriously believe that Mensmore had anything to do with my wife s death I cannot honestly give you a satisfactory answer But what do you think If you press me I will try to put my opinion into words Mensmore was in some mysterious way associated with the crime but the degree of association and whether conscious or unconscious I do not know What do you mean by conscious or unconscious I am sure that Lady Dyke met her death in his residence but it is impossible to say now if he was aware of her presence He was in London at the time that is quite certain Do the police know all this No I am glad of it Mensmore did not kill my wife The suggestion is absurd wildly absurd Things look black against him nevertheless I tell you it is nonsense You are on the wrong track Bruce What possible reason could he have had to decoy my wife to his flat and there murder her None perhaps Then why do you hesitate to agree with me Because there is a woman in the case Another woman Yes Mensmore s sister or half sister to be exact She also lives in Raleigh Mansions Indeed So all kinds of things have been going on without my knowledge Yet you promised faithfully to keep me informed of every incident that transpired I am sorry Dyke but you were so upset Upset man Don t you realize that this affair is all I have to think about in the world The baronet was so disturbed that Claude at once made up his mind to tell him as little as possible in the future These constant possibilities of rupture between them must be avoided at all hazard To change the conversation he said Never mind this time you must pardon my inadvertence How do your wife s people bear the continued mystery of her disappearance At first they were awfully cut up But lately they have been reconciled to her death which they say must have resulted from accident and that her identity must have been mixed up with that of some other person Such things do happen you know Anyway her sister has gone into mourning for her You didn t hear I suppose that I have made my little nephew my heir Was that step necessary at your time of life I shall never marry again Bruce Well let us drop the subject You have done right as regards the boy under present circumstances but as a man of the world I only point out that it is an unwise thing to bring up a youngster in expectation of something which chance might determine differently Chance There is no chance My wife cannot return from the grave True You have done right no doubt But the suddenness of the thing caused me to speak unwittingly They were silent for a little while when Sir Charles returned to the subject nearest his heart Has your search developed in other directions Bruce fenced with the query To be candid he said I am now most busily engaged in the not very difficult task of throwing dust in the eyes of the police My motives are hardly definite to myself but I do not want this unfortunate man Mensmore to be arrested until I have personally become convinced of his guilt You are right Your instinct seldom fails you I question if he ever to his own knowledge saw my wife Ah You see you have hit upon the difficulty Show me her reason for making that secret journey and I will tell you how she met her death His concluding words sank to a murmur An old friend of Dyke s had entered the room and came toward them A few minutes later Bruce quitted the Imperial and drove to his chambers where he found a note from the ticket collector stating that Foxey s name was William Marsh The day was still young and the barrister paid a visit to the West London Police Court where the records soon revealed the conviction of the cab driver and the period of his sentence Let me see said the resident inspector his time at Holloway is up on February six That is a Monday and as Sunday doesn t count he will be liberated on the fourth about eight A M That is the habit sir in the matter of short sentences If you want to see him when he leaves the jail you can either wait at the gates or at the nearest public house where the prisoners go for their first drink They seldom or never miss Bruce thanked the official and returned home He was on the point of going out to drive when he received a letter from Sir Charles Dyke It ran My Dear Claude Today s experiences have taught me to take the inevitable step of announcing my wife s death Hence I have forwarded the enclosed notice to an advertisement agency with instructions to insert it in the principal papers I have also decided to follow your advice and leave town for a few days I am going to Wensley my place in Yorkshire should you happen to want me Yours CHARLES DYKE The notice read DYKE On November six Alice wife of Sir Charles Dyke Bart suddenly at London Next morning it figured in the obituary columns of many newspapers Bruce though taken back by the suddenness of his friend s resolve saw no reason to endeavor to dissuade him In the words of the letter it was the inevitable step CHAPTER XVIII WHAT HAPPENED ON THE RIVIERA The White Heather swung quietly at her moorings in the harbor of Genoa the Superb The lively company on board tired after a day s sight seeing had left the marble streets and palace cafes to the Genoese and sought the pleasant seclusion of the yacht s airy promenade deck Dinner on board followed by a dance said Phyllis as arbiter of the procedure A few hasty invitations sent out to British residents in Genoa met with general acceptance and the lull between afternoon tea and the more formal meal was a grateful interlude Genoa is so shut in by its amphitheatre of hills that unless a gale blows from the west its bay is unruffled and its atmosphere oppressively hot during the day even in the winter months Sir William Browne s excursion had proved so attractive to those invited that the White Heather was taken farther along the coast than was originally intended When all the best known resorts of the Riviera itself were exploited some one probably prompted thereto by Phyllis or Mensmore suggested a run to Genoa They had been in the port three days and on the morrow would hand the yacht over to the owner s agents those on board separating on their different routes The Brownes went to Florence and Rome and Mensmore was pretending to hold out against a pressing request to accompany them cordially given by his prospective father in law This afternoon Phyllis and he were leaning over the taffrail and discussing the point The young lady was slightly inclined to be angry Her eyes roamed over the magnificent panorama of church crowned hills and verdant valleys with the white city in front and the picturesque quays looking as though they had been specially decked for a painting by Clara Montalba But Phyllis paid heed to none of these things She wanted her lover to come with her and not to fly away to smoke covered London Business she cried it is always business that men think of Of course I know that affairs must be attended to but now that everything is settled and we are quite happy it is too bad of you to run away immediately But dearest There Take your hand off my arm You are not going to coax me into agreement Just because you receive a horrid letter this morning you go and upset all the arrangements Phyllis listen to me I You shan t go I think it is mean of you to insist upon it when I am so urgent I am not insisting You might at least help me to settle matters otherwise they will get terribly mixed And you will stay What else can I do when you ask me Oh you darling This little quarrel was very delightful and made them feel ever so much more in love than before but it did not help Mensmore out of his difficulty Let us see what Corbett really says he remarked ruefully taking a letter from his pocket Am I to look too Of course I have no secrets from you little woman Phyllis nestled up close to him This time she did not object to his hand resting on her shoulder and together they read the following letter My Dear Bertie At last I am able to write you definitely The prospectors have struck it rich on our property and I have sold two claims outright for fifty thousand dollars With this nest egg I am taking the girls to New York and shall then start by the Teutonic for your side of the pond I am due in Liverpool on February four so look out for me Yours ever SYDNEY H CORBETT Both gazed thoughtfully at the document for a few moments before Phyllis said Does that mean we shall be rich Bertie Her companion emphasized the gratification of the plural pronoun by a squeeze I hope so sweet That will be very nice won t it I will marry you even if you have to take a place in father s office but it will be so much better if we haven t to explain to him that we are poor after all Mensmore laughed It is not so bad as that in any case he said This Springbok Mine speculation will probably turn out well but I look to Wyoming to yield the best and most permanent results Why is mister Corbett coming to London Because it is only in London that capital can be obtained for large undertakings and if the Wyoming Goldfield is really a valuable one we may be able to realize some portion of our interests for a considerable sum Anyhow he wants to consult me Do you both own the ranch Yes it was a joint transaction but I found the money And why did you come away Well we made very little out of it Phil As Corbett has two sisters I thought it best to leave what there was for him He was absurdly grateful about what he called my generosity in the matter but now that the land has proved valuable of course all that nonsense is at an end and we go half shares in the deal Two sisters They pretty What Jealous already They are very nice but much older than their brother and he is my senior by two years Miss Browne was graciously pleased to accept this explanation She knitted her smooth brow into a reflective frown as she said mister Corbett arrives on the fourth It is now January thirtieth You really ought to go home Bertie Now my dear sensible little woman is talking like her own self I see I must give you permission But I did hope we would see Florence together So we shall I ll tell you what I can do I shall write to Corbett to day care of the steamer at Liverpool tell him to go to my flat and stay there a few days until I arrive and go home myself at the end of next week He is sure to spend some time seeing the sights before tackling business and he can do that as well without me as if I were there A line to my old housekeeper who has a spare key will make the place habitable for him Happy thought I ll do it And another happy thought I ll come and watch you do it She did not notice that Mensmore s face clouded at this otherwise pleasant intimation Nevertheless he raced off with her to the saloon and seated himself at the writing table But before he placed pen to paper Phyllis bending over him meanwhile he suddenly exclaimed in a tone of annoyance Now what a bore this is I don t know how to address the letter to make sure of reaching him at once and it is very important that it should not miss him Father will know Let us ask him No said Mensmore judicially I will row across the harbor to the Florio Rubattino office find out the exact thing and send off the letter Back in half an hour Be good And before Phyllis could argue the matter he was at the gangway shouting for a boat She blew a kiss to him as he shot over the narrow strip of water inside the mole and little realized that Mensmore was saying to himself That was a narrow squeak Never again as long as I live will I take another man s name It causes no end of bother and at the most unexpected moments He did not trouble the Florio Rubattino people as he well knew that a letter addressed to the White Star offices would insure any communication reaching his friend The context of the missive as finally indited at the post office explains his hesitancy to write it in the presence of his fiancee My dear Sydney Your good news is more than surprising Although I believe you I cannot yet grasp its full significance However let us leave explanations until we meet I am fixed here for a few days more as I have just become engaged to the sweetest girl in the world but will return home at the end of next week Meanwhile I want you to take up your residence at my flat No twelve Raleigh Mansions Sloane Square where my housekeeper has instructions to receive you Do not be surprised if you find the name of Corbett familiar there Indeed I took the place in your name in August last However all explanations when we meet Yours ever BERTIE MENSMORE This with a note to the housekeeper missus Robinson and another to the hall porter of the Universities Club lest by any chance the Liverpool letter missed his friend completed his task He laughed as he hurried from the post office to the harbor By Jove he said to himself won t old Robinson be surprised when she gets my letter telling her that another mister Corbett is coming from America and that my name concealed for family reasons is Mensmore I guess that Sydney will feel a bit mixed up too until I tell him the whole yarn No wonder his housekeeper would fail to understand him Others whose influence on his fortunes he little suspected were already puzzled by the circumstances Bruce for instance and White would be very glad if some occult power enabled them to read the seemingly trivial letters posted that day in Genoa Every person known to the reader and not the least the visitor from the United States was on the eve of a mad whirl of events the outcome of which no man could prophesy As yet one man only Claude Bruce had the slightest suspicion that affairs were approaching a crisis When Mensmore reached the White Heather he found Lady Browne and Phyllis dressed for a drive before dinner Sir William seized the opportunity to cross examine his daughter s suitor as to his means Phyllis was an only child and her father did not propose that she should live in penury whatever the financial position of her husband might be He liked Mensmore and had ascertained by private inquiries that his social position was good His father was a Major General said his informant who lost his savings by speculation and was unable to maintain his son in a crack cavalry corps so the youngster resigned and went to America to try to better himself There was a daughter too by the first wife a very charming woman who when the crash came was supposed to have gone on the stage But I have never heard of her since So far the credentials were not bad but Sir William thought it his duty to ascertain definite particulars Mensmore was quite candid with him I have been somewhat of a rolling stone he said but I am glad to believe that people have never had cause to think ill of me At times my affairs have been at a desperate stage but I hope such periods have passed forever I have already spoken to you about the Springbok Mine The old gentleman nodded Well this morning I have received very satisfactory news from America and he handed over Corbett s letter for perusal Yes agreed Sir William these things promise well We will look into them when we reach England Meanwhile I give my provisional sanction to my daughter s engagement She is a good girl Mensmore She will be a true and excellent wife I think you are worthy of her and I hope that whatever clouds may have darkened your life will now pass away You two ought to be happy We will sir said Mensmore fervently By the way where is your sister Is she in England or abroad Mensmore had been expecting this question He was prepared for it missus Hillmer is my half sister he explained I have not seen much of her since since an unhappy marriage she contracted some years ago Indeed Is her husband alive I can hardly tell you I believe so But she does not live with him She is well provided for but it was partly on account of this matter that I came to the Riviera for the winter To tell the truth I quarrelled with her about it Ah well Her troubles need not affect Phyllis and you except to give you warning And take my advice Never interfere between husband and wife However good your motive ill is sure to come of it In the growing dusk Sir William Browne did not note his companion s embarrassment in discussing this topic Mensmore was essentially an honorable man and he detested the necessity which forced him to permit false inferences to be drawn from his words Yet there was no help for it He was compelled to suffer for the faults of another It was relief when the dressing bell for dinner allowed him to escape to his cabin There was quite a large gathering for dinner Places like Genoa contain a number of highly interesting personages if the visitor discovers them The British race produces a richer variety of human flotsam and jetsam than any other These derelicts come to anchor in out of the way parts of the earth They seem to have been everywhere and have done everything while the whole world is an open book to them Thus there was no lack of variety in the conversation and as usual in such assemblies it dealt more with persons than with incidents Phyllis had arranged the guests so it may be taken for granted that her lover was near her in fact he sat exactly opposite The lady he took in to dinner was the wife of an English doctor and the British consul at the port was Miss Browne s table companion The consul was a chatty man who kept himself well informed concerning society events By the way he said to Phyllis did you ever meet Lady Dyke No her name is not familiar to me Do you mean the wife of Sir Charles Dyke said Mensmore and the sudden interest he evinced caused Phyllis to glance at him wonderingly Yes that is she I know Sir Charles well What is there new about his wife She is dead Good Heavens Dead When and how Mensmore was so obviously agitated that others present noticed it and Phyllis marvelled much that in all their confidence the name of Dyke had never escaped his lips The consul too was a little nonplussed by the sensation caused by his words I fear he said that I have blurted out the fact rather unguardedly The Dykes are friends of yours No no not in that sense Sir Charles I have known for many years But are you sure his wife is dead My authority is an announcement in the Times to hand by to day s post I should not have mentioned it were not her ladyship so well known in society and the affair is peculiar to say the least Peculiar how In his all absorbing interest in the consul s statement Mensmore paid no heed to the curious looks directed at him he had become very pale and was more excited in manner than the circumstances appeared to warrant In this sense The paper is the issue of January twenty eight yet the notice says that Lady Dyke died on November six This is odd is it not A woman of her position could hardly have quitted life so quietly that no one would trouble to publish the fact until nearly three months after the event It is extraordinary inexplicable Did you know Lady Dyke personally Bertie put in Phyllis timorously The question restored Mensmore to some sense of his surroundings I have never even seen her he said trying desperately to be commonplace but her husband is an old schoolfellow of mine and I have heard much of both of them since their marriage I am quite shocked by the news I can only repeat my regret for having spoken of it so carelessly said the polite consul Oh I am glad to know of it since it has happened Poor Lady Dyke How strange that she should die Phyllis had the tact to change the conversation and Mensmore gradually recovered his self possession A woman s eyes are keener than a man often gives her credit for and Phyllis saw quite plainly that after the first effect of the news had passed it in some indefinable way seemed to have a good effect on her lover But if a woman s intuition is seldom at fault her reasoning faculties are narrow Trying to arrive at a solution of the mystery attending Mensmore s behavior Phyllis suddenly became hot all over She felt furiously and inordinately jealous of a woman she did not know and who was admittedly dead before Mensmore and she herself had met Hence her nose went high in the air when Bertie claimed her for the first dance Who is this Lady Dyke in whom you are so deeply interested she said drawing him beneath a sheltering awning As I said replied Mensmore she is the wife of an old acquaintance of mine But you must have been very fond of her to feel so keenly when you heard of her death Fond of her I have never to my knowledge laid eyes on her Oh And the tone was somewhat mollified Then why did you look so worried during dinner Simply because I know Sir Charles What a dear sympathetic little boy you are When I die Bertie I suppose you will drop down stiff from grief at once Don t talk nonsense We are missing all this delightful music And they whirled away down the snowy deck forgetful of all things save one that they were in love Now what a pity it was that Bruce was not on board the White Heather that night Many complications and not a little misery would have been avoided thereby CHAPTER XIX WHERE missus HILLMER WENT Sir Charles Dyke in sending off the hurried announcement of his wife s death forgot the society papers Such a promising topic did not come in their way every week and they made the most of it Where did Lady Dyke die Under what circumstances did she die They rolled the morsel under their tongue in every conceivable manner Details were not forthcoming Our representative called at Wensley House Portman Square but was informed that Sir Charles was in Yorkshire Inquiry by a local reporter from Sir Charles in person elicited no information Lady Dyke is dead wrote this enterprising journalist of that there can be no manner of doubt but her husband states that for family reasons he is unable to supply the public with the precise facts concerning his wife s demise This ill advised authentic statement only fanned the flame An evening journal got hold of the proceedings at the Putney Coroner s Court which inquired into the death of a woman found in the Thames and with a portentous display of headlines published an interview with the doctor giving particulars of the iron spike found imbedded in the skull The paper was also able to state on the best authority that at this inquest Sir Charles Dyke and the missing lady s personal maid were called in to identify the body but failed A first class sensation was in full swing and threatened to reach the question stage in the House of Commons when Bruce took hold of affairs He went to Sir Charles Dyke s solicitors and induced them to send out the following authoritative communication to the press Much unnecessary pain is being caused to Sir Charles Dyke and to the relatives of his late wife by the comments which have appeared in many newspapers regarding Lady Dyke s death Her ladyship left her home on November sixth to pay a visit to her sister at Richmond and since that date has not been seen or heard of There was no possible reason for her disappearance After a long and agonizing search her husband and relatives have come to the conclusion that she met with some accident on the date named with the result that her identity was not established and she was probably buried from some hospital or other institution long before her friends seriously entertained the thought that she was dead Every such case of accidental death followed by the interment of unknown persons by the authorities occurring on or about November sixth has since been rigidly investigated but no definite trace has been found of the missing lady Sir Charles Dyke determined to take the public step of announcing his wife s death in the hope that any hitherto undiscovered clue might thereby come to light But there are no grounds to suppose that any other explanation of the occurrence than that given will be forthcoming The investigation has been in the hands of Scotland Yard throughout so no good purpose can be served by further discussion in the press of what is now and threatens to remain a mystery rendered more complex by the simplicity of its leading features Several newspapers of course pointed out that they were helping forward the inquiry by noising it abroad but thenceforth the paragraphs ceased being eclipsed in interest by the revelations of a great divorce case in which there were no less than six titled company respondents One man was much puzzled by the original obituary notice and the semi official statement supplied by the solicitors mister White did not know what to make of them He guessed that Bruce had inspired that explanation and he read the concluding sentence many times It threatens to remain a mystery does it not he murmured Just wait mister Bruce until I lay my hands on Corbett Clever as you are I think I will show you that Scotland Yard can occasionally get the better of your theories Anyhow Corbett will have to be very explicit about his movements before I am satisfied that he knows nothing about this business He had written to the Chief of Police at Cheyenne and something definite would soon come to hand Nevertheless he felt somewhat shaken in his diagnosis of the crime Wyoming was a long way from London and the letter from Corbett which he had in his possession did not exactly confirm his suspicion that this man was concerned in the murder of Lady Dyke He quickly became aware of missus Hillmer s departure and at once jumped to the conclusion that she had recently left England for the United States A close scrutiny of the passenger lists at Liverpool and Southampton did not help him much and he ultimately resolved to call on Bruce in the hope that a chance exclamation might reveal the barrister s opinion of the situation Claude was not at a loss to account for mister White s presence I expected you he said Really now may I ask why sir Because you have missed missus Hillmer and you want me to help you find where she has gone and why The detective smiled I won t say that you are wrong sir he cried In these affairs it is always well to keep an eye on the woman you know When did missus Hillmer leave Raleigh Mansions On the thirtieth It is now February three Four days ago eh That is the time She might have left by the American line from Southampton or the Cunard from Liverpool on Wednesday but she did not and no one answering to her description is booked by the White Star to morrow Southampton Liverpool Do you think she has gone to America Where else She s in league with Corbett somehow of that I am certain and I think that the Monte Carlo address was a mere blind a clever one too as it even deceived you mister Bruce Yes It did deceive me Then why are you so surprised at the suggestion that the lady should attempt to cross the Atlantic Because I have not your rapid perception of the points of the case That s your way of pulling my leg mister Bruce The barrister smiled missus Hillmer of course had gone to Monte Carlo Once there she would have little difficulty in tracing the White Heather and overtaking Mensmore She would warn him of the police pursuit and there would be a scene between them How would it result Would Mensmore guilty seek safety in flight Would he innocent return to London and demand to be confronted with his accusers For the life of him Bruce could not say positively Yet he felt the situation was too delicate to be dealt with by mister White s bludgeon methods and he forebore to speak The detective interpreted his silence as an admission of inability to find a satisfactory explanation of missus Hillmer s absence He went on Corbett is not at Monte Carlo So I imagined Well it is a fact The police have made constant inquiries for him at the Hotel du Cercle and elsewhere Not the slightest trace of him can be found I was there myself you know Yes sir I have not forgotten that But it shows what a clever rascal the fellow is in concealing his identity However he could never have counted on my discovering that letter of his Even if he is not in America we shall have some reliable data to go upon in answer to my queries There I fully agree with you You will have done a great deal if you thoroughly clear up the mystery regarding Corbett May I ask you to let me know the result With pleasure sir And now can I request a favor in return Certainly Tell me then what is in your opinion the best way to find missus Hillmer Bruce did not expect to be thus openly challenged on the matter It was one thing to withhold his own theories and discoveries from this representative of the majesty of the law but quite another to refuse to help a detective with whom he was nominally working Besides missus Hillmer had four days start It would take some time possibly a telegram would not be sufficiently explicit to obtain the desired assistance from the Continental police Yes in this instance Mensmore must take his chances If I were you said Bruce slowly weighing his words I would inquire at the Continental booking offices at Victoria and Charing Cross and from the guards in charge of the morning mail trains on the thirtieth In fact it would be quite safe if you were to wire the authorities at Monte Carlo asking if missus Hillmer is not now at the Hotel du Cercle The detective started as though he had been shot What he cried you think she is there all the time I think she has been there since Wednesday morning That is what I mean Why did you not tell me sooner Because you never asked me And now mister White one word of advice Go slow It s all jolly fine telling me to go slow when I have no reason to go fast The case even against Corbett is shadowy enough at present Exactly Wait until you can grasp a substance I will sir said White jamming his hat on but when I lay my hands on Corbett I will grasp him hard enough It took the policeman all that day to satisfy himself that missus Hillmer had really booked for the Riviera by the Club train from Charing Cross on the preceding Monday Just as he verified the fact came a reply from the Monte Carlo police missus Hillmer arrived at the Hotel du Cercle on Wednesday Left for Italy same afternoon Shall we endeavor to trace her Oh bother he growled Corbett may be in Jerusalem by this time And here have I been fussing about Wyoming or some other potato patch in the Far West However he wired again to Monte Carlo Yes Locate missus Hillmer if possible I will then telegraph instructions to local police When this message was despatched he felt easier in his mind The chase was at least getting warm I cannot arrest him yet he reflected but if I once get fairly on his track I will not lose sight of him again if I can help it I suppose it will mean a trip to Italy for me I must lay the evidence before the Treasury to see if a warrant is justified Two days passed without incident Late on Sunday evening February five a Continental telegram was handed to him at Scotland Yard missus Hillmer s present address Hotel Imperiale Florence He promptly wired the Chief of Police at Florence Keep missus Hillmer English visitor Hotel Imperiale under surveillance Also watch her associates particularly Englishman named Corbett if there Letter follows That s a good stroke of business said he when the message was sent Now we shan t be long It was in contented mood that he lit a cigar in his office before walking home for dinner but a messenger with the badge of the Commercial Cable Company in Northumberland Avenue bustled past him Who s the cable for boy said the detective White Scotland Yard was the answer That s me He tore open the envelope and found that the contents were coded but he caught the word Corbett amidst the unintelligible jumble With some excitement he rushed into the office to find the A B C Code and after some confusion in deciphering the words this was what he read Regret delay in replying to your communication Corbett left New York in White Star steamer due Liverpool February four February four Why that s yesterday Good gracious he s here all the time Well of all the But exclamations were useless Calling another plain clothes man to accompany him he drove off in mad haste to Sloane Square About an hour later Bruce received a typewritten slip gummed on to a telegraph form It was from Florence and ran as follows My brother wildly excited regarding allegations We start for London to night Meanwhile fearful complications expected mister Corbett of Wyoming my brother s friend is probably occupying his flat and may be arrested We both trust you to save him Wire us at Modane or Gare du Nord GWENDOLINE HILLMER So Bruce also raced off in a hansom towards Sloane Square CHAPTER XX mister SYDNEY H CORBETT The detective glanced up at Bruce s chambers while passing through Victoria Street I wonder what he would think if he knew what we are after he said to his colleague one of the two who accompanied him when the barrister was arrested by mistake What are we after said the policeman This time we are going to nail the right Corbett was the confident answer Will we cart him off Well now that depends I think I am quite right in collaring him unless he explains to my satisfaction which is hardly likely The charge is one of murder isn t it Yes Who did he kill Well up to now it hasn t come out for the sake of the family But if Corbett is here you will know soon enough It s a funny way to go to work Commissioner s orders my boy I am not to reveal the la the name until it cannot be helped However as I have said so much I don t mind telling you it s a woman and a big one too Big Fat do you mean No A woman of high position Phew A regular society scandal I suppose That s about the size of it On arrival at Sloane Square they quickly ascended to No twelve Raleigh Mansions A stout elderly woman answered their knock and a glance at her face revealed the map of Ireland although her name was Saxon Robinson mister Corbett in inquired White Faix he s not Then where is he I don t know misther an if I did I wouldn t be afther telling when axed in an oncivil manner All right missus Robinson s my name if that s anny use to ye Very well missus Robinson We wish to have a word with mister Corbett and we will be much obliged if you can tell us when he is likely to return if he is in London Arrah it s meself is mixed intirely about him Sure this mister Corbett is in London right enough and is comin in to dinner in half an hour so by yer lave I ll jist go on wid me wurruk May we come in and wait for him missus Robinson surveyed them suspiciously but seemingly decided in their favor Stip in here gintlemen both she said and conducted them to the sitting room A fire now burned brightly in the grate wherein Bruce had made his pregnant discovery The damaged bracket still stared at White so to speak but he saw it not missus Robinson bustled away to the kitchen and the two officers sat silently waiting developments Suddenly a thought occurred to White and he went into the passage missus Robinson he said what did you mean by referring to this mister Corbett A quick step came bounding up the stairs and a key rattled in the lock You d betther ax him yerself responded the housekeeper pithily and the door opened to admit a handsome well knit man tall and straight with the clearly cut features of the true Westerner and the easy carriage of one accustomed to the freedom of the prairie He was quietly dressed The only sign that he was not a Londoner was given by his wide awake felt hat the last token of environment relinquished by a wandering citizen from the region of the Rockies In the semi darkness of the interior he could but dimly discern the form of the detective behind the ready tongued housekeeper There s two gintlemen to see ye Misther Corbett said she Well now that s curious he answered cheerfully I can only see one of you but I m glad to have you call stranger anyway Come right in Are you sent by my friend to kinder cheer me up I find this big city of yours a powerful kind of tonic after Wyoming Come right in mister White was as greatly nonplussed by the newcomer s attitude as by his flow of language Within the drawing room Corbett caught sight of the second detective Hello Here s the other one Ve ry glad to meet you both Now if you ll just tell me your names we ll get along straight away as I guess you know mine all right The man was genuinely pleased by this unexpected visit He smilingly pushed towards them a box of cigars green ones and helped himself to a weed My name said the detective is Inspector White of Scotland Yard and my friend here accompanies me officially And hasn t he got a name Yes but it doesn t matter Well if it doesn t matter we won t quarrel I guess you ve got a message of some sort for me else you wouldn t trouble to climb these stairs Why don t you have el e vators in these big buildings As I said began mister White we are from Scotland Yard That s so I ve got that fixed O K Your name is I White from Scotland Yard I don t know where Scotland Yard is but we ll worry along without the geography of it I am in the police My title is Inspector It is not my Christian name Scotland Yard is the headquarters of the London police The American s eyes opened wide in wonder at this announcement and a perplexing thought seemed to occur to him But he said quietly I ll figure it out better when you tell me why you ve been good enough to call And suppose we all sit down I m not used to stone pavements I m tired Your name is Sydney H Corbett said the detective severely though he took a chair So my people always told me And you have occupied these chambers since August last Have I So I am informed Get along with your story You have just returned to England from Wyoming The New York police cabled me that you arrived in Liverpool yesterday Did they now That was real cute of em I want to ask you in the first instance the exact date of your departure from this country Before replying to the detective Corbett looked at him fixedly as though he was trying to read what was passing in his mind At last he said with a smile Say what are you after mister White of Scotland Yard What s the game Who s been fooling you That is not the way to talk to me sir Answer my question fully and properly or it may be worse for you Jehosh Have you come to wipe the floor with me Are you going to reply to me or not I m not going to speak square to any man who comes along and puts a thing like you do Very well I can get my information by other means You leave me no alternative mister White had half risen and was about to add but to arrest you when with a rapidity known only to those accustomed to draw from boyhood Corbett whipped a revolver from a hip pocket and covered the bridge of White s nose with the muzzle Just you sit still right there mister White of Scotland Yard or I will let daylight through you and your nameless friend if he interferes You d better believe me By gad I won t speak twice Neither White nor his companion were cowards But they were quite helpless They had not grappled with the circumstances with sufficient alertness and they were utterly at this man s mercy They were away from the door and a table separated them from Corbett while there was that in his eye which told them he would shoot if either of them moved They both sprang to their feet and glared at him impotently Now gentlemen said Corbett with the utmost coolness let me persuade you to sit down again and go on with your story which interests me White was scarlet with wrath and annoyance Let me tell you he roared Sit down Make the best of it Jim murmured the other policeman and the queer gathering resumed their seats That s better said Corbett genially Now we ll have a nice little chat Am I correct in supposing that you were about to march me off to jail just now when I spoilt the proposition There s no use in resisting growled White You cannot escape If you have an atom of sense left you will come with us quietly as it s all up with you It looks like it said Corbett with a grim smile But if it s so bad a case as all that there s no desperate hurry is there You re only making matters more difficult for yourself Maybe But as I happen to be a citizen of the United States I allow that I can t be whipped off to prison just because a fool like you thinks it s good for me I ve been a law abiding man all my life and I ve lived in places where each man made his own law If you can show good cause for your action I ll stand the racket At present I regard you as a blamed idiot The situation overcame the detective He could only mutter Time will show who s the idiot I m getting hungry mister White of Scotland Yard and I ve a kind of notion that the old lady is ready with the eatables Will you be good enough to say what you re after I came here to ask you to account for your movements and failing a satisfactory explanation to arrest you On what charge For being concerned in the murder of Lady Dyke on or about November six last Lady Dyke Yes Arrest me Yes I placed you right away You are a blamed idiot mister White of Scotland Yard This repetition of his name and address goaded the detective almost beyond endurance Now you know the charge he shouted are you coming with us quietly or Or what The revolver still hovered across the table Are we going to sit here all night It was a weak conclusion but to suggest an attack was sheer madness under the conditions I guess not was the calm answer I want my dinner and I mean to have it Very well Eat your dinner and have done with it That s better You and your friend shall join me We ll have a nice little talk and straighten out matters which have got kinder mixed This was too much for White s associate He burst out laughing I allowed there was a joke in the deal somewhere went on Corbett but I haven t quite got the hang of it yet Now mister White of Scotland Yard are you going to act like a reasonable man or must I keep your nose in line with the barrel White was saved from deciding which horn of the dilemma he would land on for a sharp rat tat at the door induced silence and a moment later Bruce s voice was heard inquiring Is mister Corbett in Faix there may be a half a dozen of him in by this time cried missus Robinson I dunno where I am at all at all The gintlemen are in the parlor sir And Bruce entered In order to enfilade the new comer scientifically Corbett backed to the corner Claude glanced at the three saw the revolver and said with a comical air of relief Thank goodness nothing has happened Put away your pistol mister Corbett you will not need it Although the barrister s manner differed considerably from the brusque methods adopted by mister White the American remained on his guard He said stiffly You all seem to know me fairly well but if you had the advantage of closer acquaintance you would allow that I am not the man to be rushed on a confidence trick If somebody doesn t explain quick I will lose my temper and there will be trouble I sympathize with you cried Bruce But the first thing you must learn in this country is to keep dry cigars for your visitors Our respective tastes differ in that respect I guess I ll cotton to you stranger but I m tired holding this pistol Put it away then I tell you it is not wanted White listen to me You have hit upon the wrong man Wrong man cried the detective feeling more confident in the barrister s presence Why I ve had a cable about him from New York Possibly but you re mistaken nevertheless mister Corbett has not been within five thousand miles of England for years possibly not in his life Bully for you stranger broke in Corbett Then who is mister Sydney H Corbett whom you believe as well as I to be the murderer of Lady Dyke Steady White The last time I saw you I appealed to you to go slow The man whom you want simply because he happens to be the real occupant of these rooms is at present travelling to London as fast he can from Florence and his sister missus Hillmer is with him Florence missus Hillmer gasped the policeman I ve just arranged to have her watched there Your arrangements though admirable are somewhat late in the day Then what is her brother s name Albert Mensmore For some reason hidden at this moment he lived here under the name of the gentleman who has I see been giving you a practical lesson in the art of not jumping at conclusions Have you known this long For some weeks Then why didn t you tell me Because I have no definite reason for connecting Mensmore with Lady Dyke s death If I had his action in returning to London the moment he hears of the charge would shake my belief Who told him missus Hillmer Oh this business is quite beyond me I can t fathom it a little bit And White sank dejectedly to his chair again I don t know what you re talking about gentlemen said Corbett pocketing his revolver but it dawns upon me that I shan t be required to shoot anybody or sleep in jail to night Why didn t you answer my questions properly and save all this nonsense I ll tell you why sir The name of a friend of mine has been mentioned Albert Mensmore has been more than a brother to me I allowed you meant mischief to him as you thought you were talking to him all the time I don t know much about you but I hope that your first action would not be to give away your chum if he is in trouble The detective did not answer though his look of astonishment at Corbett s declaration of motive was eloquent enough Before we quit this business went on the American let me say one thing Any man who tells you that Albert Mensmore murdered a woman is telling you a lie I don t know anything about this Lady Dyke or how she may have died but I do know my friend He s good in a tight place but to think of him killing a woman Jehosh it s sickening missus Robinson burst in with face aflame Is this palaverin to go on all night she demanded angrily Here s the dinner sphilin after all me worry and bother with the head of me vexed to know who is the masther and who ishn t All right mother laughed Corbett Bring in the whole caboodle mister Corbett said Bruce I hope you will come and have lunch with me to morrow at this address handing him a card I want to have a long talk with you mister White if you come with me I will explain a good deal to you of which you are now in ignorance Surely mister Corbett will answer a few questions first said the detective Don t you think you have troubled him sufficiently for this evening Besides he can tell us nothing All the explanation is really due to him and I propose to give it to him to morrow Come White this time I promise you that a considerable portion of your inquiry shall be cleared up and I do not speak without foundation as you have often learned hitherto So the mysterious Sydney H Corbett was left in undisturbed possession of his flat and his dinner while the trio passed out into the quietude of the streets CHAPTER XXI HOW LADY DYKE LEFT RALEIGH MANSIONS mister White was actually inclined to preserve silence while they walked to Victoria Street The events of the preceding hour had not exactly conduced to the maintenance in the eyes of his brother officer of that pre eminent sagacity which he invariably claimed His companion rubbed in this phase of the matter by saying I should think Jim you will give Raleigh Mansions wide berth for some time to come after making two bad breaks there But it was no part of Bruce s scheme that the detective should be rendered desperate by repeated failures It is not mister White s fault he said that these errors have occurred They are rather the result of his pertinacity in leaving no clue unsolved which promises to lead to success When this case ends if ever it does end I feel sure he will admit that he has never before encountered so much difficulty in unravelling the most complex problems within his experience That is so chimed in the senior detective The thing that beats me in this affair is the want of a beginning so to speak One would imagine it the work of a lunatic if Lady Dyke herself had not contributed so curiously to the mystery of her disappearance There you are White that is the true scent Find the motive and we find the murderer if Lady Dyke was wilfully put to death If she was mister Bruce Have you any doubt about it There cannot be certainty when we are groping in the dark But the gloom is passing we are on the eve of a discovery At Bruce s residence White s colleague left him Soon the barrister and the policeman were sitting snugly before a good fire There Claude took him step by step through each branch of his inquiry as it is known to the reader He omitted nothing The discovery of Jane Harding and of Mensmore the latter s transactions with Dodge company his dramatic coup at Monte Carlo and its attendant love episode all these were exhaustively described He enlarged upon missus Hillmer s anxiety when the tragedy became known to her and did not forget Sir Charles Dyke s amazement at the suggestion that his old playmate might prove to be responsible for the death of his wife He produced the waxen moulds of the piece of iron found on the body at Putney and the ornamental scroll from which it had been taken At this bit of evidence mister White s complacency forsook him Thus far he had experienced a feeling of resentment against Bruce for having concealed from him so much that was material to their investigation But when he realized that a powerful link in the chain of events had all along been placidly resting before his eyes his distress was evident and the barrister came to his rescue You are not to blame White he said for having failed to note many things which I have now told you You are the slave of a system Your method works admirably for the detection of commonplace crime but as soon as the higher region of romance is reached it is as much out of place as a steam roller in a lady s boudoir Look at the remarkable series of crimes the English police have failed to solve of late merely because some bizarre element had intruded itself at the outset Have you ever read any of the works of Edgar Allan Poe The detective answered in the affirmative The Murders of the Rue Morgue and The Mystery of Marie Roget were familiar to him Well went on Bruce there you have the accurate samples of my meaning Poe would not have been puzzled for an hour by the vagaries of Jack the Ripper He would have said at once most certainly after the third or fourth in the series of murders This is the work of an athletic lunatic with a morbid love of anatomy and a morbid hatred of a certain class of women Seek for him among young men who have pestered doctors with outrageous theories and who possess weak minded or imbecile relatives Then again take the murder on the South Western Railway Do you think Poe would have gone questioning bar tenders or inquiring into abortive love affairs Not he Jealous swains do not carry pestles about with them to slay their sweethearts nor do they choose a four minutes interval between suburban stations for frenzied avowals of their passion Here you have the clear trail of a clever lunatic dropping from the skies as it were and disappearing in the same erratic manner That is why I tell you most emphatically that neither you nor I have yet the remotest conception as to who really killed Lady Dyke Surely things look black now against this Mensmore Do they How would it have fared with an acquaintance of one of the unfortunate women killed by Jack the Ripper had the police found him in the locality with fresh blood stains on his clothes What would have resulted from the discovery of a chemist s mortar among the possessions of one of Elizabeth Camp s male friends Come now be honest and tell me But mister White could only smoke in silence Therefore continued Bruce let us ask ourselves why and how it was possible for Mensmore to commit the crime Personally notwithstanding all that we apparently know against him circumstantially I should hardly believe Mensmore if he confessed himself to be the murderer Now why on earth do you say that mister Bruce Because Mensmore is normal and this crime abnormal Because the man who would blow out his brains on account of losses at pigeon shooting never had brains enough to dispose of the body in such fashion Because Mensmore having temporarily changed his name for some trivial reason would never resume it with equal triviality with this shadow upon his life Then why have you told me all these things that tell so heavily against him In order that this time at least you may feel that the production of a pair of handcuffs does not satisfactorily settle the entire business I promise there shall be no more arrests until this affair is much more decided than it is at present Good I shall make a detective of you after my own heart in time Yet I cannot help being surprised at the very strange fact that his own sister should seem to suspect him Ah Now you have struck the true line Why did she have that fear There I am with you entirely Let us ascertain that and I promise you an important development missus Hillmer and Mensmore are both concerned in the disappearance of Lady Dyke yet neither knew that she had disappeared and both are deeply upset by it for missus Hillmer flies off to warn her brother and the brother posts back to London the moment it comes to his ears through her There you see we have a key which may unlock many doors For Heaven s sake let it not be battered out of shape the instant it reaches our hands But mister White was quite humble As I have told you he said I have done with the battering process I am sure of it And now listen to the most remarkable fact that has yet come to light Lady Dyke s body was taken from Raleigh Mansions to Putney in a four wheeler The cabman was forthwith locked up by the police and clapped into prison for three months He was released yesterday and will be here within the next quarter of an hour The detective s hair nearly rose on end at this statement Look here mister Bruce he cried have you any more startlers up your sleeve or is that the finish That is the last shot in my locker I m jolly glad I half expected the next thing you would say was that you did the job yourself It wouldn t be the first time you thought that eh my friend White positively blushed Oh that s chaff he said But why the dickens did the police lock up this cabman the only witness we could lay our hands upon Why I myself questioned every cabman in the vicinity several times Because he got drunk on the proceeds of the journey and subsequently thought he was Phaeton driving the chariot of the sun But there he will tell you himself I met him yesterday morning outside Holloway Jail and persuaded him to come here to night provided he has not gone on the spree again with disastrous results The entrance of Smith obviously relieved to see his master and the tec on such good terms to announce the arrival of mister William Marsh settled any doubts as to the cabman s intentions and his appearance established the fact of his sobriety Three months hard had made the cab driver a new man Recognition was mutual between him and mister White Hello Foxey cried the latter It s you is it Me it is guv nor but I didn t know there was to be a cop here this with a suspicious glance at Bruce and a backward movement towards the door Do not be alarmed said the barrister this gentleman s presence implies no trouble for you We want you to help us and if you do so willingly I will make up that lost fiver you received for driving two people to Putney the night you were arrested The poor old cabman became very confused on hearing this staggering remark Up to that moment he regarded Bruce as the agent for a charitable association and there was no harm he told his missus in trying to knock him for a bit He stood nervously fumbling with his hat but did not answer White knew how to deal with him Sit down Foxey and have a drink You need one to cheer you up Answer this gentleman s questions He means you no harm Honor bright Honor bright Well I don t mind if I do No soda thank you sir Just a small drop of water Ah that s better stuff n they keep in Holloway Thus fortified Marsh had no hesitation in telling them what he knew Substantially his story was identical with the version given to Bruce by the ticket collector Can you describe the gentleman said the barrister No sir He was just like any other swell Tall and well dressed and talked in the aw aw style It might ha been yerself for all I could tell Do you think it was I Foxey scratched his head No p r aps it wasn t now I come to rec llect He ad a moustache and you aven t Beggin yer pardon sir but you ave a bit of the cut of a parson or a hactor an this chap wasn t neither just an every day sort of toff Could you swear to him if you saw him That I couldn t sir I am a rare and at langwidge but I couldn t manage that Why Because that night sir I were as full as a tick when I started Lord love you it must ave poured out of me afterwards when I started fightin coppers mister White e knows I ain t no fightin man as a rule And the lady Did you see her No sir Leastways I seed a bundle which I took to be a lydy but her face was covered up with a shawl and she was lyin eavy in is arms as though she was mortal bad He tell d me she was sick Did he Anything else No sir Are you sure it was a shawl A vacuous smile spread over Foxey s countenance as he answered I ain t sure of anythink that appened that night But were you not surprised when a man hired your cab under such peculiar circumstances and paid you such a high fare We four wheelers are surprised at nothink sir You don t know all wot goes on in kebs Why once crossin Waterloo Bridge Never mind Waterloo Bridge Foxey put in the detective Keep your wits fixed on as much as you can remember of November six Where did he tell you to drive to went on Bruce Just Putney I was to drive my ardest I recollect wantin to pull up at the Three Bells but e put is ead out an said Go on driver I am awfully late already So on I went Where did you stop I don t know no more than the child unborn By that time the drink was yeastin up in me The fare kept me on the road e wanted by shoutin When we pulled up e carries er into a lane There was a big ouse there I know that all right After a bit e comes back and tips me a fiver With that I whips up the old oss and gets back to the Three Bells You know the rest as the girl said when she axed the Bench to Yes we know the rest interrupted Bruce but I fear you are not able to help us much This isn t a five pun job eh guv nor said Foxey anxiously Hardly at present We shall see Can you say exactly where you drew up your cab when the lady was carried into it Sure as death replied the cabman in the hope that his information might yet be valuable It was outside Raleigh Mansions Sloane Square We know that It seems to me sir as ye know as much about the business as I do broke in Marsh Were you in the Square or in Sloane Street In Sloane Street of course Right away from the Square Not so very far away surely Foxey was doubtful His memory was hazy and he feared lest he should be mistaken No no he said quickly not far but still well in the street Were there many people about You could ardly tell sir it was that foggy and nasty If the lydy ad bin dead nobody would ave noticed er that night Did any one besides yourself see the gentleman carrying the lady into the cab I think not I don t remember anybody passin at the time Did the gentleman keep your cab waiting long at the kerb before he brought the lady out It might a bin a minute or two No longer Well sir it s ard for me to say especially after bein away for a change of ealth so to speak Did not the lady speak or move in any manner Not so far as I know sir And do you mean to tell me that although you had been drinking you were not astonished at the whole business I never axes my fares any questions cept when they says By the hour Then I wants to know a bit Yes but this carrying of a lady out of a house in such fashion did not this strike you as strange Strange bless your eart sir You ought to see me cartin em off from the Daffodil Club after a big night three and four in one keb all blind paralytic No doubt but this was not the Daffodil Club at daybreak It was a respectable neighborhood at seven o clock or thereabouts on a winter s evening It ain t my fault said Foxey doggedly Wot was wrong with the lydy Was it a habduction The lady was dead murdered we believe The cabman s face grew livid with anxiety Oh crikey mister White he cried addressing the detective I knew nothink about it No one says you did Foxey was the reply Don t be frightened We just want you to help us as far as you can and not to get skeered and lose your wits Thus reassured Marsh mopped his head and said solemnly I will do wot lies in my power gentlemen both but I wish I adn t bin so blamed drunk that night You say you would not recognize your fare if you saw him continued Bruce Could you tell us if you were shown a certain person that he was not the man You might not be sure of the right man but you might be sure regarding the wrong one Yes sir It wasn t you and it wasn t mister White and it wasn t a lot of other people I know I think if I saw the man who really got into my keb I would be able to swear that e was like him at any rate All right That will do for the present Leave us your address so that we may find you again if necessary Here is a sovereign for you When Marsh had gone Bruce turned to the detective Well he said if Mensmore were here now I suppose you would want to lock him up No admitted White sadly the more I learn about this affair the more mixed it becomes Still I don t deny but I shall be glad to have Mensmore s explanation of his movements at that time And so will you mister Bruce CHAPTER XXII A WILFUL MURDER Bruce sent a telegram to missus Hillmer at Paris Matters satisfactorily arranged pending your arrival he wired and early on Monday morning he received a reply Due Charing Cross seven point thirty P M Will drive straight to your chambers with my brother GWENDOLINE HILLMER He forwarded the message with a note to the detective asking him to be present About one o clock Corbett turned up Guess I slept well last night after the excitement he said with a pleasant smile You seemed to skeer those chaps more with a few words mister Bruce than I did with a revolver The English police are not so much afraid of revolvers as they are of making mistakes was the answer Now is that so On our side they wouldn t have stopped to argy Both of em would have drawn on me at once Then I am glad for everybody s sake mister Corbett that the affair happened in London Why sure But tell me Has my friend Mensmore been getting himself into trouble Not so much as it looks Others appear to have involved him without his knowledge and he has lent color to the accusations by involuntary actions of a suspicious nature Well if it is permissible I should like to hear the straight story Under the circumstances Bruce thought that this stranger from America had a right to know why he was in danger of being arrested during his first twenty four hours residence in the country so he gave him a succinct narrative of the prima facie case against Mensmore Corbett listened in silence to the recital When it ended he said mister Bruce my friend was incapable of murdering any woman He was equally incapable of conducting any discreditable liaison with any woman I have known him for years and a straighter truer more honorable man I never met I don t know what his reason was for assuming my name which he undoubtedly did as the agent called this morning and I find the flat is taken in my name What did you say Oh just that Mensmore had acted for me The man seemed a bit puzzled but he didn t kick when I offered to pay up the rent owing since Christmas and another quarter in advance I don t suppose he did The rent was due then Yes It seems that Mensmore writing in my name sent a letter from Monte Carlo a month ago saying he would return about this time and settle up Thus proving his intention all along to come back to London It is a queer muddle mister Corbett is it not Very but you will pardon me as an outsider saying one thing you all appear to have overlooked a clear trail And what is that What about missus Hillmer Who is she Who are her friends Who maintains her in such style Bertie was with me four years and never mentioned her name She could not have been rich by inheritance as it was on account of their father going broke that Mensmore had to leave the Army and come to the States It strikes me mister Bruce that the woman knows more about this affair than the man You may be right But do not forget the absolute proofs we possess that the crime occurred in Mensmore s chambers and the extraordinary coincidence that he left England immediately afterwards I am not forgetting anything Those facts tell both ways Just because he quitted the country at the time somebody may have tried to throw the blame on him The theory was plausible though Bruce could not accept it Nevertheless after Corbett had taken his departure he could not help thinking about his references to missus Hillmer That there was force in them he could not deny and with the admission came the unpleasant thought that perhaps he Bruce was in some sense responsible for the neglect to clear up her antecedents However a few hours might explain much With unwonted impatience the barrister awaited the coming of night He tried every expedient to kill time and found each operation tedious He dined early and as half past seven came and passed he wondered why the detective did not appear But his doubts on this point did not last long White is looking at Charing Cross to make sure of their arrival he said to himself At ten minutes to eight the detective came in hurriedly They will be here directly he announced A servant has taken their luggage to missus Hillmer s place and they are evidently driving straight here after taking some refreshment at the station Have you no faith in human nature mister White Could you not trust their words Well sir my experience of human nature is that you can very seldom trust anybody s word At last Smith announced missus Hillmer and mister Mensmore When they entered Bruce was for the moment at a loss to know exactly how to receive them But missus Hillmer settled the matter by greeting him with a quiet Good evening and seating herself Mensmore stood near the door very pale and stern looking It appears mister Bruce he said that we met in Monte Carlo under false pretences You were it seems a detective on the track of a murderer and you were good enough to believe that I was the person you sought It would have saved some misconception on my part had you explained our roles earlier However I am here to meet the charge Claude was not unprepared for this attitude on Mensmore s part But he was determined that it should not continue if he could help it When we parted at Monte Carlo Mensmore he said we parted as friends Yes Then tell me what has happened since to cause this obvious change in your opinion of me Is it not true that you suspect me of murdering Lady Dyke No But why has my sister been told that I ran serious risk of being apprehended on that account Because we certainly did suspect a mysterious personage who called himself Sydney H Corbett and whose behavior was so unaccountable that the authorities required a reasonable explanation of it Do I understand Bruce that we meet with no more suspicion between us than when we last saw each other Most certainly Then I ask your pardon for my manner and words I have suffered keenly during the last three days from this cruel thought Let us shake hands on it As their hands met they both heard missus Hillmer stifle a sob Mensmore turned to her Now Gwen he said don t be foolish We will soon clear up this miserable business So far as we are concerned all we need to do is to tell the truth and fear nobody That s it said White If you adopt that course the matter will soon be ended Mensmore turned to the speaker He guessed his identity but Bruce introduced the detective by name Well said Mensmore I have come here to answer questions What is it you want to know mister White glanced at the barrister and the other explained I have as you may already realize taken more than a passive interest in this inquiry so the questioning largely devolves on me First tell me why you adopted the name of Corbett Simply enough though stupid I now admit When I returned from the States I was very hard up but managed to pick up a subsistence by writing for the sporting press and occasionally backing horses But I knew this could not last so I tried to secure some financial interests in the City In doing so I made the acquaintance of a man named Dodge and committed myself to the underwriting of a new venture named the Springbok Mine This fell through at the time and with this collapse came other demands I hate being worried by creditors so when my sister offered to take and furnish a flat for me near her own I thought I would live quietly for a time and conceal my name so as to have peace there at any rate Therefore I assumed the name of a friend in America little thinking that I should land both him and myself into such trouble by doing it That is the explanation By the way what has happened to Corbett He is all right He expects to see you to night You know Sir Charles Dyke do you not Yes Intimately Well no not exactly He and I were at school together at Brighton at Childe s place At Brighton Yes I was a little chap when Dyke was a senior After he left the headmaster changed the school to a place called Seton Lodge at Putney on account of cramming operations for Army exams Then you were at Putney Yes for two years And Dyke was not No that I am sure of Have you and Sir Charles been friendly since Mensmore s face hardened somewhat as he answered I have seen very little of him and hardly ever spoken to him Why Did you quarrel N no but we just did not happen to meet Bear in mind I was in business some years ago and I am not yet thirty Did you know his wife I have never to my knowledge seen her How then can you account for the fact that she visited your flat at Raleigh Mansions on November six I say that such a statement is mere nonsense But if it can be proved It cannot I assure you on my honor that it can But look here Bruce Why should she come to see me I question greatly if she knew of my existence Nevertheless it is the fact I can only tell you it is not I left London on November eight and on the two previous evenings I dined alone missus Robinson my housekeeper can tell you that not another soul entered my flat for a week prior to my departure except my sister and and I had forgotten some workmen Some workmen Yes some fellows from a furniture warehouse What were they doing Well don t you see I told you I was not well off and my sister furnished my flat for me in August last that was but the drawing room was left bare for a time Just before I left for France she decided to refurnish her drawing room and she gave me the whole fit out The things were brought in by the men who brought her purchases At this astounding revelation Bruce and the detective were utterly taken aback It was with difficulty that the barrister enunciated his next words clearly Can you tell me with absolute certainty the date of this change of the furniture Oh yes It was the day before I started for the Riviera that must have been November seven Are you positive of this Undoubtedly Is it a matter of importance Gwen you know all about it Besides the bills for your new furniture will show the exact date of delivery and it was the same day missus Hillmer s face was hidden by her veil but she nodded silently Three people in the room knew the significance of Mensmore s straightforward words he alone was unaware of the direction towards which the investigation now tended Let us analyze the matter carefully said Bruce who had recovered his self possession though he was almost terrified at the possibilities of the situation Did the whole of the contents of your drawing room come from your sister s flat Every stick There was nothing there before but the bare boards Do you remember a handsome ornamental fender being among these articles Perfectly My housekeeper said the men broke it during the transit They denied this and looked for the piece chipped off but could not find it She told me about it that night Did you mention it to missus Hillmer No To tell the honest truth Gwen and I had quarrelled a couple of days before That is to say we disagreed seriously about a certain matter and it was this which led to my making off to Monte Carlo Therefore it was hardly likely I should mention such a trivial matter to her May I ask what you quarrelled about I have told her since that it ought to be made known but she has implored me not to reveal it so I cannot But she will tell you herself that we agreed I should be at liberty to make this guarded explanation Bruce and the detective exchanged glances of wondering comprehension I do not think we need question mister Mensmore further said the barrister to White No was the reply The matter is clear enough missus Hillmer must tell us how that furniture came to be transferred from her premises on the morning of the seventh If she chooses The barrister s tone was sad and its ominous significance was not lost on his hearers missus Hillmer raised her veil Her face was deathly pale and tense in its fixed agony But in her eyes was a light which gave a curious aspect of resolve to her otherwise painful aspect of utter grief I do not choose she said quietly looking not at Bruce or the detective but at her brother For a little while no one spoke Mensmore at last broke out eagerly Don t act absurdly Gwen I cannot even guess where all this talk about the furniture is leading us but I do know that you are as innocent of any complicity in Lady Dyke s death as I am so it is better for you to help forward the inquiry than to retard it I am not innocent said missus Hillmer her words falling with painful distinctness upon the ears of the three men Heaven help me I am responsible for it Her brother started to his feet and caught her by the shoulder What folly is this he cried Do you know what you are saying Fully My words are like sledge hammers I will forever feel their weight I tell you I am responsible for the death of Lady Dyke Then how did she die missus Hillmer said Bruce whose glance sought to read her soul I do not know I do not want to know It matters little to me In other words you are assuming a responsibility you should not bear You were not even aware of this poor lady s death until I told you Why should you seek to avert suspicion from others merely because Lady Dyke is shown to have met her death in your apartments But how is it shown interrupted Mensmore vehemently He was more disturbed by his sister s unaccountable attitude than he had ever been by the serious charge against himself Easily enough said White feeling that he ought to have some share in the conversation A piece of the damaged fender placed in your rooms mister Mensmore was found in the murdered lady s head Was it he cried Then by Heaven I refuse to see my sister sacrificed for anybody s sake She has borne too long the whole burden of misery and degradation I tell you Gwen that if you do not save yourself I will save you against your will That furniture came to my room because Bertie I beseech you for the sake of the woman you love to spare me missus Hillmer flung herself on her knees before him and caught hold of his hands while she burst into a storm of tears Mensmore was unnerved He turned to Bruce and said Help me in this miserable business old chap I don t know what to say or do my sister had no more connection with Lady Dyke s death than I had This statement on her part is mere hysteria arising from other circumstances altogether That I feel acutely said the barrister Yet some one killed her and whatever the pain that may be caused and whoever may suffer I am determined that the truth shall come out I tell you wailed missus Hillmer between her sobs that I must bear all the blame Why do you hesitate She was killed in my house and I confess my guilt This is rum business growled mister White aloud half unconsciously At that moment the door opened unexpectedly and Smith entered Before Bruce had time to vociferate an order to his astounded servitor the man stuttered an excuse Beg pardon sir he said but Sir Charles Dyke has called and wants to know if you will be disengaged soon CHAPTER XXIII THE LETTER Quick on the heels of the footman s stammered explanation came the voice of Sir Charles himself Sorry to disturb you Bruce if you are busy but I must see you for a moment on a matter of the utmost importance There was that in his utterance which betokened great excitement He was not visible to the occupants of the room During the audible silence that followed his words they could hear him stamping about the passage impatiently awaiting Bruce s presence missus Hillmer quietly collapsed on the floor She had fainted The barrister rushed out calling for missus Smith and responding to Sir Charles Dyke s proffered statement as to the reason for his presence by the startling cry Wait a bit Dyke There s a lady in a faint inside We must attend to her at once missus Smith fortunately was at hand and with the help of her ministrations missus Hillmer gradually regained her senses After a whispered colloquy with White the barrister said to Mensmore You must remove your sister to her residence as quickly as possible She is far too highly strung to bear any further questioning to night Perhaps to morrow when you and she have discussed matters fully together you may be able to send for us and clear up this wretched business For answer Mensmore silently pressed his hand With the help of the housekeeper he led his sister from the room passing Sir Charles Dyke in the hall The baronet politely turned aside and Mensmore did not look at him being far too engrossed with his sister to pay heed to aught else at the moment As for missus Hillmer she was in such a state of collapse as to be practically unconscious of her surroundings She managed to murmur at the door Where are you taking me to Bertie Home dear Home Oh thank Heaven They all heard her and even the detective was constrained to say Poor thing she needn t have been afraid She is suffering for some one else Sir Charles Dyke grasped Bruce s arm What on earth is going on he said Merely a foolish woman worrying herself about others replied Bruce grimly But those people were my old friends Mensmore and his sister Yes What are they doing here Mensmore has been brought back to London by missus Hillmer to face the allegations made against him with regard to your wife s disappearance They came here by their own appointment and Did I not tell you that this charge against Mensmore was wild folly on the face of it So it seems when we have just discovered that your wife was killed in his sister s house and missus Hillmer persists in declaring that she was responsible for the crime Look here Bruce Don t lose your head like everybody else mixed up in this wretched business My wife is not dead What The cry was a double one for both Bruce and White gave simultaneous utterance to their amazement It is true She is alive all the time I have had a letter from her A letter Surely Dyke I am neither mad nor drunk The letter reached me by this morning s post I came here with it as fast as I could travel I have been in the train all day and am nearly fainting from hunger Where is it cried White Is it genuine I could swear to her writing amidst a thousand letters Here it is I have brought some old correspondence of hers for the purpose of comparison as I could hardly believe my eyes when I first received it Bruce was so dumfounded by this remarkable development that he could but mutely take the document produced by the baronet and read it He himself recognized Lady Dyke s handwriting which he had often seen a clear bold well defined script more like the caligraphy of a banker than of a fashionable lady The letter was dated February one bore no other superscription and read as follows My Dear Charles I have just seen in the newspapers the announcement of my death and the theories set on foot to account for my disappearance on November six This seems to convey to me the strange fact that you have not received the explanation I sent you of my reasons for leaving London so suddenly Otherwise you must have kept your own counsel very closely However I do not now desire to reopen the question of motive let it suffice to say that no one save myself was responsible for my disappearance and that neither you nor any one acquainted with me will ever see me again Do not search for me it will be time wasted If you have legal proof of my death and wish to marry again be satisfied Tear up this letter and forget it I am dead to you and to the world You can neither refuse to accept the genuineness of this letter nor trace me by reason of it as I have taken such precautions that the latter course will be impossible Let me repeat forget me ALICE The barrister carefully refolded the sheet after scrutinizing the water mark against the light and noting that the paper was British made he then examined the envelope The obliterating postmark was London February four nine P M West Strand The office of delivery was Wensley February six Posted at the West Strand Post Office on Saturday he said Detained in London all Sunday and delivered to you this morning in the North Exactly It was written three days earlier if the date be accurate So the writer is somewhere in Europe That s how I take it said Sir Charles Unless the whole thing is a fraud How can it be a fraud I am sure as to the handwriting Why even yourself Bruce must have a good recollection of my wife s style Undoubtedly No man born could swear that this was not Lady Dyke s production Well what are we to do And what did missus Hillmer mean by kicking up that fuss when we spoke to her interpolated White I ll take my oath that some one was killed in her house else how comes it that a woman found in the Thames at Putney is carrying about in her head some of missus Hillmer s ironwork I wish she hadn t fainted just now Why she said herself that she was the cause of Lady Dyke s death and here is Lady Dyke writing to say she is alive This business is beyond me but missus Hillmer has got to explain a good deal yet before I am done with her The detective s wrath at this check in the hunt after a criminal did not appeal to the baronet You can please yourself mister White of course he said coldly but so far as I am concerned I will respect my wife s wishes and let the matter rest where it is My dear fellow said the barrister such a course is impossible Assuming that her ladyship is really alive why did she leave you How can I tell She herself refuses to give a reason She apparently stated one in a letter which never reached me as you know She has selfishly caused me a world of suffering and misery for three long months I refuse to be plagued in the matter further Sir Charles was excited and angry He was in bitter revolt against circumstances Do you intend to show this letter to Lady Dyke s relatives asked Bruce at a loss for the time to discuss the situation coherently I do not know What would you advise I trust fully to your judgment But is it not better to obey her wishes to forget as she puts it We must decide nothing hastily I am perplexed beyond endurance by this business There is so much that is wildly impossible in its irreconcilable features I must have time Will you give me a copy of the letter Certainly keep it yourself We have all seen it Thank you Bruce placed the envelope and its contents in his pocket book Then turning to the detective he said Now mister White do me a favor Do not worry missus Hillmer until you hear from me By all means mister Bruce But am I to report to the Commissioner that Lady Dyke has been found or has at any rate explained that she is not dead There is no immediate necessity why a report of any kind should be made None Then leave matters where they are at present But why put in Sir Charles Is it not better to end all inquiries at least so far as my wife is concerned It is her desire and I may add my own now that I know something of her fate Of course if you wish it Dyke I have no valid objection Oh no no Do not look at it in that way I leave the ultimate decision entirely to you In that case I recommend complete silence in all quarters at present The detective left them and as he passed out into Victoria Street his philosophy could find but one comprehensive dictum This is a rum go he muttered unconsciously plagiarizing himself on many previous occasions The baronet sat down and meditatively chewed the handle of his umbrella What is this nonsense Mensmore s sister talked about being responsible for my wife s death he said I do not pretend to understand answered Bruce Little more than a week ago she learned for the first time of your wife s supposed murder Of that I am quite positive She feared that her brother was implicated and without trusting me with the reasons for her belief took the measures she thought best to safeguard him Took measures What Sir Charles jerked the words out impetuously She followed him to the South of France and found him in Florence What she said I cannot guess but the result was their visit here to night During our interview it came out quite by accident that some furniture was taken from her place to her brother s on the morning of November seven thus shifting the venue of Lady Dyke s death or imaginary death I must now say from No twelve Raleigh Mansions to No sixty one This discovery was as startling to missus Hillmer as to us for she forthwith protested that the whole affair arose from her fault and practically asked the detective to arrest her on the definite charge of murder Pooh The mania of an hysterical woman Possibly Why possibly No one was murdered in her abode Do you for a moment believe the monstrous insinuation No not in that sense But her brother was about to make some revelation regarding a third person when she appealed to him not to speak What would have happened finally I do not know At that critical moment my servant announced your arrival But what can missus Hillmer have to conceal She and her brother have been lost to Society since long before my marriage Neither of them so far as I know has ever set eyes on my wife during the last seven years Yet missus Hillmer must have had some powerful motive in acting as she did Is it not more than likely that she had a bad attack of nerves A woman who merely yields to nervous prostration behaves foolishly This woman gave way to emotion it is true but it was strength not weakness that sustained her What do you mean There is but one force that sustains in such a crisis the power of love missus Hillmer was not flying from consequences She met them half way in the spirit of a martyr Pon my honor Bruce I am beginning to think that this wretched business is affecting your usually clear brain You are accepting fancies as facts Maybe I confess I am unable to form a logical conclusion to night Why not abandon the whole muddle to time There is no solution of a difficulty like the almanac Let us both go off somewhere What and leave missus Hillmer to die of sheer pain of mind Let this unfortunate fellow Mensmore suffer no one knows what consequences from the events of to day It is out of the question Very well I leave it to you Every one seems to forget that it is I who suffer most The baronet stood up and dejectedly gazed into the fire I at least can feel for you Dyke said Bruce sympatherically but you must admit that things cannot be allowed to remain in their present whirlpool So be it Let them go on to their bitter end If my wife was tired of my society she might at least have got rid of me in an easier manner With this trite reflection Sir Charles quitted his friend s house Bruce sat motionless for a long time Then as his mind became calmer he lit a cigar took out the doubly mysterious letter and examined it in every possible way critically and microscopically There could be no doubt that it was a genuine production The condition of the ink bore out the correctness of the date and the fact that the note paper and envelope were not of Continental style was not very material It did not appear to have been enclosed in another envelope as the writer implied for the purpose of being re posted in London Rather did the slightly frayed edges give rise to the assumption that it had been carried in some one s pocket before postage But this theory was vague and undemonstrable The handwriting was Lady Dyke s the style allowing for the strange conditions under which it was written was hers yet Bruce did not believe in it Nothing could shake his faith in the one solid concrete certainty that stood out from a maze of contradictions and mystery Lady Dyke was dead and buried in a pauper s grave at Putney At last wearied with thought and theorizing he went to bed but Smith sat up late to regale his partner with the full true and particular narrative of the lydy a cryin on her knees and the strange gent lookin as though he would like to murder mister White CHAPTER XXIV THE HANDWRITING Like most men Claude took a different view of events in the morning to that which he entertained over night Yesterday the surprises of the hour were concrete embodiments each distinct and emphatic To day they were merged in the general mass of contradictory details that made up this most bewildering inquiry That matters could not be allowed to rest in their present state was clear that they would in the natural course of things reveal themselves more definitely even if unaided was also patent missus Hillmer s partial admissions her brother s evident knowledge of some salient features of the puzzle that utterly strange letter in the admitted handwriting of Lady Dyke herself and bearing the prosaic testimony of dates stamped by the Post office these sensational elements when brought into juxtaposition could not avoid reaction into clearer phases Long experience in criminal investigation told him that under certain circumstances the best course of all was one of inactivity On the basis of the accepted truism in the affairs of many people that letters left unanswered answer themselves the barrister knew that there must be an outcome from the queer medley of occurrences at his residence on the Monday evening Reviewing the history of the past three months several odd features stood out from the general jumble In the first place he wondered why he had failed to deduce any pertinent fact from the manner in which missus Hillmer s dining room was furnished on the occasion of his first visit to Raleigh Mansions He distinctly remembered noting his reception in an unusual room littered with unusual articles when the luxurious and well appointed suite of apartments was considered as a whole It was suggested to him at the time that the drawing room which he saw during his second visit was dismantled earlier but he did not connect this trivial incident with the feature in Mensmore s flat that he noted immediately namely the discrepancies between the arrangement of the sitting room and the other chambers in the place These things were immaterial now but he indexed them as a guide for future use Lady Dyke s motive for that secret visit to Raleigh Mansions that was the key to the mystery But how to discover it Who was her confidant To whom could he turn for possible enlightenment It was useless to broach the matter again to her husband The baronet and his wife had been friends sharing the same menage rather than husband and wife Her relatives had already been appealed to in vain They knew nothing of the slightest value in this search for truth In this train of thought the name of Jane Harding cropped up She was the personal maid of the deceased lady She had sharp eyes and quick wits Her queer antics shortly after the inquest were not forgotten Here at least was a possibility of light if the girl would speak If she refused what could be her motive Anyhow it was worth while to make a fresh effort Early in the afternoon he called at the stage door of the Jollity Theatre Is Miss Marie le Marchant still employed here he asked the attendant I dunno was the careless answer Well think hard said the barrister laying a half crown on the battered blotting pad which is an indispensable part of the furniture in the letter bureau of a theatre Yes sir I believe she is but she has been away on a week s leave Indeed Has she returned I was off last night sir but if you will pardon me a moment I ll inquire from the man who took my place The stage doorkeeper disappeared into the dark interior to return quickly with the information that Miss le Marchant had appeared as usual on Monday night She was away most part of last week sir added the man and I believe it wasn t a holiday as she was a sort of flurried about it as if some one was ill Thank you Do you know where she lives A momentary hesitation was soon softened by another half crown It s against the rules sir If you were to find yourself near Jubilee Buildings Bloomsbury you would not be far out The information was sound Miss Marie le Marchant s name was painted outside a second floor flat Bruce knocked and the door was opened by an elderly woman whom he had no difficulty in recognizing Is your daughter in missus Harding he said For a moment she could not speak for surprise Well I never she cried but London is a funny place Do you know me sir Any one would recognize you from your daughter if they did not take you for her elder sister he said Bruce s smile was irresistible My daughter is not in just now sir replied missus Harding but I expect her in to tea almost immediately Then may I come in and await her arrival Certainly sir Once inside the flat he was impressed by the pretentious but fairly comfortable nature of its appointments the ex lady s maid s legacy must have been a nice one to enable her to live in such style as the poor pittance of a coryphee would barely pay the rent and taxes Moreover the presence of her mother in the establishment was a distinct factor in her favor missus Harding had brought the visitor to the tiny sitting room She seated herself near the window and resumed some sewing Have you been long in town missus Harding he said by way of being civil In London do you mean sir About two months Ever since my daughter got along so well in her new profession She s a good girl is my daughter Miss Harding is doing well on the stage then Oh yes sir Why she s been earning Lsix a week and last week she was sent for on a special engagement which paid her so well that she s going to buy me a new dress out of the money Really said the barrister you ought to be proud of her I am admitted the admiring mother I only wish her brother who went off and listed for a sojer had turned out half as well missus Harding nodded towards a photograph of a cavalry soldier in uniform on the mantelshelf and Bruce rose to examine it inwardly marvelling at the intelligence he had just received Was it reasonable that the girl could be the recipient of a legacy without the knowledge of her mother In any case why did she conceal the real nature of her earnings The story about Lsix a week was a myth Near to the portrait of the gallant huzzar was a large plaque presentment of Miss Marie herself in all the glory of tights wig and make up Across it was written in the best theatrical style Ever yours sincerely Marie le Marchant And no sooner had Bruce caught sight of the words than he almost shouted aloud in his amazement The handwriting was identical with that of Lady Dyke Gulping down his surprise he devoured the signature with his eyes The resemblance was truly remarkable What on earth could be the explanation of this phenomenon Your daughter is a remarkably nice writer missus Harding he said turning the photograph towards her Yes said the complacent mother she taught herself when before she went on the stage She was always a clever girl and when she grew up she improved herself I wasn t able to afford her much schooling when she was young I have seldom seen a nicer hand he went on Have you any other specimens of her writing I should like to see them if they are not private The smooth surface of the photograph might perhaps lend a deceptive fluency to the pen He wanted to make quite sure that he was not mistaken Oh yes She s just copying out the part of Ophelia in Hamlet And she acts it beautiful missus Harding handed over a large MS book and there written on the first page was the name of the luckless woman whose fatal passion has moved millions to tears He admired Miss Marie le Marchant s efforts in the matter of self culture but he was determined once for all to wrest from her some explanation of her actions The rattle of a key in the outer door caused him to throw aside the coveted part and the young lady herself entered A few weeks of stage experience had given her a more stylish appearance There was a professional touch in the arrangement of her hat and the droop of her skirt She knew him instantly and listened with evident anger to her mother s explanation that this gentleman has just called to see you dear All right mother she cried I see it is mister Bruce Will you get tea ready while I talk with him I shall be ready in two minutes This with a defiant look at the visitor When missus Harding quitted the room her daughter said in the crisp accents of ill temper What do you want with me now I want to ask why you dared to write a letter to Sir Charles Dyke in the name of your dead mistress The answer was so direct the tone so menacing its assumption of absolute and unquestioned knowledge so complete that for a moment Marie le Marchant s assurance failed her She stood like one petrified with eyes dilated and breast heaving At last she managed to ejaculate I I why do you ask me that question Because I must have the truth from you this time You are playing a very dangerous game That he was right he was sure now beyond doubt It was impossible for the girl to deny it with those piercing eyes fixed on her and seeming to read the secrets of her heart Yet she was plucky enough Although she was confused and on the point of bursting into tears she snapped viciously I will tell you nothing Go away You are obstinate I know said Bruce but I must warn you that you are juggling with edged tools You should not imagine that you can trifle with murder What is your motive for deliberately trying to conceal Lady Dyke s death If you do not answer me you may be asked the question in a court of law You have no right to come here annoying me she retorted I am not here to annoy you I come rather as a friend to appeal to you not to incur the grave risk of keeping from the authorities information which they ought to possess What information The reasons which led you to leave Sir Charles Dyke s house so suddenly the source from which you obtain your money paid to you doubtless to secure your silence the motive which impelled you to use your ability to imitate her ladyship s handwriting in order to spread the false news that she is alive This is the information needed and your wilful refusal to give it constitutes a grave indictment I don t care that for you mister Bruce replied the girl her face set now in a scarlet temper while she snapped her fingers to emphasize the words You can do and say what you like I will tell you nothing You cannot deny you wrote that letter to Sir Charles Dyke last Saturday I am waiting for my tea Sorry I can t ask you to join me Your flippancy will not avail you See here is the letter itself your own production written on paper of which you have a quantity in this very room The shot was a bold one and it very nearly hit the mark She was staggered almost subdued by this melodramatic production of the original and his clever guess at the existence of similar notepaper in the house But her dogged temperament saved her Jane Harding was British notwithstanding her penchant for a French sounding name and she would have died sooner than beat a retreat I will thank you to leave me alone mister Bruce she said There was nothing for it but to retire as gracefully as possible but the barrister was more than satisfied with the result of his visit He had now established beyond a shadow of doubt that for some reason which he could not fathom the ex lady s maid not only knew of her mistress s death but wished to conceal it This desire too had the essential feature of every other branch of the inquiry it grew to maturity long after the day when Lady Dyke was actually killed What did it all mean From Bloomsbury he strolled west to Portman Square and found Sir Charles on the point of going for a drive in the Park He briefly told him his discovery The baronet at first was sceptical Do you mean to say Claude he cried fretfully that I do not know my wife s writing when I see it You may think you do but when another person can imitate it exactly of course you may be deceived Besides if this girl as is probable was helped in her education by your wife what is more likely than that Jane Harding should seek to copy that which she would consider the ideal of excellence Don t harbor any delusions in the matter Dyke The letter you received on Monday morning was written by Jane Harding I am sure of that from her manner no less than from the accidental resemblance of the two styles of handwriting What I could not find out was her motive for the deceit It is a queer business altogether said Sir Charles wearily I wish it were ended CHAPTER XXV MISS PHYLLIS BROWNE INTERVENES Bruce was quite positive in his belief that Jane Harding was the paid agent of some person who wished to conceal the facts concerning Lady Dyke s death Her unexpected appearance in the field at this late hour no less than the bold role she adopted proved this conclusively But in England there was no torture chamber to which she might be led and gradually dismembered until she confessed the truth So long as she adhered to the policy of pert denial she was quite safe The law could not touch her for the chief witness against her Sir Charles Dyke was obviously more than half inclined to admit the genuineness of the letter even in opposition to the superior judgment of his friend Yet it was a matter which Bruce considered ought to be made known to the police so he sent for mister White and told him of the strange result of his interview with Miss Marie le Marchant Dash everything cried the detective when he heard the news I made a note sometime ago that that girl ought to be watched but I clean forgot all about it Remember said Bruce that my discovery was the result of pure accident My object in visiting her was to endeavor to induce her confidence with regard to Lady Dyke s former life and habits Indeed I handled the business very badly I don t see that sir You got hold of a very remarkable fact and thus prevented the success of a bold move by some one which in my case at any rate nearly choked me off the inquiry True Thus far chance favored me But I ought to have been content with the assumption There was no need to frighten her by pressing it home Oh from that point of view began the detective But Bruce was merely thinking aloud rough shaping his ideas as they grouped themselves in his brain Perhaps I am wrong there too he went on If this girl is working to instructions she would have refused to help me in any way and she already knows that I am on the trail There is one highly satisfactory feature in the Jane Harding adventure mister White And what is that The person or persons responsible for Lady Dyke s death know that the matter has not been dropped They are inclined to think that the circle is narrowing In some of our casts mister White we must have come so unpleasantly close to them that they deemed it advisable to throw us off the scent by a bold effort No doubt you are right sir but I wish to goodness I knew when we were warm as I am becoming tired of the business Every new development deepens the mystery The detective s face was as downcast as his words Surely not The more pieces of the puzzle we have to handle the less difficult should be the final task of putting them together Not when every piece is a fresh puzzle in itself Why what has disconcerted you to day missus Hillmer What of her I have had another talk with the maid her companion you know a girl named Dobson It struck me that it was advisable to know more about missus Hillmer than we do at present Bruce made no comment but he could not help reflecting that Corbett the stranger from Wyoming had entertained the same view Well continued the detective I went about the affair as quietly as possible but the maid though willing could not tell me much missus Hillmer she thinks married very young and was badly treated by her husband Finally there was a rumpus and she went on the stage while Hillmer drank himself to death He died a year ago and they had been separated nearly five years He was fairly well to do but he squandered all his money in dissipation and never gave her a cent Three years last Michaelmas she set up her present establishment at Raleigh Mansions and there she has been ever since Then where does the money come from It must cost her at least Ltwo thousand a year to live That s just what the maid can t tell me Her mistress led a very secluded life and was never what you could call fast though a very pretty woman During this time she had only one visitor a gentleman Ah It sounds promising but it ends in smoke so far as I can see Why This gentleman was a Colonel Montgomery an old friend though he wasn t much turned thirty the maid says He interested himself a lot in missus Hillmer s affairs looked after some investments for her and was on very good terms with her and nobody could whisper a word against the character of either of them He was never there except in the afternoon On very rare occasions he took missus Hillmer whose maid always accompanied them to Epping Forest or up the river or on some such journey Go on I m sorry sir but the chase is over He s dead Dead Yes The maid doesn t know how or when exactly but one day she found her mistress crying and when she asked her what was the matter missus Hillmer said I ve lost my friend The maid said Surely not Colonel Montgomery madam and she replied Yes She quite took on about it Had the maid no idea as to the date of this interesting occurrence Only a vague one Sometime in the autumn or before Christmas By Jove yes it escaped me at the time but she said that soon after the Colonel s death another gentleman called and took her mistress out to dinner I was so busy thinking about the colonel that I slipped the significance of that statement It must have been you mister Bruce So it seems The barrister s active brain was already assimilating this new information If a woman like missus Hillmer had lost a dear and valuable friend one who practically formed the horizon of her life she would certainly have worn mourning for him It was a singular coincidence that missus Hillmer lost Colonel Montgomery about the same time that Lady Dyke disappeared Detective and maid alike had drawn a false inference from missus Hillmer s words We must find Colonel Montgomery he said after a slight pause Find him Yes I hope neither of us is going his way for some time to come mister Bruce laughed the policeman White I shall never cure you from jumping at conclusions Upon your present evidence Colonel Montgomery is no more dead than you are But the maid said I don t care if fifty maids said There are many more ways of losing a friend than by death Pass me the Army List on that bookshelf behind you there A brief reference to the index and Bruce said I thought so There is no Colonel Montgomery There are several captains and lieutenants and a Major General who has commanded a small island in the Pacific for the last five years but not a single colonel White you have blundered into eminence in your profession I m glad to hear it even as you put it mister Bruce But I don t see I know you don t If you did a popular novelist would write your life and style you the English Lecocq missus Hillmer lost the gallant colonel at the same time that the world lost Lady Dyke Find the first and I am much mistaken if we do not learn all about the second Now I wonder if you are right The detective s eyes sparkled with animation It was the first real clue he had hit upon and Bruce s method of complimenting him on the fact did not disconcert him Of course I am right You have done so well with the maid that I leave her in your hands Try the coachman and the cook But keep me informed of your progress White rushed off elated So persistent was he in striving to elucidate this new problem that he paid no heed during some days to the side light furnished by Jane Harding and her exceedingly curious powers as a letter writer Bruce purposely left the inquiry to the policeman He realized intuitively that the disappearance of Lady Dyke would soon be explained but he shrank from subjecting missus Hillmer to further questioning His abstinence was rewarded later in the week for Mensmore came to see him The young man wore an expression of settled melancholy which surprised the barrister greatly Have you prevailed on your sister to take us into her confidence he said when Mensmore was ensconced in a chair in his cosy sitting room No She is more fixed than ever in her resolve to take the whole blame on herself Surely this mistaken idea can be shaken I fear not And you also share it I do Bear with us Bruce This is a terrible business It has broken me up utterly Nonsense You are in no way concerned save to shield your sister and no one credits her wild statements regarding her complicity in this crime Look here my dear fellow I have come to ask you if this investigation cannot be allowed to rest It means a lot of misery that you cannot foretell or prevent Knowing what I do I cannot believe that Lady Dyke was murdered Knowing what I do I cannot accept any other conclusion A worthy and estimable lady leaves her home suddenly without the slightest imaginary cause and she is found in the Thames with a piece of iron driven into her brain while the medical evidence is clear that death was not due to drowning What other inference can be drawn than that she was foully done to death Heaven help me I cannot tell Yet I appeal to you to let matters rest where they are if it is possible It is not possible I cannot control the police I am merely a private agent acting on my own responsibility and on behalf of Lady Dyke s relatives Don t misunderstand me Bruce I am not asking this thing on account of my sister or myself On whose account then Mensmore did not answer for a moment He looked mournfully into the fire for inspiration Perhaps I had better tell you he said that I have broken off my engagement with Miss Browne The other jumped from his chair What the dickens do you mean he cried Exactly what I have said When we met on Monday night I did not mention that Sir William and Lady Browne and their daughter travelled back to England with us On Tuesday I saw Phyllis In view of the shadow thrown on me by this frightful charge I thought it my duty to release her from any ties If my sister has to figure in a court of law as a principal or accomplice in a murder case and possibly myself with her I could not consent to associate my poor Phyllis s name with mine So I took the plunge You are a beastly idiot shouted Bruce If I had the power I would give you six months hard labor this moment Who ever threatened to put you or your sister in the dock You have done your best that way you know I I have shielded you throughout I feel that But your admission shows that I am right Shielded us from what From arrest by the police of course But why take this precipitate action What has Lady Dyke s death to do with your marriage to Miss Browne That s it Bruce I cannot explain I must endure silently Did you give her any reason for your absurd resolution Yes I could have no secrets from her Did you inflict all this wretched story on a woman you loved and hoped to marry You may be as bitter as you like That is my idea of square dealing at any rate What other pretext could I invite for for giving her up Mensmore found it hard to utter the words In his heart Bruce pitied him though he raged at this lamentable issue of the only bright passage in the whole story of death and intrigue And what did Miss Browne say Oh she just pooh poohed the affair and pretended to laugh at me though she was crying all the time A nice kettle of fish you have made of it growled the barrister You help your sister in her folly of silence and then proceed to give effect to it by ruining your own happiness and that of your affianced wife Have you seen Miss Browne since No His visitor was so utterly disconsolate that Bruce was at a loss to know how to deal with him He felt that if Mensmore would but speak regarding missus Hillmer s strange delusion and the cause of it all these difficulties and disasters would disappear He resolved to try a direct attack Have you ever heard of a Colonel Montgomery he said suddenly bending his searching gaze on the other s downcast face The effect was electrical Mensmore was so taken back that he was spellbound He looked at Claude the picture of astonishment before he stammered I you who told you about him He was your sister s friend adviser and confidant was the stern reply He it is who in some mysterious way is bound up with Lady Dyke s disappearance Mensmore rose excitedly I cannot discuss the matter with you he cried I have given my sacred promise and no matter what the cost may be I will not break my word I do not press you But may I see missus Hillmer again When she is calmer I might reason with her The other placed his hand on Bruce s shoulder and his voice was very impressive though shaken by strong emotion Believe me he said it is better that you should not see her It will be useless She is leaving London not to avoid consequences but to get away from painful memories Her departure will be quite open and her place of residence known to any one who cares to inquire One thing she is immovable in She will never reveal to a living soul what she knows of Lady Dyke s death She would rather suffer any punishment at the hands of the law Don t you understand that this man Montgomery is now known to the police Sooner or later he will be found and asked to explain any connection he may have had with the crime Why not accomplish quietly that which will perforce be done through the uncompromising channels of Scotland Yard Your reasoning appears to be good but But folly must prevail Put it that way if you like So this wretched imbroglio may cost you the love of a charming and devoted girl Heaven help me it may probably will I swear to you cried the barrister who was unusually excited that I will tear the heart out of this mystery before the week expires Mensmore bowed silently and would have left the room but Smith entered In their distraction they had not heard the bell ring Smith handed a card to his master Instantly Bruce controlled himself His admiration for the dramatic sequence of events overcame his eagerness as an actor It was with an appreciative smile that he said without the slightest reference to Mensmore Show the lady in Mensmore was passing out but the sight of the visitor drove him back as though he had been struck It was Phyllis Browne Her recognition of him was a bright smile She advanced to Bruce saying pleasantly I am glad to meet you though the manner of my call is somewhat unconventional I heard much of you from Bertie in the Riviera and more since my return to town He suitably expressed his delight at this apparition Mensmore not knowing what to do stood awkwardly at the other end of the room Neither of the others paid the least heed to him Of course I had a definite object in coming to see you mister Bruce went on the young lady I have been coolly told that because somebody killed somebody else some months ago a young gentlemen who asked me to be his wife is not only not going to marry me but intends to spend the rest of his life in Central Africa or China anywhere in fact but where I may be A most unwise resolve said the barrister So I thought You appear to hold the key to the situation and as it is an easy matter to trace you through the Directory here I am My people think I am skating at saint James s Well Miss Browne said Claude I am neither judge nor jury nor counsel for the prosecution but there is the culprit I hand him over to you Yes but that goose didn t kill anybody did he No And I am sure his sister did not from what little I saw of her she would not hurt a fly Quite true Then why don t you find the man who caused all the mischief and and lock him up at least so that he cannot go on injuring people Miss Phyllis was very brave and self confident at the outset Now she was on the verge of tears for Mensmore s saddened face and depressed manner unnerved her more than his passionate words at their last interview You ask me a straight question replied Bruce though his eyes were fixed on Mensmore and I will give you a straight answer I will find the man who killed Lady Dyke As you say it is time his capacity for doing injury to others should be limited Before many days have passed mister Mensmore will come to you and beg your pardon for his hasty and quite unwarranted resolve Do you hear that Bertie cried the girl Didn t I tell you so Mensmore came forward to her side of the table I need not wait Phil dear he said simply I ask your pardon now This business is in the hands of Providence I was foolish to think that anything I could do would stave off the inevitable And if you have to go to China you w will take me with you Bruce looked out of the window whistled and said loudly addressing a beautiful lady in short skirts who figured in a poster across the way Let me ring for some tea All this talk makes one dry CHAPTER XXVI LADY HELEN MONTGOMERY S SON When the young people had gone Mensmore ill at ease though tremuously happy that Phyllis had so demonstrated her trust in him Phyllis herself radiantly confident in the barrister s powers to set everything right Bruce devoted himself to the task of determining a new line for his energies The first step was self evident He must ascertain if the Dykes knew a Colonel Montgomery He drove to the Club frequented by Sir Charles but the baronet was not there so he went to Wensley House Sir Charles was at home in his accustomed nook by the library fire He looked ill and low spirited The temporary animation he had displayed during the past few weeks was gone If anything he was more listless than at any time since his wife s death Well Claude he said wearily anything to report Yes a good deal What is it I want to ask you something Did you ever know a Colonel Montgomery or was your wife acquainted with any one of that name to your knowledge I do not think she was Had she ever met such a man I should probably have heard of him Who was he The baronet s low state rendered his words careless and indefinite but his friend did not wish to bother him unduly The police have discovered he said that missus Hillmer formed a close intimacy with some one whom she designated by that name and rank though I have failed to trace any British officer who answers to his description He disappeared or died as some people put it about the same time as your wife Is it not known what became of him then No Won t missus Hillmer tell you She absolutely refuses to give any help whatever On what ground That is best known to herself My theory is that a man she loves is implicated in the affair and she is prepared to go to any lengths to shield him Ah Sir Charles bent over and poked the fire viciously Then he murmured Women are queer creatures Bruce We men never understand them until too late My wife and I did not to all appearance care a jot for one another while she lived Yet I now realize that she loved me and I would give the little remaining span of existence dear as life is to see her once more This was a morbid subject the younger man tried to switch him off it It is almost clear to me he said that Colonel Montgomery s name was assumed Few people realize the use of the alias made in modern life I have a notion that the custom among otherwise honorable people has arisen from the publicity given to the fact that Royal and other distinguished personages frequently choose to conceal their identity under less known territorial titles The idea is ingenious We are all slaves to fashion However that may be it should not be a difficult task to lay hands on the gentleman should he be still living Suppose you succeed How can you connect him with my wife s death At this moment I am unable to say But the cabman might be of some use The cabman What cabman Did I omit that I ought to have told you that I have found the driver of the four wheeler in which your poor wife was taken dead or insensible from Sloane Square to Putney What an extraordinary thing What is That you should have forgotten to inform me of such a striking fact Not so Now that I recollect I have not had the opportunity It was impossible to discuss anything else but that forged letter on the last two occasions we met and it was only a few hours prior to your visit on Monday that I got the cabman s story fully By the way do you now see any reason why Jane Harding should have tried to deceive you in such a manner The barrister perceived that Sir Charles was nervous and irritable so he deemed it a needless strain to enlarge on the history of his discovery of Foxey I am tired of letters and plots and mysteries My life is resolving into one huge note of interrogation Soon the great question of eternity will dominate all others Dyke s mood unfitted him for sustained conversation Bruce could but pity him and hope that time would calm his fevered brain and soothe the unrest that shed this gloom over him Really said Claude after a long interval during which both men sought inspiration from the dancing flames in the fireplace really this is too bad of you Dyke You showed a marked improvement for a little space and now you are letting yourself slip back into a state of lonely and unoccupied moping again My thoughts find me both occupation and company was the despondent reply There is nothing for it continued Bruce cheerfully but a tour round the world You must start immediately A complete change of scene and surroundings will soon pull you back to a normal state of mind and health I have been thinking of a long journey for some time past The barrister glanced sharply at his friend The double entente was not lost on him Dyke was in a depressed and nervous condition The uncertainty regarding his wife s fate was harassing him unduly and it was with a twinge of conscience that Bruce reflected upon his own eagerness to pursue a quest which by very reason of its indefiniteness attracted him as an intellectual pursuit Look here he cried on the spur of the moment I have long desired to see the Canadian Pacific route Will you arrange to start West with me a fortnight hence We can return when the spirit moves us We will see We will see To day I feel unable to decide anything Yes I know but the mere fact that you take the resolution will serve to reanimate you It is very good of you Claude to trouble so about me Had you asked me earlier I might have gone straight away But let it rest for a little while When I have recovered my spirits somewhat I will come to you to ask you to sail next day or something of the sort Beyond this the other could not move him There was one link in the chain of evidence that would be irrefragable if discovered Was this Colonel Montgomery in any way connected with the house at Putney where the murderer had disposed of the body If this could be established the unknown visitor to Raleigh Mansions would experience a good deal of difficulty in clearing himself of suspicion Bruce was certain that once the Colonel was traced much would come to light explanatory of missus Hillmer s and her brother s dread lest his identity should be discovered An inquiry addressed to the house agents to whom possible tenants were referred elicited the information that the present owner a lady was prepared to let the house annually or on a lease They enclosed an order to view which Bruce retained in case he should happen to need it A second letter gave him the address of the lady s solicitors Messrs Small Sharp Lincoln s Inn He called on them as a possible tenant with a desire to purchase the property outright if his proposal could be entertained mister Sharp the partner who dealt with the estate became very suave when the suggestion reached his ears You will understand mister Bruce that your request requires some consideration The rent my client asks is comparatively low because the house is old fashioned but the splendid riparian position of the property a free hold acre on the banks of the Thames at Putney gives it a highly increased future value Any figure you may have based on a rental calculation would therefore Not meet the case at all said the barrister repressing a smile at the familiar opening move in the game of bargaining Precisely May I ask who the present owner is Certainly the lady s name is Small In fact she is my partner s wife Her father the late reverend Septimus Childe purchased the estate some years ago largely because the house suited his requirements as the head of a successful private school Has the estate changed hands frequently then Oh dear no Indeed it is well understood that the reverend mister Childe acquired it more as a friendly transaction than otherwise The estate is a portion of the separate estate of the late Lady Helen Montgomery who married Sir William Dyke father of the present baronet who perhaps good gracious my dear sir what is the matter Had Bruce been a woman he must have fainted As it was the shock of the intelligence nearly paralyzed him Sir Charles Dyke Montgomery The house at Putney the property of his mother What new terror did not this frightful combination suggest Why did his friend conceal from him these most important facts Why did he pretend ignorance not only of the locality but of his mother s maiden name Like lightning the remembrance flashed through Bruce s troubled brain that he had only heard of the earlier Lady Dyke as a daughter of the Earl of Tilbury A suspicion profoundly horrible yet convincing was slowly mastering him and every second brought further proof not only of its reasonableness but of its ghastly and inflexible certainty Again the lawyer s voice reached his ears dully and thin as though it penetrated through a wall Surely you feel ill Let me get you some brandy No no murmured the barrister It is but a momentary faintness I I think I will go out into the fresh air Are you quite sure that mister Childe bought the property from Lady Helen Montgomery s trustees Quite sure If you wait even a few moments I will show you the title deeds No thank you I will call again Pray excuse me Somehow Bruce crossed the quiet square of the Inn and plunged into the turmoil of the street Amid the bustle of Holborn he had a curious sensation of safety The fiend so suddenly installed in his consciousness was less busy here suggesting strange and maddening thoughts Why why why fifty questions beat incessantly against the barrier of agonized negation he strove to set up but the noise of traffic made the attack confused Each incautious bump against a passer by silenced a demand each heavy crunch of a bus on the gravel strewed roadway temporarily silenced a doubt He was so unmanned that he felt almost on the verge of tears He absolutely dared not attempt to reason out the fearful alternative which had so fiercely thrust itself upon him At last he became vaguely aware that people were staring at him Fearful lest some acquaintance should recognize and accost him he hailed a hansom and drove to Victoria Street All the way the heavy beat of the horse s feet served to distract his thoughts He forced himself to count the quick paces and tried hard to accommodate the numerals of two or more syllables to the rapidity of the animal s trot He failed in this but in the failure found relief Nevertheless though the horse was willing and the driver eager to oblige a fare who gave a good address the time seemed interminable until the cab stopped in front of his door Once arrived there he slowly ascended the stairs to his own flat told Smith to pay the cabman half a crown and to admit no one and threw himself into a chair At last he was face to face with the troublous demon who possessed him in Lincoln s Inn struggled with him through the crowd and travelled with him in the hansom Phyllis Browne should have her answer sooner than he had expected The man who murdered Lady Dyke was her own husband Oh heavens moaned Bruce as he swayed restlessly to and fro in his chair is it possible He sat there for hours Smith entered turned on the lights and suggested tea but received an impatient dismissal After another long interval Smith appeared again to announce that mister White had called Did you not say I was out said Claude his hollow tones and haggard air startling his faithful servitor considerably Yes sir oh yes sir But that s no use with mister White E said as ow e were sure you were in Ask him to oblige me by coming again to morrow I am very ill I really cannot see him Smith left the room only to return and say mister White says sir is business is of the hutmost himportance E can t leave it and e says you will be very sorry afterwards if you don t see im now Oh so be it cried Bruce turning to a spirit stand to seek sustenance in a stiff glass of brandy Send him in Quite awed by circumstances Smith admitted the detective and closed the door upon the two men who stood looking at each other without a word of greeting or explanation CHAPTER XXVII mister WHITE S METHOD The policeman spoke first Has Jane Harding been here then he said His words conveyed no meaning to his hearer They were so incongruous so ridiculously unreasoning that Bruce laughed hysterically You must have seen her cried the detective excitedly I know you have learned the truth and in no other way that I can imagine could it have reached you Learnt what truth That Sir Charles Dyke himself is at the bottom of all this business Indeed How have you blundered upon that solution mister Bruce this time I am right and you know it It was Sir Charles Dyke who killed his wife Nobody else had anything else to do with it so far as I can guess But if you haven t seen Jane Harding I wonder how you found out You are speaking in riddles Pray explain yourself If Sir Charles Dyke had not been out of town the riddle would have been answered by this time in the easiest way as I should have locked him up Excellent You remain faithful to tradition mister Bruce please don t try to humbug me for the sake of your friend I am quite in earnest I have come to you for advice Sir Charles Dyke is guilty enough And what do you want me to do To help me to adopt the proper course The whole thing seems so astounding that I can hardly trust my own senses I spoke hastily just now I would not have touched Sir Charles before consulting you I was never in such a mixed up condition in my life Whatever the source of his information the detective had evidently arrived at the same conclusion as Bruce himself There was nothing for it but to endeavor to reason out the situation calmly and follow the best method of dealing with it suggested by their joint intelligence Claude motioned the detective to a chair imposed silence by a look and summoned Smith He was faint from want of food With returning equanimity he resolved first to restore his strength as he would need all his powers to wrestle with events before he slept that night mister White nothing loth joined him in a simple meal and by tacit consent no reference was made to the one engrossing topic in their thoughts until the table was cleared And now mister White demanded the barrister what have you found out During the last two days he replied I have been unsuccessfully trying to trace Colonel Montgomery No matter what I did I failed I got hold of several of missus Hillmer s tradespeople but she always paid her bills with her own cheques and none of them had ever heard of a Colonel Montgomery That furniture business puzzled me a lot the change of the drawing room set from one flat to another on November seven I mean So I discovered the address of the people who supplied the new articles to missus Hillmer How Through the maid Dobson missus Hillmer has given her notice to leave and the girl is furious about it as she appears to have had a very easy place there I think it came to missus Hillmer s ears that she talked to me I see Proceed Here I hit upon a slight clue It was a gentleman who ordered the new furniture and directed the transfer of the articles replaced from No sixty one to No twelve Raleigh Mansions He did this early in the morning of November seven and the foreman in charge of the job remembered that there was some bother about it as neither missus Hillmer nor mister Corbett as Mensmore used to be called knew anything about it But the gentleman came the same morning and explained matters It struck the foreman as funny that there should be such a fearful hurry about refurnishing a drawing room for the gentleman did not care what the cost was so long as the job was carried out at express speed Another odd thing was that missus Hillmer paid for the articles though she had not ordered them nor did she appear to want them The man was quite sure that Mensmore s first knowledge of the affair came with the arrival of the first batch of articles from missus Hillmer s flat but he could only describe the mysterious agent as being a regular swell He afterwards identified a portrait of Sir Charles Dyke as being exactly like the man he had seen if not the man himself How did you come to have a portrait of Sir Charles in your possession That appears later said the detective full of professional pride at the undoubtedly smart manner in which he had manipulated his facts once they were placed in order before him Of course he went on I jumped at the conclusion that the stranger was this Colonel Montgomery Then while closely questioning the maid about the events of November seven she suddenly remembered that she lost an old skirt and coat about that time They had vanished from her room and she had never laid eyes on them since This set me thinking I confronted her with the clothes worn by Lady Dyke when she was found in the river and I m jiggered if Dobson didn t recognize them at once as being her missing property Now wasn t that a rum go It certainly was said Bruce who was piecing together the story of the murder in his mind as each additional detail came to light Naturally I thought harder than ever after that It then occurred to me that Jane Harding must have had some powerful reasons for so suddenly shutting up about the identification of her mistress s underclothing She was right enough as we know in regard to the skirt and coat but she admitted to me that the linen on the dead body was just the same as Lady Dyke s Curiously enough it was not marked by initials crest or laundry mark and I ascertained months ago that owing to some fad of her ladyship s all the family washing was done on the estate in Yorkshire This explained the absence of the otherwise inevitable laundry mark Thus far you are coherence itself Well said mister White complacently I was a long time getting to work mister Bruce and had it not been for your help I should probably never have got at the truth but I flatter myself that once on the right track I seldom leave it However as I was saying I felt that Jane Harding knew a good deal more than she would tell except under pressure so I decided to put that pressure on In what way I frightened her Played off on her a bit of the stage business she is so fond of This afternoon I placed a pair of handcuffs in my pocket and went to her place at Bloomsbury having previously prepared a bogus warrant for her arrest on a charge of complicity in the murder of Lady Dyke It was a dangerous game Very If it had gone wrong and reached the ears of the Commissioner or got into the papers I should have been reduced or dismissed But what is a policeman to do in such cases I was losing my temper over this infernal inquiry and never obtaining any real light though always coming across startling developments It had to end somehow and I took the chance The make believe warrant and the production of handcuffs for a woman they are never used you know in reality have often been trump cards for us when everything else failed This time then the properties made up the show as Miss Harding would put it They did and no mistake I gave her no time to think or act I found her sitting with her mother admiring a new carpet she had just laid down I said Is your name Jane Harding now engaged at the Jollity Theatre under the alias of Marie le Marchant but formerly a maid in the service of Lady Dyke She grew very white and said Yes while her mother clutched hold of her terrified Then I whipped out the warrant and the cuffs My but you should have heard them squeal when the bracelets clinked together What has my child done screamed the mother Perhaps nothing madam I answered but she is guilty in the eyes of the law just the same if she persists in screening the guilty parties Jane Harding was trembling and blubbering but she said It is very hard on me I have done nothing I trembled myself then as I feared that she might offer to come with me to the police station in which case I should have been dished But the mother fixed the affair splendidly I am sure my daughter will not conceal anything she said and it is a shame to disgrace her in this way without telling what it is you want to know I took the cue in an instant I am empowered I said to suspend this warrant and perhaps do away with it altogether if she answers my questions fully and truthfully Why of course she will said the mother and the girl though desperately upset whimpered her agreement With that I got the whole story Sir Charles Dyke inspired her actions I suppose From the very beginning almost At first Jane Harding herself believed when she gave evidence at the inquest that the body she saw was not that of Lady Dyke but afterwards she changed her opinion especially when she recalled the exact pattern and materials of the underclothing Then my inquiries put her on the scent Being rather a sharp girl she jumped to the conclusion that Sir Charles knew more about the matter than he professed In any case her place was gone and she would soon be dismissed so she resolved on a plan even bolder than mine in threatening to lock her up She watched her opportunity found Sir Charles alone one day and told him that from certain things within her knowledge she thought it her duty to go to the police station He was startled she could see and asked her to explain herself She said that her mistress had been killed and she might be able to put the police on the right track He hesitated not knowing what to say so she hinted that it would mean a lot of trouble for her and she would prefer if she had Lfive hundred to go to America and let the matter drop altogether He told her that he did not desire to have Lady Dyke s name brought into public notoriety Sooner than to allow such a thing to occur he would give her the money An hour later he handed her fifty ten pound notes What a wretched mistake cried Bruce involuntarily This unmasking of his unfortunate friend s duplicity was the most painful feature of all to him Perhaps it was replied the detective but the thing is not yet quite clear to me That is why I am here But to continue The girl admitted that she lost her head a bit Instead of leaving the house openly without attracting comment she simply bolted thus giving rise to the second sensational element attending Lady Dyke s disappearance But she resolved to be faithful to her promise When you found her she held her tongue and even wrote to Sir Charles to assure him that she had not spoken a word to a soul He sent for her and pitched into her about not going to America but took her address in case he wished to see her again He recognized her letter writing powers no doubt Evidently She was surprised last Thursday week to receive a telegram asking her to meet him at York Station When she arrived there he asked her to write the letter he handed to you and to post it in London on Saturday evening He explained that his action was due to his keen anxiety to shield his wife s name and that this letter would settle the affair altogether As he handed her another bundle of notes and promised to settle Lone hundred a year on her for life she was willing enough to help him During your interview with her you guessed the reason why she wrote Lady Dyke s hand so perfectly She had copied it for three years All this must have astonished you considerably mister Bruce astonished isn t the word I was flabbergasted Once she started talking I let her alone only rattling the handcuffs when she seemed inclined to stop But all the time I felt as if the top of my head had been blown off I imagine she had not much more to tell you She pitched into you as the cause of all the mischief and went so far as to say that she was sure it was not Sir Charles who killed Lady Dyke but you yourself Bruce winced at Jane Harding s logic Were he able to retrieve the past three months the mystery of Lady Dyke s death would have remained a mystery forever Now about the photograph said the detective After I had left Jane Harding with a solemn warning to speak to no one until I saw her again I made a round of the fashionable photographers and soon obtained an excellent likeness of Sir Charles I showed it to Dobson and she said That is Colonel Montgomery I showed it to the foreman of the furniture warehouse and he said That is the image of the man who ordered missus Hillmer s suite Now what on earth is the upshot of this business to be I called at Wensley House but was told Sir Charles was not in town Had he been in I would not have seen him until I had discussed matters with you That is very good of you mister White May I ask your reason for showing him this consideration The policeman who was very earnest and very excited banged his hand on the table as he cried Don t you see what all this amounts to I have no option but to arrest Sir Charles Dyke for the murder of his wife That is a sad conclusion And do you believe he killed her Strange as it may seem to you I do not And I m jiggered if I do either I I am greatly obliged to you White Claude bent his head almost to his knees and for some minutes there was complete silence When he again looked at the detective there were tears in his eyes What can we do to unravel this tangled skein without creating untold mischief he murmured It beats me sir was the perplexed answer But when I came in I imagined that Jane Harding or some one had been to see you Surely you had learned something of all this before my arrival Yes indeed I had reached your goal but by a different route Unfortunately my discovery only goes to confirm yours Bruce then told him of his visit to the lawyer s office and its result mister White listened to the recital with knitted brows It is very clear he said when the barrister had ended that Lady Dyke was killed in missus Hillmer s flat that Sir Charles knew of her death that he himself conveyed the body to the river bank at Putney and that ever since he has tried to throw dust in our eyes and prevent any knowledge of the true state of affairs reaching us Your summary cannot be disputed in the least particular Well mister Bruce we must do something If you don t like to interfere then I must There is but one person in the world who can enlighten us as to the facts That person obviously is Sir Charles Dyke himself Unquestionably Bruce looked at his watch It was ten point thirty P M He rose Let us go to him he said But he is not in London He is I expect you will find that he gave orders for no one to be admitted and told the servants to say he had left town to make the denial more emphatic It will be a terrible business I fear mister Bruce I dread it on my soul I do But I cannot shirk this final attempt to save my friend My presence may tend to help forward a final and full explanation No matter what the pain to myself I must be present Come it is late already CHAPTER XXVIII SIR CHARLES DYKE S JOURNEY The streets were comparatively deserted as they drove quickly up Whitehall and crossed the south side of Trafalgar Square It is a common belief even among Londoners themselves that the traffic is dense in the main thoroughfares at all hours of the night until twelve o clock has long past But to the experienced eye there is a marked hiatus between half past nine and eleven o clock At such a time Charing Cross is negotiable Piccadilly Circus loses much of its terror and a hansom may turn out of Regent Street into Oxford Street without the fare being impelled to clutch convulsively at the brass window slide in a make believe effort to save the vehicle from being crushed like a walnut shell between two heavy buses Such considerations did not appeal to the barrister and his companion on this occasion For some inexplicable cause they both felt that they were in a desperate hurry A momentary stoppage at the turn into Orchard Street caused each man to swear quite unconsciously Now that the supreme moment in this most painful investigation was at hand they resented the slightest delay Though they were barely fifteen minutes in the cab it seemed an hour before they alighted at Wensley House Portman Square In response to an imperative ring a footman appeared Instead of answering the barrister s question as to whether Sir Charles was at home or not he said You are mister Bruce sir aren t you Yes Sir Charles is at home but he retired to his room before dinner He is not well and he may have gone to bed but he said that if you came you were to be admitted I will ask mister Thompson Better send Thompson to me said Bruce decisively and in a minute the old butler stood before him I hear that Sir Charles has retired for the night said Claude Thompson had caught sight of the detective standing on the steps A few hours earlier he had himself told him that the baronet was out of town It was an awkward dilemma and he coughed doubtingly while he racked his brains for a judicious answer But Bruce grasped his difficulty It is all right Thompson mister White quite understands the position Do you think Sir Charles is in bed I will go and see sir He was very anxious that you should be sent upstairs if you called But that was when he was in the library Bruce and the detective entered the hall the butler closed the door behind them and then solemnly ascended the stairs to Sir Charles Dyke s bedroom which was situated on the first floor along a corridor towards the back of the house They distinctly heard the polite knock at the door and Thompson s query Are you asleep Sir Charles After a pause there was another knock and the same question in a slightly louder key Then the butler returned saying as he came down the stairs Sir Charles seems to be sound asleep sir Bruce and the detective exchanged glances The barrister was disappointed almost perturbed but he said In that case we will not disturb him Sir Charles does not often retire so early No sir I have never known him to go to his room so early before He told me not to serve dinner as he wasn t well He would not let me get anything for him He just took some wine and I have not seen him since Since when About seven point thirty sir Bruce turned to depart but Thompson with the privilege of an old servant when talking to one whom he knew to be on familiar terms with his master whispered That there blessed maid turned up again this afternoon sir The barrister started violently Not Jane Harding surely Yes sir She came at four o clock and asked for Sir Charles as bold as brass Did he see her Oh yes sir Do you hear that White The detective nodded She must have reached the house about half an hour before me he said addressing the butler That s about right sir But I understood went on Bruce that Sir Charles was not at home to ordinary callers Thompson shuffled about somewhat uneasily He wished now he had held his tongue I had my orders sir he murmured in extenuation of his apparently diverse actions Tell me what your orders were persisted Bruce The man hesitated not wishful to offend his master s friend but too well trained to reveal the explicit instructions given him by Sir Charles Dyke Do not be afraid I will explain everything to Sir Charles personally We cannot best judge what to do whether to wake him or not unless we know the position went on the barrister Thus absolved from blame Thompson took from his waistcoat pocket a folded sheet of notepaper I don t pretend to understand the reason sir he said but Sir Charles wrote this himself and told me to be careful to obey him exactly The barrister eagerly grasped the note and read If mister Bruce Jane Harding or missus Hillmer should call admit any of them immediately To all others say that I have left town some days ago should they ask you C D White round eyed and bullet headed gazed with goggle orbs over Bruce s shoulder That settles it mister Bruce he said We must see him Thompson said Bruce does Sir Charles usually lock his door Never sir Very well Knock again and then try the door We will go with you Something in the barrister s manner rather than his words sent a cold shiver down the old butler s spine I do hope there s nothing wrong sir he commenced but Bruce was already half way up the stairs Both he and White guessed what had happened They knew that poor Thompson s repeated summons at the bedroom door would remain forever unanswered that the unfortunate baronet had quitted the dread certainties of this world for the uncertainties of the next They were not mistaken A few minutes later they found him listlessly drooping over the side of the chair in which he was seated partly undressed and seemingly overcome at the moment when he was about to take off his boots On a table near him were two bottles both half emptied and an empty wineglass Each of the bottles bore the label of a well known chemist One was endorsed Sleeping draught the other Poison and Chloral The three men were pale as the limp inanimate form in the chair while they silently noted these details Bruce raised the head of his friend in the hope that life might not yet be extinct But Sir Charles Dyke had taken his measures effectually Though the rigor mortis had not set in he had evidently been dead some time Thompson quite beside himself with grief dropped to his knees by his master s side Sir Charles he wailed Sir Charles For the love of Heaven speak to us You can t be dead Oh you can t It ain t fair You re too young to die What curse has come upon the house that both should go Bruce leaned over and shook the old butler firmly by the shoulder Thompson he said impressively for now that the crisis he feared had come and gone he exercised full control over himself Thompson if you ever wished to serve Sir Charles you must do so now by remaining calm For his sake help us and do not create an unnecessary scene Governed by the more powerful nature the affrighted man struggled to his feet What shall I do he whimpered Shall I send for a doctor Yes say Sir Charles is very ill Not a word to a soul about what has happened until we have carefully examined the room At that instant mister White caught sight of a large and bulky envelope which had fallen to the floor near the chair on which Sir Charles was seated Picking it up he found it was addressed Claude Bruce esquire To be delivered to him at once This will explain matters I expect said the detective Whatever could have come to my master to do such a thing groaned Thompson turning to reach the door Come back cried Bruce sharply Now look here Thompson he went on placing both his hands on the butler s shoulders and looking him straight in the eyes it is imperative that you should pull yourself together That sort of remark will never do Sir Charles has simply taken an over dose of chloral accidentally He has slept badly ever since Lady Dyke s death you understand and has been in the habit of taking sleeping draughts Now before you leave the room tell me exactly what has happened in your own language I can t put it together now sir but I won t say anything to anybody You can trust me for that Why I loved him as my own son I did Yes I know that well But remember An over dose An accident Nothing else Do you follow me Quite sir Heaven help us all Very well Now send for the doctor without needlessly alarming the other servants Bruce placed the envelope in the pocket of his overcoat saying to the detective We will examine this later White Just now we must do what we can to avoid a scandal The case between Lady Dyke and her husband will be settled by a higher tribunal than we had counted upon It certainly looks like an accident mister Bruce was the answer but it all depends upon the view the doctor takes And you know of course that I shall have to report the actual facts to my superiors That is obvious Yet no harm is done at this early stage in taking such steps as may finally render undue publicity needless It may be impossible but on the other hand until we have heard Sir Charles s version contained I suppose in this letter to me it is advisable to sustain the theory of an accidental death Anything I can do to help you will be done replied the detective With that they dropped the subject and more carefully scrutinized the room To all intents and purposes Sir Charles Dyke might indeed have brought about the catastrophe inadvertently The sleeping draught bore the ledger number of its prescription and there is nothing unusual in a patient striving to help the cautious dose ordered by a physician by the addition of a more powerful nostrum His partly dressed state too argued that he had taken the fatal mixture at a time when he contemplated retiring to rest forthwith A fire still burned in the grate On the mantelpiece in a position where the baronet must see it until the moment when all things faded from his vision was a beautiful miniature of his wife The detective with professional nonchalance soon sat down There was nothing to do but await the arrival of the doctor and having heard his report go home In the quietude of the room with the strain relaxed Bruce was profoundly moved by the spectacle of his dead friend Whatever his logical faculties might argue he could not regard this man as a murderer If Lady Dyke met her death at his hand then it must have been the result of some terrible mistake of some momentary outburst of passion which never contemplated such a sequel Poisons which kill by stupefaction do not distort their victims as in cases where violent irritants are used Sir Charles Dyke seemed to live in a deep sleep exhausted by toil or pain sleep the counterfeit of death while the bright colors and speaking eyes of the miniature counterfeited life Standing between these two both the mere images of the man and the woman he had known so well the barrister insensibly felt that at last they had peace It was his first experience of the tremendous change in the relationship established by death It utterly overpowered him No mere words could express his emotions Between him and those that had been was imposed the impenetrable wall of eternity A bustle in the hall beneath aroused him from his grief stricken stupor and mister White s commonplace tones sounded strange to his ears Here s the doctor A well known physician hastened to the room Thompson had carefully followed instructions The doctor was not prepared for the condition of affairs that a glance revealed to his practised eye Surely he is not dead he cried looking from the form in the chair to the two men Bruce answered him Yes for some hours I fear but we wanted to avoid spreading unnecessary rumors until I understand My poor friend How came this to happen The skilled practitioner merely lifted one of the dead man s eyelids and then turned to examine the bottles on the table My own prescription he said after tasting the contents of one phial Ah this was bad why did he not consult me and he sadly shook his head as he tasted the remaining liquid in the second What do you make of it said Bruce He looked the other steadily in the face and the doctor interpreted the cause of his anxiety A clear case of accidental poisoning he replied Sir Charles has consulted me several times during the past week on account of his extreme insomnia I specifically warned him against overdoing my treatment Change of air exercise and diet are the true specifics for sleeplessness especially when induced as his was by a morbid state of mind You mean That Sir Charles has never recovered from the shock of his wife s death I did not know of it myself until it was announced recently and I gathered from him that the manner of her demise was partly unaccounted for Altogether it is a sad business that such a couple should be taken in such a manner mister White was industriously taking notes the while and the doctor regarded him with a questioning look This gentleman is in the police explained Bruce Indeed Yes We came here by mere accident mister White and I were engaged in an important inquiry the cause of Lady Dyke s disappearance in fact and we hurried here at a late hour to consult with Sir Charles Hence our presence and this discovery How strange There is no reason now broke in the detective why the body should not be moved Claude shuddered at the phrase It suggested the inevitable Not in the least I am quite satisfied as to the cause of death The despatch of telegrams and other necessary details kept Bruce busily employed until two o clock Not until he reached the privacy of his own library was he able to break the seal of the packet left for him as the final act and word of the late Sir Charles Dyke CHAPTER XXIX HOW LADY DYKE DISAPPEARED Being the Manuscript left by Sir Charles Dyke Bart and addressed to Claude Bruce esquire Barrister at law It is customary I believe for poor wretches who are sentenced to undergo the last punishment of the law to be allowed a three weeks respite between the date of their sentence and that on which they are executed I am in the position of such a one The difference between me and the convicted felon lies merely in environment in most respects I am worse situated than he My period of agony is longer drawn out I am condemned to die by my own hand I am mocked by the surroundings of luxury taunted by the knowledge that though life and even a sort of happiness are within my reach I must not avail myself of them There may come a time in the affairs of any man when he is compelled to choose between a dishonored existence and voluntary death These unpleasant alternatives are now before me You who know me would never doubt which of them I should adopt nor will you upbraid me because our judgments coincide There is nothing for it Bruce but quiet death death in the least obtrusive form and so disposed that it may be possible for you chief among my friends and the only person I can trust to fulfil my wishes to arrange that my memory may be speedily forgotten My virtues I fear will not secure me immortality my faults I hope will not be spread broadcast to cram the maws of the gaping crowd I do not shirk this final issue nor do I crave pity In setting forth plainly the history of my wife s death and its results I am actuated solely by a desire to protect others from needless suspicion Having resolved to pay forfeit for my own errors I claim to have expiated them This document is an explanation not a confession I have not much time left wherein fittingly to shape my story so as to be just to all myself included If I am not mistaken the officers of the law are in hot chase of me but my statement shall not be made to an earthly judge The words of a man about to die may not be well chosen they should at least be true I will tell of events as nearly as possible in their sequence of time If I leave gaps through haste or forgetfulness you will from your own knowledge of the facts readily fill them up once you are in possession of the salient features Mensmore and his sister were the friends of my early years We played together as children Gwendoline Mensmore was two years younger than I and I well remember making love to her at the age of eleven Her mother died when she was quite a baby and her father married again so her step brother Albert is her junior by four years I taught him how to ride and swim and play cricket My father s place in Surrey we did not acquire the Yorkshire property until the death of my grandfather adjoined the estate General Mensmore occupied after his retirement from the army We children always called Gwendoline Dick to avoid the difficulty of her long sounding name I suppose and I honestly believe that our respective parents entertained the idea that a marriage between us was quite a natural thing I went to school at Brighton and Mensmore being a somewhat precocious lad joined the same school before I left The headmaster the reverend Septimus Childe was an old friend of my father s and when he wished to purchase a house at Putney the terrible house which has figured in my dreams for the past three months as a Place of Skulls my parents put pressure on my mother s trustees to make the transaction an easy one Of course I knew it well We regarded it in those early days as a town house and always lived there during the season My father s succession to the title and estates changed all that We quitted Surrey for Yorkshire and Wensley House Portman Square was a step upwards from the barrack like building which so admirably suited mister Childe s requirements When I was at Sandhurst General Mensmore got into difficulties He quitted Surrey and we gradually lost sight of him and his children Afterwards I knew that he struggled on for a few years placed his son in the army and then came a complete collapse ending in his death and the boy s resignation of his commission Of Gwendoline Mensmore s whereabouts I knew nothing Her memory never quitted me but the new interests in my life dulled it I imagined that I could laugh at a childish infatuation Then I married I did so in obedience to my father s wishes and Alice was I suppose an ideal wife far too ideal for a youngster of my lower intellectual plane I know now that I never had any real affection for her I was always somewhat awed by her loftier aspirations My interests lay in racing hunting sports generally and having what I defined as a good time She though an excellent horsewoman and in every sense an admirable hostess thought Newmarket vulgar treated Ascot as a social necessity and turned up her eyebrows at me when I failed to see any utility in schemes for the reclamation of the submerged tenth Thus though we never quarrelled we gradually drifted apart She knew she bored me if she asked me to inspect a model dwelling I knew she hated the people who were the companions of a coaching tour or a week at Goodwood Unfortunately we were not blessed with offspring Had it been otherwise we might have found a common object of interest in our children Insensibly we agreed to a separate existence We lived together as friends rather than as husband and wife We parted without regret and met without cordiality Do not think we were unhappy If our marriage was not bliss it was at least comfortable I think my wife was proud of my successes on the turf in a quiet kind of way and I certainly was proud of her and of the high reputation she enjoyed among all classes of society I even reverenced her for it and I well knew that the enthusiastic receptions given us by our Yorkshire tenantry were not due to my efforts in their behalf but to hers So we lived for nearly six years and so we might have continued for sixty had I not met Gwendoline Mensmore again under vastly changed circumstances She was a chorus girl in a variety theatre earning a poor living under wretched conditions I discovered the fact by mere chance I met her and she told me her story how she had married a man named Hillmer whom her father had trusted and whom she believed to be able to save them from ruin Then the crash came Her father died her husband also broke down financially took to drink and ill treated her her brother was swallowed up somewhere in the Far West She had no alternative but to live apart from her husband and try to support herself by the first career that suggests itself to a young talented and beautiful woman But she was already weary of the stage and its distasteful surroundings Her nature was too delicate for the rude friendships of the dressing room She shuddered at the thought of a mild carousal in a bar when the labors of the night were ended In a word were I differently constituted were she cast in more common mould there was apparently ready to hand all the material for a vulgar liaison My respect for my wife however no less than missus Hillmer s fine disposition saved both of us from folly Yet I could not leave her exposed to the exigencies of a life in which she was rapidly becoming disillusioned Away in the depths of my heart I knew that this sweet woman was my true mate separated from me by adverse chance There was nothing unfair to Alice in the thought Were she questioned at any time I suppose she must have admitted that we were in some respects as ill matched a couple as we were well matched in others You will say that I understood but little of feminine nature nothing at all of my wife s How best to help missus Hillmer that was the question It was at this stage I made the initial mistake to which I can too late trace a host of succeeding misfortunes I did not consult my wife Trying now to analyze my reasons for this lamentable error of judgment I imagined that it arose from some absurd disinclination on my part to admit that I went to the stage door of a theatre to inquire about the identity of a young woman whom I had recognized from the front of the house Don t you see my dear Bruce it is almost as bad to fear your wife as to suspect her As at that time my own life was free from the slightest cloud of sorrow I took keen interest in the troubles of missus Hillmer and I amused myself by playing in her behalf the part of a modern magician I felt intuitively that she would resent any direct attempt on my part to place funds at her disposal and I found a great deal of harmless fun in helping her with her consent but without her actual knowledge I am as you know a rich man At this hour I cannot sum up my available assets to within Lone hundred thousand Altogether I must be worth nearly a million sterling yet my money cannot purchase me another day s existence such as I would tolerate Strange is it not Well the close of the year before last was a period of unexampled activity on the Stock Exchange and by way of a joke I made some purchases on missus Hillmer s account with the intention of pretending to pay myself out of the profits while handing her such balances as might accrue She is a shrewd woman and quick at figures so I might have experienced some difficulty in deceiving her But the mad record of the past twelve months was in no wise belied by its inception My purchases were those of a man inspired by the Goddess of Fortune Stocks which I bought commenced suddenly to inflate I astounded my brokers by the manner in which I ferreted out neglected bonds mines which struck the mother lode next week railway companies whose directors were even then secretly conspiring to water the stock missus Hillmer became infected with the craze like myself Twice we plunged heavily in American Rails and came out triumphantly To end this part of my story after five months of excitement I had contrived not only to swell my own deposits to a large extent but I had secured on missus Hillmer s account a sufficient quantity of reliable stock to bring her in an average income of Lfifteen hundred per annum My greatest difficulty was to persuade missus Hillmer to break off the habit of speculation once she had contracted it I found that she perused the late editions of the evening papers with the same eagerness that a bookmaker looks for the starting prices of the day s races By the exercise of firmness and tact I was able to stop her from further dealings At the close of this period I need hardly say that two things had happened missus Hillmer and I were fast friends with common objects and interests in life and concurrently the ties between Alice and myself had loosened still more I also carelessly made another blunder Under the pretence that secrecy was requisite for Stock Exchange transactions I persuaded missus Hillmer to allow me to pass under the name of Colonel Montgomery missus Hillmer of course was now able to live in comparative luxury I came to regard her house as an abode of rest I was more at home in her drawing room than in my own house She often spoke to me of my wife and obviously wished to see her but here I did a cowardly thing I represented my married existence as far less comfortable than it really was and gradually missus Hillmer ceased all allusion to Alice She misunderstood our relations I knew it and did not explain Not a very worthy proceeding for a man whose sense of honor is so keen that he prefers death to disgrace But one can deceive no other so easily as oneself Occasionally when opportunities offered we went out together It was foolish you will say and I agree with you If folly were not pleasant it would not be so fashionable But to this hour the relations between us are those only of close friendship Never in my life have I addressed her by other than her married name never have I touched her arm save by way of casual politeness I really think I flattered myself upon my superior virtues I could see all the excellence but none of the stupidity of my behavior About this time missus Hillmer s husband died Thenceforth she became slightly reserved in manner When life was a defiance she fought convention but with safety came prudence In fact she told me that my frequent visits to her house would certainly be ill construed if they became known I was seeking for a pretext to introduce her to her own set in society when a double catastrophe occurred My wife discovered as she imagined that I was clandestinely occupied with another woman and missus Hillmer s brother returned from America It will best serve my hurried narrative if I relate events exactly as they happened and not as they look in the light of subsequent knowledge Mensmore was naturally astounded to find his sister so well provided for and gratefully accepted the help she gave him towards resuscitating his own fortunes But it did not occur to either of us that he would take the ordinary view of the bond existing between us and I shall never forget his rage when he found out that I was not known to his sister s servants by my right name It was an awkward position for all three He was loth to allege that which we did not feel called upon to deny But between him and me there was a marked coolness arising from suspicion on his part and resentment on mine coupled I must add with an unquiet consciousness that his attitude was not wholly unreasonable missus Hillmer and he discussed the matter several times He urged that this compromising friendship should be discontinued She a determined woman when her mind was made up fought the suggestion on the ground of unfairness though like myself she would have been glad of any accident which would alter the position of affairs He interpreted her opposition to different motives Finally as his financial position was a dangerous one as we afterwards learned and he despaired of setting things straight in Raleigh Mansions judging them from his own point of view he resolved to leave England again And now I come to the night of November six It was as you will remember a foggy and unpleasant day I had some business in the city which detained me until darkness set in I had not seen missus Hillmer for two days so I resolved to drive to Sloane Square travelling by the Underground was intolerable in such weather and have tea with her I did not know then that she had gone with her maid to Brighton intending to return that evening It was a sudden whim she told me subsequently and she had not even informed the other servants of her intention The pavements in the City were slimy with the dampness of the fog and as an empty four wheeler passed through Cornhill I hailed it a most unusual choice on my part The cabman I noticed was fairly elevated but as these fellows often drive better when drunk than sober I simply told him to be careful and jumped in I reached Sloane Square all right and detained the cab for my intended journey home in time for dinner At the door of missus Hillmer s flat I met the cook and housemaid both going out to do some shopping probably in the spare hour before it was time to prepare dinner They knew me well of course and admitted me to the drawing room telling me that missus Hillmer was out but would surely return very soon I had not been in the room a minute before the sharp double knock of a telegraph messenger brought the coachman whom the girls left in charge of the house to the door and I startled the man by appearing in the hall as he did not know of my presence What is it Simmonds I said as I correctly guessed the message to be from missus Hillmer The missus is in Brighton sir he answered She wants the carriage to meet her at Victoria at seven o clock It s six now and I ought to go around to the stables at once but both these blessed girls have gone out I m in a fair fix No fix at all I said I want to see missus Hillmer so I will wait here until she arrives or at all events till the servants come back The man scratched his head but he could think of no better plan so he too went off and I was left alone for the first time in my life in missus Hillmer s abode It is the small events that govern our lives Claude not those that stand out prominently The shopping expedition of a couple of servant girls intent on securing a new cap or a few yards of calico brought about my wife s death caused misery to many people and ends I sincerely hope in my own speedy leap into oblivion I picked up a novel Tess of the D Urbervilles hit upon the terrible episode that culminates on Salisbury Plain and was soon deeply interested when another knock this time an imperative summons long drawn out caused me to hasten to the door I opened it and in the dim light of the staircase landing for a second did not recognize the lady who stood outside Heaven help me I was soon enlightened My wife s voice was bitterly contemptuous as she said You don t keep a footman it appears in your new establishment Charles Had I been suddenly struck blind or paralyzed I could not have been more dumfounded than by Alice s unexpected appearance A thorough scoundrel might perhaps have thought of the best thing to say I blurted out the worst What are you doing here I stammered when my tongue recovered its use No doubt you resent my appearance she cried in a high shrill tone I had never before heard from her but I shall not trouble you further I merely came to confirm with my own eyes what my ears refused to entertain Now I am satisfied She half turned with the intention of reaching the street but rendered desperate by the absurdity of my position I gripped her arm and pulled her forcibly into the entrance hall closing and bolting the door behind us You have seen too much not to see more I cried I will not allow you to ruin both our lives by a mere suspicion She was in a furious temper but her sense of propriety for she did not know that the servants quarters were empty restrained her until we had both entered the drawing room Then she burst upon me with a torrent of words CHAPTER XXX SIR CHARLES DYKE ENDS HIS NARRATIVE A mere suspicion indeed she said and there was that in her voice which warned me that I had better try unarmed to control a tigress than a wife who deemed herself wronged these are pretty suspicions that surround you A house tenanted by another woman where you are evidently master A mistress who left the ranks of the ballet or something of the sort living in luxury on means supplied by you A married woman who casts off her husband with her poverty to take up a paramour and riches Do you think you can blind my eyes further I have the most convincing proofs of your infamy Do not imagine that on any specious pretext I will condone your conduct I despise you from the depths of my heart Henceforth I will strive to forget your very existence Alice I said and if she had not been blinded by passion she must have been affected by my earnestness will you listen to me Why should I What respect have you shown to me that I should now seem even to accept your excuses I appeal to you not to do anything in anger You have good reason to be enraged with me I only ask you to suspend your final judgment Hear what I have to say take time for deliberation for further inquiry and then condemn me to any punishment you think fit She did not answer me Her eyes were roving round the room and taking stock of every indication of poor missus Hillmer s artistic aptitude The place was eminently home like much more so than our elegant mansion in Portman Square and my wife noted the fact with momentarily increasing bitterness Yet I essayed my desperate task with failing nerve and terrible consciousness of a bad cause Notwithstanding all that you have seen and heard I said I am not guilty of the crime you accuse me of missus Hillmer is an old friend of mine whom I have helped from a state of misery to one of comfort and comparative happiness She is as pure minded in thought as spotless in character as you are yourself You are doing her a grievous injustice by doubting the relations between her and me If you only knew her My wife laughed scornfully Pray spare yourself Charles I have never seen you so interested before but you lie badly nevertheless I do not lie Before heaven I am telling you the truth You are even willing to perjure yourself Colonel Montgomery My poor armor was ill fitted for this stroke I suppose I must have flinched before it for she went on You see I am well posted My detectives have done their work well Oh Heaven that I should ever have learned to love a vile wretch like you I thought you respected me at least I tried hard to bend my own wishes to sympathy with yours and I dreamt even of ultimate success I knew you didn t care much for me but the devotion of a slave has at times been rewarded by the affection of her master Fortunately I am a slave by choice It only required experience to break my bonds and you have supplied the experience For the first time in my life did it dawn on me that my self contained and haughty wife harbored other thoughts than a sentiment of respect for an indulgent and easily controlled husband It was a shock to me a deeper humiliation than she dreamed of How could I expiate the past wipe out this record of error and folly but not of ill doing and live happily with her so long as Providence was pleased to spare us While these things ran through my brain she suddenly turned on me You fear exposure in the law courts You dread your name figuring in a society scandal How little you know me You naturally compare me by your own contemptible standard I left your house to night determined never to return to it should I find you here as in all probability I was told would be the case I will go to my sister until I have determined upon my future life You at least will never by my desire see or hear from me again Thus far I presume I will fall in with your views She would have passed me but I held fast to the inside of the door If once she got away from me I might never be able to set affairs even tolerably right Better I deemed have one trying scene in the hope that she would calm down in the face of facts than allow her to carry the quarrel to her relatives and strengthen her attitude by their natural support Alice I said you shall not go How can you dare to detain me she shrieked and the glint in her eyes showed how thoroughly her passions were aroused You can separate from me if you will I shall not venture to hinder you But I swear you shall not do this rash act without knowledge I tell you you must remain here When you leave this house you do so in my company And why am I to be kept a prisoner missus Hillmer will return in less than an hour You have sought this meeting yourself Very well You shall have it When your charges have been thoroughly thrashed out in the presence of missus Hillmer and myself I will then accompany you where you will and leave you under the protection of your sister or any one else you choose should you still persist in leaving me Of course my action was unwise to the last degree But remember Claude that during these last awful five minutes I had seen a side of my wife s nature hidden from me six long years And I was a man suddenly plunged into a raging sea drifting helplessly I knew not whither All that consumed me was a wild desire for such scant justice as I deserved I had erred but my faults were not those my wife alleged against me If she was angry before she was now absolutely uncontrollable What she screamed Remain to meet your your mistress Never while I have life She flung herself upon me so suddenly that she tore me away from the door She was a strong and athletic woman and I suppose she expected some resistance for she used such force as to drag me forward into the middle of the room overturning a chair in the effort I was so utterly taken by surprise that I yielded to her violence more completely than she expected She staggered let go her hold and fell heavily backwards tripping over the fallen chair I made a desperate attempt to save her but only caught the end of a fur necklet and it tore like a spider s web Her body crashed against a Venetian fender and her head came with awful force against a sort of support for the fire irons that stood up a foot from the ground Then she rolled over her eyes and face undergoing a ghastly change and instantly became as I thought unconscious I knelt beside her raising her head with my right hand and brokenly besought her to speak to me when I would at once do anything she demanded But she gave no sign of animation In a frenzy of despair I forced myself to examine her injuries and my heart nearly stopped beating when I discovered that a large piece of iron had been driven into her brain through the back of her head I knew in a moment that she was dead Although I have not had much experience of that terrible epoch in the human being I have seen far too much of death in animal life not to know that she who had been my honored and respected wife now lay before me a mere soulless entity a symbol only of the splendid vital creature who a minute earlier was angrily protesting against the supposed faithlessness of her mate Looking back now upon the events of that fateful night I marvel at the appalling coolness which came to my aid as soon as I realized the extent of the misfortune which had befallen both Alice and myself I can fully understand what is meant by the callousness of a certain class of criminals or the indifference to inevitable death betrayed by Eastern races No sooner was I quite assured that my wife was dead dead beyond hope or doubt than I regained the use of my reasoning faculties in the most marvellously cold blooded degree The actual difficulties of my position were enormous I arraigned myself before the judge and jury and saw clearly that every circumstance which contributed to Alice s suspicions in the first instance were now magnified a hundred fold by the manner and scene of her death Before me in ghostly panorama moved the dread crowd of witnesses against me the degradation of my family the bitter and vengeful feelings of my wife s relatives the suffering of poor unconscious missus Hillmer the whole avalanche of horror and misery which this unfortunate accident had precipitated upon every person who claimed my relationship or friendship My mental attitude was quite altruistic Could I have undone the past I would cheerfully have undergone a painful and protracted death forthwith But no possible atonement on my part would restore Alice to life I knew it was quite improbable that I should be convicted of murdering her strong as the circumstantial testimony against me must be The mere legal consequences did not however weigh with me for a second From that awful hour I felt that I was doomed personally My only thought was to seek oblivion not only for myself but for all whom Alice s death might affect Reasoning in this way I rapidly resolved to make a bold effort to conceal forever the time and place of the fatality If I failed I could tell the truth if I succeeded I might at my own expense save a vast amount of unnecessary sorrow The desperate expedient came to me of carrying off the body to the untenanted house at Putney where my old master had resided until his death utilizing the four wheeled cab with its half drunken driver for the purpose If I reached Putney unhindered I could dispose of my terrible burden easily for the river flowed past the grounds and every inch of the locality was known to me It occurred to me that perhaps the body might be found and recognized Our personal linen was never marked by reason of the fact that our laundry work was done upon our Yorkshire estate but as a temporary safeguard I resolved to take some different and less valuable outer clothes from missus Hillmer s residence Her maid was of a similar build to my wife so I hastened to the girl s room and laid hands upon a soiled coat and skirt which were relegated to the recesses of the wardrobe I glanced at my watch as I came along the corridor It was six point fifteen P M All the incidents I have related to you had happened within a quarter of an hour Oh heaven it seemed longer than all the preceding years of my life Having resolved upon a line of conduct I pursued it with the sang froid and accuracy of one of the superior scoundrels delineated by Du Boisgobey The door of the flat was locked If the servants hardly due yet returned unexpectedly I would send them off to Victoria Station on some imaginary errand of their mistress s I knelt beside my poor wife s body once more and with great difficulty took off her costume and loosely fastened on the maid s garments In her purse there were some bulky documents which I afterwards discovered to be the reports furnished by a firm of private detectives detailing all my movements with reference to Raleigh Mansions with surprising accuracy But she had concealed her name These men themselves only knew me as Colonel Montgomery How Alice first came to suspect me I can only guess Perhaps my indifference my absence from home at definite hours a chance meeting in the street unknown to me any of these may have supplied the initial cause and led her to verify her doubts before taxing me with my supposed iniquity Indeed her final act in coming alone to missus Hillmer s abode revealed her fearless spirit and independent methods She wanted no divorce court revelations She would simply have spurned me as an unworthy and dishonorable wretch Her small belongings I put in my pockets the clothes I made into a parcel and stuffed temporarily beneath my overcoat Then I unlocked the door and went down the few steps to the main entrance There was no one about the fog and sleet having cleared the street a quiet thoroughfare at all times I took the risk of the maids coming back and I ran to the square for my conveyance The driver had been improving the occasion and was more inebriated than before He brought his cab to the door and I knew by the appearance of things that no one had entered during my absence With some difficulty I lifted Alice s body into my arms in as natural a position as possible and carried her to the cab leaving the door of the flat ajar Luck still favored me The cabman supposed that she like himself was intoxicated A man came down the opposite side of the street but he paid not the slightest heed to me and indeed we were but dimly visible to each other Exerting all my strength unobtrusively I placed my wife on the rear seat and then calmly gave the driver instructions He grumbled at the distance but I told him I would pay him handsomely Searching in my pockets and Alice s purse I could only find twelve shillings so although it was risky to avoid a quarrel with the man I determined to give him a five pound note Thus far all had gone well The notion possessed me that to all intents and purposes I had murdered my wife and that I was now disposing of the visible signs of my guilt in the most approved manner of a daring criminal Whether I did right or wrong I cannot even at this late hour decide Should my death induce forgetfulness I am still inclined to think that I acted for the best My wife was dead I was self condemned Why then allow others wholly innocent to be dragged into the vortex This was my line of thought If you reading this ghastly narrative shudder at my deeds I pray you nevertheless to weigh in the balance the good and ill that resulted from my actions At last we reached Putney and drew up at the end of the disused lane which runs down by the side of the house to the river Here again the road was deserted I lifted my wife out carried her to the postern gate and returned to give the driver his note The man was so amazed at the amount that he whipped up his horse instantly fearing lest I should change my mind I was about to force open the old and rickety door into the garden when I remembered the drain pipe jutting into the Thames a place where as a child I often caused much alarm by surreptitious visits for the purpose of catching minnows I quickly took off my coat and boots turned up my trousers and shirt sleeves and examined the pipe with my hands It exactly suited my purpose In half a minute I had firmly wedged my wife s body beneath it This was the most horrible portion of my task The chill water the desolation of the river bank the mud and trailing weeds all these things seemed so vile and loathsome when placed in contact with the mortal remains of my ill fated Alice She had loved me I believe I loved her as I assuredly do now when her presence is but a memory yet I was condemned to commit her to the contaminating beastliness of such surroundings It was a small matter in the face of death but it has weighed on me since more than any other feature of that cruel night s history Before leaving Putney I tied her clothes hat and furs to a couple of heavy stones and threw the parcel into deep water By train and cab I reached home but a few minutes late for dinner It was not difficult for me to act my part with the servants nor keep up the farce during the weary days that followed My consciousness was so seared by what I had gone through that the mere make believe of my position was a relief to me That night in the privacy of my room I recollected the broken fender and feared lest the ironwork would supply a clue should the body be discovered a thing I deemed practically impossible But for missus Hillmer s sake I took no risk Next morning before I saw you at Tattersall s I made arrangements for the whole contents of her drawing room to be transferred to her brother s flat where to my knowledge the articles were needed missus Hillmer had gone out early so the thing was done in her absence Her amazement was so great that she wired me using as a signature the pet name of her childhood and this was the first message you heard the groom refer to when he came a second time with the telegram from Richmond I wrote her a hurried note explaining that I intended the transfer as a sop to her offended brother but she had telegraphed again and I had to go to see her to learn that Mensmore resented the gift and had gone off in a huff to Monte Carlo A little later I took the supreme step of writing a farewell letter Since my wife s death I could not bear to meet any other woman I communed with my poor Alice more when dead than when alive I do not think I have anything else to tell you Step by step I watched you and the police tearing aside my barrier of deceit At times I thought I would baffle you in the end Were it not for my folly in bribing Jane Harding I think I must have succeeded That poor girl was the undoing of me in the first instance and she now has brought me my final sentence for she came to day and told me with tears all that happened between the detective and herself White too put in an appearance To morrow I suppose he will bring a warrant if you do not see him first and tell him the truth Do not misunderstand me I am glad of this release When you strove to arouse me from my despair I did for a little while cherish the hope that I might be able to devote my declining years to the work which Alice herself took an interest in But the web of testimony woven round my old friend Mensmore the self effacing spirit of his sister who to shield me was willing to sacrifice herself the possibility that I might involve these two and perhaps others in my own ruin every circumstance conspired to overwhelm me I can endure no more my dear Bruce It is ended The past is already a dream to me the future void My poor nature was not designed to withstand such a strain The cord of existence has snapped and I cannot bring myself to believe it will be mended again In bidding you farewell I ask one thing If you take a charitable view of my deeds if you consider that my penalty is commensurate with my faults then you might take my dead hand and say This was my friend I pity him May the spirit of his wife be merciful unto him should they meet in the regions beyond the grave And so for the last time I sign myself CHARLES DYKE

5244-59146-0001	train-other-500	and the strange chain of events encircled other actors in the drama too strongly to enable the barrister to adopt the course which would otherwise have commended itself to him An early visit to Scotland Yard
5244-59146-0002	train-other-500	where in company with mister White he interviewed the Deputy Commissioner and a conference with the district coroner settled two important questions The police were satisfied as to the cause of Lady Dyke s death
5244-59146-0003	train-other-500	and the coroner agreed to keep the evidence as to the baronet s sudden collapse strictly within the limits of the medical evidence A wholly unnecessary public scandal was thus avoided
5244-59146-0004	train-other-500	With Lady Dyke s relatives his task required considerable tact Without taking them fully into his confidence he explained that Sir Charles had all along known the exact facts bearing upon her death and burial place
5244-59146-0005	train-other-500	but for family reasons he thought it best not to disclose his knowledge Bruce needed their company operation in getting the home office to give the requisite permission for Lady Dyke s reburial
5244-59146-0006	train-other-500	The circumstance that the deceased baronet had left his estates to his wife s nephew joined to the important position Bruce occupied as one of the trustees and joint guardian with the boy s mother of the young heir
5244-59146-0007	train-other-500	smoothed over many difficulties After a harassing and anxious week Bruce had the melancholy satisfaction of seeing the remains of the unfortunate couple laid to rest in the stately gloom of the family vault
5244-59146-0008	train-other-500	The newspapers of course scented a mystery in the proceedings
none	none	 but definite inquiry was barred in every direction 
5244-59146-0009	train-other-500	Even the exhumation order gave no clue to the reasons of the authorities for granting it and in less than the proverbial nine days the incident was forgotten Sir Charles had made it a condition precedent to the succession
none	none	 that his heir should bear his name 
5244-59146-0010	train-other-500	and should live with his widowed mother on the Yorkshire estate or in the town house for a certain number of months in each year
none	none	 until the boy was old enough to go to school The stipulation was intended to have the effect of more rapidly burying his own memory in oblivion Bruce too was given a sum of Lfive thousand to be expended in bequests as he thought fit Claude understood his motive thoroughly Jane Harding had been loyal to her master in her way 
5244-59146-0011	train-other-500	so he arranged that she should receive an annual income sufficient to secure her from want Thompson too was provided for when the time came that he was too feeble for further employment at Portman Square
5244-59146-0012	train-other-500	and mister White received a handsome douceur for his services missus Hillmer did not even know of Sir Charles Dyke s death until weeks had passed Acting on Bruce s advice
5244-59146-0013	train-other-500	her brother simply told her that everything had been settled and that the authorities concurred with the barrister in the opinion that Lady Dyke was accidently killed When she had completely recovered from the shock of the belief that her loyal friend had murdered his wife
5244-59146-0014	train-other-500	Mensmore one day told her the whole sad story But he would allow no more weeping It is time he said that the misery of this episode should cease When the chief actor in the tragedy gave his life to end the suffering
5244-59146-0015	train-other-500	we would but ill meet his wishes by allowing it to occupy our thoughts unduly in the future Mensmore s marriage with Phyllis Browne was now definitely fixed for the following autumn so he carried his sister off with him on a hasty trip to Wyoming
5244-59146-0016	train-other-500	in company with Corbett a journey required for the protection and development of their joint interests in that State Not only did their property turn out to be of great and lasting value but during their absence the Springbok Mine began to boom
5244-59146-0017	train-other-500	Even the cautious barrister one day found himself hesitating whether or not to sell at half over par
none	none	 so excellent were the reports and so extensive the dividends from that auriferous locality 
5244-59146-0018	train-other-500	The two young people were married a scion of the house had become a lusty two year old mister White had become Chief Inspector and Miss Marie le Marchant had by strenuous effort risen to the dignity of double crown posters
5244-59146-0019	train-other-500	as a dashing comedienne when Bruce s memories of his lost friends were suddenly revived in an unexpected manner mister Sydney H Corbett came to him with measured questionings and brooding thought stamped on his brows
5244-59146-0020	train-other-500	It s like this he said when they were settled down to details I want to get married To whom inquired Claude wondering at the savage tone in which the announcement was made To missus Hillmer Oh
none	none	 That s what everybody yells the moment I mention it 
5244-59146-0021	train-other-500	She screams Oh and runs off with tears in her eyes Her brother says Oh and looks uncomfortable but refuses to discuss the proposition Now you say Oh and gaze at me like an owl at the bare statement
5244-59146-0022	train-other-500	What the dickens does it all mean I want to know I m not worrying about what happened years ago missus Hillmer is just the sort of woman I require as a wife and I ll marry her yet if the whole British nation says Oh loud enough to be heard and answered by the U nited States
5244-59146-0023	train-other-500	That s the proper sort of spirit in which to set about the business Yes sir but I can t get any forrarder There s a kind of rock below water which holds me up every time I shoot the rapids She likes me well enough I know
5244-59146-0024	train-other-500	She calls me Syd as slick as butter and I call her Gwen but there you are if I want to go ahead a bit she pulls up and weeps
none	none	 Now why the 
5244-59146-0025	train-other-500	Steady mister Corbett Women weep for many reasons Do you know her history No and I don t want to
none	none	 But perhaps that is exactly what she does want 
5244-59146-0026	train-other-500	Remember that she has been married before with somewhat bitter experience She probably believes that a husband and wife should have no secrets from each other Above all else there should be no cloud between them as to bygone events
5244-59146-0027	train-other-500	missus Hillmer is highly sensitive If she imagined you were under any misapprehension as to the circumstances under which Sir Charles and Lady Dyke met their deaths
none	none	 do not forget that you were personally mixed up in the affair 
5244-59146-0028	train-other-500	she would neither entertain your proposal nor explain her motives She would just do as you say run away and cry Well now that beats everything said Corbett admiringly That never struck me before
5244-59146-0029	train-other-500	It is the probable explanation of her attitude nevertheless Then what am I to do Write to her Ask her permission to learn the facts from me Tell her you believe you understand the reasons for her reticence
5244-59146-0030	train-other-500	and that your only excuse for the request is that you want to go to her on an equal plane of absolute confidence It seems to me That I d better get quick and do it shouted Corbett vanishing with the utmost celerity
5244-59146-0031	train-other-500	Bruce still occupied his old chambers in Victoria Street He did not expect to see Corbett again for a couple of days To the barrister s utter amazement he returned within ten minutes Fire away he cried excitedly
5244-59146-0032	train-other-500	You struck it first time I just rang her up Rang her up Yes she s staying at the Savoy for a few days
none	none	 so I telephoned from the Windsor 
5244-59146-0033	train-other-500	I could never fix up a letter in your words you know
none	none	 But switch me on the end of a wire and I know where I am 
5244-59146-0034	train-other-500	What on earth did you say As soon as I got her in the box at the other end I said Is that you Gwen Yes said she Well said I I guess you know who s talking Quite well said she Then said I
5244-59146-0035	train-other-500	I ve just been telling mister Bruce I wanted to marry you and that you wouldn t even discuss the proposition He said you probably wished me to know the whole story of Sir Charles Dyke but felt kinder shy of telling me yourself He will get it off his chest if you give him permission
5244-59146-0036	train-other-500	and then I can come along in a hansom and fix things What do you say There was no answer so I shouted Are you there and she said Yes faint like Don t let me hurry you said I but if you agree straight away I can catch Bruce at home
5244-59146-0037	train-other-500	for I ve just left him With that she said Very well You can see mister Bruce And here I am Having accomplished the whole thing satisfactorily As how Don t you see you have proposed to the lady and practically been accepted
none	none	 Jehosh It does look something like it 
5244-59146-0038	train-other-500	Say I m off This story of yours will keep until to morrow He would have gone but Bruce jumped after him Not so fast mister Corbett You must not sail into the Savoy flying a false flag Kindly oblige me with your attention for the next half hour
5244-59146-0039	train-other-500	With that he unlocked a safe and took from its recesses Sir Charles Dyke s confession He read the whole of its opening passages explaining the relations between missus Hillmer and her unfortunate but abiding friend
5244-59146-0040	train-other-500	The straightforward honest sentences sounded strangely familiar at this distance of time Bruce was glad of the opportunity of reading them aloud It seemed a fitting thing that this testimony should come as it were from the tomb
5244-59146-0041	train-other-500	Corbett listened intently to the recital and to the barrister s summary of the events that followed Poor chap he said when the sad tale had ended I hope you shook hands with him as he asked you to do I did
5244-59146-0042	train-other-500	Would that my grasp had the power to reassure him of my heartfelt sympathy For a little while they were silent So said Corbett at last Gwen thought I would make the same mistake as the poor lady
5244-59146-0043	train-other-500	and suspect her wrongfully No not that But naturally she wished the man whom she could trust as a husband to be wholly cognizant of events in which already he had participated slightly She was right
5244-59146-0044	train-other-500	I like her all the better for it But tell me is there any necessity for that wonderful document to be preserved Not the slightest It has served its last use Then put it in the fire
5244-59146-0045	train-other-500	Bruce did not hesitate a moment to comply with the wish The flames devoured the record with avidity and the two men watched the manuscript crumbling into nothingness
none	none	 Then Corbett said I must be off to the Savoy Good bye old chap said Bruce And good luck to you too I congratulate both missus Hillmer and yourself End of Project Gutenberg s A Mysterious
