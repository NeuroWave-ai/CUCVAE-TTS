These Bones shall Rise Again The Other Animals The Yellow Peril What Life Means to Me REVOLUTION The present is enough for common souls Who never looking forward are indeed Mere clay wherein the footprints of their age Are petrified for ever I received a letter the other day It was from a man in Arizona It began Dear Comrade It ended Yours for the Revolution I replied to the letter and my letter began Dear Comrade It ended Yours for the Revolution In the United States there are four hundred thousand men of men and women nearly one million who begin their letters Dear Comrade and end them Yours for the Revolution In Germany there are three million men who begin their letters Dear Comrade and end them Yours for the Revolution in France one million men in Austria eight hundred thousand men in Belgium three hundred thousand men in Italy two hundred fifty thousand men in England one hundred thousand men in Switzerland one hundred thousand men in Denmark fifty five thousand men in Sweden fifty thousand men in Holland forty thousand men in Spain thirty thousand men comrades all and revolutionists These are numbers which dwarf the grand armies of Napoleon and Xerxes But they are numbers not of conquest and maintenance of the established order but of conquest and revolution They compose when the roll is called an army of seven million men who in accordance with the conditions of to day are fighting with all their might for the conquest of the wealth of the world and for the complete overthrow of existing society There has never been anything like this revolution in the history of the world There is nothing analogous between it and the American Revolution or the French Revolution It is unique colossal Other revolutions compare with it as asteroids compare with the sun It is alone of its kind the first world revolution in a world whose history is replete with revolutions And not only this for it is the first organized movement of men to become a world movement limited only by the limits of the planet This revolution is unlike all other revolutions in many respects It is not sporadic It is not a flame of popular discontent arising in a day and dying down in a day It is older than the present generation It has a history and traditions and a martyr roll only less extensive possibly than the martyr roll of Christianity It has also a literature a myriad times more imposing scientific and scholarly than the literature of any previous revolution They call themselves comrades these men comrades in the socialist revolution Nor is the word empty and meaningless coined of mere lip service It knits men together as brothers as men should be knit together who stand shoulder to shoulder under the red banner of revolt This red banner by the way symbolizes the brotherhood of man and does not symbolize the incendiarism that instantly connects itself with the red banner in the affrighted bourgeois mind The comradeship of the revolutionists is alive and warm It passes over geographical lines transcends race prejudice and has even proved itself mightier than the Fourth of July spread eagle Americanism of our forefathers The French socialist working men and the German socialist working men forget Alsace and Lorraine and when war threatens pass resolutions declaring that as working men and comrades they have no quarrel with each other Only the other day when Japan and Russia sprang at each other s throats the revolutionists of Japan addressed the following message to the revolutionists of Russia Dear Comrades Your government and ours have recently plunged into war to carry out their imperialistic tendencies but for us socialists there are no boundaries race country or nationality We are comrades brothers and sisters and have no reason to fight Your enemies are not the Japanese people but our militarism and so called patriotism Patriotism and militarism are our mutual enemies In January nineteen oh five throughout the United States the socialists held mass meetings to express their sympathy for their struggling comrades the revolutionists of Russia and more to the point to furnish the sinews of war by collecting money and cabling it to the Russian leaders The fact of this call for money and the ready response and the very wording of the call make a striking and practical demonstration of the international solidarity of this world revolution Whatever may be the immediate results of the present revolt in Russia the socialist propaganda in that country has received from it an impetus unparalleled in the history of modern class wars The heroic battle for freedom is being fought almost exclusively by the Russian working class under the intellectual leadership of Russian socialists thus once more demonstrating the fact that the class conscious working men have become the vanguard of all liberating movements of modern times Here are seven million comrades in an organized international world wide revolutionary movement Here is a tremendous human force It must be reckoned with Here is power And here is romance romance so colossal that it seems to be beyond the ken of ordinary mortals These revolutionists are swayed by great passion They have a keen sense of personal right much of reverence for humanity but little reverence if any at all for the rule of the dead They refuse to be ruled by the dead To the bourgeois mind their unbelief in the dominant conventions of the established order is startling They laugh to scorn the sweet ideals and dear moralities of bourgeois society They intend to destroy bourgeois society with most of its sweet ideals and dear moralities and chiefest among these are those that group themselves under such heads as private ownership of capital survival of the fittest and patriotism even patriotism Such an army of revolution seven million strong is a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider The cry of this army is No quarter We want all that you possess We will be content with nothing less than all that you possess We want in our hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind Here are our hands They are strong hands We are going to take your governments your palaces and all your purpled ease away from you and in that day you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the starved and runty clerk in your metropolises Here are our hands They are strong hands Well may rulers and ruling classes pause and consider This is revolution And further these seven million men are not an army on paper Their fighting strength in the field is seven million To day they cast seven million votes in the civilized countries of the world Yesterday they were not so strong To morrow they will be still stronger And they are fighters They love peace They are unafraid of war They intend nothing less than to destroy existing capitalist society and to take possession of the whole world If the law of the land permits they fight for this end peaceably at the ballot box If the law of the land does not permit and if they have force meted out to them they resort to force themselves They meet violence with violence Their hands are strong and they are unafraid In Russia for instance there is no suffrage The government executes the revolutionists The revolutionists kill the officers of the government The revolutionists meet legal murder with assassination Now here arises a particularly significant phase which it would be well for the rulers to consider Let me make it concrete I am a revolutionist Yet I am a fairly sane and normal individual I speak and I think of these assassins in Russia as my comrades So do all the comrades in America and all the seven million comrades in the world Of what worth an organized international revolutionary movement if our comrades are not backed up the world over The worth is shown by the fact that we do back up the assassinations by our comrades in Russia They are not disciples of Tolstoy nor are we We are revolutionists Our comrades in Russia have formed what they call The Fighting Organization This Fighting Organization accused tried found guilty and condemned to death one Sipiaguin Minister of Interior On April two he was shot and killed in the Maryinsky Palace Two years later the Fighting Organization condemned to death and executed another Minister of Interior Von Plehve Having done so it issued a document dated July twenty nine nineteen oh four setting forth the counts of its indictment of Von Plehve and its responsibility for the assassination Now and to the point this document was sent out to the socialists of the world and by them was published everywhere in the magazines and newspapers The point is not that the socialists of the world were unafraid to do it not that they dared to do it but that they did it as a matter of routine giving publication to what may be called an official document of the international revolutionary movement These are high lights upon the revolution granted but they are also facts And they are given to the rulers and the ruling classes not in bravado not to frighten them but for them to consider more deeply the spirit and nature of this world revolution The time has come for the revolution to demand consideration It has fastened upon every civilized country in the world As fast as a country becomes civilized the revolution fastens upon it With the introduction of the machine into Japan socialism was introduced Socialism marched into the Philippines shoulder to shoulder with the American soldiers The echoes of the last gun had scarcely died away when socialist locals were forming in Cuba and Porto Rico Vastly more significant is the fact that of all the countries the revolution has fastened upon on not one has it relaxed its grip On the contrary on every country its grip closes tighter year by year As an active movement it began obscurely over a generation ago In eighteen sixty seven its voting strength in the world was thirty thousand By eighteen seventy one its vote had increased to one million Not till eighteen eighty four did it pass the half million point By eighteen eighty nine it had passed the million point it had then gained momentum In eighteen ninety two the socialist vote of the world was one million seven hundred ninety eight thousand three hundred ninety one in eighteen ninety three two million five hundred eighty five thousand eight hundred ninety eight in eighteen ninety five three million thirty three thousand seven hundred eighteen in eighteen ninety eight four million five hundred fifteen thousand five hundred ninety one in nineteen oh two five million two hundred fifty three thousand fifty four in nineteen oh three six million two hundred eighty five thousand three hundred seventy four and in the year of our Lord nineteen oh five it passed the seven million mark Nor has this flame of revolution left the United States untouched In eighteen eighty eight there were only twenty sixty eight socialist votes In nineteen oh two there were one hundred twenty seven thousand seven hundred thirteen socialist votes And in nineteen oh four four hundred thirty five thousand forty socialist votes were cast What fanned this flame Not hard times The first four years of the twentieth century were considered prosperous years yet in that time more than three hundred thousand men added themselves to the ranks of the revolutionists flinging their defiance in the teeth of bourgeois society and taking their stand under the blood red banner In the state of the writer California one man in twelve is an avowed and registered revolutionist One thing must be clearly understood This is no spontaneous and vague uprising of a large mass of discontented and miserable people a blind and instinctive recoil from hurt On the contrary the propaganda is intellectual the movement is based upon economic necessity and is in line with social evolution while the miserable people have not yet revolted The revolutionist is no starved and diseased slave in the shambles at the bottom of the social pit but is in the main a hearty well fed working man who sees the shambles waiting for him and his children and recoils from the descent The very miserable people are too helpless to help themselves But they are being helped and the day is not far distant when their numbers will go to swell the ranks of the revolutionists Another thing must be clearly understood In spite of the fact that middle class men and professional men are interested in the movement it is nevertheless a distinctly working class revolt The world over it is a working class revolt The workers of the world as a class are fighting the capitalists of the world as a class The so called great middle class is a growing anomaly in the social struggle It is a perishing class wily statisticians to the contrary and its historic mission of buffer between the capitalist and working classes has just about been fulfilled Little remains for it but to wail as it passes into oblivion as it has already begun to wail in accents Populistic and Jeffersonian Democratic The fight is on The revolution is here now and it is the world s workers that are in revolt Naturally the question arises

none	none	is this so No mere whim of the spirit can give rise to a world revolution Whim does not conduce to unanimity There must be a deep seated cause to make seven million men of the one mind to make them cast off allegiance to the bourgeois gods and lose faith in so fine a thing as patriotism There are many counts of the indictment which the revolutionists bring against the capitalist class but for present use only one need be stated and it is a count to which capital has never replied and can never reply The capitalist class has managed society and its management has failed And not only has it failed in its management but it has failed deplorably ignobly horribly The capitalist class had an opportunity such as was vouchsafed no previous ruling class in the history of the world It broke away from the rule of the old feudal aristocracy and made modern society It mastered matter organized the machinery of life and made possible a wonderful era for mankind wherein no creature should cry aloud because it had not enough to eat and wherein for every child there would be opportunity for education for intellectual and spiritual uplift Matter being mastered and the machinery of life organized all this was possible Here was the chance God given and the capitalist class failed It was blind and greedy It prattled sweet ideals and dear moralities rubbed its eyes not once nor ceased one whit in its greediness and smashed down in a failure as tremendous only as was the opportunity it had ignored But all this is like so much cobwebs to the bourgeois mind As it was blind in the past it is blind now and cannot see nor understand Well then let the indictment be stated more definitely in terms sharp and unmistakable In the first place consider the caveman He was a very simple creature His head slanted back like an orang outang s and he had but little more intelligence He lived in a hostile environment the prey of all manner of fierce life He had no inventions nor artifices His natural efficiency for food getting was say one He did not even till the soil With his natural efficiency of one he fought off his carnivorous enemies and got himself food and shelter He must have done all this else he would not have multiplied and spread over the earth and sent his progeny down generation by generation to become even you and me The caveman with his natural efficiency of one got enough to eat most of the time and no caveman went hungry all the time Also he lived a healthy open air life loafed and rested himself and found plenty of time in which to exercise his imagination and invent gods That is to say he did not have to work all his waking moments in order to get enough to eat The child of the caveman and this is true of the children of all savage peoples had a childhood and by that is meant a happy childhood of play and development And now how fares modern man Consider the United States the most prosperous and most enlightened country of the world In the United States there are ten million people living in poverty By poverty is meant that condition in life in which through lack of food and adequate shelter the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained In the United States there are ten million people who have not enough to eat In the United States because they have not enough to eat there are ten million people who cannot keep the ordinary one measure of strength in their bodies This means that these ten million people are perishing are dying body and soul slowly because they have not enough to eat All over this broad prosperous enlightened land are men women and children who are living miserably In all the great cities where they are segregated in slum ghettos by hundreds of thousands and by millions their misery becomes beastliness No caveman ever starved as chronically as they starve ever slept as vilely as they sleep ever festered with rottenness and disease as they fester nor ever toiled as hard and for as long hours as they toil In Chicago there is a woman who toiled sixty hours per week She was a garment worker She sewed buttons on clothes Among the Italian garment workers of Chicago the average weekly wage of the dressmakers is ninety cents but they work every week in the year The average weekly wage of the pants finishers is one dollar thirty one cents and the average number of weeks employed in the year is twenty seven point eighty five The average yearly earnings of the dressmakers is thirty seven dollars of the pants finishers forty two dollars forty one cents Such wages means no childhood for the children beastliness of living and starvation for all Unlike the caveman modern man cannot get food and shelter whenever he feels like working for it Modern man has first to find the work and in this he is often unsuccessful Then misery becomes acute This acute misery is chronicled daily in the newspapers Let several of the countless instances be cited In New York City lived a woman Mary Mead She had three children Mary one year old Johanna two years old Alice four years old Her husband could find no work They starved They were evicted from their shelter at one hundred sixty Steuben Street Mary Mead strangled her baby Mary one year old strangled Alice four years old failed to strangle Johanna two years old and then herself took poison Said the father to the police Constant poverty had driven my wife insane We lived at No one hundred sixty Steuben Street until a week ago when we were dispossessed I could get no work I could not even make enough to put food into our mouths The babies grew ill and weak My wife cried nearly all the time So overwhelmed is the Department of Charities with tens of thousands of applications from men out of work that it finds itself unable to cope with the situation New York Commercial January eleven nineteen oh five In a daily paper because he cannot get work in order to get something to eat modern man advertises as follows Young man good education unable to obtain employment will sell to physician and bacteriologist for experimental purposes all right and title to his body Address for price box three thousand four hundred sixty six Examiner Frank A Mallin went to the central police station Wednesday night and asked to be locked up on a charge of vagrancy He said he had been conducting an unsuccessful search for work for so long that he was sure he must be a vagrant In any event he was so hungry he must be fed Police Judge Graham sentenced him to ninety days imprisonment San Francisco Examiner In a room at the Soto House thirty two Fourth Street San Francisco was found the body of W G Robbins He had turned on the gas Also was found his diary from which the following extracts are made March three No chance of getting anything here What will I do March seven Cannot find anything yet March eight Am living on doughnuts at five cents a day March nine My last quarter gone for room rent March ten God help me Have only five cents left Can get nothing to do What next Starvation or I have spent my last nickel to night What shall I do Shall it be steal beg or die I have never stolen begged or starved in all my fifty years of life but now I am on the brink death seems the only refuge March eleven Sick all day burning fever this afternoon Had nothing to eat to day or since yesterday noon My head my head Good bye all How fares the child of modern man in this most prosperous of lands In the city of New York fifty thousand children go hungry to school every morning From the same city on January twelve a press despatch was sent out over the country of a case reported by doctor A E Daniel of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children The case was that of a babe eighteen months old who earned by its labour fifty cents per week in a tenement sweat shop On a pile of rags in a room bare of furniture and freezing cold missus Mary Gallin dead from starvation with an emaciated baby four months old crying at her breast was found this morning at five hundred thirteen Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn by Policeman McConnon of the Flushing Avenue Station Huddled together for warmth in another part of the room were the father James Gallin and three children ranging from two to eight years of age The children gazed at the policeman much as ravenous animals might have done They were famished and there was not a vestige of food in their comfortless home New York Journal January two nineteen oh two In the United States eighty thousand children are toiling out their lives in the textile mills alone In the South they work twelve hour shifts They never see the day Those on the night shift are asleep when the sun pours its life and warmth over the world while those on the day shift are at the machines before dawn and return to their miserable dens called homes after dark Many receive no more than ten cents a day There are babies who work for five and six cents a day Those who work on the night shift are often kept awake by having cold water dashed in their faces There are children six years of age who have already to their credit eleven months work on the night shift When they become sick and are unable to rise from their beds to go to work there are men employed to go on horseback from house to house and cajole and bully them into arising and going to work Ten per cent of them contract active consumption All are puny wrecks distorted stunted mind and body Elbert Hubbard says of the child labourers of the Southern cotton mills I thought to lift one of the little toilers to ascertain his weight Straightaway through his thirty five pounds of skin and bones there ran a tremor of fear and he struggled forward to tie a broken thread I attracted his attention by a touch and offered him a silver dime He looked at me dumbly from a face that might have belonged to a man of sixty so furrowed tightly drawn and full of pain it was He did not reach for the money he did not know what it was There were dozens of such children in this particular mill A physician who was with me said that they would all be dead probably in two years and their places filled by others there were plenty more Pneumonia carries off most of them Their systems are ripe for disease and when it comes there is no rebound no response Medicine simply does not act nature is whipped beaten discouraged and the child sinks into a stupor and dies So fares modern man and the child of modern man in the United States most prosperous and enlightened of all countries on earth It must be remembered that the instances given are instances only but they can be multiplied myriads of times It must also be remembered that what is true of the United States is true of all the civilized world Such misery was not true of the caveman Then what has happened Has the hostile environment of the caveman grown more hostile for his descendants Has the caveman s natural efficiency of one for food getting and shelter getting diminished in modern man to one half or one quarter On the contrary the hostile environment of the caveman has been destroyed For modern man it no longer exists All carnivorous enemies the daily menace of the younger world have been killed off Many of the species of prey have become extinct Here and there in secluded portions of the world still linger a few of man s fiercer enemies But they are far from being a menace to mankind Modern man when he wants recreation and change goes to the secluded portions of the world for a hunt Also in idle moments he wails regretfully at the passing of the big game which he knows in the not distant future will disappear from the earth Nor since the day of the caveman has man s efficiency for food getting and shelter getting diminished It has increased a thousandfold Since the day of the caveman matter has been mastered The secrets of matter have been discovered Its laws have been formulated Wonderful artifices have been made and marvellous inventions all tending to increase tremendously man s natural efficiency of in every food getting shelter getting exertion in farming mining manufacturing transportation and communication From the caveman to the hand workers of three generations ago the increase in efficiency for food and shelter getting has been very great But in this day by machinery the efficiency of the hand worker of three generations ago has in turn been increased many times Formerly it required two hundred hours of human labour to place one hundred tons of ore on a railroad car To day aided by machinery but two hours of human labour is required to do the same task The United States Bureau of Labour is responsible for the following table showing the comparatively recent increase in man s food and shelter getting efficiency Machine Hours Hand Hours Barley one hundred bushels nine two hundred eleven Corn fifty bushels thirty four two hundred twenty eight shelled stalks husks and blades cut into fodder Oats one hundred sixty bushels twenty eight two hundred sixty five Wheat fifty bushels seven one hundred sixty Loading ore loading two two hundred one hundred tons iron ore on cars Unloading coal twenty two hundred forty transferring two hundred tons from canal boats to bins four hundred feet distant Pitchforks fifty twelve two hundred pitchforks twelve inch tines Plough one landside three one hundred eighteen plough oak beams and handles According to the same authority under the best conditions for organization in farming labour can produce twenty bushels of wheat for sixty six cents or one bushel for three point five cents This was done on a bonanza farm of ten thousand acres in California and was the average cost of the whole product of the farm mister Carroll D Wright says that to day four million five hundred thousand men aided by machinery turn out a product that would require the labour of forty million men if produced by hand Professor Herzog of Austria says that five million people with the machinery of to day employed at socially useful labour would be able to supply a population of twenty million people with all the necessaries and small luxuries of life by working one point five hours per day This being so matter being mastered man s efficiency for food and shelter getting being increased a thousandfold over the efficiency of the caveman then why is it that millions of modern men live more miserably than lived the caveman This is the question the revolutionist asks and he asks it of the managing class the capitalist class The capitalist class does not answer it The capitalist class cannot answer it If modern man s food and shelter getting efficiency is a thousandfold greater than that of the caveman why then are there ten million people in the United States to day who are not properly sheltered and properly fed If the child of the caveman did not have to work why then to day in the United States are eighty thousand children working out their lives in the textile factories alone If the child of the caveman did not have to work why then to day in the United States are there one million seven hundred fifty two thousand one hundred eighty seven child labourers It is a true count in the indictment The capitalist class has mismanaged is to day mismanaging In New York City fifty thousand children go hungry to school and in New York City there are thirteen twenty millionaires The point however is not that the mass of mankind is miserable because of the wealth the capitalist class has taken to itself Far from it The point really is that the mass of mankind is miserable not for want of the wealth taken by the capitalist class but for want of the wealth that was never created This wealth was never created because the capitalist class managed too wastefully and irrationally The capitalist class blind and greedy grasping madly has not only not made the best of its management but made the worst of it It is a management prodigiously wasteful This point cannot be emphasized too strongly In face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the caveman and that modern man s food and shelter getting efficiency is a thousandfold greater than the caveman s no other solution is possible than that the management is prodigiously wasteful With the natural resources of the world the machinery already invented a rational organization of production and distribution and an equally rational elimination of waste the able bodied workers would not have to labour more than two or three hours per day to feed everybody clothe everybody house everybody educate everybody and give a fair measure of little luxuries to everybody There would be no more material want and wretchedness no more children toiling out their lives no more men and women and babes living like beasts and dying like beasts Not only would matter be mastered but the machine would be mastered In such a day incentive would be finer and nobler than the incentive of to day which is the incentive of the stomach No man woman or child would be impelled to action by an empty stomach On the contrary they would be impelled to action as a child in a spelling match is impelled to action as boys and girls at games as scientists formulating law as inventors applying law as artists and sculptors painting canvases and shaping clay as poets and statesmen serving humanity by singing and by statecraft The spiritual intellectual and artistic uplift consequent upon such a condition of society would be tremendous All the human world would surge upward in a mighty wave This was the opportunity vouchsafed the capitalist class Less blindness on its part less greediness and a rational management were all that was necessary A wonderful era was possible for the human race But the capitalist class failed It made a shambles of civilization Nor can the capitalist class plead not guilty It knew of the opportunity Its wise men told of the opportunity its scholars and its scientists told it of the opportunity All that they said is there to day in the books just so much damning evidence against it It would not listen It was too greedy It rose up as it rises up to day shamelessly in our legislative halls and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes It lulled its conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities and allowed the suffering and misery of mankind to continue and to increase in short the capitalist class failed to take advantage of the opportunity But the opportunity is still here The capitalist class has been tried and found wanting Remains the working class to see what it can do with the opportunity But the working class is incapable says the capitalist class What do you know about it the working class replies Because you have failed is no reason that we shall fail Furthermore we are going to have a try at it anyway Seven millions of us say so And what have you to say to that And what can the capitalist class say Grant the incapacity of the working class Grant that the indictment and the argument of the revolutionists are all wrong The seven million revolutionists remain Their existence is a fact Their belief in their capacity and in their indictment and their argument is a fact Their constant growth is a fact Their intention to destroy present day society is a fact as is also their intention to take possession of the world with all its wealth and machinery and governments Moreover it is a fact that the working class is vastly larger than the capitalist class The revolution is a revolution of the working class How can the capitalist class in the minority stem this tide of revolution What has it to offer What does it offer Employers associations injunctions civil suits for plundering of the treasuries of the labour unions clamour and combination for the open shop bitter and shameless opposition to the eight hour day strong efforts to defeat all reform child labour bills graft in every municipal council strong lobbies and bribery in every legislature for the purchase of capitalist legislation bayonets machine guns policemen s clubs professional strike breakers and armed Pinkertons these are the things the capitalist class is dumping in front of the tide of revolution as though forsooth to hold it back The capitalist class is as blind to day to the menace of the revolution as it was blind in the past to its own God given opportunity It cannot see how precarious is its position cannot comprehend the power and the portent of the revolution It goes on its placid way prattling sweet ideals and dear moralities and scrambling sordidly for material benefits No overthrown ruler or class in the past ever considered the revolution that overthrew it and so with the capitalist class of to day Instead of compromising instead of lengthening its lease of life by conciliation and by removal of some of the harsher oppressions of the working class it antagonizes the working class drives the working class into revolution Every broken strike in recent years every legally plundered trades union treasury every closed shop made into an open shop has driven the members of the working class directly hurt over to socialism by hundreds and thousands Show a working man that his union fails and he becomes a revolutionist Break a strike with an injunction or bankrupt a union with a civil suit and the working men hurt thereby listen to the siren song of the socialist and are lost for ever to the political capitalist parties Antagonism never lulled revolution and antagonism is about all the capitalist class offers It is true it offers some few antiquated notions which were very efficacious in the past but which are no longer efficacious Fourth of July liberty in terms of the Declaration of Independence and of the French Encyclopaedists is scarcely apposite to day It does not appeal to the working man who has had his head broken by a policeman s club his union treasury bankrupted by a court decision or his job taken away from him by a labour saving invention Nor does the Constitution of the United States appear so glorious and constitutional to the working man who has experienced a bull pen or been unconstitutionally deported from Colorado Nor are this particular working man s hurt feelings soothed by reading in the newspapers that both the bull pen and the deportation were pre eminently just legal and constitutional To hell then with the Constitution says he and another revolutionist has been made by the capitalist class In short so blind is the capitalist class that it does nothing to lengthen its lease of life while it does everything to shorten it The capitalist class offers nothing that is clean noble and alive The revolutionists offer everything that is clean noble and alive They offer service unselfishness sacrifice martyrdom the things that sting awake the imagination of the people touching their hearts with the fervour that arises out of the impulse toward good and which is essentially religious in its nature But the revolutionists blow hot and blow cold They offer facts and statistics economics and scientific arguments If the working man be merely selfish the revolutionists show him mathematically demonstrate to him that his condition will be bettered by the revolution If the working man be the higher type moved by impulses toward right conduct if he have soul and spirit the revolutionists offer him the things of the soul and the spirit the tremendous things that cannot be measured by dollars and cents nor be held down by dollars and cents The revolutionist cries out upon wrong and injustice and preaches righteousness And most potent of all he sings the eternal song of human freedom a song of all lands and all tongues and all time Few members of the capitalist class see the revolution Most of them are too ignorant and many are too afraid to see it It is the same old story of every perishing ruling class in the world s history Fat with power and possession drunken with success and made soft by surfeit and by cessation of struggle they are like the drones clustered about the honey vats when the worker bees spring upon them to end their rotund existence President Roosevelt vaguely sees the revolution is frightened by it and recoils from seeing it As he says Above all we need to remember that any kind of class animosity in the political world is if possible even more wicked even more destructive to national welfare than sectional race or religious animosity Class animosity in the political world President Roosevelt maintains is wicked But class animosity in the political world is the preachment of the revolutionists Let the class wars in the industrial world continue they say but extend the class war to the political world As their leader Eugene V Debs says So far as this struggle is concerned there is no good capitalist and no bad working man Every capitalist is your enemy and every working man is your friend Here is class animosity in the political world with a vengeance And here is revolution In eighteen eighty eight there were only two thousand revolutionists of this type in the United States in nineteen hundred there were one hundred twenty seven thousand revolutionists in nineteen oh four four hundred thirty five thousand revolutionists Wickedness of the President Roosevelt definition evidently flourishes and increases in the United States Quite so for it is the revolution that flourishes and increases Here and there a member of the capitalist class catches a clear glimpse of the revolution and raises a warning cry But his class does not heed President Eliot of Harvard raised such a cry I am forced to believe there is a present danger of socialism never before so imminent in America in so dangerous a form because never before imminent in so well organized a form The danger lies in the obtaining control of the trades unions by the socialists And the capitalist employers instead of giving heed to the warnings are perfecting their strike breaking organization and combining more strongly than ever for a general assault upon that dearest of all things to the trades unions the closed shop In so far as this assault succeeds by just that much will the capitalist class shorten its lease of life It is the old old story over again and over again The drunken drones still cluster greedily about the honey vats Possibly one of the most amusing spectacles of to day is the attitude of the American press toward the revolution It is also a pathetic spectacle It compels the onlooker to be aware of a distinct loss of pride in his species Dogmatic utterance from the mouth of ignorance may make gods laugh but it should make men weep And the American editors in the general instance are so impressive about it The old divide up men are not born free and equal propositions are enunciated gravely and sagely as things white hot and new from the forge of human wisdom Their feeble vapourings show no more than a schoolboy s comprehension of the nature of the revolution Parasites themselves on the capitalist class serving the capitalist class by moulding public opinion they too cluster drunkenly about the honey vats Of course this is true only of the large majority of American editors To say that it is true of all of them would be to cast too great obloquy upon the human race Also it would be untrue for here and there an occasional editor does see clearly and in his case ruled by stomach incentive is usually afraid to say what he thinks about it So far as the science and the sociology of the revolution are concerned the average editor is a generation or so behind the facts He is intellectually slothful accepts no facts until they are accepted by the majority and prides himself upon his conservatism He is an instinctive optimist prone to believe that what ought to be is The revolutionist gave this up long ago and believes not that what ought to be is but what is is and that it may not be what it ought to be at all Now and then rubbing his eyes vigorously an editor catches a sudden glimpse of the revolution and breaks out in naive volubility as for instance the one who wrote the following in the Chicago Chronicle American socialists are revolutionists They know that they are revolutionists It is high time that other people should appreciate the fact A white hot brand new discovery and he proceeded to shout it out from the housetops that we forsooth were revolutionists Why it is just what we have been doing all these years shouting it out from the housetops that we are revolutionists and stop us who can The time should be past for the mental attitude Revolution is atrocious Sir there is no revolution Likewise should the time be past for that other familiar attitude Socialism is slavery Sir it will never be It is no longer a question of dialectics theories and dreams There is no question about it The revolution is a fact It is here now Seven million revolutionists organized working day and night are preaching the revolution that passionate gospel the Brotherhood of Man Not only is it a cold blooded economic propaganda but it is in essence a religious propaganda with a fervour in it of Paul and Christ The capitalist class has been indicted It has failed in its management and its management is to be taken away from it Seven million men of the working class say that they are going to get the rest of the working class to join with them and take the management away The revolution is here now Stop it who can SACRAMENTO RIVER March nineteen oh five THE SOMNAMBULISTS

8820_294113_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The mightiest and absurdest sleep walker on the planet 
8820_294113_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Chained in the circle of his own imaginings man is only too keen to forget his origin and to shame that flesh of his that bleeds like all flesh and that is good to eat 
8820_294113_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Civilization which is part of the circle of his imaginings has spread a veneer over the surface of the soft shelled animal known as man 
none	none	It is a very thin veneer but so wonderfully is man constituted that he squirms on his bit of achievement and believes he is garbed in armour plate Yet man to day is the same man that drank from his enemy s skull in the dark German forests that sacked cities and stole his women from neighbouring clans like any howling aborigine 
8820_294113_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The flesh and blood body of man has not changed in the last several thousand years 
none	none	Nor has his mind changed There is no faculty of the mind of man to day that did not exist in the minds of the men of long ago 
8820_294113_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Man has to day no concept that is too wide and deep and abstract for the mind of Plato or Aristotle to grasp 
8820_294113_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Give to Plato or Aristotle the same fund of knowledge that man to day has access to and Plato and Aristotle would reason as profoundly as the man of to day and would achieve very similar conclusions 
none	none	It is the same old animal man smeared over it is true with a veneer thin and magical that makes him dream drunken dreams of self exaltation and to sneer at the flesh and the blood of him beneath the smear 
8820_294113_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The raw animal crouching within him is like the earthquake monster pent in the crust of the earth 
8820_294113_000005_000002	train-clean-360	As he persuades himself against the latter till it arouses and shakes down a city so does he persuade himself against the former until it shakes him out of his dreaming and he stands undisguised a brute like any other brute 
none	none	Starve him let him miss six meals and see gape through the veneer the hungry maw of the animal beneath Get between him and the female of his kind upon whom his mating instinct is bent and see his eyes blaze like an angry cat s hear in his throat the scream of wild stallions and watch his fists clench like an orang outang s Maybe he will even beat his chest Touch his silly vanity which he exalts into high sounding pride call him a liar and behold the red animal in him that makes a hand clutching that is quick like the tensing of a tiger s claw or an eagle s talon incarnate with desire to rip and tear 
8820_294113_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It is not necessary to call him a liar to touch his vanity

8820_294113_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The raw animals beneath are identical 
8820_294113_000008_000000	train-clean-360	But intrude not violently upon man leave him alone in his somnambulism and he kicks out from under his feet the ladder of life up which he has climbed constitutes himself the centre of the universe dreams sordidly about his own particular god and maunders metaphysically about his own blessed immortality 
8820_294113_000009_000000	train-clean-360	True he lives in a real world breathes real air eats real food and sleeps under real blankets in order to keep real cold away 
8820_294113_000009_000001	train-clean-360	And there s the rub 
none	none	He has to effect adjustments with the real world and at the same time maintain the sublimity of his dream 
8820_294113_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The result of this admixture of the real and the unreal is confusion thrice confounded 
none	none	The man that walks the real world in his sleep becomes such a tangled mass of contradictions paradoxes and lies that he has to lie to himself in order to stay asleep In passing it may be noted that some men are remarkably constituted in this matter of self deception They excel at deceiving themselves They believe and they help others to believe It becomes their function in society and some of them are paid large salaries for helping their fellow men to believe for instance that they are not as other animals for helping the king to believe and his parasites and drudges as well that he is God s own manager over so many square miles of earth crust for helping the merchant and banking classes to believe that society rests on their shoulders and that civilization would go to smash if they got out from under and ceased from their exploitations and petty pilferings 
8820_294113_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Prize fighting is terrible 
8820_294113_000011_000001	train-clean-360	This is the dictum of the man who walks in his sleep 
8820_294113_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He prates about it and writes to the papers about it and worries the legislators about it 
none	none	There is nothing of the brute about him He is a sublimated soul that treads the heights and breathes refined ether in self comparison with the prize fighter 
8820_294113_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The man who walks in his sleep ignores the flesh and all its wonderful play of muscle joint and nerve 
none	none	He feels that there is something godlike in the mysterious deeps of his being denies his relationship with the brute and proceeds to go forth into the world and express by deeds that something godlike within him He sits at a desk and chases dollars through the weeks and months and years of his life To him the life godlike resolves into a problem something like this Since the great mass of men toil at producing wealth how best can he get between the great mass of men and the wealth they produce and get a slice for himself 
8820_294113_000012_000002	train-clean-360	With tremendous exercise of craft deceit and guile he devotes his life godlike to this purpose 
8820_294113_000012_000003	train-clean-360	As he succeeds his somnambulism grows profound 
none	none	He bribes legislatures buys judges controls primaries and then goes and hires other men to tell him that it is all glorious and right 
8820_294113_000012_000005	train-clean-360	And the funniest thing about it is that this arch deceiver believes all that they tell him 
8820_294113_000012_000006	train-clean-360	He reads only the newspapers and magazines that tell him what he wants to be told listens only to the biologists who tell him that he is the finest product of the struggle for existence and herds only with his own kind where like the monkey folk they teeter up and down and tell one another how great they are 
8820_294113_000013_000000	train-clean-360	In the course of his life godlike he ignores the flesh until he gets to table 
none	none	He raises his hands in horror at the thought of the brutish prize fighter and then sits down and gorges himself on roast beef rare and red running blood under every sawing thrust of the implement called a knife 
8820_294113_000013_000002	train-clean-360	He has a piece of cloth which he calls a napkin with which he wipes from his lips and from the hair on his lips the greasy juices of the meat 
8820_294113_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He is fastidiously nauseated at the thought of two prize fighters bruising each other with their fists and at the same time because it will cost him some money he will refuse to protect the machines in his factory though he is aware that the lack of such protection every year mangles batters and destroys out of all humanness thousands of working men women and children 
8820_294113_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He will chatter about things refined and spiritual and godlike like himself and he and the men who herd with him will calmly adulterate the commodities they put upon the market and which annually kill tens of thousands of babies and young children 
none	none	He will recoil at the suggestion of the horrid spectacle of two men confronting each other with gloved hands in the roped arena and at the same time he will clamour for larger armies and larger navies for more destructive war machines which with a single discharge will disrupt and rip to pieces more human beings than have died in the whole history of prize fighting He will bribe a city council for a franchise or a state legislature for a commercial privilege but he has never been known in all his sleep walking history to bribe any legislative body in order to achieve any moral end such as for instance abolition of prize fighting child labour laws pure food bills or old age pensions
8820_294113_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah but we do not stand for the commercial life object the refined scholarly and professional men 
none	none	They are also sleep walkers 
8820_294113_000016_000002	train-clean-360	They do not stand for the commercial life but neither do they stand against it with all their strength 
none	none	They submit to it to the brutality and carnage of it 
8820_294113_000016_000004	train-clean-360	They develop classical economists who announce that the only possible way for men and women to get food and shelter is by the existing method 
none	none	They produce university professors men who claim the role of teachers and who at the same time claim that the austere ideal of learning is passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence They serve the men who lead the commercial life give to their sons somnambulistic educations preach that sleep walking is the only way to walk and that the persons who walk otherwise are atavisms or anarchists 
8820_294113_000016_000007	train-clean-360	They paint pictures for the commercial men write books for them sing songs for them act plays for them and dose them with various drugs when their bodies have grown gross or dyspeptic from overeating and lack of exercise 
none	none	Then there are the good kind somnambulists who don t prize fight who don t play the commercial game who don t teach and preach somnambulism who don t do anything except live on the dividends that are coined out of the wan white fluid that runs in the veins of little children out of mothers tears the blood of strong men and the groans and sighs of the old The receiver is as bad as the thief ay and the thief is finer than the receiver he at least has the courage to run the risk 
8820_294113_000017_000002	train-clean-360	But the good kind people who don t do anything won t believe this and the assertion will make them angry for a moment 
8820_294113_000017_000003	train-clean-360	They possess several magic phrases which are like the incantations of a voodoo doctor driving devils away 
8820_294113_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The phrases that the good kind people repeat to themselves and to one another sound like abstinence temperance thrift virtue Sometimes they say them backward when they sound like prodigality drunkenness wastefulness and immorality They do not really know the meaning of these phrases but they think they do and that is all that is necessary for somnambulists 
none	none	The calm repetition of such phrases invariably drives away the waking devils and lulls to slumber Our statesmen sell themselves and their country for gold Our municipal servants and state legislators commit countless treasons 
8820_294113_000018_000002	train-clean-360	The world of graft 
none	none	The world of betrayal 
8820_294113_000018_000004	train-clean-360	The world of somnambulism whose exalted and sensitive citizens are outraged by the knockouts of the prize ring and who annually not merely knock out but kill thousands of babies and children by means of child labour and adulterated food 
8820_294113_000018_000005	train-clean-360	Far better to have the front of one s face pushed in by the fist of an honest prize fighter than to have the lining of one s stomach corroded by the embalmed beef of a dishonest manufacturer 
8820_294113_000019_000000	train-clean-360	In a prize fight men are classed 
none	none	A lightweight fights with a light weight he never fights with a heavy weight and foul blows are not allowed 
8820_294113_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Yet in the world of the somnambulists where soar the sublimated spirits there are no classes and foul blows are continually struck and never disallowed 
8820_294113_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Only they are not called foul blows 
8820_294113_000019_000004	train-clean-360	The world of claw and fang and fist and club has passed away so say the somnambulists 
none	none	A rebate is not an elongated claw 
8820_294113_000019_000006	train-clean-360	A Wall Street raid is not a fang slash 
8820_294113_000019_000007	train-clean-360	Dummy boards of directors and fake accountings are not foul blows of the fist under the belt 
8820_294113_000019_000008	train-clean-360	A present of coal stock by a mine operator to a railroad official is not a claw rip to the bowels of a rival mine operator 
none	none	The hundred million dollars with which a combination beats down to his knees a man with a million dollars is not a club 
8820_294113_000019_000010	train-clean-360	The man who walks in his sleep says it is not a club 
none	none	So say all of his kind with which he herds 
8820_294113_000019_000012	train-clean-360	They gather together and solemnly and gloatingly make and repeat certain noises that sound like discretion acumen initiative enterprise These noises are especially gratifying when they are made backward 
8820_294113_000019_000013	train-clean-360	They mean the same things but they sound different 
8820_294113_000019_000014	train-clean-360	And in either case forward or backward the spirit of the dream is not disturbed 
none	none	When a man strikes a foul blow in the prize ring the fight is immediately stopped he is declared the loser and he is hissed by the audience as he leaves the ring But when a man who walks in his sleep strikes a foul blow he is immediately declared the victor and awarded the prize and amid acclamations he forthwith turns his prize into a seat in the United States Senate into a grotesque palace on Fifth Avenue and into endowed churches universities and libraries to say nothing of subsidized newspapers to proclaim his greatness The red animal in the somnambulist will out He decries the carnal combat of the prize ring and compels the red animal to spiritual combat The poisoned lie the nasty gossiping tongue the brutality of the unkind epigram the business and social nastiness and treachery of to day these are the thrusts and scratches of the red animal when the somnambulist is in charge They are not the upper cuts and short arm jabs and jolts and slugging blows of the spirit 
8820_294113_000021_000003	train-clean-360	They are the foul blows of the spirit that have never been disbarred as the foul blows of the prize ring have been disbarred Would it not be preferable for a man to strike one full on the mouth with his fist than for him to tell a lie about one or malign those that are nearest and dearest 
none	none	For these are the crimes of the spirit and alas they are so much more frequent than blows on the mouth And whosoever exalts the spirit over the flesh by his own creed avers that a crime of the spirit is vastly more terrible than a crime of the flesh Thus stand the somnambulists convicted by their own creed only they are not real men alive and awake and they proceed to mutter magic phrases that dispel all doubt as to their undiminished and eternal gloriousness 
8820_294113_000023_000000	train-clean-360	It is well enough to let the ape and tiger die but it is hardly fair to kill off the natural and courageous apes and tigers and allow the spawn of cowardly apes and tigers to live 
8820_294113_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The prize fighting apes and tigers will die all in good time in the course of natural evolution but they will not die so long as the cowardly somnambulistic apes and tigers club and scratch and slash 
8820_294113_000023_000002	train-clean-360	This is not a brief for the prize fighter 
none	none	It is a blow of the fist between the eyes of the somnambulists teetering up and down muttering magic phrases and thanking God that they are not as other animals GLEN ELLEN CALIFORNIA June nineteen hundred THE DIGNITY OF DOLLARS Man is a blind helpless creature He looks back with pride upon his goodly heritage of the ages and yet obeys unwittingly every mandate of that heritage for it is incarnate with him and in it are embedded the deepest roots of his soul 
8820_294114_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Strive as he will he cannot escape it unless he be a genius one of those rare creations to whom alone is granted the privilege of doing entirely new and original things in entirely new and original ways 
8820_294114_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But the common clay born man possessing only talents may do only what has been done before him 
8820_294114_000004_000004	train-clean-360	At the best if he work hard and cherish himself exceedingly he may duplicate any or all previous performances of his kind he may even do some of them better but there he stops the composite hand of his whole ancestry bearing heavily upon him 
none	none	And again in the matter of his ideas which have been thrust upon him and which he has been busily garnering from the great world ever since the day when his eyes first focussed and he drew startled against the warm breast of his mother the tyranny of these he cannot shake off Servants of his will they at the same time master him They may not coerce genius but they dictate and sway every action of the clay born If he hesitate on the verge of a new departure they whip him back into the well greased groove if he pause bewildered at sight of some unexplored domain they rise like ubiquitous finger posts and direct him by the village path to the communal meadow 
8820_294114_000005_000002	train-clean-360	And he permits these things and continues to permit them for he cannot help them and he is a slave Out of his ideas he may weave cunning theories beautiful ideals but he is working with ropes of sand 
none	none	At the slightest stress the last least bit of cohesion flits away and each idea flies apart from its fellows while all clamour that he do this thing or think this thing in the ancient and time honoured way

none	none	He knows further that the clay born are a pitiful pitiless majority and that he may do nothing which they do not do It is only in some way such as this that we may understand and explain the dignity which attaches itself to dollars 
8820_294114_000006_000001	train-clean-360	In the watches of the night we may assure ourselves that there is no such dignity but jostling with our fellows in the white light of day we find that it does exist and that we ourselves measure ourselves by the dollars we happen to possess 
none	none	They give us confidence and carriage and dignity ay a personal dignity which goes down deeper than the garments with which we hide our nakedness The world when it knows nothing else of him measures a man by his clothes but the man himself if he be neither a genius nor a philosopher but merely a clay born measures himself by his pocket book He cannot help it and can no more fling it from him than can the bashful young man his self consciousness when crossing a ballroom floor 
8820_294114_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I remember once absenting myself from civilization for weary months When I returned it was to a strange city in another country 
none	none	The people were but slightly removed from my own breed and they spoke the same tongue barring a certain barbarous accent which I learned was far older than the one imbibed by me with my mother s milk 
8820_294114_000007_000002	train-clean-360	A fur cap soiled and singed by many camp fires half sheltered the shaggy tendrils of my uncut hair 
8820_294114_000007_000003	train-clean-360	My foot gear was of walrus hide cunningly blended with seal gut The remainder of my dress was as primal and uncouth 
8820_294114_000007_000004	train-clean-360	I was a sight to give merriment to gods and men 
8820_294114_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Olympus must have roared at my coming The world knowing me not could judge me by my clothes alone 
8820_294114_000007_000006	train-clean-360	But I refused to be so judged 
none	none	My spiritual backbone stiffened and I held my head high looking all men in the eyes 
8820_294114_000007_000008	train-clean-360	And I did these things not that I was an egotist not that I was impervious to the critical glances of my fellows but because of a certain hogskin belt plethoric and sweat bewrinkled which buckled next the skin above the hips 
8820_294114_000007_000009	train-clean-360	Oh it s absurd I grant but had that belt not been so circumstanced and so situated I should have shrunk away into side streets and back alleys walking humbly and avoiding all gregarious humans except those who were likewise abroad without belts 
none	none	Why 
8820_294114_000007_000011	train-clean-360	I do not know save that in such way did my fathers before me 
none	none	Viewed in the light of sober reason the whole thing was preposterous But I walked down the gang plank with the mien of a hero of a barbarian who knew himself to be greater than the civilization he invaded 
8820_294114_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I was possessed of the arrogance of a Roman governor 
8820_294114_000008_000002	train-clean-360	At last I knew what it was to be born to the purple and I took my seat in the hotel carriage as though it were my chariot about to proceed with me to the imperial palace 
8820_294114_000008_000003	train-clean-360	People discreetly dropped their eyes before my proud gaze and into their hearts I know I forced the query What manner of man can this mortal be 
8820_294114_000008_000004	train-clean-360	I was superior to convention and the very garb which otherwise would have damned me tended toward my elevation 
none	none	And all this was due not to my royal lineage nor to the deeds I had done and the champions I had overthrown but to a certain hogskin belt buckled next the skin 
8820_294114_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The sweat of months was upon it toil had defaced it and it was not a creation such as would appeal to the aesthetic mind but it was plethoric 
none	none	There was the arcanum each yellow grain conduced to my exaltation and the sum of these grains was the sum of my mightiness Had they been less just so would have been my stature more and I should have reached the sky And this was my royal progress through that most loyal city 
8820_294114_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I purchased a host of things from the tradespeople and bought me such pleasures and diversions as befitted one who had long been denied 
none	none	I scattered my gold lavishly nor did I chaffer over prices in mart or exchange 
8820_294114_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And because of these things I did I demanded homage 
8820_294114_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Nor was it refused 
8820_294114_000009_000005	train-clean-360	I moved through wind swept groves of limber backs across sunny glades lighted by the beaming rays from a thousand obsequious eyes and when I tired of this basked on the greensward of popular approval 
8820_294114_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Money was very good I thought and for the time was content 
8820_294114_000009_000007	train-clean-360	But there rushed upon me the words of Erasmus When I get some money I shall buy me some Greek books and afterwards some clothes and a great shame wrapped me around 
8820_294114_000009_000008	train-clean-360	But luckily for my soul s welfare I reflected and was saved By the clearer vision vouchsafed me I beheld Erasmus fire flashing heaven born while I I was merely a clay born a son of earth 
8820_294114_000009_000009	train-clean-360	For a giddy moment I had forgotten this and tottered 
none	none	And I rolled over on my greensward caught a glimpse of a regiment of undulating backs and thanked my particular gods that such moods of madness were passing brief But on another day receiving with kingly condescension the service of my good subjects backs I remembered the words of another man long since laid away who was by birth a nobleman by nature a philosopher and a gentleman and who by circumstance yielded up his head upon the block That a man of lead he once remarked who has no more sense than a log of wood and is as bad as he is foolish should have many wise and good men to serve him only because he has a great heap of that metal and that if by some accident or trick of law which sometimes produces as great changes as chance itself all this wealth should pass from the master to the meanest varlet of his whole family he himself would very soon become one of his servants as if he were a thing that belonged to his wealth and so was bound to follow its fortune And when I had remembered this much I unwisely failed to pause and reflect So I gathered my belongings together cinched my hogskin belt tight about me and went away to my own country

8820_294114_000012_000005	train-clean-360	From my window I could descry at no great distance a very ordinary mortal of a man working industriously among his cabbages 
none	none	I thought Here am I capable of teaching him much concerning the field wherein he labours the nitrogenic why of the fertilizer the alchemy of the sun the microscopic cell structure of the plant the cryptic chemistry of root and runner but thereat he straightened his work wearied back and rested His eyes wandered over what he had produced in the sweat of his brow then on to mine

8820_294114_000013_000005	train-clean-360	I gathered together certain certificates of goods and chattels pointed my heel towards him and his cabbages and journeyed townward

Francisco awoke to read in one of its daily papers a curious letter which had been received by Walter Bassett and which had evidently been written by some crank Walter Bassett was the greatest captain of industry west of the Rockies and was one of the small group that controlled the nation in everything but name As such he was the recipient of lucubrations from countless cranks but this particular lucubration was so different from the average ruck of similar letters that instead of putting it into the waste basket he had turned it over to a reporter It was signed Goliah and the superscription gave his address as Palgrave Island The letter was as follows mister WALTER BASSETT DEAR SIR I am inviting you with nine of your fellow captains of industry to visit me here on my island for the purpose of considering plans for the reconstruction of society upon a more rational basis Up to the present social evolution has been a blind and aimless blundering thing The time has come for a change Man has risen from the vitalized slime of the primeval sea to the mastery of matter but he has not yet mastered society Man is to day as much the slave to his collective stupidity as a hundred thousand generations ago he was a slave to matter There are two theoretical methods whereby man may become the master of society and make of society an intelligent and efficacious device for the pursuit and capture of happiness and laughter The first theory advances the proposition that no government can be wiser or better than the people that compose that government that reform and development must spring from the individual that in so far as the individuals become wiser and better by that much will their government become wiser and better in short that the majority of individuals must become wiser and better before their government becomes wiser and better The mob the political convention the abysmal brutality and stupid ignorance of all concourses of people give the lie to this theory In a mob the collective intelligence and mercy is that of the least intelligent and most brutal members that compose the mob On the other hand a thousand passengers will surrender themselves to the wisdom and discretion of the captain when their ship is in a storm on the sea In such matter he is the wisest and most experienced among them The second theory advances the proposition that the majority of the people are not pioneers that they are weighted down by the inertia of the established that the government that is representative of them represents only their feebleness and futility and brutishness that this blind thing called government is not the serf of their wills but that they are the serfs of it in short speaking always of the great mass that they do not make government but that government makes them and that government is and has been a stupid and awful monster misbegotten of the glimmerings of intelligence that come from the inertia crushed mass Personally I incline to the second theory Also I am impatient For a hundred thousand generations from the first social groups of our savage forbears government has remained a monster To day the inertia crushed mass has less laughter in it than ever before In spite of man s mastery of matter human suffering and misery and degradation mar the fair world Wherefore I have decided to step in and become captain of this world ship for a while I have the intelligence and the wide vision of the skilled expert Also I have the power I shall be obeyed The men of all the world shall perform my bidding and make governments so that they shall become laughter producers These modelled governments I have in mind shall not make the people happy wise and noble by decree but they shall give opportunity for the people to become happy wise and noble I have spoken I have invited you and nine of your fellow captains to confer with me On March third the yacht Energon will sail from San Francisco You are requested to be on board the night before This is serious The affairs of the world must be handled for a time by a strong hand Mine is that strong hand If you fail to obey my summons you will die Candidly I do not expect that you will obey But your death for failure to obey will cause obedience on the part of those I subsequently summon You will have served a purpose And please remember that I have no unscientific sentimentality about the value of human life I carry always in the background of my consciousness the innumerable billions of lives that are to laugh and be happy in future aeons on the earth Yours for the reconstruction of society GOLIAH The publication of this letter did not cause even local amusement Men might have smiled to themselves as they read it but it was so palpably the handiwork of a crank that it did not merit discussion Interest did not arouse till next morning An Associated Press despatch to the Eastern states followed by interviews by eager nosed reporters had brought out the names of the other nine captains of industry who had received similar letters but who had not thought the matter of sufficient importance to be made public But the interest aroused was mild and it would have died out quickly had not Gabberton cartooned a chronic presidential aspirant as Goliah Then came the song that was sung hilariously from sea to sea with the refrain Goliah will catch you if you don t watch out The weeks passed and the incident was forgotten Walter Bassett had forgotten it likewise but on the evening of February twenty two he was called to the telephone by the Collector of the Port I just wanted to tell you said the latter that the yacht Energon has arrived and gone to anchor in the stream off Pier Seven What happened that night Walter Bassett has never divulged But it is known that he rode down in his auto to the water front chartered one of Crowley s launches and was put aboard the strange yacht It is further known that when he returned to the shore three hours later he immediately despatched a sheaf of telegrams to his nine fellow captains of industry who had received letters from Goliah These telegrams were similarly worded and read The yacht Energon has arrived There is something in this I advise you to come Bassett was laughed at for his pains It was a huge laugh that went up for his telegrams had been made public and the popular song on Goliah revived and became more popular than ever Goliah and Bassett were cartooned and lampooned unmercifully the former as the Old Man of the Sea riding on the latter s neck The laugh tittered and rippled through clubs and social circles was restrainedly merry in the editorial columns and broke out in loud guffaws in the comic weeklies There was a serious side as well and Bassett s sanity was gravely questioned by many and especially by his business associates Bassett had ever been a short tempered man and after he sent the second sheaf of telegrams to his brother captains and had been laughed at again he remained silent In this second sheaf he had said Come I implore you As you value your life come He arranged all his business affairs for an absence and on the night of March two went on board the Energon The latter properly cleared sailed next morning And next morning the newsboys in every city and town were crying Extra In the slang of the day Goliah had delivered the goods The nine captains of industry who had failed to accept his invitation were dead A sort of violent disintegration of the tissues was the report of the various autopsies held on the bodies of the slain millionaires yet the surgeons and physicians the most highly skilled in the land had participated would not venture the opinion that the men had been slain Much less would they venture the conclusion at the hands of parties unknown It was all too mysterious They were stunned Their scientific credulity broke down They had no warrant in the whole domain of science for believing that an anonymous person on Palgrave Island had murdered the poor gentlemen One thing was quickly learned however namely that Palgrave Island was no myth It was charted and well known to all navigators lying on the line of one hundred sixty west longitude right at its intersection by the tenth parallel north latitude and only a few miles away from Diana Shoal Like Midway and Fanning Palgrave Island was isolated volcanic and coral in formation Furthermore it was uninhabited A survey ship in eighteen eighty seven had visited the place and reported the existence of several springs and of a good harbour that was very dangerous of approach And that was all that was known of the tiny speck of land that was soon to have focussed on it the awed attention of the world Goliah remained silent till March twenty four On the morning of that day the newspapers published his second letter copies of which had been received by the ten chief politicians of the United States ten leading men in the political world who were conventionally known as statesmen The letter with the same superscription as before was as follows DEAR SIR I have spoken in no uncertain tone I must be obeyed You may consider this an invitation or a summons but if you still wish to tread this earth and laugh you will be aboard the yacht Energon in San Francisco harbour not later than the evening of April five It is my wish and my will that you confer with me here on Palgrave Island in the matter of reconstructing society upon some rational basis Do not misunderstand me when I tell you that I am one with a theory I want to see that theory work and therefore I call upon your cooperation In this theory of mine lives are but pawns I deal with quantities of lives I am after laughter and those that stand in the way of laughter must perish The game is big There are fifteen hundred million human lives to day on the planet What is your single life against them It is as naught in my theory And remember that mine is the power Remember that I am a scientist and that one life or one million of lives mean nothing to me as arrayed against the countless billions of billions of the lives of the generations to come It is for their laughter that I seek to reconstruct society now and against them your own meagre little life is a paltry thing indeed Whoso has power can command his fellows By virtue of that military device known as the phalanx Alexander conquered his bit of the world By virtue of that chemical device gunpowder Cortes with his several hundred cut throats conquered the empire of the Montezumas Now I am in possession of a device that is all my own In the course of a century not more than half a dozen fundamental discoveries or inventions are made I have made such an invention The possession of it gives me the mastery of the world I shall use this invention not for commercial exploitation but for the good of humanity For that purpose I want help willing agents obedient hands and I am strong enough to compel the service I am taking the shortest way though I am in no hurry I shall not clutter my speed with haste The incentive of material gain developed man from the savage to the semi barbarian he is to day This incentive has been a useful device for the development of the human but it has now fulfilled its function and is ready to be cast aside into the scrap heap of rudimentary vestiges such as gills in the throat and belief in the divine right of kings Of course you do not think so but I do not see that that will prevent you from aiding me to fling the anachronism into the scrap heap For I tell you now that the time has come when mere food and shelter and similar sordid things shall be automatic as free and easy and involuntary of access as the air I shall make them automatic what of my discovery and the power that discovery gives me And with food and shelter automatic the incentive of material gain passes away from the world for ever With food and shelter automatic the higher incentives will universally obtain the spiritual aesthetic and intellectual incentives that will tend to develop and make beautiful and noble body mind and spirit Then all the world will be dominated by happiness and laughter It will be the reign of universal laughter Yours for that day GOLIAH Still the world would not believe The ten politicians were at Washington so that they did not have the opportunity of being convinced that Bassett had had and not one of them took the trouble to journey out to San Francisco to make the opportunity As for Goliah he was hailed by the newspapers as another Tom Lawson with a panacea and there were specialists in mental disease who by analysis of Goliah s letters proved conclusively that he was a lunatic The yacht Energon arrived in the harbour of San Francisco on the afternoon of April five and Bassett came ashore But the Energon did not sail next day for not one of the ten summoned politicians had elected to make the journey to Palgrave Island The newsboys however called Extra that day in all the cities The ten politicians were dead The yacht lying peacefully at anchor in the harbour became the centre of excited interest She was surrounded by a flotilla of launches and rowboats and many tugs and steamboats ran excursions to her While the rabble was firmly kept off the proper authorities and even reporters were permitted to board her The mayor of San Francisco and the chief of police reported that nothing suspicious was to be seen upon her and the port authorities announced that her papers were correct and in order in every detail Many photographs and columns of descriptive matter were run in the newspapers The crew was reported to be composed principally of Scandinavians fair haired blue eyed Swedes Norwegians afflicted with the temperamental melancholy of their race stolid Russian Finns and a slight sprinkling of Americans and English It was noted that there was nothing mercurial and flyaway about them They seemed weighty men oppressed by a sad and stolid bovine sort of integrity A sober seriousness and enormous certitude characterized all of them They appeared men without nerves and without fear as though upheld by some overwhelming power or carried in the hollow of some superhuman hand The captain a sad eyed strong featured American was cartooned in the papers as Gloomy Gus the pessimistic hero of the comic supplement Some sea captain recognized the Energon as the yacht Scud once owned by Merrivale of the New York Yacht Club With this clue it was soon ascertained that the Scud had disappeared several years before The agent who sold her reported the purchaser to be merely another agent a man he had seen neither before nor since The yacht had been reconstructed at Duffey s Shipyard in New Jersey The change in her name and registry occurred at that time and had been legally executed Then the Energon had disappeared in the shroud of mystery In the meantime Bassett was going crazy at least his friends and business associates said so He kept away from his vast business enterprises and said that he must hold his hands until the other masters of the world could join with him in the reconstruction of society proof indubitable that Goliah s bee had entered his bonnet To reporters he had little to say He was not at liberty he said to relate what he had seen on Palgrave Island but he could assure them that the matter was serious the most serious thing that had ever happened His final word was that the world was on the verge of a turnover for good or ill he did not know but one way or the other he was absolutely convinced that the turnover was coming As for business business could go hang He had seen things he had and that was all there was to it There was a great telegraphing during this period between the local Federal officials and the state and war departments at Washington A secret attempt was made late one afternoon to board the Energon and place the captain under arrest the Attorney General having given the opinion that the captain could be held for the murder of the ten statesmen The government launch was seen to leave Meigg s Wharf and steer for the Energon and that was the last ever seen of the launch and the men on board of it The government tried to keep the affair hushed up but the cat was slipped out of the bag by the families of the missing men and the papers were filled with monstrous versions of the affair The government now proceeded to extreme measures The battleship Alaska was ordered to capture the strange yacht or failing that to sink her These were secret instructions but thousands of eyes from the water front and from the shipping in the harbour witnessed what happened that afternoon The battleship got under way and steamed slowly toward the Energon At half a mile distant the battleship blew up simply blew up that was all her shattered frame sinking to the bottom of the bay a riff raff of wreckage and a few survivors strewing the surface Among the survivors was a young lieutenant who had had charge of the wireless on board the Alaska The reporters got hold of him first and he talked No sooner had the Alaska got under way he said than a message was received from the Energon It was in the international code and it was a warning to the Alaska to come no nearer than half a mile He had sent the message through the speaking tube immediately to the captain He did not know anything more except that the Energon twice repeated the message and that five minutes afterward the explosion occurred The captain of the Alaska had perished with his ship and nothing more was to be learned The Energon however promptly hoisted anchor and cleared out to sea A great clamour was raised by the papers the government was charged with cowardice and vacillation in its dealings with a mere pleasure yacht and a lunatic who called himself Goliah and immediate and decisive action was demanded Also a great cry went up about the loss of life especially the wanton killing of the ten statesmen Goliah promptly replied In fact so prompt was his reply that the experts in wireless telegraphy announced that since it was impossible to send wireless messages so great a distance Goliah was in their very midst and not on Palgrave Island Goliah s letter was delivered to the Associated Press by a messenger boy who had been engaged on the street The letter was as follows What are a few paltry lives In your insane wars you destroy millions of lives and think nothing of it In your fratricidal commercial struggle you kill countless babes women and men and you triumphantly call the shambles individualism I call it anarchy I am going to put a stop to your wholesale destruction of human beings I want laughter not slaughter Those of you who stand in the way of laughter will get slaughter Your government is trying to delude you into believing that the destruction of the Alaska was an accident Know here and now that it was by my orders that the Alaska was destroyed In a few short months all battleships on all seas will be destroyed or flung to the scrap heap and all nations shall disarm fortresses shall be dismantled armies disbanded and warfare shall cease from the earth Mine is the power I am the will of God The whole world shall be in vassalage to me but it shall be a vassalage of peace I am GOLIAH Blow Palgrave Island out of the water was the head line retort of the newspapers The government was of the same frame of mind and the assembling of the fleets began Walter Bassett broke out in ineffectual protest but was swiftly silenced by the threat of a lunacy commission Goliah remained silent Against Palgrave Island five great fleets were hurled the Asiatic Squadron the South Pacific Squadron the North Pacific Squadron the Caribbean Squadron and half of the North Atlantic Squadron the two latter coming through the Panama Canal I have the honour to report that we sighted Palgrave Island on the evening of April twenty nine ran the report of Captain Johnson of the battleship North Dakota to the Secretary of the Navy The Asiatic Squadron was delayed and did not arrive until the morning of April thirty A council of the admirals was held and it was decided to attack early next morning The destroyer Swift VII crept in unmolested and reported no warlike preparations on the island It noted several small merchant steamers in the harbour and the existence of a small village in a hopelessly exposed position that could be swept by our fire It had been decided that all the vessels should rush in scattered upon the island opening fire at three miles and continuing to the edge of the reef there to retain loose formation and engage Palgrave Island repeatedly warned us by wireless in the international code to keep outside the ten mile limit but no heed was paid to the warnings The North Dakota did not take part in the movement of the morning of May one This was due to a slight accident of the preceding night that temporarily disabled her steering gear The morning of May one broke clear and calm There was a slight breeze from the south west that quickly died away The North Dakota lay twelve miles off the island At the signal the squadrons charged in upon the island from all sides at full speed Our wireless receiver continued to tick off warnings from the island The ten mile limit was passed and nothing happened I watched through my glasses At five miles nothing happened at four miles nothing happened at three miles the New York in the lead on our side of the island opened fire She fired only one shot Then she blew up The rest of the vessels never fired a shot They began to blow up everywhere before our eyes Several swerved about and started back but they failed to escape The destroyer Dart XXX nearly made the ten mile limit when she blew up She was the last survivor No harm came to the North Dakota and that night the steering gear being repaired I gave orders to sail for San Francisco To say that the United States was stunned is but to expose the inadequacy of language The whole world was stunned It confronted that blight of the human brain the unprecedented Human endeavour was a jest a monstrous futility when a lunatic on a lonely island who owned a yacht and an exposed village could destroy five of the proudest fleets of Christendom And how had he done it Nobody knew The scientists lay down in the dust of the common road and wailed and gibbered They did not know Military experts committed suicide by scores The mighty fabric of warfare they had fashioned was a gossamer veil rent asunder by a miserable lunatic It was too much for their sanity Mere human reason could not withstand the shock As the savage is crushed by the sleight of hand of the witch doctor so was the world crushed by the magic of Goliah How did he do it It was the awful face of the Unknown upon which the world gazed and by which it was frightened out of the memory of its proudest achievements But all the world was not stunned There was the invariable exception the Island Empire of Japan Drunken with the wine of success deep quaffed without superstition and without faith in aught but its own ascendant star laughing at the wreckage of science and mad with pride of race it went forth upon the way of war America s fleets had been destroyed From the battlements of heaven the multitudinous ancestral shades of Japan leaned down The opportunity God given had come The Mikado was in truth a brother to the gods The war monsters of Japan were loosed in mighty fleets The Philippines were gathered in as a child gathers a nosegay It took longer for the battleships to travel to Hawaii to Panama and to the Pacific Coast The United States was panic stricken and there arose the powerful party of dishonourable peace In the midst of the clamour the Energon arrived in San Francisco Bay and Goliah spoke once more There was a little brush as the Energon came in and a few explosions of magazines occurred along the war tunnelled hills as the coast defences went to smash Also the blowing up of the submarine mines in the Golden Gate made a remarkably fine display Goliah s message to the people of San Francisco dated as usual from Palgrave Island was published in the papers It ran Peace Peace be with you You shall have peace I have spoken to this purpose before And give you me peace Leave my yacht Energon alone Commit one overt act against her and not one stone in San Francisco shall stand upon another To morrow let all good citizens go out upon the hills that slope down to the sea Go with music and laughter and garlands Make festival for the new age that is dawning Be like children upon your hills and witness the passing of war Do not miss the opportunity It is your last chance to behold what henceforth you will be compelled to seek in museums of antiquities I promise you a merry day GOLIAH The madness of magic was in the air With the people it was as if all their gods had crashed and the heavens still stood Order and law had passed away from the universe but the sun still shone the wind still blew the flowers still bloomed that was the amazing thing about it That water should continue to run downhill was a miracle All the stabilities of the human mind and human achievement were crumbling The one stable thing that remained was Goliah a madman on an island And so it was that the whole population of San Francisco went forth next day in colossal frolic upon the hills that overlooked the sea Brass bands and banners went forth brewery wagons and Sunday school picnics all the strange heterogeneous groupings of swarming metropolitan life On the sea rim rose the smoke from the funnels of a hundred hostile vessels of war all converging upon the helpless undefended Golden Gate And not all undefended for out through the Golden Gate moved the Energon a tiny toy of white rolling like a straw in the stiff sea on the bar where a strong ebb tide ran in the teeth of the summer sea breeze But the Japanese were cautious Their thirty and forty thousand ton battleships slowed down half a dozen miles offshore and manoeuvred in ponderous evolutions while tiny scout boats lean six funnelled destroyers ran in cutting blackly the flashing sea like so many sharks But compared with the Energon they were leviathans Compared with them the Energon was as the sword of the arch angel Michael and they the forerunners of the hosts of hell But the flashing of the sword the good people of San Francisco gathered on her hills never saw Mysterious invisible it cleaved the air and smote the mightiest blows of combat the world had ever witnessed The good people of San Francisco saw little and understood less They saw only a million and a half tons of brine cleaving thunder flinging fabrics hurled skyward and smashed back in ruin to sink into the sea It was all over in five minutes Remained upon the wide expanse of sea only the Energon rolling white and toylike on the bar Goliah spoke to the Mikado and the Elder Statesmen It was only an ordinary cable message despatched from San Francisco by the captain of the Energon but it was of sufficient moment to cause the immediate withdrawal of Japan from the Philippines and of her surviving fleets from the sea Japan the sceptical was converted She had felt the weight of Goliah s arm And meekly she obeyed when Goliah commanded her to dismantle her war vessels and to turn the metal into useful appliances for the arts of peace In all the ports navy yards machine shops and foundries of Japan tens of thousands of brown skinned artisans converted the war monsters into myriads of useful things such as ploughshares Goliah insisted on ploughshares gasolene engines bridge trusses telephone and telegraph wires steel rails locomotives and rolling stock for railways It was a world penance for a world to see and paltry indeed it made appear that earlier penance barefooted in the snow of an emperor to a pope for daring to squabble over temporal power Goliah s next summons was to the ten leading scientists of the United States This time there was no hesitancy in obeying The savants were ludicrously prompt some of them waiting in San Francisco for weeks so as not to miss the scheduled sailing date They departed on the Energon on June fifteen and while they were on the sea on the way to Palgrave Island Goliah performed another spectacular feat Germany and France were preparing to fly at each other s throats Goliah commanded peace They ignored the command tacitly agreeing to fight it out on land where it seemed safer for the belligerently inclined Goliah set the date of June nineteen for the cessation of hostile preparations Both countries mobilized their armies on June eighteen and hurled them at the common frontier And on June nineteen Goliah struck All generals war secretaries and jingo leaders in the two countries died on that day and that day two vast armies undirected like strayed sheep walked over each other s frontiers and fraternized But the great German war lord had escaped it was learned afterward by hiding in the huge safe where were stored the secret archives of his empire And when he emerged he was a very penitent war lord and like the Mikado of Japan he was set to work beating his sword blades into ploughshares and pruning hooks But in the escape of the German Emperor was discovered a great significance The scientists of the world plucked up courage got back their nerve One thing was conclusively evident Goliah s power was not magic Law still reigned in the universe Goliah s power had limitations else had the German Emperor not escaped by secretly hiding in a steel safe Many learned articles on the subject appeared in the magazines The ten scientists arrived back from Palgrave Island on July six Heavy platoons of police protected them from the reporters No they had not see Goliah they said in the one official interview that was vouchsafed but they had talked with him and they had seen things They were not permitted to state definitely all that they had seen and heard but they could say that the world was about to be revolutionized Goliah was in the possession of a tremendous discovery that placed all the world at his mercy and it was a good thing for the world that Goliah was merciful The ten scientists proceeded directly to Washington on a special train where for days they were closeted with the heads of government while the nation hung breathless on the outcome But the outcome was a long time in arriving From Washington the President issued commands to the masters and leading figures of the nation Everything was secret Day by day deputations of bankers railway lords captains of industry and Supreme Court justices arrived and when they arrived they remained The weeks dragged on and then on August twenty five began the famous issuance of proclamations Congress and the Senate company operated with the President in this while the Supreme Court justices gave their sanction and the money lords and the captains of industry agreed War was declared upon the capitalist masters of the nation Martial law was declared over the whole United States The supreme power was vested in the President In one day child labour in the whole country was abolished It was done by decree and the United States was prepared with its army to enforce its decrees In the same day all women factory workers were dismissed to their homes and all the sweat shops were closed But we cannot make profits wailed the petty capitalists Fools was the retort of Goliah As if the meaning of life were profits Give up your businesses and your profit mongering But there is nobody to buy our business they wailed Buy and sell is that all the meaning life has for you replied Goliah You have nothing to sell Turn over your little cut throating anarchistic businesses to the government so that they may be rationally organized and operated And the next day by decree the government began taking possession of all factories shops mines ships railroads and producing lands The nationalization of the means of production and distribution went on apace Here and there were sceptical capitalists of moment They were made prisoners and haled to Palgrave Island and when they returned they always acquiesced in what the government was doing A little later the journey to Palgrave Island became unnecessary When objection was made the reply of the officials was Goliah has spoken which was another way of saying He must be obeyed The captains of industry became heads of departments It was found that civil engineers for instance worked just as well in government employ as before they had worked in private employ It was found that men of high executive ability could not violate their nature They could not escape exercising their executive ability any more than a crab could escape crawling or a bird could escape flying And so it was that all the splendid force of the men who had previously worked for themselves was now put to work for the good of society The half dozen great railway chiefs company operated in the organizing of a national system of railways that was amazingly efficacious Never again was there such a thing as a car shortage These chiefs were not the Wall Street railway magnates but they were the men who formerly had done the real work while in the employ of the Wall Street magnates Wall Street was dead There was no more buying and selling and speculating Nobody had anything to buy or sell There was nothing in which to speculate Put the stock gamblers to work said Goliah give those that are young and that so desire a chance to learn useful trades Put the drummers and salesmen and advertising agents and real estate agents to work said Goliah and by hundreds of thousands the erstwhile useless middlemen and parasites went into useful occupations The four hundred thousand idle gentlemen of the country who had lived upon incomes were likewise put to work Then there were a lot of helpless men in high places who were cleared out the remarkable thing about this being that they were cleared out by their own fellows Of this class were the professional politicians whose wisdom and power consisted of manipulating machine politics and of grafting There was no longer any graft Since there were no private interests to purchase special privileges no bribes were offered to legislators and legislators for the first time legislated for the people The result was that men who were efficient not in corruption but in direction found their way into the legislatures With this rational organization of society amazing results were brought about The national day s work was eight hours and yet production increased In spite of the great permanent improvements and of the immense amount of energy consumed in systematizing the competitive chaos of society production doubled and tripled upon itself The standard of living increased and still consumption could not keep up with production The maximum working age was decreased to fifty years to forty nine years and to forty eight years The minimum working age went up from sixteen years to eighteen years The eight hour day became a seven hour day and in a few months the national working day was reduced to five hours In the meantime glimmerings were being caught not of the identity of Goliah but of how he had worked and prepared for his assuming control of the world Little things leaked out clues were followed up apparently unrelated things were pieced together Strange stories of blacks stolen from Africa were remembered of Chinese and Japanese contract coolies who had mysteriously disappeared of lonely South Sea Islands raided and their inhabitants carried away stories of yachts and merchant steamers mysteriously purchased that had disappeared and the descriptions of which remotely tallied with the crafts that had carried the Orientals and Africans and islanders away Where had Goliah got the sinews of war was the question And the surmised answer was By exploiting these stolen labourers It was they that lived in the exposed village on Palgrave Island It was the product of their toil that had purchased the yachts and merchant steamers and enabled Goliah s agents to permeate society and carry out his will And what was the product of their toil that had given Goliah the wealth necessary to realize his plans Commercial radium the newspapers proclaimed and radiyte and radiosole and argatium and argyte and the mysterious golyte that had proved so valuable in metallurgy These were the new compounds discovered in the first decade of the twentieth century the commercial and scientific use of which had become so enormous in the second decade The line of fruit boats that ran from Hawaii to San Francisco was declared to be the property of Goliah This was a surmise for no other owner could be discovered and the agents who handled the shipments of the fruit boats were only agents Since no one else owned the fruit boats then Goliah must own them The point of which is that it leaked out that the major portion of the world s supply in these precious compounds was brought to San Francisco by those very fruit boats That the whole chain of surmise was correct was proved in later years when Goliah s slaves were liberated and honourably pensioned by the international government of the world It was at that time that the seal of secrecy was lifted from the lips of his agents and higher emissaries and those that chose revealed much of the mystery of Goliah s organization and methods His destroying angels however remained for ever dumb Who the men were who went forth to the high places and killed at his bidding will be unknown to the end of time for kill they did by means of that very subtle and then mysterious force that Goliah had discovered and named Energon But at that time Energon the little giant that was destined to do the work of the world was unknown and undreamed of Only Goliah knew and he kept his secret well Even his agents who were armed with it and who in the case of the yacht Energon destroyed a mighty fleet of war ships by exploding their magazines knew not what the subtle and potent force was nor how it was manufactured They knew only one of its many uses and in that one use they had been instructed by Goliah It is now well known that radium and radiyte and radiosole and all the other compounds were by products of the manufacture of Energon by Goliah from the sunlight but at that time nobody knew what Energon was and Goliah continued to awe and rule the world One of the uses of Energon was in wireless telegraphy It was by its means that Goliah was able to communicate with his agents all over the world At that time the apparatus required by an agent was so clumsy that it could not be packed in anything less than a fair sized steamer trunk To day thanks to the improvements of Hendsoll the perfected apparatus can be carried in a coat pocket It was in December nineteen twenty four that Goliah sent out his famous Christmas Letter part of the text of which is here given So far while I have kept the rest of the nations from each other s throats I have devoted myself particularly to the United States Now I have not given to the people of the United States a rational social organization What I have done has been to compel them to make that organization themselves There is more laughter in the United States these days and there is more sense Food and shelter are no longer obtained by the anarchistic methods of so called individualism but are now wellnigh automatic And the beauty of it is that the people of the United States have achieved all this for themselves I did not achieve it for them I repeat they achieved it for themselves All that I did was to put the fear of death in the hearts of the few that sat in the high places and obstructed the coming of rationality and laughter The fear of death made those in the high places get out of the way that was all and gave the intelligence of man a chance to realize itself socially In the year that is to come I shall devote myself to the rest of the world I shall put the fear of death in the hearts of all that sit in the high places in all the nations And they will do as they have done in the United States get down out of the high places and give the intelligence of man a chance for social rationality All the nations shall tread the path the United States is now on And when all the nations are well along on that path I shall have something else for them But first they must travel that path for themselves They must demonstrate that the intelligence of mankind to day with the mechanical energy now at its disposal is capable of organizing society so that food and shelter be made automatic labour be reduced to a three hour day and joy and laughter be made universal And when that is accomplished not by me but by the intelligence of mankind then I shall make a present to the world of a new mechanical energy This is my discovery This Energon is nothing more nor less than the cosmic energy that resides in the solar rays When it is harnessed by mankind it will do the work of the world There will be no more multitudes of miners slaving out their lives in the bowels of the earth no more sooty firemen and greasy engineers All may dress in white if they so will The work of life will have become play and young and old will be the children of joy and the business of living will become joy and they will compete one with another in achieving ethical concepts and spiritual heights in fashioning pictures and songs and stories in statecraft and beauty craft in the sweat and the endeavour of the wrestler and the runner and the player of games all will compete not for sordid coin and base material reward but for the joy that shall be theirs in the development and vigour of flesh and in the development and keenness of spirit All will be joy smiths and their task shall be to beat out laughter from the ringing anvil of life And now one word for the immediate future On New Year s Day all nations shall disarm all fortresses and war ships shall be dismantled and all armies shall be disbanded GOLIAH On New Year s Day all the world disarmed The millions of soldiers and sailors and workmen in the standing armies in the navies and in the countless arsenals machine shops and factories for the manufacture of war machinery were dismissed to their homes These many millions of men as well as their costly war machinery had hitherto been supported on the back of labour They now went into useful occupations and the released labour giant heaved a mighty sigh of relief The policing of the world was left to the peace officers and was purely social whereas war had been distinctly anti social Ninety per cent of the crimes against society had been crimes against private property With the passing of private property at least in the means of production and with the organization of industry that gave every man a chance the crimes against private property practically ceased The police forces everywhere were reduced repeatedly and again and again Nearly all occasional and habitual criminals ceased voluntarily from their depredations There was no longer any need for them to commit crime They merely changed with changing conditions A smaller number of criminals was put into hospitals and cured And the remnant of the hopelessly criminal and degenerate was segregated And the courts in all countries were likewise decreased in number again and again Ninety five per cent of all civil cases had been squabbles over property conflicts of property rights lawsuits contests of wills breaches of contract bankruptcies et cetera With the passing of private property this ninety five per cent of the cases that cluttered the courts also passed The courts became shadows attenuated ghosts rudimentary vestiges of the anarchistic times that had preceded the coming of Goliah The year nineteen twenty five was a lively year in the world s history Goliah ruled the world with a strong hand Kings and emperors journeyed to Palgrave Island saw the wonders of Energon and went away with the fear of death in their hearts to abdicate thrones and crowns and hereditary licenses When Goliah spoke to politicians so called statesmen they obeyed or died He dictated universal reforms dissolved refractory parliaments and to the great conspiracy that was formed of mutinous money lords and captains of industry he sent his destroying angels The time is past for fooling he told them You are anachronisms You stand in the way of humanity To the scrap heap with you To those that protested and they were many he said This is no time for logomachy You can argue for centuries It is what you have done in the past I have no time for argument Get out of the way With the exception of putting a stop to war and of indicating the broad general plan Goliah did nothing By putting the fear of death into the hearts of those that sat in the high places and obstructed progress Goliah made the opportunity for the unshackled intelligence of the best social thinkers of the world to exert itself Goliah left all the multitudinous details of reconstruction to these social thinkers He wanted them to prove that they were able to do it and they proved it It was due to their initiative that the white plague was stamped out from the world It was due to them and in spite of a deal of protesting from the sentimentalists that all the extreme hereditary inefficients were segregated and denied marriage Goliah had nothing whatever to do with the instituting of the colleges of invention This idea originated practically simultaneously in the minds of thousands of social thinkers The time was ripe for the realization of the idea and everywhere arose the splendid institutions of invention For the first time the ingenuity of man was loosed upon the problem of simplifying life instead of upon the making of money earning devices The affairs of life such as house cleaning dish and window washing dust removing and scrubbing and clothes washing and all the endless sordid and necessary details were simplified by invention until they became automatic We of to day cannot realize the barbarously filthy and slavish lives of those that lived prior to nineteen twenty five The international government of the world was another idea that sprang simultaneously into the minds of thousands The successful realization of this idea was a surprise to many but as a surprise it was nothing to that received by the mildly protestant sociologists and biologists when irrefutable facts exploded the doctrine of Malthus With leisure and joy in the world with an immensely higher standard of living and with the enormous spaciousness of opportunity for recreation development and pursuit of beauty and nobility and all the higher attributes the birth rate fell and fell astoundingly People ceased breeding like cattle And better than that it was immediately noticeable that a higher average of children was being born The doctrine of Malthus was knocked into a cocked hat or flung to the scrap heap as Goliah would have put it All that Goliah had predicted that the intelligence of mankind could accomplish with the mechanical energy at its disposal came to pass Human dissatisfaction practically disappeared The elderly people were the great grumblers but when they were honourably pensioned by society as they passed the age limit for work the great majority ceased grumbling They found themselves better off in their idle old days under the new regime enjoying vastly more pleasure and comforts than they had in their busy and toilsome youth under the old regime The younger generation had easily adapted itself too the changed order and the very young had never known anything else The sum of human happiness had increased enormously The world had become gay and sane Even the old fogies of professors of sociology who had opposed with might and main the coming of the new regime made no complaint They were a score of times better remunerated than in the old days and they were not worked nearly so hard Besides they were busy revising sociology and writing new text books on the subject Here and there it is true there were atavisms men who yearned for the flesh pots and cannibal feasts of the old alleged individualism creatures long of teeth and savage of claw who wanted to prey upon their fellow men but they were looked upon as diseased and were treated in hospitals A small remnant however proved incurable and was confined in asylums and denied marriage Thus there was no progeny to inherit their atavistic tendencies As the years went by Goliah dropped out of the running of the world There was nothing for him to run The world was running itself and doing it smoothly and beautifully In nineteen thirty seven Goliah made his long promised present of Energon to the world He himself had devised a thousand ways in which the little giant should do the work of the world all of which he made public at the same time But instantly the colleges of invention seized upon Energon and utilized it in a hundred thousand additional ways In fact as Goliah confessed in his letter of March nineteen thirty eight the colleges of invention cleared up several puzzling features of Energon that had baffled him during the preceding years With the introduction of the use of Energon the two hour work day was cut down almost to nothing As Goliah had predicted work indeed became play And so tremendous was man s productive capacity due to Energon and the rational social utilization of it that the humblest citizen enjoyed leisure and time and opportunity for an immensely greater abundance of living than had the most favoured under the old anarchistic system Nobody had ever seen Goliah and all peoples began to clamour for their saviour to appear While the world did not minimize his discovery of Energon it was decided that greater than that was his wide social vision He was a superman a scientific superman and the curiosity of the world to see him had become wellnigh unbearable It was in nineteen forty one after much hesitancy on his part that he finally emerged from Palgrave Island He arrived on June six in San Francisco and for the first time since his retirement to Palgrave Island the world looked upon his face And the world was disappointed Its imagination had been touched An heroic figure had been made out of Goliah He was the man or the demi god rather who had turned the planet over The deeds of Alexander Caesar Genghis Khan and Napoleon were as the play of babes alongside his colossal achievements And ashore in San Francisco and through its streets stepped and rode a little old man sixty five years of age well preserved with a pink and white complexion and a bald spot on his head the size of an apple He was short sighted and wore spectacles But when the spectacles were removed his were quizzical blue eyes like a child s filled with mild wonder at the world Also his eyes had a way of twinkling accompanied by a screwing up of the face as if he laughed at the huge joke he had played upon the world trapping it in spite of itself into happiness and laughter For a scientific superman and world tyrant he had remarkable weaknesses He loved sweets and was inordinately fond of salted almonds and salted pecans especially of the latter He always carried a paper bag of them in his pocket and he had a way of saying frequently that the chemism of his nature demanded such fare Perhaps his most astonishing failing was cats He had an ineradicable aversion to that domestic animal It will be remembered that he fainted dead away with sudden fright while speaking in Brotherhood Palace when the janitor s cat walked out upon the stage and brushed against his legs But no sooner had he revealed himself to the world than he was identified Old time friends had no difficulty in recognizing him as Percival Stultz the German American who in eighteen ninety eight had worked in the Union Iron Works and who for two years at that time had been secretary of Branch three hundred sixty nine of the International Brotherhood of Machinists It was in nineteen oh one then twenty five years of age that he had taken special scientific courses at the University of California at the same time supporting himself by soliciting what was then known as life insurance His records as a student are preserved in the university museum and they are unenviable He is remembered by the professors he sat under chiefly for his absent mindedness Undoubtedly even then he was catching glimpses of the wide visions that later were to be his His naming himself Goliah and shrouding himself in mystery was his little joke he later explained As Goliah or any other thing like that he said he was able to touch the imagination of the world and turn it over but as Percival Stultz wearing side whiskers and spectacles and weighing one hundred and eighteen pounds he would have been unable to turn over a pecan not even a salted pecan But the world quickly got over its disappointment in his personal appearance and antecedents It knew him and revered him as the master mind of the ages and it loved him for himself for his quizzical short sighted eyes and the inimitable way in which he screwed up his face when he laughed it loved him for his simplicity and comradeship and warm humanness and for his fondness for salted pecans and his aversion to cats And to day in the wonder city of Asgard rises in awful beauty that monument to him that dwarfs the pyramids and all the monstrous blood stained monuments of antiquity And on that monument as all know is inscribed in imperishable bronze the prophecy and the fulfilment ALL WILL BE JOY SMITHS AND THEIR TASK SHALL BE TO BEAT OUT LAUGHTER FROM THE RINGING ANVIL OF LIFE EDITORIAL NOTE This remarkable production is the work of Harry Beckwith a student in the Lowell High School of San Francisco and it is here reproduced chiefly because of the youth of its author Far be it from our policy to burden our readers with ancient history and when it is known that Harry Beckwith was only fifteen when the fore going was written our motive will be understood Goliah won the Premier for high school composition in twenty two fifty four and last year Harry Beckwith took advantage of the privilege earned by electing to spend six months in Asgard The wealth of historical detail the atmosphere of the times and the mature style of the composition are especially noteworthy in one so young THE GOLDEN POPPY I have a poppy field That is by the grace of God and the good nature of editors I am enabled to place each month divers gold pieces into a clerical gentleman s hands and in return for said gold pieces I am each month reinvested with certain proprietary rights in a poppy field This field blazes on the rim of the Piedmont Hills Beneath lies all the world In the distance across the silver sweep of bay San Francisco smokes on her many hills like a second Rome Not far away Mount Tamalpais thrusts a rugged shoulder into the sky and midway between is the Golden Gate where sea mists love to linger From the poppy field we often see the shimmering blue of the Pacific beyond and the busy ships that go for ever out and in We shall have great joy in our poppy field said Bess Yes said I how the poor city folk will envy when they come to see us and how we will make all well again when we send them off with great golden armfuls But those things will have to come down I added pointing to numerous obtrusive notices relics of the last tenant displayed conspicuously along the boundaries and bearing each and all this legend Private Grounds No Trespassing Why should we refuse the poor city folk a ramble over our field because forsooth they have not the advantage of our acquaintance How I abhor such things said Bess the arrogant symbols of power They disgrace human nature said I They shame the generous landscape she said and they are abominable Piggish quoth I hotly Down with them We looked forward to the coming of the poppies did Bess and I looked forward as only creatures of the city may look who have been long denied I have forgotten to mention the existence of a house above the poppy field a squat and wandering bungalow in which we had elected to forsake town traditions and live in fresher and more vigorous ways The first poppies came orange yellow and golden in the standing grain and we went about gleefully as though drunken with their wine and told each other that the poppies were there We laughed at unexpected moments in the midst of silences and at times grew ashamed and stole forth secretly to gaze upon our treasury But when the great wave of poppy flame finally spilled itself down the field we shouted aloud and danced and clapped our hands freely and frankly mad And then came the Goths My face was in a lather the time of the first invasion and I suspended my razor in mid air to gaze out on my beloved field At the far end I saw a little girl and a little boy their arms filled with yellow spoil Ah thought I an unwonted benevolence burgeoning what a delight to me is their delight It is sweet that children should pick poppies in my field All summer shall they pick poppies in my field But they must be little children I added as an afterthought and they must pick from the lower end this last prompted by a glance at the great golden fellows nodding in the wheat beneath my window Then the razor descended Shaving was always an absorbing task and I did not glance out of the window again until the operation was completed And then I was bewildered Surely this was not my poppy field No and yes for there were the tall pines clustering austerely together on one side the magnolia tree burdened with bloom and the Japanese quinces splashing the driveway hedge with blood Yes it was the field but no wave of poppy flame spilled down it nor did the great golden fellows nod in the wheat beneath my window I rushed into a jacket and out of the house In the far distance were disappearing two huge balls of colour orange and yellow for all the world like perambulating poppies of cyclopean breed Johnny said I to the nine year old son of my sister Johnny whenever little girls come into our field to pick poppies you must go down to them and in a very quiet and gentlemanly manner tell them it is not allowed Warm days came and the sun drew another blaze from the free bosomed earth Whereupon a neighbour s little girl at the behest of her mother duly craved and received permission from Bess to gather a few poppies for decorative purposes But of this I was uninformed and when I descried her in the midst of the field I waved my arms like a semaphore against the sky Little girl called I Little girl The little girl s legs blurred the landscape as she fled and in high elation I sought Bess to tell of the potency of my voice Nobly she came to the rescue departing forthwith on an expedition of conciliation and explanation to the little girl s mother But to this day the little girl seeks cover at sight of me and I know the mother will never be as cordial as she would otherwise have been Came dark overcast days stiff driving winds and pelting rains day on day without end and the city folk cowered in their dwelling places like flood beset rats and like rats half drowned and gasping when the weather cleared they crawled out and up the green Piedmont slopes to bask in the blessed sunshine And they invaded my field in swarms and droves crushing the sweet wheat into the earth and with lustful hands ripping the poppies out by the roots I shall put up the warnings against trespassing I said Yes said Bess with a sigh I m afraid it is necessary The day was yet young when she sighed again I m afraid O Man that your signs are of no avail People have forgotten how to read these days I went out on the porch A city nymph in cool summer gown and picture hat paused before one of my newly reared warnings and read it through with care Profound deliberation characterized her movements She was statuesquely tall but with a toss of the head and a flirt of the skirt she dropped on hands and knees crawled under the fence and came to her feet on the inside with poppies in both her hands I walked down the drive and talked ethically to her and she went away Then I put up more signs At one time years ago these hills were carpeted with poppies As between the destructive forces and the will to live the poppies maintained an equilibrium with their environment But the city folk constituted a new and terrible destructive force the equilibrium was overthrown and the poppies wellnigh perished Since the city folk plucked those with the longest stems and biggest bowls and since it is the law of kind to procreate kind the long stemmed big bowled poppies failed to go to seed and a stunted short stemmed variety remained to the hills And not only was it stunted and short stemmed but sparsely distributed as well Each day and every day for years and years the city folk swarmed over the Piedmont Hills and only here and there did the genius of the race survive in the form of miserable little flowers close clinging and quick blooming like children of the slums dragged hastily and precariously through youth to a shrivelled and futile maturity On the other hand the poppies had prospered in my field and not only had they been sheltered from the barbarians but also from the birds Long ago the field was sown in wheat which went to seed unharvested each year and in the cool depths of which the poppy seeds were hidden from the keen eyed songsters And further climbing after the sun through the wheat stalks the poppies grew taller and taller and more royal even than the primordial ones of the open So the city folk gazing from the bare hills to my blazing burning field were sorely tempted and it must be told as sorely fell But no sorer was their fall than that of my beloved poppies Where the grain holds the dew and takes the bite from the sun the soil is moist and in such soil it is easier to pull the poppies out by the roots than to break the stalk Now the city folk like other folk are inclined to move along the line of least resistance and for each flower they gathered there were also gathered many crisp rolled buds and with them all the possibilities and future beauties of the plant for all time to come One of the city folk a middle aged gentleman with white hands and shifty eyes especially made life interesting for me We called him the Repeater what of his ways When from the porch we implored him to desist he was wont slowly and casually to direct his steps toward the fence simulating finely the actions of a man who had not heard but whose walk instead had terminated of itself or of his own volition To heighten this effect now and again still casually and carelessly he would stoop and pluck another poppy Thus did he deceitfully save himself the indignity of being put out and rob us of the satisfaction of putting him out but he came and he came often each time getting away with an able bodied man s share of plunder It is not good to be of the city folk Of this I am convinced There is something in the mode of life that breeds an alarming condition of blindness and deafness or so it seems with the city folk that come to my poppy field Of the many to whom I have talked ethically not one has been found who ever saw the warnings so conspicuously displayed while of those called out to from the porch possibly one in fifty has heard Also I have discovered that the relation of city folk to country flowers is quite analogous to that of a starving man to food No more than the starving man realizes that five pounds of meat is not so good as an ounce do they realize that five hundred poppies crushed and bunched are less beautiful than two or three in a free cluster where the green leaves and golden bowls may expand to their full loveliness Less forgivable than the unaesthetic are the mercenary Hordes of young rascals plunder me and rob the future that they may stand on street corners and retail California poppies only five cents a bunch In spite of my precautions some of them made a dollar a day out of my field One horde do I remember with keen regret Reconnoitring for a possible dog they applied at the kitchen door for a drink of water please While they drank they were besought not to pick any flowers They nodded wiped their mouths and proceeded to take themselves off by the side of the bungalow They smote the poppy field beneath my windows spread out fan shaped six wide picking with both hands and ripped a swath of destruction through the very heart of the field No cyclone travelled faster or destroyed more completely I shouted after them but they sped on the wings of the wind great regal poppies broken stalked and mangled trailing after them or cluttering their wake the most high handed act of piracy I am confident ever committed off the high seas One day I went a fishing and on that day a woman entered the field Appeals and remonstrances from the porch having no effect upon her Bess despatched a little girl to beg of her to pick no more poppies The woman calmly went on picking Then Bess herself went down through the heat of the day But the woman went on picking and while she picked she discussed property and proprietary rights denying Bess s sovereignty until deeds and documents should be produced in proof thereof And all the time she went on picking never once overlooking her hand She was a large woman belligerent of aspect and Bess was only a woman and not prone to fisticuffs So the invader picked until she could pick no more said Good day and sailed majestically away People have really grown worse in the last several years I think said Bess to me in a tired sort of voice that night as we sat in the library after dinner Next day I was inclined to agree with her There s a woman and a little girl heading straight for the poppies said May a maid about the bungalow I went out on the porch and waited their advent They plunged through the pine trees and into the fields and as the roots of the first poppies were pulled I called to them They were about a hundred feet away The woman and the little girl turned to the sound of my voice and looked at me Please do not pick the poppies I pleaded They pondered this for a minute then the woman said something in an undertone to the little girl and both backs jack knifed as the slaughter recommenced I shouted but they had become suddenly deaf I screamed and so fiercely that the little girl wavered dubiously And while the woman went on picking I could hear her in low tones heartening the little girl I recollected a siren whistle with which I was wont to summon Johnny the son of my sister It was a fearsome thing of a kind to wake the dead and I blew and blew but the jack knifed backs never unclasped I do not mind with men but I have never particularly favoured physical encounters with women yet this woman who encouraged a little girl in iniquity tempted me I went into the bungalow and fetched my rifle Flourishing it in a sanguinary manner and scowling fearsomely I charged upon the invaders The little girl fled screaming to the shelter of the pines but the woman calmly went on picking She took not the least notice I had expected her to run at sight of me and it was embarrassing There was I charging down the field like a wild bull upon a woman who would not get out of the way I could only slow down supremely conscious of how ridiculous it all was At a distance of ten feet she straightened up and deigned to look at me I came to a halt and blushed to the roots of my hair Perhaps I really did frighten her I sometimes try to persuade myself that this is so or perhaps she took pity on me but at any rate she stalked out of my field with great composure nay majesty her arms brimming with orange and gold Nevertheless thenceforward I saved my lungs and flourished my rifle Also I made fresh generalizations To commit robbery women take advantage of their sex Men have more respect for property than women Men are less insistent in crime than women And women are less afraid of guns than men Likewise we conquer the earth in hazard and battle by the virtues of our mothers We are a race of land robbers and sea robbers we Anglo Saxons and small wonder when we suckle at the breasts of a breed of women such as maraud my poppy field Still the pillage went on Sirens and gun flourishings were without avail The city folk were great of heart and undismayed and I noted the habit of repeating was becoming general What booted it how often they were driven forth if each time they were permitted to carry away their ill gotten plunder When one has turned the same person away twice and thrice an emotion arises somewhat akin to homicide And when one has once become conscious of this sanguinary feeling his whole destiny seems to grip hold of him and drag him into the abyss More than once I found myself unconsciously pulling the rifle into position to get a sight on the miserable trespassers In my sleep I slew them in manifold ways and threw their carcasses into the reservoir Each day the temptation to shoot them in the legs became more luring and every day I felt my fate calling to me imperiously Visions of the gallows rose up before me and with the hemp about my neck I saw stretched out the pitiless future of my children dark with disgrace and shame I became afraid of myself and Bess went about with anxious face privily beseeching my friends to entice me into taking a vacation Then and at the last gasp came the thought that saved me Why not confiscate If their forays were bootless in the nature of things their forays would cease The first to enter my field thereafter was a man I was waiting for him And oh joy it was the Repeater himself smugly complacent with knowledge of past success I dropped the rifle negligently across the hollow of my arm and went down to him I am sorry to trouble you for those poppies I said in my oiliest tones but really you know I must have them He regarded me speechlessly It must have made a great picture It surely was dramatic With the rifle across my arm and my suave request still ringing in my ears I felt like Black Bart and Jesse James and Jack Sheppard and Robin Hood and whole generations of highwaymen Come come I said a little sharply and in what I imagined was the true fashion I am sorry to inconvenience you believe me but I must have those poppies I absently shifted the gun and smiled That fetched him Without a word he passed them over and turned his toes toward the fence but no longer casual and careless was his carriage I nor did he stoop to pick the occasional poppy by the way That was the last of the Repeater I could see by his eyes that he did not like me and his back reproached me all the way down the field and out of sight From that day the bungalow has been flooded with poppies Every vase and earthen jar is filled with them They blaze on every mantel and run riot through all the rooms I present them to my friends in huge bunches and still the kind city folk come and gather more for me Sit down for a moment I say to the departing guest And there we sit in the shade of the porch while aspiring city creatures pluck my poppies and sweat under the brazen sun And when their arms are sufficiently weighted with my yellow glories I go down with the rifle over my arm and disburden them Thus have I become convinced that every situation has its compensations Confiscation was successful so far as it went but I had forgotten one thing namely the vast number of the city folk Though the old transgressors came no more new ones arrived every day and I found myself confronted with the titanic task of educating a whole cityful to the inexpediency of raiding my poppy field During the process of disburdening them I was accustomed to explaining my side of the case but I soon gave this over It was a waste of breath They could not understand To one lady who insinuated that I was miserly I said My dear madam no hardship is worked upon you Had I not been parsimonious yesterday and the day before these poppies would have been picked by the city hordes of that day and the day before and your eyes which to day have discovered this field would have beheld no poppies at all The poppies you may not pick to day are the poppies I did not permit to be picked yesterday and the day before Therefore believe me you are denied nothing But the poppies are here to day she said glaring carnivorously upon their glow and splendour I will pay you for them said a gentleman at another time I had just relieved him of an armful I felt a sudden shame I know not why unless it be that his words had just made clear to me that a monetary as well as an aesthetic value was attached to my flowers The apparent sordidness of my position overwhelmed me and I said weakly I do not sell my poppies You may have what you have picked But before the week was out I confronted the same gentleman again I will pay you for them he said Yes I said you may pay me for them Twenty dollars please He gasped looked at me searchingly gasped again and silently and sadly put the poppies down But it remained as usual for a woman to attain the sheerest pitch of audacity When I declined payment and demanded my plucked beauties she refused to give them up I picked these poppies she said and my time is worth money When you have paid me for my time you may have them Her cheeks flamed rebellion and her face withal a pretty one was set and determined Now I was a man of the hill tribes and she a mere woman of the city folk and though it is not my inclination to enter into details it is my pleasure to state that that bunch of poppies subsequently glorified the bungalow and that the woman departed to the city unpaid Anyway they were my poppies They are God s poppies said the Radiant Young Radical democratically shocked at sight of me turning city folk out of my field And for two weeks she hated me with a deathless hatred I sought her out and explained I explained at length I told the story of the poppy as Maeterlinck has told the life of the bee I treated the question biologically psychologically and sociologically I discussed it ethically and aesthetically I grew warm over it and impassioned and when I had done she professed conversion but in my heart of hearts I knew it to be compassion I fled to other friends for consolation I retold the story of the poppy They did not appear supremely interested I grew excited They were surprised and pained They looked at me curiously It ill befits your dignity to squabble over poppies they said It is unbecoming I fled away to yet other friends I sought vindication The thing had become vital and I needs must put myself right I felt called upon to explain though well knowing that he who explains is lost I told the story of the poppy over again I went into the minutest details I added to it and expanded I talked myself hoarse and when I could talk no more they looked bored Also they said insipid things and soothful things and things concerning other things and not at all to the point I was consumed with anger and there and then I renounced them all At the bungalow I lie in wait for chance visitors Craftily I broach the subject watching their faces closely the while to detect first signs of disapprobation whereupon I empty long stored vials of wrath upon their heads I wrangle for hours with whosoever does not say I am right I am become like Guy de Maupassant s old man who picked up a piece of string I am incessantly explaining and nobody will understand I have become more brusque in my treatment of the predatory city folk No longer do I take delight in their disburdenment for it has become an onerous duty a wearisome and distasteful task My friends look askance and murmur pityingly on the side when we meet in the city They rarely come to see me now They are afraid I am an embittered and disappointed man and all the light seems to have gone out of my life and into my blazing field So one pays for things PIEDMONT CALIFORNIA April nineteen oh two THE SHRINKAGE OF THE PLANET What a tremendous affair it was the world of Homer with its indeterminate boundaries vast regions and immeasurable distances The Mediterranean and the Euxine were illimitable stretches of ocean waste over which years could be spent in endless wandering On their mysterious shores were the improbable homes of impossible peoples The Great Sea the Broad Sea the Boundless Sea the Ethiopians dwelling far away the most distant of men and the Cimmerians covered with darkness and cloud where baleful night is spread over timid mortals Phoenicia was a sore journey Egypt simply unattainable while the Pillars of Hercules marked the extreme edge of the universe Ulysses was nine days in sailing from Ismarus the city of the Ciconians to the country of the Lotus eaters a period of time which to day would breed anxiety in the hearts of the underwriters should it be occupied by the slowest tramp steamer in traversing the Mediterranean and Black Seas from Gibraltar to Sebastopol Homer s world restricted to less than a drummer s circuit was nevertheless immense surrounded by a thin veneer of universe the Stream of Ocean But how it has shrunk To day precisely charted weighed and measured a thousand times larger than the world of Homer it is become a tiny speck gyrating to immutable law through a universe the bounds of which have been pushed incalculably back The light of Algol shines upon it a light which travels at one hundred and ninety thousand miles per second yet requires forty seven years to reach its destination And the denizens of this puny ball have come to know that Algol possesses an invisible companion three and a quarter millions of miles away and that the twain move in their respective orbits at rates of fifty five and twenty six miles per second They also know that beyond it are great chasms of space innumerable worlds and vast star systems While much of the shrinkage to which the planet has been subjected is due to the increased knowledge of mathematics and physics an equal if not greater portion may be ascribed to the perfection of the means of locomotion and communication The enlargement of stellar space demonstrating with stunning force the insignificance of the earth has been negative in its effect but the quickening of travel and intercourse by making the earth s parts accessible and knitting them together has been positive The advantage of the animal over the vegetable kingdom is obvious The cabbage should its environment tend to become worse must live it out or die the rabbit may move on in quest of a better But after all the swift footed creatures are circumscribed in their wanderings The first large river almost inevitably bars their way and certainly the first salt sea becomes an impassable obstacle Better locomotion may be classed as one of the prime aims of the old natural selection for in that primordial day the race was to the swift as surely as the battle to the strong But man already pre eminent in the common domain because of other faculties was not content with the one form of locomotion afforded by his lower limbs He swam in the sea and still better becoming aware of the buoyant virtues of wood learned to navigate its surface Likewise from among the land animals he chose the more likely to bear him and his burdens The next step was the domestication of these useful aids Here in its organic significance natural selection ceased to concern itself with locomotion Man had displayed his impatience at her tedious methods and his own superiority in the hastening of affairs Thenceforth he must depend upon himself and faster swimming or faster running men ceased to be bred The one half amphibian breasting the water with muscular arms could not hope to overtake or escape an enemy who propelled a fire hollowed tree trunk by means of a wooden paddle nor could the other trusting to his own nimbleness compete with a foe who careered wildly across the plain on the back of a half broken stallion So in that dim day man took upon himself the task of increasing his dominion over space and time and right nobly has he acquitted himself Because of it he became a road builder and a bridge builder likewise he wove clumsy sails of rush and matting At a very remote period he must also have recognized that force moves along the line of least resistance and in virtue thereof placed upon his craft rude keels which enabled him to beat to windward in a seaway As he excelled in these humble arts just so did he add to his power over his less progressive fellows and lay the foundations for the first glimmering civilizations crude they were beyond conception sporadic and ephemeral but each formed a necessary part of the groundwork upon which was to rise the mighty civilization of our latter day world Divorced from the general history of man s upward climb it would seem incredible that so long a time should elapse between the moment of his first improvements over nature in the matter of locomotion and that of the radical changes he was ultimately to compass The principles which were his before history was were his neither more nor less even to the present century He utilized improved applications but the principles of themselves were ever the same whether in the war chariots of Achilles and Pharaoh or the mail coach and diligence of the European traveller the cavalry of the Huns or of Prince Rupert the triremes and galleys of Greece and Rome or the East India men and clipper ships of the last century But when the moment came to alter the methods of travel the change was so sweeping that it may be safely classed as a revolution Though the discovery of steam attaches to the honour of the last century the potency of the new power was not felt till the beginning of this By eighteen hundred small steamers were being used for coasting purposes in England eighteen thirty witnessed the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway while it was not until eighteen thirty eight that the Atlantic was first crossed by the steamships Great Western and Sirius In eighteen sixty nine the East was made next door neighbour to the West Over almost the same ground where had toiled the caravans of a thousand generations the Suez Canal was dug Clive during his first trip was a year and a half en route from England to India were he alive to day he could journey to Calcutta in twenty two days After reading De Quincey s hyperbolical description of the English mail coach one cannot down the desire to place that remarkable man on the pilot of the White Mail or of the Twentieth Century But this tremendous change in the means of locomotion meant far more than the mere rapid transit of men from place to place Until then though its influence and worth cannot be overestimated commerce had eked out a precarious and costly existence The fortuitous played too large a part in the trade of men The mischances by land and sea the mistakes and delays were adverse elements of no mean proportions But improved locomotion meant improved carrying and commerce received an impetus as remarkable as it was unexpected In his fondest fancies James Watt could not have foreseen even the approximate result of his invention the Hercules which was to spring from the puny child of his brain and hands An illuminating spectacle were it possible would be afforded by summoning him from among the Shades to a place in the engine room of an ocean greyhound The humblest trimmer would treat him with the indulgence of a child while an oiler a greasy nimbus about his head and in his hand as sceptre a long snouted can would indeed appear to him a demigod and ruler of forces beyond his ken It has ever been the world s dictum that empire and commerce go hand in hand In the past the one was impossible without the other Rome gathered to herself the wealth of the Mediterranean nations and it was only by an unwise distribution of it that she became emasculated and lost both power and trade With a just system of economics it is highly probable that for centuries she could have held back the welling tide of the Germanic peoples When upon her ruins rose the institutions of the conquering Teutons commerce slipped away and with it empire In the present empire and commerce have become interdependent Such wonders has the industrial revolution wrought in a few swift decades and so great has been the shrinkage of the planet that the industrial nations have long since felt the imperative demand for foreign markets The favoured portions of the earth are occupied From their seats in the temperate zones the militant commercial nations proceed to the exploitation of the tropics and for the possession of these they rush to war hot footed Like wolves at the end of a gorge they wrangle over the fragments There are no more planets no more fragments and they are yet hungry There are no longer Cimmerians and Ethiopians in wide stretching lands awaiting them On either hand they confront the naked poles and they recoil from unnavigable space to an intenser struggle among themselves And all the while the planet shrinks beneath their grasp Of this struggle one thing may be safely predicated a commercial power must be a sea power Upon the control of the sea depends the control of trade Carthage threatened Rome till she lost her navy and then for thirteen days the smoke of her burning rose to the skies and the ground was ploughed and sown with salt on the site of her most splendid edifices The cities of Italy were the world s merchants till new trade routes were discovered and the dominion of the sea passed on to the west and fell into other hands Spain and Portugal inaugurating an era of maritime discovery divided the new world between them but gave way before a breed of sea rovers who after many generations of attachment to the soil had returned to their ancient element With the destruction of her Armada Spain s colossal dream of colonial empire passed away Against the new power Holland strove in vain and when France acknowledged the superiority of the Briton upon the sea she at the same time relinquished her designs upon the world Hampered by her feeble navy her contest for supremacy upon the land was her last effort and with the passing of Napoleon she retired within herself to struggle with herself as best she might For fifty years England held undisputed sway upon the sea controlled markets and domineered trade laying during that period the foundations of her empire Since then other naval powers have arisen their attitudes bearing significantly upon the future for they have learned that the mastery of the world belongs to the masters of the sea That many of the phases of this world shrinkage are pathetic goes without question There is much to condemn in the rise of the economic over the imaginative spirit much for which the energetic Philistine can never atone Perhaps the deepest pathos of all may be found in the spectacle of John Ruskin weeping at the profanation of the world by the vandalism of the age Steam launches violate the sanctity of the Venetian canals where Xerxes bridged the Hellespont ply the filthy funnels of our modern shipping electric cars run in the shadow of the pyramids and it was only the other day that Lord Kitchener was in a railroad wreck near the site of ancient Luxor But there is always the other side If the economic man has defiled temples and despoiled nature he has also preserved He has policed the world and parked it reduced the dangers of life and limb made the tenure of existence less precarious and rendered a general relapse of society impossible There can never again be an intellectual holocaust such as the burning of the Alexandrian library Civilizations may wax and wane but the totality of knowledge cannot decrease With the possible exception of a few trade secrets arts and sciences may be discarded but they can never be lost And these things must remain true until the end of man s time upon the earth Up to yesterday communication for any distance beyond the sound of the human voice or the sight of the human eye was bound up with locomotion A letter presupposed a carrier The messenger started with the message and he could not but avail himself of the prevailing modes of travel If the voyage to Australia required four months four months were required for communication by no known means could this time be lessened But with the advent of the telegraph and telephone communication and locomotion were divorced In a few hours at most there could be performed what by the old way would have required months In eighteen thirty seven the needle telegraph was invented and nine years later the Electric Telegraph Company was formed for the purpose of bringing it into general use Government postal systems also came into being later to consolidate into an international union and to group the nations of the earth into a local neighbourhood The effects of all this are obvious and no fitter illustration may be presented than the fact that to day in the matter of communication the Klondike is virtually nearer to Boston than was Bunker Hill in the time of Warren A contemporaneous and remarkable shrinkage of a vast stretch of territory may be instanced in the Northland From its rise at Lake Linderman the Yukon runs twenty five hundred miles to Bering Sea traversing an almost unknown region the remote recesses of which had never felt the moccasined foot of the pathfinder At occasional intervals men wallowed into its dismal fastnesses or emerged gaunt and famine worn But in the fall of eighteen ninety six a great gold strike was made greater than any since the days of California and Australia yet so rude were the means of communication nearly a year elapsed before the news of it reached the eager ear of the world Passionate pilgrims disembarked their outfits at Dyea Over the terrible Chilcoot Pass the trail led to the lakes thirty miles away Carriage was yet in its most primitive stage the road builder and bridge builder unheard of With heavy packs upon their backs men plunged waist deep into hideous quagmires bridged mountain torrents by felling trees across them toiled against the precipitous slopes of the ice worn mountains and crossed the dizzy faces of innumerable glaciers When after incalculable toil they reached the lakes they went into the woods sawed pine trees into lumber by hand and built it into boats In these overloaded unseaworthy they battled down the long chain of lakes Within the memory of the writer there lingers the picture of a sheltered nook on the shores of Lake Le Barge in which half a thousand gold seekers lay storm bound Day after day they struggled against the seas in the teeth of a northerly gale and night after night returned to their camps repulsed but not disheartened At the rapids they ran their boats through hit or miss and after infinite toil and hardship on the breast of a jarring ice flood arrived at the Klondike From the beach at Dyea to the eddy below the Barracks at Dawson they had paid for their temerity the tax of human life demanded by the elements A year later so greatly had the country shrunk the tourist on disembarking from the ocean steamship took his seat in a modern railway coach A few hours later at Lake Bennet he stepped aboard a commodious river steamer At the rapids he rode around on a tramway to take passage on another steamer below And in a few hours more he was in Dawson without having once soiled the lustre of his civilized foot gear Did he wish to communicate with the outside world he strolled into the telegraph office A few short months before he would have written a letter and deemed himself favoured above mortals were it delivered within the year From man s drawing the world closer and closer together his own affairs and institutions have consolidated Concentration may typify the chief movement of the age concentration classification order the reduction of friction between the parts of the social organism The urban tendency of the rural populations led to terrible congestion in the great cities There was stifling and impure air and lo rapid transit at once attacked the evil Every great city has become but the nucleus of a greater city which surrounds it the one the seat of business the other the seat of domestic happiness Between the two night and morning by electric road steam railway and bicycle path ebbs and flows the middle class population And in the same direction lies the remedy for the tenement evil In the cleansing country air the slum cannot exist Improvement in road beds and the means of locomotion a tremor of altruism a little legislation and the city by day will sleep in the country by night What a play ball has this planet of ours become Steam has made its parts accessible and drawn them closer together The telegraph annihilates space and time Each morning every part knows what every other part is thinking contemplating or doing A discovery in a German laboratory is being demonstrated in San Francisco within twenty four hours A book written in South Africa is published by simultaneous copyright in every English speaking country and on the following day is in the hands of the translators The death of an obscure missionary in China or of a whisky smuggler in the South Seas is served up the world over with the morning toast The wheat output of Argentine or the gold of Klondike is known wherever men meet and trade Shrinkage or centralization has been such that the humblest clerk in any metropolis may place his hand on the pulse of the world And because of all this everywhere is growing order and organization The church the state men women and children the criminal and the law the honest man and the thief industry and commerce capital and labour the trades and the professions the arts and the sciences all are organizing for pleasure profit policy or intellectual pursuit They have come to know the strength of numbers solidly phalanxed and driving onward with singleness of purpose These purposes may be various and many but one and all ever discovering new mutual interests and objects obeying a law which is beyond them these petty aggregations draw closer together forming greater aggregations and congeries of aggregations And these in turn vaguely merging each into each present glimmering adumbrations of the coming human solidarity which shall be man s crowning glory OAKLAND CALIFORNIA January nineteen hundred THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL Speaking of homes I am building one now and I venture to assert that very few homes have received more serious thought in the planning Let me tell you about it In the first place there will be no grounds whatever no fences lawns nor flowers Roughly the dimensions will be forty five feet by fifteen That is it will be fifteen feet wide at its widest and if you will pardon the bull it will be narrower than it is wide The details must submit to the general plan of economy There will be no veranda no porch entrances no grand staircases I m ashamed to say how steep the stairways are going to be The bedrooms will be seven by seven and one will be even smaller A bedroom is only good to sleep in anyway There will be no hallway thank goodness Rooms were made to go through Why a separate passage for traffic The bath room will be a trifle larger than the size of the smallest bath tub it won t require so much work to keep in order The kitchen won t be very much larger but this will make it easy for the cook In place of a drawing room there will be a large living room fourteen by six The walls of this room will be covered with books and it can serve as library and smoking room as well Then the floor space not being occupied we shall use the room as a dining room Incidentally such a room not being used after bedtime the cook and the second boy can sleep in it One thing that I am temperamentally opposed to is waste and why should all this splendid room be wasted at night when we do not occupy it My ideas are cramped you say Oh I forgot to tell you that this home I am describing is to be a floating home and that my wife and I are to journey around the world in it for the matter of seven years or more I forgot also to state that there will be an engine room in it for a seventy horse power engine a dynamo storage batteries et cetera tanks for water to last long weeks at sea space for fifteen hundred gallons of gasolene fire extinguishers and life preservers and a great store room for food spare sails anchors hawsers tackles and a thousand and one other things Since I have not yet built my land house I haven t got beyond a few general ideas and in presenting them I feel as cocksure as the unmarried woman who writes the column in the Sunday supplement on how to rear children My first idea about a house is that it should be built to live in Throughout the house in all the building of it this should be the paramount idea It must be granted that this idea is lost sight of by countless persons who build houses apparently for every purpose under the sun except to live in them Perhaps it is because of the practical life I have lived that I worship utility and have come to believe that utility and beauty should be one and that there is no utility that need not be beautiful What finer beauty than strength whether it be airy steel or massive masonry or a woman s hand A plain black leather strap is beautiful It is all strength and all utility and it is beautiful It efficiently performs work in the world and it is good to look upon Perhaps it is because it is useful that it is beautiful I do not know I sometimes wonder A boat on the sea is beautiful Yet it is not built for beauty Every graceful line of it is a utility is designed to perform work It is created for the express purpose of dividing the water in front of it of gliding over the water beneath it of leaving the water behind it and all with the least possible wastage of stress and friction It is not created for the purpose of filling the eye with beauty It is created for the purpose of moving through the sea and over the sea with the smallest resistance and the greatest stability yet somehow it does fill the eye with its beauty And in so far as a boat fails in its purpose by that much does it diminish in beauty I am still a long way from the house I have in my mind some day to build yet I have arrived somewhere I have discovered to my own satisfaction at any rate that beauty and utility should be one In applying this general idea to the building of a house it may be stated in another and better way namely construction and decoration must be one This idea is more important than the building of the house for without the idea the house so built is certain to be an insult to intelligence and beauty love I bought a house in a hurry in the city of Oakland some time ago I do not live in it I sleep in it half a dozen times a year I do not love the house I am hurt every time I look at it No drunken rowdy or political enemy can insult me so deeply as that house does Let me tell you why It is an ordinary two storey frame house After it was built the criminal that constructed it nailed on at the corners perpendicularly some two inch fluted planks These planks rise the height of the house and to a drunken man have the appearance of fluted columns To complete the illusion in the eyes of the drunken man the planks are topped with wooden Ionic capitals nailed on and in I may say bas relief When I analyze the irritation these fluted planks cause in me I find the reason in the fact that the first rule for building a house has been violated These decorative planks are no part of the construction They have no use no work to perform They are plastered gawds that tell lies that nobody believes A column is made for the purpose of supporting weight this is its use A column when it is a utility is beautiful The fluted wooden columns nailed on outside my house are not utilities They are not beautiful They are nightmares They not only support no weight but they themselves are a weight that drags upon the supports of the house Some day when I get time one of two things will surely happen Either I ll go forth and murder the man who perpetrated the atrocity or else I ll take an axe and chop off the lying fluted planks A thing must be true or it is not beautiful any more than a painted wanton is beautiful any more than a sky scraper is beautiful that is intrinsically and structurally light and that has a false massiveness of pillars plastered on outside The true sky scraper is beautiful and this is the reluctant admission of a man who dislikes humanity festering cities The true sky scraper is beautiful and it is beautiful in so far as it is true In its construction it is light and airy therefore in its appearance it must be light and airy It dare not if it wishes to be beautiful lay claim to what it is not And it should not bulk on the city scape like Leviathan it should rise and soar light and airy and fairylike Man is an ethical animal or at least he is more ethical than any other animal Wherefore he has certain yearnings for honesty And in no way can these yearnings be more thoroughly satisfied than by the honesty of the house in which he lives and passes the greater part of his life They that dwelt in San Francisco were dishonest They lied and cheated in their business life like the dwellers in all cities and because they lied and cheated in their business life they lied and cheated in the buildings they erected Upon the tops of the simple severe walls of their buildings they plastered huge projecting cornices These cornices were not part of the construction They made believe to be part of the construction and they were lies The earth wrinkled its back for twenty eight seconds and the lying cornices crashed down as all lies are doomed to crash down In this particular instance the lies crashed down upon the heads of the people fleeing from their reeling habitations and many were killed They paid the penalty of dishonesty Not alone should the construction of a house be truthful and honest but the material must be honest They that lived in San Francisco were dishonest in the material they used They sold one quality of material and delivered another quality of material They always delivered an inferior quality There is not one case recorded in the business history of San Francisco where a contractor or builder delivered a quality superior to the one sold A seven million dollar city hall became thirty cents in twenty eight seconds Because the mortar was not honest a thousand walls crashed down and scores of lives were snuffed out There is something after all in the contention of a few religionists that the San Francisco earthquake was a punishment for sin It was a punishment for sin but it was not for sin against God The people of San Francisco sinned against themselves An honest house tells the truth about itself There is a house here in Glen Ellen It stands on a corner It is built of beautiful red stone Yet it is not beautiful On three sides the stone is joined and pointed The fourth side is the rear It faces the back yard The stone is not pointed It is all a smudge of dirty mortar with here and there bricks worked in when the stone gave out The house is not what it seems It is a lie All three of the walls spend their time lying about the fourth wall They keep shouting out that the fourth wall is as beautiful as they If I lived long in that house I should not be responsible for my morals The house is like a man in purple and fine linen who hasn t had a bath for a month If I lived long in that house I should become a dandy and cut out bathing for the same reason I suppose that an African is black and that an Eskimo eats whale blubber I shall not build a house like that house Last year I started to build a barn A man who was a liar undertook to do the stonework and concrete work for me He could not tell the truth to my face he could not tell the truth in his work I was building for posterity The concrete foundations were four feet wide and sunk three and one half feet into the earth The stone walls were two feet thick and nine feet high Upon them were to rest the great beams that were to carry all the weight of hay and the forty tons of the roof The man who was a liar made beautiful stone walls I used to stand alongside of them and love them I caressed their massive strength with my hands I thought about them in bed before I went to sheep And they were lies Came the earthquake Fortunately the rest of the building of the barn had been postponed The beautiful stone walls cracked in all directions I started to repair and discovered the whole enormous lie The walls were shells On each face were beautiful massive stones on edge The inside was hollow This hollow in some places was filled with clay and loose gravel In other places it was filled with air and emptiness with here and there a piece of kindling wood or dry goods box to aid in the making of the shell The walls were lies They were beautiful but they were not useful Construction and decoration had been divorced The walls were all decoration They hadn t any construction in them As God lets Satan live I let that lying man live but I have built new walls from the foundation up And now to my own house beautiful which I shall build some seven or ten years from now I have a few general ideas about it It must be honest in construction material and appearance If any feature of it despite my efforts shall tell lies I shall remove that feature Utility and beauty must be indissolubly wedded Construction and decoration must be one If the particular details keep true to these general ideas all will be well I have not thought of many details But here are a few Take the bath room for instance It shall be as beautiful as any room in the house just as it will be as useful The chance is that it will be the most expensive room in the house Upon that we are resolved even if we are compelled to build it first and to live in a tent till we can get more money to go on with the rest of the house In the bath room no delights of the bath shall be lacking Also a large part of the expensiveness will be due to the use of material that will make it easy to keep the bathroom clean and in order Why should a servant toil unduly that my body may be clean On the other hand the honesty of my own flesh and the square dealing I give it are more important than all the admiration of my friends for expensive decorative schemes and magnificent trivialities More delightful to me is a body that sings than a stately and costly grand staircase built for show Not that I like grand staircases less but that I like bath rooms more I often regret that I was born in this particular period of the world In the matter of servants how I wish I were living in the golden future of the world where there will be no servants naught but service of love But in the meantime living here and now being practical understanding the rationality and the necessity of the division of labour I accept servants But such acceptance does not justify me in lack of consideration for them In my house beautiful their rooms shall not be dens and holes And on this score I foresee a fight with the architect They shall have bath rooms toilet conveniences and comforts for their leisure time and human life if I have to work Sundays to pay for it Even under the division of labour I recognize that no man has a right to servants who will not treat them as humans compounded of the same clay as himself with similar bundles of nerves and desires contradictions irritabilities and lovablenesses Heaven in the drawing room and hell in the kitchen is not the atmosphere for a growing child to breathe nor an adult either One of the great and selfish objections to chattel slavery was the effect on the masters themselves And because of the foregoing one chief aim in the building of my house beautiful will be to have a house that will require the minimum of trouble and work to keep clean and orderly It will be no spick and span and polished house with an immaculateness that testifies to the tragedy of drudge I live in California where the days are warm I d prefer that the servants had three hours to go swimming or hammocking than be compelled to spend those three hours in keeping the house spick and span Therefore it devolves upon me to build a house that can be kept clean and orderly without the need of those three hours But underneath the spick and span there is something more dreadful than the servitude of the servants This dreadful thing is the philosophy of the spick and span In Korea the national costume is white Nobleman and coolie dress alike in white It is hell on the women who do the washing but there is more in it than that The coolie cannot keep his white clothes clean He toils and they get dirty The dirty white of his costume is the token of his inferiority The nobleman s dress is always spotless white It means that he doesn t have to work But it means further that somebody else has to work for him His superiority is not based upon song craft nor state craft upon the foot races he has run nor the wrestlers he has thrown His superiority is based upon the fact that he doesn t have to work and that others are compelled to work for him And so the Korean drone flaunts his clean white clothes for the same reason that the Chinese flaunts his monstrous finger nails and the white man and woman flaunt the spick and spanness of their spotless houses There will be hardwood floors in my house beautiful But these floors will not be polished mirrors nor skating rinks They will be just plain and common hardwood floors Beautiful carpets are not beautiful to the mind that knows they are filled with germs and bacilli They are no more beautiful than the hectic flush of fever or the silvery skin of leprosy Besides carpets enslave A thing that enslaves is a monster and monsters are not beautiful The fireplaces in my house will be many and large Small fires and cold weather mean hermetically sealed rooms and a jealous cherishing of heated and filth laden air With large fire places and generous heat some windows may be open all the time and without hardship all the windows can be opened every little while and the rooms flushed with clean pure air I have nearly died in the stagnant rotten air of other people s houses especially in the Eastern states In Maine I have slept in a room with storm windows immovable and with one small pane five inches by six that could be opened Did I say slept I panted with my mouth in the opening and blasphemed till I ruined all my chances of heaven For countless thousands of years my ancestors have lived and died and drawn all their breaths in the open air It is only recently that we have begun to live in houses The change is a hardship especially on the lungs I ve got only one pair of lungs and I haven t the address of any repair shop Wherefore I stick by the open air as much as possible For this reason my house will have large verandas and near to the kitchen there will be a veranda dining room Also there will be a veranda fireplace where we can breathe fresh air and be comfortable when the evenings are touched with frost I have a plan for my own bedroom I spend long hours in bed reading studying and working I have tried sleeping in the open but the lamp attracts all the creeping crawling butting flying fluttering things to the pages of my book into my ears and blankets and down the back of my neck So my bedroom shall be indoors But it will be not be of indoors Three sides of it will be open The fourth side will divide it from the rest of the house The three sides will be screened against the creeping fluttering things but not against the good fresh air and all the breezes that blow For protection against storm to keep out the driving rain there will be a sliding glass so made that when not in use it will occupy small space and shut out very little air There is little more to say about this house I am to build seven or ten years from now There is plenty of time in which to work up all the details in accord with the general principles I have laid down It will be a usable house and a beautiful house wherein the aesthetic guest can find comfort for his eyes as well as for his body It will be a happy house or else I ll burn it down It will be a house of air and sunshine and laughter These three cannot be divorced Laughter without air and sunshine becomes morbid decadent demoniac I have in me a thousand generations Laughter that is decadent is not good for these thousand generations GLEN ELLEN CALIFORNIA July nineteen oh six THE GOLD HUNTERS OF THE NORTH Where the Northern Lights come down a nights to dance on the houseless snow Ivan I forbid you to go farther in this undertaking Not a word about this or we are all undone Let the Americans and the English know that we have gold in these mountains then we are ruined They will rush in on us by thousands and crowd us to the wall to the death So spoke the old Russian governor Baranov at Sitka in eighteen oh four to one of his Slavonian hunters who had just drawn from his pocket a handful of golden nuggets Full well Baranov fur trader and autocrat understood and feared the coming of the sturdy indomitable gold hunters of Anglo Saxon stock And thus he suppressed the news as did the governors that followed him so that when the United States bought Alaska in eighteen sixty seven she bought it for its furs and fisheries without a thought of its treasures underground No sooner however had Alaska become American soil than thousands of our adventurers were afoot and afloat for the north They were the men of the days of gold the men of California Fraser Cassiar and Cariboo With the mysterious infinite faith of the prospector they believed that the gold streak which ran through the Americas from Cape Horn to California did not peter out in British Columbia That it extended farther north was their creed and Farther North became their cry No time was lost and in the early seventies leaving the Treadwell and the Silver Bow Basin to be discovered by those who came after they went plunging on into the white unknown North farther north they struggled till their picks rang in the frozen beaches of the Arctic Ocean and they shivered by driftwood fires on the ruby sands of Nome But first in order that this colossal adventure may be fully grasped the recentness and the remoteness of Alaska must be emphasized The interior of Alaska and the contiguous Canadian territory was a vast wilderness Its hundreds of thousands of square miles were as dark and chartless as Darkest Africa In eighteen forty seven when the first Hudson Bay Company agents crossed over the Rockies from the Mackenzie to poach on the preserves of the Russian Bear they thought that the Yukon flowed north and emptied into the Arctic Ocean Hundreds of miles below however were the outposts of the Russian traders They in turn did not know where the Yukon had its source and it was not till later that Russ and Saxon learned that it was the same mighty stream they were occupying And a little over ten years later Frederick Whymper voyaged up the Great Bend to Fort Yukon under the Arctic Circle From fort to fort from York Factory on Hudson s Bay to Fort Yukon in Alaska the English traders transported their goods a round trip requiring from a year to a year and a half It was one of their deserters in eighteen sixty seven escaping down the Yukon to Bering Sea who was the first white man to make the North west Passage by land from the Atlantic to the Pacific It was at this time that the first accurate description of a fair portion of the Yukon was given by doctor W H Ball of the Smithsonian Institution But even he had never seen its source and it was not given him to appreciate the marvel of that great natural highway No more remarkable river in this one particular is there in the world taking its rise in Crater Lake thirty miles from the ocean the Yukon flows for twenty five hundred miles through the heart of the continent ere it empties into the sea A portage of thirty miles and then a highway for traffic one tenth the girth of the earth As late as eighteen sixty nine Frederick Whymper fellow of the Royal Geographical Society stated on hearsay that the Chilcat Indians were believed occasionally to make a short portage across the Coast Range from salt water to the head reaches of the Yukon But it remained for a gold hunter questing north ever north to be first of all white men to cross the terrible Chilcoot Pass and tap the Yukon at its head This happened only the other day but the man has become a dim legendary hero Holt was his name and already the mists of antiquity have wrapped about the time of his passage eighteen seventy two eighteen seventy four and eighteen seventy eight are the dates variously given a confusion which time will never clear Holt penetrated as far as the Hootalinqua and on his return to the coast reported coarse gold The next recorded adventurer is one Edward Bean who in eighteen eighty headed a party of twenty five miners from Sitka into the uncharted land And in the same year other parties now forgotten for who remembers or ever hears the wanderings of the gold hunters crossed the Pass built boats out of the standing timber and drifted down the Yukon and farther north And then for a quarter of a century the unknown and unsung heroes grappled with the frost and groped for the gold they were sure lay somewhere among the shadows of the Pole In the struggle with the terrifying and pitiless natural forces they returned to the primitive garmenting themselves in the skins of wild beasts and covering their feet with the walrus mucluc and the moosehide moccasin They forgot the world and its ways as the world had forgotten them killed their meat as they found it feasted in plenty and starved in famine and searched unceasingly for the yellow lure They crisscrossed the land in every direction threaded countless unmapped rivers in precarious birch bark canoes and with snowshoes and dogs broke trail through thousands of miles of silent white where man had never been They struggled on under the aurora borealis or the midnight sun through temperatures that ranged from one hundred degrees above zero to eighty degrees below living in the grim humour of the land on rabbit tracks and salmon bellies To day a man may wander away from the trail for a hundred days and just as he is congratulating himself that at last he is treading virgin soil he will come upon some ancient and dilapidated cabin and forget his disappointment in wonder at the man who reared the logs Still if one wanders from the trail far enough and deviously enough he may chance upon a few thousand square miles which he may have all to himself On the other hand no matter how far and how deviously he may wander the possibility always remains that he may stumble not alone upon a deserted cabin but upon an occupied one As an instance of this and of the vastness of the land no better case need be cited than that of Harry Maxwell An able seaman hailing from New Bedford Massachusetts his ship the brig Fannie E Lee was pinched in the Arctic ice Passing from whaleship to whaleship he eventually turned up at Point Barrow in the summer of eighteen eighty He was north of the Northland and from this point of vantage he determined to pull south of the interior in search of gold Across the mountains from Fort Macpherson and a couple of hundred miles eastward from the Mackenzie he built a cabin and established his headquarters And here for nineteen continuous years he hunted his living and prospected He ranged from the never opening ice to the north as far south as the Great Slave Lake Here he met Warburton Pike the author and explorer an incident he now looks back upon as chief among the few incidents of his solitary life When this sailor miner had accumulated twenty thousand dollars worth of dust he concluded that civilization was good enough for him and proceeded to pull for the outside From the Mackenzie he went up the Little Peel to its headwaters found a pass through the mountains nearly starved to death on his way across to the Porcupine Hills and eventually came out on the Yukon River where he learned for the first time of the Yukon gold hunters and their discoveries Yet for twenty years they had been working there his next door neighbours virtually in a land of such great spaces At Victoria British Columbia previous to his going east over the Canadian Pacific the existence of which he had just learned he pregnantly remarked that he had faith in the Mackenzie watershed and that he was going back after he had taken in the World s Fair and got a whiff or two of civilization Faith It may or may not remove mountains but it has certainly made the Northland No Christian martyr ever possessed greater faith than did the pioneers of Alaska They never doubted the bleak and barren land Those who came remained and more ever came They could not leave They knew the gold was there and they persisted Somehow the romance of the land and the quest entered into their blood the spell of it gripped hold of them and would not let them go Man after man of them after the most terrible privation and suffering shook the muck of the country from his moccasins and departed for good But the following spring always found him drifting down the Yukon on the tail of the ice jams Jack McQuestion aptly vindicates the grip of the North After a residence of thirty years he insists that the climate is delightful and declares that whenever he makes a trip to the States he is afflicted with home sickness Needless to say the North still has him and will keep tight hold of him until he dies In fact for him to die elsewhere would be inartistic and insincere Of three of the pioneer pioneers Jack McQuestion alone survives In eighteen seventy one from one to seven years before Holt went over Chilcoot in the company of Al Mayo and Arthur Harper McQuestion came into the Yukon from the North west over the Hudson Bay Company route from the Mackenzie to Fort Yukon The names of these three men as their lives are bound up in the history of the country and so long as there be histories and charts that long will the Mayo and McQuestion rivers and the Harper and Ladue town site of Dawson be remembered As an agent of the Alaska Commercial Company in eighteen seventy three McQuestion built Fort Reliance six miles below the Klondike River In eighteen ninety eight the writer met Jack McQuestion at Minook on the Lower Yukon The old pioneer though grizzled was hale and hearty and as optimistic as when he first journeyed into the land along the path of the Circle And no man more beloved is there in all the North There will be great sadness there when his soul goes questing on over the Last Divide farther north perhaps who can tell Frank Dinsmore is a fair sample of the men who made the Yukon country A Yankee born in Auburn Maine the Wanderlust early laid him by the heels and at sixteen he was heading west on the trail that led farther north He prospected in the Black Hills Montana and in the Coeur d Alene then heard a whisper of the North and went up to Juneau on the Alaskan Panhandle But the North still whispered and more insistently and he could not rest till he went over Chilcoot and down into the mysterious Silent Land This was in eighteen eighty two and he went down the chain of lakes down the Yukon up the Pelly and tried his luck on the bars of McMillan River In the fall a perambulating skeleton he came back over the Pass in a blizzard with a rag of shirt tattered overalls and a handful of raw flour But he was unafraid That winter he worked for a grubstake in Juneau and the next spring found the heels of his moccasins turned towards salt water and his face toward Chilcoot This was repeated the next spring and the following spring and the spring after that until in eighteen eighty five he went over the Pass for good There was to be no return for him until he found the gold he sought The years came and went but he remained true to his resolve For eleven long years with snow shoe and canoe pickaxe and gold pan he wrote out his life on the face of the land Upper Yukon Middle Yukon Lower Yukon he prospected faithfully and well His bed was anywhere Winter or summer he carried neither tent nor stove and his six pound sleeping robe of Arctic hare was the warmest covering he was ever known to possess Rabbit tracks and salmon bellies were his diet with a vengeance for he depended largely on his rifle and fishing tackle His endurance equalled his courage On a wager he lifted thirteen fifty pound sacks of flour and walked off with them Winding up a seven hundred mile trip on the ice with a forty mile run he came into camp at six o clock in the evening and found a squaw dance under way He should have been exhausted Anyway his muclucs were frozen stiff But he kicked them off and danced all night in stocking feet At the last fortune came to him The quest was ended and he gathered up his gold and pulled for the outside And his own end was as fitting as that of his quest Illness came upon him down in San Francisco and his splendid life ebbed slowly out as he sat in his big easy chair in the Commercial Hotel the Yukoner s home The doctors came discussed consulted the while he matured more plans of Northland adventure for the North still gripped him and would not let him go He grew weaker day by day but each day he said To morrow I ll be all right Other old timers out on furlough came to see him They wiped their eyes and swore under their breaths then entered and talked largely and jovially about going in with him over the trail when spring came But there in the big easy chair it was that his Long Trail ended and the life passed out of him still fixed on farther north From the time of the first white man famine loomed black and gloomy over the land It was chronic with the Indians and Eskimos it became chronic with the gold hunters It was ever present and so it came about that life was commonly expressed in terms of grub was measured by cups of flour Each winter eight months long the heroes of the frost faced starvation It became the custom as fall drew on for partners to cut the cards or draw straws to determine which should hit the hazardous trail for salt water and which should remain and endure the hazardous darkness of the Arctic night There was never food enough to winter the whole population The A C Company worked hard to freight up the grub but the gold hunters came faster and dared more audaciously When the A C Company added a new stern wheeler to its fleet men said Now we shall have plenty But more gold hunters poured in over the passes to the south more voyageurs and fur traders forced a way through the Rockies from the east more seal hunters and coast adventurers poled up from Bering Sea on the west more sailors deserted from the whale ships to the north and they all starved together in right brotherly fashion More steamers were added but the tide of prospectors welled always in advance Then the N A T T Company came upon the scene and both companies added steadily to their fleets But it was the same old story famine would not depart In fact famine grew with the population till in the winter of eighteen ninety seven eighteen ninety eight the United States government was forced to equip a reindeer relief expedition As of old that winter partners cut the cards and drew straws and remained or pulled for salt water as chance decided They were wise of old time and had learned never to figure on relief expeditions They had heard of such things but no mortal man of them had ever laid eyes on one The hard luck of other mining countries pales into insignificance before the hard luck of the North And as for the hardship it cannot be conveyed by printed page or word of mouth No man may know who has not undergone And those who have undergone out of their knowledge claim that in the making of the world God grew tired and when He came to the last barrowload just dumped it anyhow and that was how Alaska happened to be While no adequate conception of the life can be given to the stay at home yet the men themselves sometimes give a clue to its rigours One old Minook miner testified thus Haven t you noticed the expression on the faces of us fellows You can tell a new comer the minute you see him he looks alive enthusiastic perhaps jolly We old miners are always grave unless were drinking Another old timer out of the bitterness of a home mood imagined himself a Martian astronomer explaining to a friend with the aid of a powerful telescope the institutions of the earth There are the continents he indicated and up there near the polar cap is a country frigid and burning and lonely and apart called Alaska Now in other countries and states there are great insane asylums but though crowded they are insufficient so there is Alaska given over to the worst cases Now and then some poor insane creature comes to his senses in those awful solitudes and in wondering joy escapes from the land and hastens back to his home But most cases are incurable They just suffer along poor devils forgetting their former life quite or recalling it like a dream Again the grip of the North which will not let one go for most cases are incurable For a quarter of a century the battle with frost and famine went on The very severity of the struggle with Nature seemed to make the gold hunters kindly toward one another The latch string was always out and the open hand was the order of the day Distrust was unknown and it was no hyperbole for a man to take the last shirt off his back for a comrade Most significant of all perhaps in this connection was the custom of the old days that when August the first came around the prospectors who had failed to locate pay dirt were permitted to go upon the ground of their more fortunate comrades and take out enough for the next year s grub stake In eighteen eighty five rich bar washing was done on the Stewart River and in eighteen eighty six Cassiar Bar was struck just below the mouth of the Hootalinqua It was at this time that the first moderate strike was made on Forty Mile Creek so called because it was judged to be that distance below Fort Reliance of Jack McQuestion fame A prospector named Williams started for the outside with dogs and Indians to carry the news but suffered such hardship on the summit of Chilcoot that he was carried dying into the store of Captain John Healy at Dyea But he had brought the news through coarse gold Within three months more than two hundred miners had passed in over Chilcoot stampeding for Forty Mile Find followed find Sixty Mile Miller Glacier Birch Franklin and the Koyokuk But they were all moderate discoveries and the miners still dreamed and searched for the fabled stream Too Much Gold where gold was so plentiful that gravel had to be shovelled into the sluice boxes in order to wash it And all the time the Northland was preparing to play its own huge joke It was a great joke albeit an exceeding bitter one and it has led the old timers to believe that the land is left in darkness the better part of the year because God goes away and leaves it to itself After all the risk and toil and faithful endeavour it was destined that few of the heroes should be in at the finish when Too Much Gold turned its yellow treasure to the stars First there was Robert Henderson and this is true history Henderson had faith in the Indian River district For three years by himself depending mainly on his rifle living on straight meat a large portion of the time he prospected many of the Indian River tributaries just missed finding the rich creeks Sulphur and Dominion and managed to make grub poor grub out of Quartz Creek and Australia Creek Then he crossed the divide between Indian River and the Klondike and on one of the feeders of the latter found eight cents to the pan This was considered excellent in those simple days Naming the creek Gold Bottom he recrossed the divide and got three men Munson Dalton and Swanson to return with him The four took out seven hundred fifty dollars And be it emphasized and emphasized again that this was the first Klondike gold ever shovelled in and washed out And be it also emphasized that Robert Henderson was the discoverer of Klondike all lies and hearsay tales to the contrary Running out of grub Henderson again recrossed the divide and went down the Indian River and up the Yukon to Sixty Mile Here Joe Ladue ran the trading post and here Joe Ladue had originally grub staked Henderson Henderson told his tale and a dozen men all it contained deserted the Post for the scene of his find Also Henderson persuaded a party of prospectors bound for Stewart River to forgo their trip and go down and locate with him He loaded his boat with supplies drifted down the Yukon to the mouth of the Klondike and towed and poled up the Klondike to Gold Bottom But at the mouth of the Klondike he met George Carmack and thereby hangs the tale Carmack was a squawman He was familiarly known as Siwash George a derogatory term which had arisen out of his affinity for the Indians At the time Henderson encountered him he was catching salmon with his Indian wife and relatives on the site of what was to become Dawson the Golden City of the Snows Henderson bubbling over with good will open handed told Carmack of his discovery But Carmack was satisfied where he was He was possessed by no overweening desire for the strenuous life Salmon were good enough for him But Henderson urged him to come on and locate until when he yielded he wanted to take the whole tribe along Henderson refused to stand for this said that he must give the preference over Siwashes to his old Sixty Mile friends and it is rumoured said some things about Siwashes that were not nice The next morning Henderson went on alone up the Klondike to Gold Bottom Carmack by this time aroused took a short cut afoot for the same place Accompanied by his two Indian brothers in law Skookum Jim and Tagish Charley he went up Rabbit Creek now Bonanza crossed into Gold Bottom and staked near Henderson s discovery On the way up he had panned a few shovels on Rabbit Creek and he showed Henderson colours he had obtained Henderson made him promise if he found anything on the way back that he would send up one of the Indians with the news Henderson also agreed to pay for his service for he seemed to feel that they were on the verge of something big and he wanted to make sure Carmack returned down Rabbit Creek While he was taking a sleep on the bank about half a mile below the mouth of what was to be known as Eldorado Skookum Jim tried his luck and from surface prospects got from ten cents to a dollar to the pan Carmack and his brother in law staked and hit the high places for Forty Mile where they filed on the claims before Captain Constantine and renamed the creek Bonanza And Henderson was forgotten No word of it reached him Carmack broke his promise Weeks afterward when Bonanza and Eldorado were staked from end to end and there was no more room a party of late comers pushed over the divide and down to Gold Bottom where they found Henderson still at work When they told him they were from Bonanza he was nonplussed He had never heard of such a place But when they described it he recognized it as Rabbit Creek Then they told him of its marvellous richness and as Tappan Adney relates when Henderson realized what he had lost through Carmack s treachery he threw down his shovel and went and sat on the bank so sick at heart that it was some time before he could speak Then there were the rest of the old timers the men of Forty Mile and Circle City At the time of the discovery nearly all of them were over to the west at work in the old diggings or prospecting for new ones As they said of themselves they were the kind of men who are always caught out with forks when it rains soup In the stampede that followed the news of Carmack s strike very few old miners took part They were not there to take part But the men who did go on the stampede were mainly the worthless ones the new comers and the camp hangers on And while Bob Henderson plugged away to the east and the heroes plugged away to the west the greenhorns and rounders went up and staked Bonanza But the Northland was not yet done with its joke When fall came on and the heroes returned to Forty Mile and to Circle City they listened calmly to the up river tales of Siwash discoveries and loafers prospects and shook their heads They judged by the calibre of the men interested and branded it a bunco game But glowing reports continued to trickle down the Yukon and a few of the old timers went up to see They looked over the ground the unlikeliest place for gold in all their experience and they went down the river again leaving it to the Swedes Again the Northland turned the tables The Alaskan gold hunter is proverbial not so much for his unveracity as for his inability to tell the precise truth In a country of exaggerations he likewise is prone to hyperbolic description of things actual But when it came to Klondike he could not stretch the truth as fast as the truth itself stretched Carmack first got a dollar pan He lied when he said it was two dollars and a half And when those who doubted him did get two and a half pans they said they were getting an ounce and lo ere the lie had fairly started on its way they were getting not one ounce but five ounces This they claimed was six ounces but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove the lie they washed out twelve ounces And so it went They continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them But the Northland s hyperborean laugh was not yet ended When Bonanza was staked from mouth to source those who had failed to get in disgruntled and sore went up the pups and feeders Eldorado was one of these feeders and many men after locating on it turned their backs upon their claims and never gave them a second thought One man sold a half interest in five hundred feet of it for a sack of flour Other owners wandered around trying to bunco men into buying them out for a song And then Eldorado showed up It was far far richer than Bonanza with an average value of a thousand dollars a foot to every foot of it A Swede named Charley Anderson had been at work on Miller Creek the year of the strike and arrived in Dawson with a few hundred dollars Two miners who had staked No twenty nine Eldorado decided that he was the proper man upon whom to unload He was too canny to approach sober so at considerable expense they got him drunk Even then it was hard work but they kept him befuddled for several days and finally inveigled him into buying No twenty nine for seven hundred fifty dollars When Anderson sobered up he wept at his folly and pleaded to have his money back But the men who had duped him were hard hearted They laughed at him and kicked themselves for not having tapped him for a couple of hundred more Nothing remained for Anderson but to work the worthless ground This he did and out of it he took over three quarters of a million of dollars It was not till Frank Dinsmore who already had big holdings on Birch Creek took a hand that the old timers developed faith in the new diggings Dinsmore received a letter from a man on the spot calling it the biggest thing in the world and harnessed his dogs and went up to investigate And when he sent a letter back saying that he had never seen anything like it Circle City for the first time believed and at once was precipitated one of the wildest stampedes the country had ever seen or ever will see Every dog was taken many went without dogs and even the women and children and weaklings hit the three hundred miles of ice through the long Arctic night for the biggest thing in the world It is related that but twenty people mostly cripples and unable to travel were left in Circle City when the smoke of the last sled disappeared up the Yukon Since that time gold has been discovered in all manner of places under the grass roots of the hill side benches in the bottom of Monte Cristo Island and in the sands of the sea at Nome And now the gold hunter who knows his business shuns the favourable looking spots confident in his hard won knowledge that he will find the most gold in the least likely place This is sometimes adduced to support the theory that the gold hunters rather than the explorers are the men who will ultimately win to the Pole Who knows It is in their blood and they are capable of it PIEDMONT CALIFORNIA February nineteen oh two FOMA GORDYEEFF What without asking hither hurried Whence And without asking Whither hurried hence Oh many a

8820_294120_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He raises the cry of the miserable and the despised and in a masterly arraignment of commercialism protests against social conditions against the grinding of the faces of the poor and weak and the self pollution of the rich and strong in their mad lust for place and power 
none	none	It is to be doubted strongly if the average bourgeois smug and fat and prosperous can understand this man Foma Gordyeeff The rebellion in his blood is something to which their own does not thrill 
8820_294120_000005_000003	train-clean-360	To them it will be inexplicable that this man with his health and his millions could not go on living as his class lived keeping regular hours at desk and stock exchange driving close contracts underbidding his competitors and exulting in the business disasters of his fellows 
none	none	It would appear so easy and after such a life well appointed and eminently respectable he could die Ah Foma will interrupt rudely he is given to rude interruptions if to die and disappear is the end of these money grubbing years why money grub And the bourgeois whom he rudely interrupted will not understand Nor did Mayakin understand as he laboured holily with his wayward godson

none	none	Why do you accumulate money Aren t you going to die Well what then And Mayakin finds himself speechless and without answer but unshaken and unconvinced Receiving by heredity the fierce bull like nature of his father plus the passive indomitableness and groping spirit of his mother Foma proud and rebellious is repelled by the selfish money seeking environment into which he is born Ignat his father and Mayakin the godfather and all the horde of successful merchants singing the paean of the strong and the praises of merciless remorseless laissez faire cannot entice him Why he demands This is a nightmare this life

none	none	You do well to pity people Ignat tells Foma the boy only you must use judgment with your pity First consider the man find out what he is like what use can be made of him and if you see that he is a strong and capable man help him if you like But if a man is weak not inclined to work spit upon him and go your way 
8820_294120_000008_000003	train-clean-360	And you must know that when a man complains about everything and cries out and groans he is not worth more than two kopeks he is not worthy of pity and will be of no use to you if you do help him

8820_294120_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Now comes Mayakin speaking softly and without satire 
none	none	Eh my boy what is a beggar A beggar is a man who is forced by fate to remind us of Christ he is Christ s brother he is the bell of the Lord and rings in life for the purpose of awakening our conscience of stirring up the satiety of man s flesh He stands under the window and sings For Christ s sa ake and by that chant he reminds us of Christ of His holy command to help our neighbour 
8820_294120_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But men have so ordered their lives that it is utterly impossible for them to act in accordance with Christ s teaching and Jesus Christ has become entirely superfluous to us 
8820_294120_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Not once but in all probability a thousand times we have given Him over to be crucified but still we cannot banish Him from our lives so long as His poor brethren sing His name in the streets and remind us of Him 
8820_294120_000010_000005	train-clean-360	And so now we have hit upon the idea of shutting up the beggars in such special buildings so that they may not roam about the streets and stir up our consciences 
8820_294120_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But Foma will have none of it

8820_294120_000011_000005	train-clean-360	It was strange why did they live 
8820_294120_000011_000006	train-clean-360	What satisfaction was it to them to live on the earth 
8820_294120_000011_000007	train-clean-360	All they did was to perform their dirty arduous toil eat poorly they were miserably clad addicted to drunkenness 
8820_294120_000011_000008	train-clean-360	One was sixty years old but he still toiled side by side with young men

8820_294120_000013_000006	train-clean-360	But my idea is that everybody ought without fail to know solidly what he is living for

8820_294120_000017_000000	train-clean-360	It is not a pretty book but it is a masterful interrogation of life not of life universal but of life particular the social life of to day

none	none	No story is told nothing is finished Ah but surely the story of Foma Gordyeeff is told his life is finished as lives are being finished each day around us Besides it is the way of life and the art of Gorky is the art of realism 
8820_294120_000019_000002	train-clean-360	But it is a less tedious realism than that of Tolstoy or Turgenev 
none	none	It lives and breathes from page to page with a swing and dash and go that they rarely attain Their mantle has fallen on his young shoulders and he promises to wear it royally Even so but so helpless hopeless terrible is this life of Foma Gordyeeff that we would be filled with profound sorrow for Gorky did we not know that he has come up out of the Valley of Shadow That he hopes we know else would he not now be festering in a Russian prison because he is brave enough to live the hope he feels 
8820_294120_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He knows life why and how it should be lived 
none	none	And in conclusion this one thing is manifest Foma Gordyeeff is no mere statement of an intellectual problem For as he lived and interrogated living so in sweat and blood and travail has Gorky lived PIEDMONT CALIFORNIA November nineteen oh one THESE BONES SHALL RISE AGAIN Rudyard Kipling prophet of blood and vulgarity prince of ephemerals and idol of the unelect as a Chicago critic chortles is dead It is true He is dead dead and buried And a fluttering chirping host of men little men and unseeing men have heaped him over with the uncut leaves of Kim wrapped him in Stalky company for winding sheet and for headstone reared his unconventional lines The Lesson It was very easy The simplest thing in the world And the fluttering chirping gentlemen are rubbing their hands in amaze and wondering why they did not do it long ago it was so very very simple But the centuries to come of which the fluttering chirping gentlemen are prone to talk largely will have something to say in the matter And when they the future centuries quest back to the nineteenth century to find what manner of century it was to find not what the people of the nineteenth century thought they thought but what they really thought not what they thought they ought to do but what they really did do then a certain man Kipling will be read and read with understanding They thought they read him with understanding those people of the nineteenth century the future centuries will say and then they thought there was no understanding in him and after that they did not know what they thought But this is over severe It applies only to that class which serves a function somewhat similar to that served by the populace of old time in Rome This is the unstable mob minded mass which sits on the fence ever ready to fall this side or that and indecorously clamber back again which puts a Democratic administration into office one election and a Republican the next which discovers and lifts up a prophet to day that it may stone him to morrow which clamours for the book everybody else is reading for no reason under the sun save that everybody else is reading it This is the class of whim and caprice of fad and vogue the unstable incoherent mob mouthed mob minded mass the monkey folk if you please of these latter days Now it may be reading The Eternal City Yesterday it was reading The Master Christian and some several days before that it was reading Kipling Yes almost to his shame be it these folk were reading him But it was not his fault If he depended upon them he well deserves to be dead and buried and never to rise again But to them let us be thankful he never lived They thought he lived but he was as dead then as he is now and as he always will be He could not help it because he became the vogue and it is easily understood When he lay ill fighting with close grapples with death those who knew him were grieved They were many and in many voices to the rim of the Seven Seas they spoke their grief Whereupon and with celerity the mob minded mass began to inquire as to this man whom so many mourned If everybody else mourned it were fit that they mourn too So a vast wail went up Each was a spur to the other s grief and each began privately to read this man they had never read and publicly to proclaim this man they had always read And straightaway next day they drowned their grief in a sea of historical romance and forgot all about him The reaction was inevitable Emerging from the sea into which they had plunged they became aware that they had so soon forgotten him and would have been ashamed had not the fluttering chirping men said Come let us bury him And they put him in a hole quickly out of their sight And when they have crept into their own little holes and smugly laid themselves down in their last long sleep the future centuries will roll the stone away and he will come forth again For be it known That man of us is imperishable who makes his century imperishable That man of us who seizes upon the salient facts of our life who tells what we thought what we were and for what we stood that man shall be the mouthpiece to the centuries and so long as they listen he shall endure We remember the caveman We remember him because he made his century imperishable But unhappily we remember him dimly in a collective sort of way because he memorialized his century dimly in a collective sort of way He had no written speech so he left us rude scratchings of beasts and things cracked marrow bones and weapons of stone It was the best expression of which he was capable Had he scratched his own particular name with the scratchings of beasts and things stamped his cracked marrowbones with his own particular seal trade marked his weapons of stone with his own particular device that particular man would we remember But he did the best he could and we remember him as best we may Homer takes his place with Achilles and the Greek and Trojan heroes Because he remembered them we remember him Whether he be one or a dozen men or a dozen generations of men we remember him And so long as the name of Greece is known on the lips of men so long will the name of Homer be known There are many such names linked with their times which have come down to us many more which will yet go down and to them in token that we have lived must we add some few of our own Dealing only with the artist be it understood only those artists will go down who have spoken true of us Their truth must be the deepest and most significant their voices clear and strong definite and coherent Half truths and partial truths will not do nor will thin piping voices and quavering lays There must be the cosmic quality in what they sing They must seize upon and press into enduring art forms the vital facts of our existence They must tell why we have lived for without any reason for living depend upon it in the time to come it will be as though we had never lived Nor are the things that were true of the people a thousand years or so ago true of us to day The romance of Homer s Greece is the romance of Homer s Greece That is undeniable It is not our romance And he who in our time sings the romance of Homer s Greece cannot expect to sing it so well as Homer did nor will he be singing about us or our romance at all A machine age is something quite different from an heroic age What is true of rapid fire guns stock exchanges and electric motors cannot possibly be true of hand flung javelins and whirring chariot wheels Kipling knows this He has been telling it to us all his life living it all his life in the work he has done What the Anglo Saxon has done he has memorialized And by Anglo Saxon is not meant merely the people of that tight little island on the edge of the Western Ocean Anglo Saxon stands for the English speaking people of all the world who in forms and institutions and traditions are more peculiarly and definitely English than anything else This people Kipling has sung Their sweat and blood and toil have been the motives of his songs but underlying all the motives of his songs is the motive of motives the sum of them all and something more which is one with what underlies all the Anglo Saxon sweat and blood and toil namely the genius of the race And this is the cosmic quality Both that which is true of the race for all time and that which is true of the race for all time applied to this particular time he has caught up and pressed into his art forms He has caught the dominant note of the Anglo Saxon and pressed it into wonderful rhythms which cannot be sung out in a day and which will not be sung out in a day The Anglo Saxon is a pirate a land robber and a sea robber Underneath his thin coating of culture he is what he was in Morgan s time in Drake s time in William s time in Alfred s time The blood and the tradition of Hengist and Horsa are in his veins In battle he is subject to the blood lusts of the Berserkers of old Plunder and booty fascinate him immeasurably The schoolboy of to day dreams the dream of Clive and Hastings The Anglo Saxon is strong of arm and heavy of hand and he possesses a primitive brutality all his own There is a discontent in his blood an unsatisfaction that will not let him rest but sends him adventuring over the sea and among the lands in the midst of the sea He does not know when he is beaten wherefore the term bulldog is attached to him so that all may know his unreasonableness He has some care as to the purity of his ways does not wish for strange gods nor juggle with intellectual phantasmagoria He loves freedom but is dictatorial to others is self willed has boundless energy and does things for himself He is also a master of matter an organizer of law and an administrator of justice And in the nineteenth century he has lived up to his reputation Being the nineteenth century and no other century and in so far different from all other centuries he has expressed himself differently But blood will tell and in the name of God the Bible and Democracy he has gone out over the earth possessing himself of broad lands and fat revenues and conquering by virtue of his sheer pluck and enterprise and superior machinery Now the future centuries seeking to find out what the nineteenth century Anglo Saxon was and what were his works will have small concern with what he did not do and what he would have liked to do These things he did do and for these things will he be remembered His claim on posterity will be that in the nineteenth century he mastered matter his twentieth century claim will be in the highest probability that he organized life but that will be sung by the twentieth century Kiplings or the twenty first century Kiplings Rudyard Kipling of the nineteenth century has sung of things as they are He has seen life as it is taken it up squarely in both his hands and looked upon it What better preachment upon the Anglo Saxon and what he has done can be had than The Bridge Builders what better appraisement than The White Man s Burden As for faith and clean ideals not of children and gods but men in a world of men who has preached them better than he Primarily Kipling has stood for the doer as opposed to the dreamer the doer who lists not to idle songs of empty days but who goes forth and does things with bended back and sweated brow and work hardened hands The most characteristic thing about Kipling is his lover of actuality his intense practicality his proper and necessary respect for the hard headed hard fisted fact And above all he has preached the gospel of work and as potently as Carlyle ever preached For he has preached it not only to those in the high places but to the common men to the great sweating thong of common men who hear and understand yet stand agape at Carlyle s turgid utterance Do the thing to your hand and do it with all your might Never mind what the thing is so long as it is something Do it Do it and remember Tomlinson sexless and soulless Tomlinson who was denied at Heaven s gate The blundering centuries have perseveringly pottered and groped through the dark but it remained for Kipling s century to roll in the sun to formulate in other words the reign of law And of the artists in Kipling s century he of them all has driven the greater measure of law in the more consummate speech Keep ye the Law be swift in all obedience Clear the land of evil drive the road and bridge the ford Make ye sure to each his own That he reap what he hath sown By the peace among Our peoples let men know we serve the Lord And so it runs from McAndrew s Law Order Duty and Restraint to his last least line whether of The Vampire or The Recessional And no prophet out of Israel has cried out more loudly the sins of the people nor called them more awfully to repent But he is vulgar he stirs the puddle of life object the fluttering chirping gentlemen the Tomlinsonian men Well and isn t life vulgar Can you divorce the facts of life Much of good is there and much of ill but who may draw aside his garment and say I am none of them Can you say that the part is greater than the whole that the whole is more or less than the sum of the parts As for the puddle of life the stench is offensive to you Well and what then Do you not live in it Why do you not make it clean Do you clamour for a filter to make clean only your own particular portion And made clean are you wroth because Kipling has stirred it muddy again At least he has stirred it healthily with steady vigour and good will He has not brought to the surface merely its dregs but its most significant values He has told the centuries to come of our lyings and our lusts but he has also told the centuries to come of the seriousness which is underneath our lyings and our lusts And he has told us too and always has he told us to be clean and strong and to walk upright and manlike But he has no sympathy the fluttering gentlemen chirp We admire his art and intellectual brilliancy we all admire his art and intellectual brilliancy his dazzling technique and rare rhythmical sense but he is totally devoid of sympathy Dear Dear What is to be understood by this Should he sprinkle his pages with sympathetic adjectives so many to the paragraph as the country compositor sprinkles commas Surely not The little gentlemen are not quite so infinitesimal as that There have been many tellers of jokes and the greater of them it is recorded never smiled at their own not even in the crucial moment when the audience wavered between laughter and tears And so with Kipling Take The Vampire for instance It has been complained that there is no touch of pity in it for the man and his ruin no sermon on the lesson of it no compassion for the human weakness no indignation at the heartlessness But are we kindergarten children that the tale be told to us in words of one syllable Or are we men and women able to read between the lines what Kipling intended we should read between the lines For some of him lived but the most of him died Is there not here all the excitation in the world for our sorrow our pity our indignation And what more is the function of art than to excite states of consciousness complementary to the thing portrayed The colour of tragedy is red Must the artist also paint in the watery tears and wan faced grief For some of him lived but the most of him died can the heartache of the situation be conveyed more achingly Or were it better that the young man some of him alive but most of him dead should come out before the curtain and deliver a homily to the weeping audience The nineteenth century so far as the Anglo Saxon is concerned was remarkable for two great developments the mastery of matter and the expansion of the race Three great forces operated in it nationalism commercialism democracy the marshalling of the races the merciless remorseless laissez faire of the dominant bourgeoisie and the practical actual working government of men within a very limited equality The democracy of the nineteenth century is not the democracy of which the eighteenth century dreamed It is not the democracy of the Declaration but it is what we have practised and lived that reconciles it to the fact of the lesser breeds without the Law It is of these developments and forces of the nineteenth century that Kipling has sung And the romance of it he has sung that which underlies and transcends objective endeavour which deals with race impulses race deeds and race traditions Even into the steam laden speech of his locomotives has he breathed our life our spirit our significance As he is our mouthpiece so are they his mouthpieces And the romance of the nineteenth century man as he has thus expressed himself in the nineteenth century in shaft and wheel in steel and steam in far journeying and adventuring Kipling has caught up in wondrous songs for the future centuries to sing If the nineteenth century is the century of the Hooligan then is Kipling the voice of the Hooligan as surely as he is the voice of the nineteenth century Who is more representative Is David Harum more representative of the nineteenth century Is Mary Johnston Charles Major or Winston Churchill Is Bret Harte William Dean Howells Gilbert Parker Who of them all is as essentially representative of nineteenth century life When Kipling is forgotten will Robert Louis Stevenson be remembered for his Dr Jekyll and mister Hyde his Kidnapped and his David Balfour Not so His Treasure Island will be a classic to go down with Robinson Crusoe Through the Looking Glass and The Jungle Books He will be remembered for his essays for his letters for his philosophy of life for himself He will be the well beloved as he has been the well beloved But his will be another claim upon posterity than what we are considering For each epoch has its singer As Scott sang the swan song of chivalry and Dickens the burgher fear of the rising merchant class so Kipling as no one else has sung the hymn of the dominant bourgeoisie the war march of the white man round the world the triumphant paean of commercialism and imperialism For that will he be remembered OAKLAND CALIFORNIA October nineteen oh one THE OTHER ANIMALS American journalism has its moments of fantastic hysteria and when it is on the rampage the only thing for a rational man to do is to climb a tree and let the cataclysm go by And so some time ago when the word nature faker was coined I for one climbed into my tree and stayed there I happened to be in Hawaii at the time and a Honolulu reporter elicited the sentiment from me that I thanked God I was not an authority on anything This sentiment was promptly cabled to America in an Associated Press despatch whereupon the American press possibly annoyed because I had not climbed down out of my tree charged me with paying for advertising by cable at a dollar per word the very human way of the American press which when a man refuses to come down and be licked makes faces at him But now that the storm is over let us come and reason together I have been guilty of writing two animal stories two books about dogs The writing of these two stories on my part was in truth a protest against the humanizing of animals of which it seemed to me several animal writers had been profoundly guilty Time and again and many times in my narratives I wrote speaking of my dog heroes He did not think these things he merely did them et cetera And I did this repeatedly to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning but by instinct sensation and emotion and by simple reasoning Also I endeavoured to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research and awoke one day to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature fakers President Roosevelt was responsible for this and he tried to condemn me on two counts one I was guilty of having a big fighting bull dog whip a wolf dog two I was guilty of allowing a lynx to kill a wolf dog in a pitched battle Regarding the second count President Roosevelt was wrong in his field observations taken while reading my book He must have read it hastily for in my story I had the wolf dog kill the lynx Not only did I have my wolf dog kill the lynx but I made him eat the body of the lynx as well Remains only the first count on which to convict me of nature faking and the first count does not charge me with diverging from ascertained facts It is merely a statement of a difference of opinion President Roosevelt does not think a bull dog can lick a wolf dog I think a bull dog can lick a wolf dog And there we are Difference of opinion may make and does make horse racing I can understand that difference of opinion can make dog fighting But what gets me is how difference of opinion regarding the relative fighting merits of a bull dog and a wolf dog makes me a nature faker and President Roosevelt a vindicated and triumphant scientist Then entered John Burroughs to clinch President Roosevelt s judgments In this alliance there is no difference of opinion That Roosevelt can do no wrong is Burroughs s opinion and that Burroughs is always right is Roosevelt s opinion Both are agreed that animals do not reason They assert that all animals below man are automatons and perform actions only of two sorts mechanical and reflex and that in such actions no reasoning enters at all They believe that man is the only animal capable of reasoning and that ever does reason This is a view that makes the twentieth century scientist smile It is not modern at all It is distinctly mediaeval President Roosevelt and John Burroughs in advancing such a view are homocentric in the same fashion that the scholastics of earlier and darker centuries were homocentric Had the world not been discovered to be round until after the births of President Roosevelt and John Burroughs they would have been geocentric as well in their theories of the Cosmos They could not have believed otherwise The stuff of their minds is so conditioned They talk the argot of evolution while they no more understand the essence and the import of evolution than does a South Sea Islander or Sir Oliver Lodge understand the noumena of radio activity Now President Roosevelt is an amateur He may know something of statecraft and of big game shooting he may be able to kill a deer when he sees it and to measure it and weigh it after he has shot it he may be able to observe carefully and accurately the actions and antics of tomtits and snipe and after he has observed it definitely and coherently to convey the information of when the first chipmunk in a certain year and a certain latitude and longitude came out in the spring and chattered and gambolled but that he should be able as an individual observer to analyze all animal life and to synthetize and develop all that is known of the method and significance of evolution would require a vaster credulity for you or me to believe than is required for us to believe the biggest whopper ever told by an unmitigated nature faker No President Roosevelt does not understand evolution and he does not seem to have made much of an attempt to understand evolution Remains John Burroughs who claims to be a thorough going evolutionist Now it is rather hard for a young man to tackle an old man It is the nature of young men to be more controlled in such matters and it is the nature of old men presuming upon the wisdom that is very often erroneously associated with age to do the tackling In this present question of nature faking the old men did the tackling while I as one young man kept quiet a long time But here goes at last And first of all let mister Burroughs s position be stated and stated in his words Why impute reason to an animal if its behaviour can be explained on the theory of instinct Remember these words for they will be referred to later A goodly number of persons seem to have persuaded themselves that animals do reason But instinct suffices for the animals they get along very well without reason Darwin tried hard to convince himself that animals do at times reason in a rudimentary way but Darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist The preceding quotation is tantamount on mister Burroughs s part to a flat denial that animals reason even in a rudimentary way And when mister Burrough denies that animals reason even in a rudimentary way it is equivalent to affirming in accord with the first quotation in this paragraph that instinct will explain every animal act that might be confounded with reason by the unskilled or careless observer Having bitten off this large mouthful mister Burroughs proceeds with serene and beautiful satisfaction to masticate it in the following fashion He cites a large number of instances of purely instinctive actions on the part of animals and triumphantly demands if they are acts of reason He tells of the robin that fought day after day its reflected image in a window pane of the birds in South America that were guilty of drilling clear through a mud wall which they mistook for a solid clay bank of the beaver that cut down a tree four times because it was held at the top by the branches of other trees of the cow that licked the skin of her stuffed calf so affectionately that it came apart whereupon she proceeded to eat the hay with which it was stuffed He tells of the phoebe bird that betrays her nest on the porch by trying to hide it with moss in similar fashion to the way all phoebe birds hide their nests when they are built among rocks He tells of the highhole that repeatedly drills through the clap boards of an empty house in a vain attempt to find a thickness of wood deep enough in which to build its nest He tells of the migrating lemmings of Norway that plunge into the sea and drown in vast numbers because of their instinct to swim lakes and rivers in the course of their migrations And having told a few more instances of like kidney he triumphantly demands Where now is your much vaunted reasoning of the lower animals No schoolboy in a class debate could be guilty of unfairer argument It is equivalent to replying to the assertion that two two four by saying No because twelve four three I have demonstrated my honourable opponent s error When a man attacks your ability as a foot racer promptly prove to him that he was drunk the week before last and the average man in the crowd of gaping listeners will believe that you have convincingly refuted the slander on your fleetness of foot On my honour it will work Try it some time It is done every day mister Burroughs has done it himself and I doubt not pulled the sophistical wool over a great many pairs of eyes No no mister Burroughs you can t disprove that animals reason by proving that they possess instincts But the worst of it is that you have at the same time pulled the wool over your own eyes You have set up a straw man and knocked the stuffing out of him in the complacent belief that it was the reasoning of lower animals you were knocking out of the minds of those who disagreed with you When the highhole perforated the icehouse and let out the sawdust you called him a lunatic But let us be charitable and serious What mister Burroughs instances as acts of instinct certainly are acts of instincts By the same method of logic one could easily adduce a multitude of instinctive acts on the part of man and thereby prove that man is an unreasoning animal But man performs actions of both sorts Between man and the lower animals mister Burroughs finds a vast gulf This gulf divides man from the rest of his kin by virtue of the power of reason that he alone possesses Man is a voluntary agent Animals are automatons The robin fights its reflection in the window pane because it is his instinct to fight and because he cannot reason out the physical laws that make this reflection appear real An animal is a mechanism that operates according to fore ordained rules Wrapped up in its heredity and determined long before it was born is a certain limited capacity of ganglionic response to eternal stimuli These responses have been fixed in the species through adaptation to environment Natural selection has compelled the animal automatically to respond in a fixed manner and a certain way to all the usual external stimuli it encounters in the course of a usual life Thus under usual circumstances it does the usual thing Under unusual circumstances it still does the usual thing wherefore the highhole perforating the ice house is guilty of lunacy of unreason in short To do the unusual thing under unusual circumstances successfully to adjust to a strange environment for which his heredity has not automatically fitted an adjustment mister Burroughs says is impossible He says it is impossible because it would be a non instinctive act and as is well known animals act only through instinct And right here we catch a glimpse of mister Burroughs s cart standing before his horse He has a thesis and though the heavens fall he will fit the facts to the thesis Agassiz in his opposition to evolution had a similar thesis though neither did he fit the facts to it nor did the heavens fall Facts are very disagreeable at times But let us see Let us test mister Burroughs s test of reason and instinct When I was a small boy I had a dog named Rollo According to mister Burroughs Rollo was an automaton responding to external stimuli mechanically as directed by his instincts Now as is well known the development of instinct in animals is a dreadfully slow process There is no known case of the development of a single instinct in domestic animals in all the history of their domestication Whatever instincts they possess they brought with them from the wild thousands of years ago Therefore all Rollo s actions were ganglionic discharges mechanically determined by the instincts that had been developed and fixed in the species thousands of years ago Very well It is clear therefore that in all his play with me he would act in old fashioned ways adjusting himself to the physical and psychical factors in his environment according to the rules of adjustment which had obtained in the wild and which had become part of his heredity Rollo and I did a great deal of rough romping He chased me and I chased him He nipped my legs arms and hands often so hard that I yelled while I rolled him and tumbled him and dragged him about often so strenuously as to make him yelp In the course of the play many variations arose I would make believe to sit down and cry All repentance and anxiety he would wag his tail and lick my face whereupon I would give him the laugh He hated to be laughed at and promptly he would spring for me with good natured menacing jaws and the wild romp would go on I had scored a point Then he hit upon a trick Pursuing him into the woodshed I would find him in a far corner pretending to sulk Now he dearly loved the play and never got enough of it But at first he fooled me I thought I had somehow hurt his feelings and I came and knelt before him petting him and speaking lovingly Promptly in a wild outburst he was up and away tumbling me over on the floor as he dashed out in a mad skurry around the yard He had scored a point After a time it became largely a game of wits I reasoned my acts of course while his were instinctive One day as he pretended to sulk in the corner I glanced out of the woodshed doorway simulated pleasure in face voice and language and greeted one of my schoolboy friends Immediately Rollo forgot to sulk rushed out to see the newcomer and saw empty space The laugh was on him and he knew it and I gave it to him too I fooled him in this way two or three times then be became wise One day I worked a variation Suddenly looking out the door making believe that my eyes had been attracted by a moving form I said coldly as a child educated in turning away bill collectors would say No my father is not at home Like a shot Rollo was out the door He even ran down the alley to the front of the house in a vain attempt to find the man I had addressed He came back sheepishly to endure the laugh and resume the game And now we come to the test I fooled Rollo but how was the fooling made possible What precisely went on in that brain of his According to mister Burroughs who denies even rudimentary reasoning to the lower animals Rollo acted instinctively mechanically responding to the external stimulus furnished by me which led him to believe that a man was outside the door Since Rollo acted instinctively and since all instincts are very ancient tracing back to the pre domestication period we can conclude only that Rollo s wild ancestors at the time this particular instinct was fixed into the heredity of the species must have been in close long continued and vital contact with man the voice of man and the expressions on the face of man But since the instinct must have been developed during the pre domestication period how under the sun could his wild undomesticated ancestors have experienced the close long continued and vital contact with man mister Burroughs says that instinct suffices for the animals that they get along very well without reason But I say what all the poor nature fakers will say that Rollo reasoned He was born into the world a bundle of instincts and a pinch of brain stuff all wrapped around in a framework of bone meat and hide As he adjusted to his environment he gained experiences He remembered these experiences He learned that he mustn t chase the cat kill chickens nor bite little girls dresses He learned that little boys had little boy playmates He learned that men came into back yards He learned that the animal man on meeting with his own kind was given to verbal and facial greeting He learned that when a boy greeted a playmate he did it differently from the way he greeted a man All these he learned and remembered They were so many observations so many propositions if you please Now what went on behind those brown eyes of his inside that pinch of brain stuff when I turned suddenly to the door and greeted an imaginary person outside Instantly out of the thousands of observations stored in his brain came to the front of his consciousness the particular observations connected with this particular situation Next he established a relation between these observations This relation was his conclusion achieved as every psychologist will agree by a definite cell action of his grey matter From the fact that his master turned suddenly toward the door and from the fact that his master s voice facial expression and whole demeanour expressed surprise and delight he concluded that a friend was outside He established a relation between various things and the act of establishing relations between things is an act of reason of rudimentary reason granted but none the less of reason Of course Rollo was fooled But that is no call for us to throw chests about it How often has every last one of us been fooled in precisely similar fashion by another who turned and suddenly addressed an imaginary intruder Here is a case in point that occurred in the West A robber had held up a railroad train He stood in the aisle between the seats his revolver presented at the head of the conductor who stood facing him The conductor was at his mercy But the conductor suddenly looked over the robber s shoulder at the same time saying aloud to an imaginary person standing at the robber s back Don t shoot him Like a flash the robber whirled about to confront this new danger and like a flash the conductor shot him down Show me mister Burroughs where the mental process in the robber s brain was a shade different from the mental processes in Rollo s brain and I ll quit nature faking and join the Trappists Surely when a man s mental process and a dog s mental process are precisely similar the much vaunted gulf of mister Burroughs s fancy has been bridged I had a dog in Oakland His name was Glen His father was Brown a wolf dog that had been brought down from Alaska and his mother was a half wild mountain shepherd dog Neither father nor mother had had any experience with automobiles Glen came from the country a half grown puppy to live in Oakland Immediately he became infatuated with an automobile He reached the culmination of happiness when he was permitted to sit up in the front seat alongside the chauffeur He would spend a whole day at a time on an automobile debauch even going without food Often the machine started directly from inside the barn dashed out the driveway without stopping and was gone Glen got left behind several times The custom was established that whoever was taking the machine out should toot the horn before starting Glen learned the signal No matter where he was or what he was doing when that horn tooted he was off for the barn and up into the front seat One morning while Glen was on the back porch eating his breakfast of mush and milk the chauffeur tooted Glen rushed down the steps into the barn and took his front seat the mush and milk dripping down his excited and happy chops In passing I may point out that in thus forsaking his breakfast for the automobile he was displaying what is called the power of choice a peculiarly lordly attribute that according to mister Burroughs belongs to man alone Yet Glen made his choice between food and fun It was not that Glen wanted his breakfast less but that he wanted his ride more The toot was only a joke The automobile did not start Glen waited and watched Evidently he saw no signs of an immediate start for finally he jumped out of the seat and went back to his breakfast He ate with indecent haste like a man anxious to catch a train Again the horn tooted again he deserted his breakfast and again he sat in the seat and waited vainly for the machine to go They came close to spoiling Glen s breakfast for him for he was kept on the jump between porch and barn Then he grew wise They tooted the horn loudly and insistently but he stayed by his breakfast and finished it Thus once more did he display power of choice incidentally of control for when that horn tooted it was all he could do to refrain from running for the barn The nature faker would analyze what went on in Glen s brain somewhat in the following fashion He had had in his short life experiences that not one of all his ancestors had ever had He had learned that automobiles went fast that once in motion it was impossible for him to get on board that the toot of the horn was a noise that was peculiar to automobiles These were so many propositions Now reasoning can be defined as the act or process of the brain by which from propositions known or assumed new propositions are reached Out of the propositions which I have shown were Glen s and which had become his through the medium of his own observation of the phenomena of life he made the new proposition that when the horn tooted it was time for him to get on board But on the morning I have described the chauffeur fooled Glen Somehow and much to his own disgust his reasoning was erroneous The machine did not start after all But to reason incorrectly is very human The great trouble in all acts of reasoning is to include all the propositions in the problem Glen had included every proposition but one namely the human proposition the joke in the brain of the chauffeur For a number of times Glen was fooled Then he performed another mental act In his problem he included the human proposition the joke in the brain of the chauffeur and he reached the new conclusion that when the horn tooted the automobile was not going to start Basing his action on this conclusion he remained on the porch and finished his breakfast You and I and even mister Burroughs perform acts of reasoning precisely similar to this every day in our lives How mister Burroughs will explain Glen s action by the instinctive theory is beyond me In wildest fantasy even my brain refuses to follow mister Burroughs into the primeval forest where Glen s dim ancestors to the tooting of automobile horns were fixing into the heredity of the breed the particular instinct that would enable Glen a few thousand years later capably to cope with automobiles doctor C J Romanes tells of a female chimpanzee who was taught to count straws up to five She held the straws in her hand exposing the ends to the number requested If she were asked for three she held up three If she were asked for four she held up four All this is a mere matter of training But consider now mister Burroughs what follows When she was asked for five straws and she had only four she doubled one straw exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number She did not do this only once and by accident She did it whenever more straws were asked for than she possessed Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act or was her action the result of blind mechanical instinct If mister Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction he may call doctor Romanes a nature faker and dismiss the incident from his mind The foregoing is a trick of erroneous human reasoning that works very successfully in the United States these days It is certainly a trick of mister Burroughs of which he is guilty with distressing frequency When a poor devil of a writer records what he has seen and when what he has seen does not agree with mister Burroughs s mediaeval theory he calls said writer a nature faker When a man like mister Hornaday comes along mister Burroughs works a variation of the trick on him mister Hornaday has made a close study of the orang in captivity and of the orang in its native state Also he has studied closely many other of the higher animal types Also in the tropics he has studied the lower types of man mister Hornaday is a man of experience and reputation When he was asked if animals reasoned out of all his knowledge on the subject he replied that to ask him such a question was equivalent to asking him if fishes swim Now mister Burroughs has not had much experience in studying the lower human types and the higher animal types Living in a rural district in the state of New York and studying principally birds in that limited habitat he has been in contact neither with the higher animal types nor the lower human types But mister Hornaday s reply is such a facer to him and his homocentric theory that he has to do something And he does it He retorts I suspect that mister Hornaday is a better naturalist than he is a comparative psychologist Exit mister Hornaday Who the devil is mister Hornaday anyway The sage of Slabsides has spoken When Darwin concluded that animals were capable of reasoning in a rudimentary way mister Burroughs laid him out in the same fashion by saying But Darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist and this despite Darwin s long life of laborious research that was not wholly confined to a rural district such as mister Burroughs inhabits in New York mister Burroughs s method of argument is beautiful It reminds one of the man whose pronunciation was vile but who said Damn the dictionary ain t I here And now we come to the mental processes of mister Burroughs to the psychology of the ego if you please mister Burroughs has troubles of his own with the dictionary He violates language from the standpoint both of logic and science Language is a tool and definitions embodied in language should agree with the facts and history of life But mister Burroughs s definitions do not so agree This in turn is not the fault of his education but of his ego To him despite his well exploited and patronizing devotion to them the lower animals are disgustingly low To him affinity and kinship with the other animals is a repugnant thing He will have none of it He is too glorious a personality not to have between him and the other animals a vast and impassable gulf The cause of mister Burroughs s mediaeval view of the other animals is to be found not in his knowledge of those other animals but in the suggestion of his self exalted ego In short mister Burroughs s homocentric theory has been developed out of his homocentric ego and by the misuse of language he strives to make the facts of life agree with his theory After the instances I have cited of actions of animals which are impossible of explanation as due to instinct mister Burroughs may reply Your instances are easily explained by the simple law of association To this I reply first then why did you deny rudimentary reason to animals and why did you state flatly that instinct suffices for the animals And second with great reluctance and with overwhelming humility because of my youth I suggest that you do not know exactly what you do mean by that phrase the simple law of association Your trouble I repeat is with definitions You have grasped that man performs what is called abstract reasoning you have made a definition of abstract reason and betrayed by that great maker of theories the ego you have come to think that all reasoning is abstract and that what is not abstract reason is not reason at all This is your attitude toward rudimentary reason Such a process in one of the other animals must be either abstract or it is not a reasoning process Your intelligence tells you that such a process is not abstract reasoning and your homocentric thesis compels you to conclude that it can be only a mechanical instinctive process Definitions must agree not with egos but with life mister Burroughs goes on the basis that a definition is something hard and fast absolute and eternal He forgets that all the universe is in flux that definitions are arbitrary and ephemeral that they fix for a fleeting instant of time things that in the past were not that in the future will be not that out of the past become and that out of the present pass on to the future and become other things Definitions cannot rule life Definitions cannot be made to rule life Life must rule definitions or else the definitions perish mister Burroughs forgets the evolution of reason He makes a definition of reason without regard to its history and that definition is of reason purely abstract Human reason as we know it to day is not a creation but a growth Its history goes back to the primordial slime that was quick with muddy life its history goes back to the first vitalized inorganic And here are the steps of its ascent from the mud to man simple reflex action compound reflex action memory habit rudimentary reason and abstract reason In the course of the climb thanks to natural selection instinct was evolved Habit is a development in the individual Instinct is a race habit Instinct is blind unreasoning mechanical This was the dividing of the ways in the climb of aspiring life The perfect culmination of instinct we find in the ant heap and the beehive Instinct proved a blind alley But the other path that of reason led on and on even to mister Burroughs and you and me There are no impassable gulfs unless one chooses as mister Burroughs does to ignore the lower human types and the higher animal types and to compare human mind with bird mind It was impossible for life to reason abstractly until speech was developed Equipped with swords with tools of thought in short the slow development of the power to reason in the abstract went on The lowest human types do little or no reasoning in the abstract With every word with every increase in the complexity of thought with every ascertained fact so gained went on action and reaction in the grey matter of the speech discoverer and slowly step by step through hundreds of thousands of years developed the power of reason Place a honey bee in a glass bottle Turn the bottom of the bottle toward a lighted lamp so that the open mouth is away from the lamp Vainly ceaselessly a thousand times undeterred by the bafflement and the pain the bee will hurl himself against the bottom of the bottle as he strives to win to the light That is instinct Place your dog in a back yard and go away He is your dog He loves you He yearns toward you as the bee yearns toward the light He listens to your departing footsteps But the fence is too high Then he turns his back upon the direction in which you are departing and runs around the yard He is frantic with affection and desire But he is not blind He is observant He is looking for a hole under the fence or through the fence or for a place where the fence is not so high He sees a dry goods box standing against the fence Presto He leaps upon it goes over the barrier and tears down the street to overtake you Is that instinct Here in the household where I am writing this is a little Tahitian feeding child He believes firmly that a tiny dwarf resides in the box of my talking machine and that it is the tiny dwarf who does the singing and the talking Not even mister Burroughs will affirm that the child has reached this conclusion by an instinctive process Of course the child reasons the existence of the dwarf in the box How else could the box talk and sing In that child s limited experience it has never encountered a single instance where speech and song were produced otherwise than by direct human agency I doubt not that the dog is considerably surprised when he hears his master s voice coming out of a box The adult savage on his first introduction to a telephone rushes around to the adjoining room to find the man who is talking through the partition Is this act instinctive No Out of his limited experience out of his limited knowledge of physics he reasons that the only explanation possible is that a man is in the other room talking through the partition But that savage cannot be fooled by a hand mirror We must go lower down in the animal scale to the monkey The monkey swiftly learns that the monkey it sees is not in the glass wherefore it reaches craftily behind the glass Is this instinct No It is rudimentary reasoning Lower than the monkey in the scale of brain is the robin and the robin fights its reflection in the window pane Now climb with me for a space From the robin to the monkey where is the impassable gulf and where is the impassable gulf between the monkey and the feeding child between the feeding child and the savage who seeks the man behind the partition ay and between the savage and the astute financiers missus Chadwick fooled and the thousands who were fooled by the Keeley Motor swindle Let us be very humble We who are so very human are very animal Kinship with the other animals is no more repugnant to mister Burroughs than was the heliocentric theory to the priests who compelled Galileo to recant Not correct human reason not the evidence of the ascertained fact but pride of ego was responsible for the repugnance In his stiff necked pride mister Burroughs runs a hazard more humiliating to that pride than any amount of kinship with the other animals When a dog exhibits choice direction control and reason when it is shown that certain mental processes in that dog s brain are precisely duplicated in the brain of man and when mister Burroughs convincingly proves that every action of the dog is mechanical and automatic then by precisely the same arguments can it be proved that the similar actions of man are mechanical and automatic No mister Burroughs though you stand on the top of the ladder of life you must not kick out that ladder from under your feet You must not deny your relatives the other animals Their history is your history and if you kick them to the bottom of the abyss to the bottom of the abyss you go yourself By them you stand or fall What you repudiate in them you repudiate in yourself a pretty spectacle truly of an exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made striving by use of the very reason that was developed by evolution to deny the possession of evolution that developed it This may be good egotism but it is not good science PAPEETE TAHITI March nineteen oh eight THE YELLOW PERIL No more marked contrast

8797_294123_000009_000012	train-clean-100	Everything worked 
none	none	I saw a man mending the road I was in China I came to the city of Antung and lodged with a merchant He was a grain merchant Corn he had hundreds of bushels stored in great bins of stout matting peas and beans in sacks and in the back yard his millstones went round and round grinding out meal Also in his back yard were buildings containing vats sunk into the ground and here the tanners were at work making leather I bought a measure of corn from mine host for my horses and he overcharged me thirty cents I was in China Antung was jammed with Japanese troops 
8797_294123_000010_000007	train-clean-100	It was the thick of war But it did not matter 
8797_294123_000010_000008	train-clean-100	The work of Antung went on just the same 
8797_294123_000010_000009	train-clean-100	The shops were wide open the streets were lined with pedlars

none	none	I dined at a Chinese restaurant cleansed myself at a public bath in a private tub with a small boy to assist in the scrubbing 
8797_294123_000010_000012	train-clean-100	I bought condensed milk bitter canned vegetables bread and cake

8797_294123_000010_000014	train-clean-100	I bought knives forks and spoons granite ware dishes and mugs 
none	none	There were horseshoes and horseshoers A worker in iron realized for me new designs of mine for my tent poles My shoes were sent out to be repaired A barber shampooed my hair

none	none	I was in China 
8797_294123_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The Korean is the perfect type of inefficiency of utter worthlessness The Chinese is the perfect type of industry 
8797_294123_000011_000001	train-clean-100	For sheer work no worker in the world can compare with him 
8797_294123_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Work is the breath of his nostrils 
none	none	It is his solution of existence It is to him what wandering and fighting in far lands and spiritual adventure have been to other peoples 
8797_294123_000011_000005	train-clean-100	Liberty to him epitomizes itself in access to the means of toil 
none	none	To till the soil and labour interminably with rude implements and utensils is all he asks of life and of the powers that be 
8797_294123_000011_000007	train-clean-100	Work is what he desires above all things and he will work at anything for anybody 
none	none	During the taking of the Taku forts he carried scaling ladders at the heads of the storming columns and planted them against the walls He did this not from a sense of patriotism but for the invading foreign devils because they paid him a daily wage of fifty cents He is not frightened by war He accepts it as he does rain and sunshine the changing of the seasons and other natural phenomena He prepares for it endures it and survives it and when the tide of battle sweeps by the thunder of the guns still reverberating in the distant canyons he is seen calmly bending to his usual tasks 
8797_294123_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Nay war itself bears fruits whereof he may pick 
none	none	Before the dead are cold or the burial squads have arrived he is out on the field stripping the mangled bodies collecting the shrapnel and ferreting in the shell holes for slivers and fragments of iron 
8797_294123_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The Chinese is no coward 
none	none	He does not carry away his doors amid windows to the mountains but remains to guard them when alien soldiers occupy his town He does not hide away his chickens and his eggs nor any other commodity he possesses 
8797_294123_000013_000003	train-clean-100	He proceeds at once to offer them for sale 
none	none	Nor is he to be bullied into lowering his price What if the purchaser be a soldier and an alien made cocky by victory and confident by overwhelming force He has two large pears saved over from last year which he will sell for five sen or for the same price three small pears What if one soldier persist in taking away with him three large pears 
8797_294123_000013_000008	train-clean-100	What if there be twenty other soldiers jostling about him 
none	none	He turns over his sack of fruit to another Chinese and races down the street after his pears and the soldier responsible for their flight and he does not return till he has wrenched away one large pear from that soldier s grasp 
8797_294123_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Nor is the Chinese the type of permanence which he has been so often designated 
none	none	He is not so ill disposed toward new ideas and new methods as his history would seem to indicate True his forms customs and methods have been permanent these many centuries but this has been due to the fact that his government was in the hands of the learned classes and that these governing scholars found their salvation lay in suppressing all progressive ideas The ideas behind the Boxer troubles and the outbreaks over the introduction of railroad and other foreign devil machinations have emanated from the minds of the literati and been spread by their pamphlets and propagandists Originality and enterprise have been suppressed in the Chinese for scores of generations Only has remained to him industry and in this has he found the supreme expression of his being On the other hand his susceptibility to new ideas has been well demonstrated wherever he has escaped beyond the restrictions imposed upon him by his government 
8797_294123_000015_000003	train-clean-100	So far as the business man is concerned he has grasped far more clearly the Western code of business the Western ethics of business than has the Japanese 
none	none	He has learned as a matter of course to keep his word or his bond 
8797_294123_000015_000005	train-clean-100	As yet the Japanese business man has failed to understand this When he has signed a time contract and when changing conditions cause him to lose by it the Japanese merchant cannot understand why he should live up to his contract 
none	none	It is beyond his comprehension and repulsive to his common sense that he should live up to his contract and thereby lose money He firmly believes that the changing conditions themselves absolve him And in so far adaptable as he has shown himself to be in other respects he fails to grasp a radically new idea where the Chinese succeeds Here we have the Chinese four hundred millions of him occupying a vast land of immense natural resources resources of a twentieth century age of a machine age resources of coal and iron which are the backbone of commercial civilization 
8797_294123_000016_000001	train-clean-100	He is an indefatigable worker 
8797_294123_000016_000002	train-clean-100	He is not dead to new ideas new methods new systems 
8797_294123_000016_000003	train-clean-100	Under a capable management he can be made to do anything 
8797_294123_000016_000004	train-clean-100	Truly would he of himself constitute the much heralded Yellow Peril were it not for his present management 
8797_294123_000016_000005	train-clean-100	This management his government is set crystallized 
8797_294123_000016_000006	train-clean-100	It is what binds him down to building as his fathers built 
8797_294123_000016_000007	train-clean-100	The governing class entrenched by the precedent and power of centuries and by the stamp it has put upon his mind will never free him 
none	none	It would be the suicide of the governing class and the governing class knows it 
8797_294123_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Comes now the Japanese 
none	none	On the streets of Antung of Feng Wang Chang or of any other Manchurian city the following is a familiar scene One is hurrying home through the dark of the unlighted streets when he comes upon a paper lantern resting on the ground On one side squats a Chinese civilian on his hams on the other side squats a Japanese soldier One dips his forefinger in the dust and writes strange monstrous characters The other nods understanding sweeps the dust slate level with his hand and with his forefinger inscribes similar characters They are talking They cannot speak to each other but they can write Long ago one borrowed the other s written language and long before that untold generations ago they diverged from a common root the ancient Mongol stock There have been changes differentiations brought about by diverse conditions and infusions of other blood but down at the bottom of their being twisted into the fibres of them is a heritage in common a sameness in kind which time has not obliterated The infusion of other blood Malay perhaps has made the Japanese a race of mastery and power a fighting race through all its history a race which has always despised commerce and exalted fighting To day equipped with the finest machines and systems of destruction the Caucasian mind has devised handling machines and systems with remarkable and deadly accuracy this rejuvenescent Japanese race has embarked on a course of conquest the goal of which no man knows The head men of Japan are dreaming ambitiously and the people are dreaming blindly a Napoleonic dream And to this dream the Japanese clings and will cling with bull dog tenacity The soldier shouting Nippon Banzai on the walls of Wiju the widow at home in her paper house committing suicide so that her only son her sole support may go to the front are both expressing the unanimity of the dream 
8797_294123_000020_000000	train-clean-100	The late disturbance in the Far East marked the clashing of the dreams for the Slav too is dreaming greatly 
8797_294123_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Granting that the Japanese can hurl back the Slav and that the two great branches of the Anglo Saxon race do not despoil him of his spoils the Japanese dream takes on substantiality 
none	none	Japan s population is no larger because her people have continually pressed against the means of subsistence But given poor empty Korea for a breeding colony and Manchuria for a granary and at once the Japanese begins to increase by leaps and bounds Even so he would not of himself constitute a Brown Peril He has not the time in which to grow and realize the dream 
8797_294123_000021_000002	train-clean-100	He is only forty five millions and so fast does the economic exploitation of the planet hurry on the planet s partition amongst the Western peoples that before he could attain the stature requisite to menace he would see the Western giants in possession of the very stuff of his dream 
none	none	The menace to the Western world lies not in the little brown man but in the four hundred millions of yellow men should the little brown man undertake their management The Chinese is not dead to new ideas he is an efficient worker makes a good soldier and is wealthy in the essential materials of a machine age 
8797_294123_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Under a capable management he will go far 
none	none	The Japanese is prepared and fit to undertake this management Not only has he proved himself an apt imitator of Western material progress a sturdy worker and a capable organizer but he is far more fit to manage the Chinese than are we The baffling enigma of the Chinese character is no baffling enigma to him He understands as we could never school ourselves nor hope to understand Their mental processes are largely the same 
8797_294123_000022_000007	train-clean-100	He thinks with the same thought symbols as does the Chinese and he thinks in the same peculiar grooves 
8797_294123_000022_000008	train-clean-100	He goes on where we are balked by the obstacles of incomprehension 
8797_294123_000022_000009	train-clean-100	He takes the turning which we cannot perceive twists around the obstacle and presto is out of sight in the ramifications of the Chinese mind where we cannot follow 
8797_294123_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The Chinese has been called the type of permanence and well he has merited it dozing as he has through the ages 
none	none	And as truly was the Japanese the type of permanence up to a generation ago when he suddenly awoke and startled the world with a rejuvenescence the like of which the world had never seen before The ideas of the West were the leaven which quickened the Japanese and the ideas of the West transmitted by the Japanese mind into ideas Japanese may well make the leaven powerful enough to quicken the Chinese We have had Africa for the Afrikander and at no distant day we shall hear Asia for the Asiatic Four hundred million indefatigable workers deft intelligent and unafraid to die aroused and rejuvenescent managed and guided by forty five million additional human beings who are splendid fighting animals scientific and modern constitute that menace to the Western world which has been well named the Yellow Peril The possibility of race adventure has not passed away

8797_294123_000024_000002	train-clean-100	The Slav is just girding himself up to begin 
none	none	Why may not the yellow and the brown start out on an adventure as tremendous as our own and more strikingly unique The ultimate success of such an adventure the Western mind refuses to consider 
8797_294123_000025_000001	train-clean-100	It is not the nature of life to believe itself weak 
8797_294123_000025_000002	train-clean-100	There is such a thing as race egotism as well as creature egotism and a very good thing it is 
8797_294123_000025_000003	train-clean-100	In the first place the Western world will not permit the rise of the yellow peril 
none	none	It is firmly convinced that it will not permit the yellow and the brown to wax strong and menace its peace and comfort It advances this idea with persistency and delivers itself of long arguments showing how and why this menace will not be permitted to arise To day far more voices are engaged in denying the yellow peril than in prophesying it 
8797_294123_000025_000005	train-clean-100	The Western world is warned if not armed against the possibility of it 
none	none	In the second place there is a weakness inherent in the brown man which will bring his adventure to naught 
8797_294123_000026_000001	train-clean-100	From the West he has borrowed all our material achievement and passed our ethical achievement by 
none	none	Our engines of production and destruction he has made his What was once solely ours he now duplicates rivalling our merchants in the commerce of the East thrashing the Russian on sea and land 
8797_294123_000026_000004	train-clean-100	A marvellous imitator truly but imitating us only in things material 
8797_294123_000026_000005	train-clean-100	Things spiritual cannot be imitated they must be felt and lived woven into the very fabric of life and here the Japanese fails 
8797_294123_000027_000000	train-clean-100	It required no revolution of his nature to learn to calculate the range and fire a field gun or to march the goose step 
8797_294123_000027_000001	train-clean-100	It was a mere matter of training 
8797_294123_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Our material achievement is the product of our intellect 
8797_294123_000027_000003	train-clean-100	It is knowledge and knowledge like coin is interchangeable 
8797_294123_000027_000004	train-clean-100	It is not wrapped up in the heredity of the new born child but is something to be acquired afterward 
none	none	Not so with our soul stuff which is the product of an evolution which goes back to the raw beginnings of the race 
8797_294123_000027_000006	train-clean-100	Our soul stuff is not a coin to be pocketed by the first chance comer 
none	none	The Japanese cannot pocket it any more than he can thrill to short Saxon words or we can thrill to Chinese hieroglyphics 
8797_294123_000027_000008	train-clean-100	The leopard cannot change its spots nor can the Japanese nor can we 
8797_294123_000027_000009	train-clean-100	We are thumbed by the ages into what we are and by no conscious inward effort can we in a day rethumb ourselves 
none	none	Nor can the Japanese in a day or a generation rethumb himself in our image Back of our own great race adventure back of our robberies by sea and land our lusts and violences and all the evil things we have done there is a certain integrity a sternness of conscience a melancholy responsibility of life a sympathy and comradeship and warm human feel which is ours indubitably ours and which we cannot teach to the Oriental as we would teach logarithms or the trajectory of projectiles That we have groped for the way of right conduct and agonized over the soul betokens our spiritual endowment 
8797_294123_000028_000001	train-clean-100	Though we have strayed often and far from righteousness the voices of the seers have always been raised and we have harked back to the bidding of conscience 
8797_294123_000028_000002	train-clean-100	The colossal fact of our history is that we have made the religion of Jesus Christ our religion 
8797_294123_000028_000003	train-clean-100	No matter how dark in error and deed ours has been a history of spiritual struggle and endeavour 
none	none	We are pre eminently a religious race which is another way of saying that we are a right seeking race What do you think of the Japanese was asked an American woman after she had lived some time in Japan
8797_294123_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 It seems to me that they have no soul was her answer 
8797_294123_000030_000000	train-clean-100	This must not be taken to mean that the Japanese is without soul 
none	none	But it serves to illustrate the enormous difference between their souls and this woman s soul 
8797_294123_000030_000002	train-clean-100	There was no feel no speech no recognition 
8797_294123_000030_000003	train-clean-100	This Western soul did not dream that the Eastern soul existed it was so different so totally different 
none	none	Religion as a battle for the right in our sense of right as a yearning and a strife for spiritual good and purity is unknown to the Japanese 
8797_294123_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Measured by what religion means to us the Japanese is a race without religion 
none	none	Yet it has a religion and who shall say that it is not as great a religion as ours nor as efficacious 
8797_294123_000032_000002	train-clean-100	As one Japanese has written 
8797_294123_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Our reflection brought into prominence not so much the moral as the national consciousness of the individual 
8797_294123_000033_000001	train-clean-100	To us the country is more than land and soil from which to mine gold or reap grain it is the sacred abode of the gods the spirit of our forefathers to us the Emperor is more than the Arch Constable of a Reichsstaat or even the Patron of a Kulturstaat he is the bodily representative of heaven on earth blending in his person its power and its mercy 
8797_294123_000034_000000	train-clean-100	The religion of Japan is practically a worship of the State itself Patriotism is the expression of this worship 
8797_294123_000034_000001	train-clean-100	The Japanese mind does not split hairs as to whether the Emperor is Heaven incarnate or the State incarnate 
8797_294123_000034_000002	train-clean-100	So far as the Japanese are concerned the Emperor lives is himself deity 
8797_294123_000034_000003	train-clean-100	The Emperor is the object to live for and to die for The Japanese is not an individualist 
8797_294123_000034_000004	train-clean-100	He has developed national consciousness instead of moral consciousness 
none	none	He is not interested in his own moral welfare except in so far as it is the welfare of the State The honour of the individual per se does not exist 
8797_294123_000034_000006	train-clean-100	Only exists the honour of the State which is his honour 
8797_294123_000034_000007	train-clean-100	He does not look upon himself as a free agent working out his own personal salvation 
none	none	Spiritual agonizing is unknown to him 
8797_294123_000034_000009	train-clean-100	He has a sense of calm trust in fate a quiet submission to the inevitable a stoic composure in sight of danger or calamity a disdain of life and friendliness with death He relates himself to the State as amongst bees the worker is related to the hive himself nothing the State everything his reasons for existence the exaltation and glorification of the State 
8797_294123_000035_000000	train-clean-100	The most admired quality to day of the Japanese is his patriotism 
none	none	The Western world is in rhapsodies over it unwittingly measuring the Japanese patriotism by its own conceptions of patriotism
8797_294123_000035_000002	train-clean-100	 For God my country and the Czar cries the Russian patriot but in the Japanese mind there is no differentiation between the three 
none	none	The Emperor is the Emperor and God and country as well 
8797_294123_000035_000004	train-clean-100	The patriotism of the Japanese is blind and unswerving loyalty to what is practically an absolutism 
8797_294123_000035_000005	train-clean-100	The Emperor can do no wrong nor can the five ambitious great men who have his ear and control the destiny of Japan 
8797_294123_000036_000000	train-clean-100	No great race adventure can go far nor endure long which has no deeper foundation than material success no higher prompting than conquest for conquest s sake and mere race glorification 
8797_294123_000036_000001	train-clean-100	To go far and to endure it must have behind it an ethical impulse a sincerely conceived righteousness 
8797_294123_000036_000002	train-clean-100	But it must be taken into consideration that the above postulate is itself a product of Western race egotism urged by our belief in our own righteousness and fostered by a faith in ourselves which may be as erroneous as are most fond race fancies 
8797_294123_000036_000003	train-clean-100	So be it 
8797_294123_000036_000004	train-clean-100	The world is whirling faster to day than ever before

Early I discovered enthusiasm ambition and ideals and to satisfy these became the problem of my child life My environment was crude and rough and raw I had no outlook but an uplook rather My place in society was at the bottom Here life offered nothing but sordidness and wretchedness both of the flesh and the spirit for here flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented Above me towered the colossal edifice of society and to my mind the only way out was up Into this edifice I early resolved to climb Up above men wore black clothes and boiled shirts and women dressed in beautiful gowns Also there were good things to eat and there was plenty to eat This much for the flesh Then there were the things of the spirit Up above me I knew were unselfishnesses of the spirit clean and noble thinking keen intellectual living I knew all this because I read Seaside Library novels in which with the exception of the villains and adventuresses all men and women thought beautiful thoughts spoke a beautiful tongue and performed glorious deeds In short as I accepted the rising of the sun I accepted that up above me was all that was fine and noble and gracious all that gave decency and dignity to life all that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and misery But it is not particularly easy for one to climb up out of the working class especially if he is handicapped by the possession of ideals and illusions I lived on a ranch in California and was hard put to find the ladder whereby to climb I early inquired the rate of interest on invested money and worried my child s brain into an understanding of the virtues and excellences of that remarkable invention of man compound interest Further I ascertained the current rates of wages for workers of all ages and the cost of living From all this data I concluded that if I began immediately and worked and saved until I was fifty years of age I could then stop working and enter into participation in a fair portion of the delights and goodnesses that would then be open to me higher up in society Of course I resolutely determined not to marry while I quite forgot to consider at all that great rock of disaster in the working class world sickness But the life that was in me demanded more than a meagre existence of scraping and scrimping Also at ten years of age I became a newsboy on the streets of a city and found myself with a changed uplook All about me were still the same sordidness and wretchedness and up above me was still the same paradise waiting to be gained but the ladder whereby to climb was a different one It was now the ladder of business Why save my earnings and invest in government bonds when by buying two newspapers for five cents with a turn of the wrist I could sell them for ten cents and double my capital The business ladder was the ladder for me and I had a vision of myself becoming a bald headed and successful merchant prince Alas for visions When I was sixteen I had already earned the title of prince But this title was given me by a gang of cut throats and thieves by whom I was called The Prince of the Oyster Pirates And at that time I had climbed the first rung of the business ladder I was a capitalist I owned a boat and a complete oyster pirating outfit I had begun to exploit my fellow creatures I had a crew of one man As captain and owner I took two thirds of the spoils and gave the crew one third though the crew worked just as hard as I did and risked just as much his life and liberty This one rung was the height I climbed up the business ladder One night I went on a raid amongst the Chinese fishermen Ropes and nets were worth dollars and cents It was robbery I grant but it was precisely the spirit of capitalism The capitalist takes away the possessions of his fellow creatures by means of a rebate or of a betrayal of trust or by the purchase of senators and supreme court judges I was merely crude That was the only difference I used a gun But my crew that night was one of those inefficients against whom the capitalist is wont to fulminate because forsooth such inefficients increase expenses and reduce dividends My crew did both What of his carelessness he set fire to the big mainsail and totally destroyed it There weren t any dividends that night and the Chinese fishermen were richer by the nets and ropes we did not get I was bankrupt unable just then to pay sixty five dollars for a new mainsail I left my boat at anchor and went off on a bay pirate boat on a raid up the Sacramento River While away on this trip another gang of bay pirates raided my boat They stole everything even the anchors and later on when I recovered the drifting hulk I sold it for twenty dollars I had slipped back the one rung I had climbed and never again did I attempt the business ladder From then on I was mercilessly exploited by other capitalists I had the muscle and they made money out of it while I made but a very indifferent living out of it I was a sailor before the mast a longshoreman a roustabout I worked in canneries and factories and laundries I mowed lawns and cleaned carpets and washed windows And I never got the full product of my toil I looked at the daughter of the cannery owner in her carriage and knew that it was my muscle in part that helped drag along that carriage on its rubber tyres I looked at the son of the factory owner going to college and knew that it was my muscle that helped in part to pay for the wine and good fellowship he enjoyed But I did not resent this It was all in the game They were the strong Very well I was strong I would carve my way to a place amongst them and make money out of the muscles of other men I was not afraid of work I loved hard work I would pitch in and work harder than ever and eventually become a pillar of society And just then as luck would have it I found an employer that was of the same mind I was willing to work and he was more than willing that I should work I thought I was learning a trade In reality I had displaced two men I thought he was making an electrician out of me as a matter of fact he was making fifty dollars per month out of me The two men I had displaced had received forty dollars each per month I was doing the work of both for thirty dollars per month This employer worked me nearly to death A man may love oysters but too many oysters will disincline him toward that particular diet And so with me Too much work sickened me I did not wish ever to see work again I fled from work I became a tramp begging my way from door to door wandering over the United States and sweating bloody sweats in slums and prisons I had been born in the working class and I was now at the age of eighteen beneath the point at which I had started I was down in the cellar of society down in the subterranean depths of misery about which it is neither nice nor proper to speak I was in the pit the abyss the human cesspool the shambles and the charnel house of our civilization This is the part of the edifice of society that society chooses to ignore Lack of space compels me here to ignore it and I shall say only that the things I there saw gave me a terrible scare I was scared into thinking I saw the naked simplicities of the complicated civilization in which I lived Life was a matter of food and shelter In order to get food and shelter men sold things The merchant sold shoes the politician sold his manhood and the representative of the people with exceptions of course sold his trust while nearly all sold their honour Women too whether on the street or in the holy bond of wedlock were prone to sell their flesh All things were commodities all people bought and sold The one commodity that labour had to sell was muscle The honour of labour had no price in the marketplace Labour had muscle and muscle alone to sell But there was a difference a vital difference Shoes and trust and honour had a way of renewing themselves They were imperishable stocks Muscle on the other hand did not renew As the shoe merchant sold shoes he continued to replenish his stock But there was no way of replenishing the labourer s stock of muscle The more he sold of his muscle the less of it remained to him It was his one commodity and each day his stock of it diminished In the end if he did not die before he sold out and put up his shutters He was a muscle bankrupt and nothing remained to him but to go down into the cellar of society and perish miserably I learned further that brain was likewise a commodity It too was different from muscle A brain seller was only at his prime when he was fifty or sixty years old and his wares were fetching higher prices than ever But a labourer was worked out or broken down at forty five or fifty I had been in the cellar of society and I did not like the place as a habitation The pipes and drains were unsanitary and the air was bad to breathe If I could not live on the parlour floor of society I could at any rate have a try at the attic It was true the diet there was slim but the air at least was pure So I resolved to sell no more muscle and to become a vendor of brains Then began a frantic pursuit of knowledge I returned to California and opened the books While thus equipping myself to become a brain merchant it was inevitable that I should delve into sociology There I found in a certain class of books scientifically formulated the simple sociological concepts I had already worked out for myself Other and greater minds before I was born had worked out all that I had thought and a vast deal more I discovered that I was a socialist The socialists were revolutionists inasmuch as they struggled to overthrow the society of the present and out of the material to build the society of the future I too was a socialist and a revolutionist I joined the groups of working class and intellectual revolutionists and for the first time came into intellectual living Here I found keen flashing intellects and brilliant wits for here I met strong and alert brained withal horny handed members of the working class unfrocked preachers too wide in their Christianity for any congregation of Mammon worshippers professors broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class and flung out because they were quick with knowledge which they strove to apply to the affairs of mankind Here I found also warm faith in the human glowing idealism sweetnesses of unselfishness renunciation and martyrdom all the splendid stinging things of the spirit Here life was clean noble and alive Here life rehabilitated itself became wonderful and glorious and I was glad to be alive I was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire All about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine all fire and dew with before my eyes ever burning and blazing the Holy Grail Christ s own Grail the warm human long suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last And I poor foolish I deemed all this to be a mere foretaste of the delights of living I should find higher above me in society I had lost many illusions since the day I read Seaside Library novels on the California ranch I was destined to lose many of the illusions I still retained As a brain merchant I was a success Society opened its portals to me I entered right in on the parlour floor and my disillusionment proceeded rapidly I sat down to dinner with the masters of society and with the wives and daughters of the masters of society The women were gowned beautifully I admit but to my naive surprise I discovered that they were of the same clay as all the rest of the women I had known down below in the cellar The colonel s lady and Judy O Grady were sisters under their skins and gowns It was not this however so much as their materialism that shocked me It is true these beautifully gowned beautiful women prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic And they were so sentimentally selfish They assisted in all kinds of sweet little charities and informed one of the fact while all the time the food they ate and the beautiful clothes they wore were bought out of dividends stained with the blood of child labour and sweated labour and of prostitution itself When I mentioned such facts expecting in my innocence that these sisters of Judy O Grady would at once strip off their blood dyed silks and jewels they became excited and angry and read me preachments about the lack of thrift the drink and the innate depravity that caused all the misery in society s cellar When I mentioned that I couldn t quite see that it was the lack of thrift the intemperance and the depravity of a half starved child of six that made it work twelve hours every night in a Southern cotton mill these sisters of Judy O Grady attacked my private life and called me an agitator as though that forsooth settled the argument Nor did I fare better with the masters themselves I had expected to find men who were clean noble and alive whose ideals were clean noble and alive I went about amongst the men who sat in the high places the preachers the politicians the business men the professors and the editors I ate meat with them drank wine with them automobiled with them and studied them It is true I found many that were clean and noble but with rare exceptions they were not alive I do verily believe I could count the exceptions on the fingers of my two hands Where they were not alive with rottenness quick with unclean life there were merely the unburied dead clean and noble like well preserved mummies but not alive In this connection I may especially mention the professors I met the men who live up to that decadent university ideal the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence I met men who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in their diatribes against war and who put rifles in the hands of Pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories I met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize fighting and who at the same time were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babies than even red handed Herod had killed I talked in hotels and clubs and homes and Pullmans and steamer chairs with captains of industry and marvelled at how little travelled they were in the realm of intellect On the other hand I discovered that their intellect in the business sense was abnormally developed Also I discovered that their morality where business was concerned was nil This delicate aristocratic featured gentleman was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans This gentleman who collected fine editions and was an especial patron of literature paid blackmail to a heavy jowled black browed boss of a municipal machine This editor who published patent medicine advertisements and did not dare print the truth in his paper about said patent medicines for fear of losing the advertising called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I told him that his political economy was antiquated and that his biology was contemporaneous with Pliny This senator was the tool and the slave the little puppet of a gross uneducated machine boss so was this governor and this supreme court judge and all three rode on railroad passes This man talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal This man a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution This man who endowed chairs in universities perjured himself in courts of law over a matter of dollars and cents And this railroad magnate broke his word as a gentleman and a Christian when he granted a secret rebate to one of two captains of industry locked together in a struggle to the death It was the same everywhere crime and betrayal betrayal and crime men who were alive but who were neither clean nor noble men who were clean and noble but who were not alive Then there was a great hopeless mass neither noble nor alive but merely clean It did not sin positively nor deliberately but it did sin passively and ignorantly by acquiescing in the current immorality and profiting by it Had it been noble and alive it would not have been ignorant and it would have refused to share in the profits of betrayal and crime I discovered that I did not like to live on the parlour floor of society Intellectually I was as bored Morally and spiritually I was sickened I remembered my intellectuals and idealists my unfrocked preachers broken professors and clean minded class conscious working men I remembered my days and nights of sunshine and starshine where life was all a wild sweet wonder a spiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance And I saw before me ever blazing and burning the Holy Grail So I went back to the working class in which I had been born and where I belonged I care no longer to climb The imposing edifice of society above my head holds no delights for me It is the foundation of the edifice that interests me There I am content to labour crowbar in hand shoulder to shoulder with intellectuals idealists and class conscious working men getting a solid pry now and again and setting the whole edifice rocking Some day when we get a few more hands and crowbars to work we ll topple it over along with all its rotten life and unburied dead its monstrous selfishness and sodden materialism Then we ll cleanse the cellar and build a new habitation for mankind in which there will be no parlour floor in which all the rooms will be bright and airy and where the air that is breathed will be clean noble and alive Such is my outlook I look forward to a time when man shall progress upon something worthier and higher than his stomach when there will be a finer incentive to impel men to action than the incentive of to day which is the incentive of the stomach I retain my belief in the nobility and excellence of the human I believe that spiritual sweetness and unselfishness will conquer the gross gluttony of to day And last of all my faith is in the working class As some Frenchman has said The stairway of time is ever echoing with the wooden shoe going up the polished boot descending NEWTON IOWA November nineteen oh five END OF THE PROJECT
