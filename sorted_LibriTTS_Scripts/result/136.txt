Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson To Alison Cunningham From Her Boy For the long nights you lay awake And watched for my unworthy sake For your most comfortable hand That led me through the uneven land For all the story books you read For all the pains you comforted For all you pitied all you bore In sad and happy days of yore My second Mother my first Wife The angel of my infant life From the sick child now well and old Take nurse the little book you hold And grant it Heaven that all who read May find as dear a nurse at need And every child who lists my rhyme In the bright

Child VI To Any Reader A Child s Garden of Verses I Bed in Summer In winter I get up at night And dress by yellow candle light In summer quite the other way I have to go to bed by day I have to go to bed and see The birds still hopping on the tree Or hear the grown up people s feet Still going past me in the street And does it not seem hard to you When all the sky is clear and blue And I should like so much to play To have to go to bed by day II A Thought It is very nice to think The world is full of meat and drink With little children saying grace In every Christian kind of place III At the Sea Side When I was down beside the sea A wooden spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore My holes were empty like a cup In every hole the sea came up Till it could come no more IV Young Night Thought All night long and every night When my mama puts out the light I see the people marching by As plain as day before my eye Armies and emperor and kings All carrying different kinds of things And marching in so grand a way You never saw the like by day So fine a show was never seen At the great circus on the green For every kind of beast and man Is marching in that caravan As first they move a little slow But still the faster on they go And still beside me close I keep Until we reach the town of Sleep V Whole Duty of Children A child should always say what s true And speak when he is spoken to And behave mannerly at table At least as far as he is able VI Rain The rain is falling all around It falls on field and tree It rains on the umbrellas here And on the ships at sea VII Pirate Story Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing Three of us abroad in the basket on the lea Winds are in the air they are blowing in the spring And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea Where shall we adventure to day that we re afloat Wary of the weather and steering by a star Shall it be to Africa a steering of the boat To Providence or Babylon or off to Malabar Hi but here s a squadron a rowing on the sea Cattle on the meadow a charging with a roar Quick and we ll escape them they re as mad as they can be The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore VIII Foreign Lands Up into the cherry tree Who should climb but little me I held the trunk with both my hands And looked abroad in foreign lands I saw the next door garden lie Adorned with flowers before my eye And many pleasant places more That I had never seen before I saw the dimpling river pass And be the sky s blue looking glass The dusty roads go up and down With people tramping in to town If I could find a higher tree Farther and farther I should see To where the grown up river slips Into the sea among the ships To where the roads on either hand Lead onward into fairy land Where all the children dine at five And all the playthings come alive IX Windy Nights Whenever the moon and stars are set Whenever the wind is high All night long in the dark and wet A man goes riding by Late in the night when the fires are out Why does he gallop and gallop about Whenever the trees are crying aloud And ships are tossed at sea By on the highway low and loud By at the gallop goes he By at the gallop he goes and then By he comes back at the gallop again X Travel I should like to rise and go Where the golden apples grow Where below another sky Parrot islands anchored lie And watched by cockatoos and goats Lonely Crusoes building boats Where in sunshine reaching out Eastern cities miles about Are with mosque and minaret Among sandy gardens set And the rich goods from near and far Hang for sale in the bazaar Where the Great Wall round China goes And on one side the desert blows And with the voice and bell and drum Cities on the other hum Where are forests hot as fire Wide as England tall as a spire Full of apes and cocoa nuts And the negro hunters huts Where the knotty crocodile Lies and blinks in the Nile And the red flamingo flies Hunting fish before his eyes Where in jungles near and far Man devouring tigers are Lying close and giving ear Lest the hunt be drawing near Or a comer by be seen Swinging in the palanquin Where among the desert sands Some deserted city stands All its children sweep and prince Grown to manhood ages since Not a foot in street or house Not a stir of child or mouse And when kindly falls the night In all the town no spark of light There I ll come when I m a man With a camel caravan Light a fire in the gloom Of some dusty dining room See the pictures on the walls Heroes fights and festivals And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys XI Singing Of speckled eggs the birdie sings And nests among the trees The sailor sings of ropes and things In ships upon the seas The children sing in far Japan The children sing in Spain The organ with the organ man Is singing in the rain XII Looking Forward When I am grown to man s estate I shall be very proud and great And tell the other girls and boys Not to meddle with my toys XIII A Good Play We built a ship upon the stairs All made of the back bedroom chairs And filled it full of sofa pillows To go a sailing on the billows We took a saw and several nails And water in the nursery pails And Tom said Let us also take An apple and a slice of cake Which was enough for Tom and me To go a sailing on till tea We sailed along for days and days And had the very best of plays But Tom fell out and hurt his knee So there was no one left but me XIV Where Go the Boats Dark brown is the river Golden is the sand It flows along for ever With trees on either hand Green leaves a floating Castles of the foam Boats of mine a boating Where will all come home On goes the river And out past the mill Away down the valley Away down the hill Away down the river A hundred miles or more Other little children Shall bring my boats ashore XV Auntie s Skirts Whenever Auntie moves around Her dresses make a curious sound They trail behind her up the floor And trundle after through the door XVI The Land of Counterpane When I was sick and lay a bed I had two pillows at my head And all my toys beside me lay To keep me happy all the day And sometimes for an hour or so I watched my leaden soldiers go With different uniforms and drills Among the bed clothes through the hills And sometimes sent my ships in fleets All up and down among the sheets Or brought my trees and houses out And planted cities all about I was the giant great and still That sits upon the pillow hill And sees before him dale and plain The pleasant land of counterpane XVII The Land of Nod From breakfast on through all the day At home among my friends I stay But every night I go abroad Afar into the land of Nod All by myself I have to go With none to tell me what to do All alone beside the streams And up the mountain sides of dreams The strangest things are these for me Both things to eat and things to see And many frightening sights abroad Till morning in the land of Nod Try as I like to find the way I never can get back by day Nor can remember plain and clear The curious music that I hear XVIII My Shadow I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me And what can be the use of him is more than I can see He is very very like me from the heels up to the head And I see him jump before me when I jump into my bed The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow Not at all like proper children which is always very slow For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india rubber ball And he sometimes goes so little that there s none of him at all He hasn t got a notion of how children ought to play And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way He stays so close behind me he s a coward you can see I d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me One morning very early before the sun was up I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup But my lazy little shadow like an arrant sleepy head Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed XIX System Every night my prayers I say And get my dinner every day And every day that I ve been good I get an orange after food The child that is not clean and neat With lots of toys and things to eat He is a naughty child I m sure Or else his dear papa is poor XX A Good Boy I woke before the morning I was happy all the day I never said an ugly word but smiled and stuck to play And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood And I am very happy for I know that I ve been good My bed is waiting cool and fresh with linen smooth and fair And I must be off to sleepsin by and not forget my prayer I know that till to morrow I shall see the sun arise No ugly dream shall fright my mind no ugly sight my eyes But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn XXI Escape at Bedtime The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out Through the blinds and the windows and bars And high overhead and all moving about There were thousands of millions of stars There ne er were such thousands of leaves on a tree Nor of people in church or the Park As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me And that glittered and winked in the dark The Dog and the Plough and the Hunter and all And the star of the sailor and Mars These shown in the sky and the pail by the wall Would be half full of water and stars They saw me at last and they chased me with cries And they soon had me packed into bed But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes And the stars going round in my head XXII Marching Song Bring the comb and play upon it Marching here we come Willie cocks his highland bonnet Johnnie beats the drum Mary Jane commands the party Peter leads the rear Feet in time alert and hearty Each a Grenadier All in the most martial manner Marching double quick While the napkin like a banner Waves upon the stick Here s enough of fame and pillage Great commander Jane Now that we ve been round the village Let s go home again XXIII The Cow The friendly cow all red and white I love with all my heart She gives me cream with all her might To eat with apple tart She wanders lowing here and there And yet she cannot stray All in the pleasant open air The pleasant light of day And blown by all the winds that pass And wet with all the showers She walks among the meadow grass And eats the meadow flowers XXIV Happy Thought The world is so full of a number of things I m sure we should all be as happy as kings XXV The Wind I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky And all around I heard you pass Like ladies skirts across the grass O wind a blowing all day long O wind that sings so loud a song I saw the different things you did But always you yourself you hid I felt you push I heard you call I could not see yourself at all O wind a blowing all day long O wind that sings so loud a song O you that are so strong and cold O blower are you young or old Are you a beast of field and tree Or just a stronger child than me O wind a blowing all day long O wind that sings so loud a song XXVI Keepsake Mill Over the borders a sin without pardon Breaking the branches and crawling below Out through the breach in the wall of the garden Down by the banks of the river we go Here is a mill with the humming of thunder Here is the weir with the wonder of foam Here is the sluice with the race running under Marvellous places though handy to home Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller Stiller the note of the birds on the hill Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill Years may go by and the wheel in the river Wheel as it wheels for us children to day Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever Long after all of the boys are away Home for the Indies and home from the ocean Heroes and soldiers we all will come home Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion Turning and churning that river to foam You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled I with your marble of Saturday last Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled Here we shall meet and remember the past XXVII Good and Bad Children Children you are very little And your bones are very brittle If you would grow great and stately You must try to walk sedately You must still be bright and quiet And content with simple diet And remain through all bewild ring Innocent and honest children Happy hearts and happy faces Happy play in grassy places That was how in ancient ages Children grew to kings and sages But the unkind and the unruly And the sort who eat unduly They must never hope for glory Theirs is quite a different story Cruel children crying babies All grow up as geese and gabies Hated as their age increases By their nephews and their nieces XXVIII Foreign Children Little Indian Sioux or Crow Little frosty Eskimo Little Turk or Japanee Oh don t you wish that you were me You have seen the scarlet trees And the lions over seas You have eaten ostrich eggs And turned the turtles off their legs Such a life is very fine But it s not so nice as mine You must often as you trod Have wearied NOT to be abroad You have curious things to eat I am fed on proper meat You must dwell upon the foam But I am safe and live at home Little Indian Sioux or Crow Little frosty Eskimo Little Turk or Japanee Oh don t you wish that you were me XXIX The Sun Travels The sun is not a bed when I At night upon my pillow lie Still round the earth his way he takes And morning after morning makes While here at home in shining day We round the sunny garden play Each little Indian sleepy head Is being kissed and put to bed And when at eve I rise from tea Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea And all the children in the west Are getting up and being dressed XXX The Lamplighter My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky It s time to take the window to see Leerie going by For every night at teatime and before you take your seat With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea And my papa s a banker and as rich as he can be But I when I am stronger and can choose what I m to do O Leerie I ll go round at night and light the lamps with you For we are very lucky with a lamp before the door And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more And oh before you hurry by with ladder and with light O Leerie see a little child and nod to him to night XXXI My Bed is a Boat My bed is like a little boat Nurse helps me in when I embark She girds me in my sailor s coat And starts me in the dark At night I go on board and say Good night to all my friends on shore I shut my eyes and sail away And see and hear no more And sometimes things to bed I take As prudent sailors have to do Perhaps a slice of wedding cake Perhaps a toy or two All night across the dark we steer But when the day returns at last Safe in my room beside the pier I find my vessel fast XXXII The Moon The moon has a face like the clock in the hall She shines on thieves on the garden wall On streets and fields and harbour quays And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse The howling dog by the door of the house The bat that lies in bed at noon All love to be out by the light of the moon But all of the things that belong to the day Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way And flowers and children close their eyes Till up in the morning the sun shall arise XXXIII The Swing How do you like to go up in a swing Up in the air so blue Oh I do think it the pleasantest thing Ever a child can do Up in the air and over the wall Till I can see so wide River and trees and cattle and all Over the countryside Till I look down on the garden green Down on the roof so brown Up in the air I go flying again Up in the air and down XXXIV Time to Rise A birdie with a yellow bill Hopped upon my window sill Cocked his shining eye and said Ain t you shamed you sleepy head XXXV Looking Glass River Smooth it glides upon its travel Here a wimple there a gleam O the clean gravel O the smooth stream Sailing blossoms silver fishes Paven pools as clear as air How a child wishes To live down there We can see our colored faces Floating on the shaken pool Down in cool places Dim and very cool Till a wind or water wrinkle Dipping marten plumping trout Spreads in a twinkle And blots all out See the rings pursue each other All below grows black as night Just as if mother Had blown out the light Patience children just a minute See the spreading circles die The stream and all in it Will clear by and by XXXVI Fairy Bread Come up here O dusty feet Here is fairy bread to eat Here in my retiring room Children you may dine On the golden smell of broom And the shade of pine And when you have eaten well Fairy stories hear and tell XXXVII From a Railway Carriage Faster than fairies faster than witches Bridges and houses hedges and ditches And charging along like troops in a battle All through the meadows the horses and cattle All of the sights of the hill and the plain Fly as thick as driving rain And ever again in the wink of an eye Painted stations whistle by Here is a child who clambers and scrambles All by himself and gathering brambles Here is a tramp who stands and gazes And here is the green for stringing the daisies Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping along with man and load And here is a mill and there is a river Each a glimpse and gone forever XXXVIII Winter Time Late lies the wintry sun a bed A frosty fiery sleepy head Blinks but an hour or two and then A blood red orange sets again Before the stars have left the skies At morning in the dark I rise And shivering in my nakedness By the cold candle bathe and dress Close by the jolly fire I sit To warm my frozen bones a bit Or with a reindeer sled explore The colder countries round the door When to go out my nurse doth wrap Me in my comforter and cap The cold wind burns my face and blows Its frosty pepper up my nose Black are my steps on silver sod Thick blows my frosty breath abroad And tree and house and hill and lake Are frosted like a wedding cake XXXIX The Hayloft Through all the pleasant meadow side The grass grew shoulder high Till the shining scythes went far and wide And cut it down to dry Those green and sweetly smelling crops They led in waggons home And they piled them here in mountain tops For mountaineers to roam Here is Mount Clear Mount Rusty Nail Mount Eagle and Mount High The mice that in these mountains dwell No happier are than I Oh what a joy to clamber there Oh what a place for play With the sweet the dim the dusty air The happy hills of hay XL Farewell to the Farm The coach is at the door at last The eager children mounting fast And kissing hands in chorus sing Good bye good bye to everything To house and garden field and lawn The meadow gates we swang upon To pump and stable tree and swing Good bye good bye to everything And fare you well for evermore O ladder at the hayloft door O hayloft where the cobwebs cling Good bye good bye to everything Crack goes the whip and off we go The trees and houses smaller grow Last round the woody turn we sing Good bye good bye to everything XLI North West Passage one Good Night When the bright lamp is carried in The sunless hours again begin O er all without in field and lane The haunted night returns again Now we behold the embers flee About the firelit hearth and see Our faces painted as we pass Like pictures on the window glass Must we to bed indeed Well then Let us arise and go like men And face with an undaunted tread The long black passage up to bed Farewell O brother sister sire O pleasant party round the fire The songs you sing the tales you tell Till far to morrow fare you well two Shadow March All around the house is the jet black night It stares through the window pane It crawls in the corners hiding from the light And it moves with the moving flame Now my little heart goes a beating like a drum With the breath of the Bogies in my hair And all around the candle the crooked shadows come And go marching along up the stair The shadow of the balusters the shadow of the lamp The shadow of the child that goes to bed All the wicked shadows coming tramp tramp tramp With the black night overhead three In Port Last to the chamber where I lie My fearful footsteps patter nigh And come out from the cold and gloom Into my warm and cheerful room There safe arrived we turn about To keep the coming shadows out And close the happy door at last On all the perils that we past Then when mamma goes by to bed She shall come in with tip toe tread And see me lying warm and fast And in the land of Nod at last THE CHILD ALONE I The Unseen Playmate When children are playing alone on the green In comes the playmate that never was seen When children are happy and lonely and good The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood Nobody heard him and nobody saw His is a picture you never could draw But he s sure to be present abroad or at home When children are happy and playing alone He lies in the laurels he runs on the grass He sings when you tinkle the musical glass Whene er you are happy and cannot tell why The Friend of the Children is sure to be by He loves to be little he hates to be big Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win Tis he when at night you go off to your bed Bids you go to sleep and not trouble your head For wherever they re lying in cupboard or shelf Tis he will take care of your playthings himself II My Ship and I O it s I that am the captain of a tidy little ship Of a ship that goes a sailing on the pond And my ship it keeps a turning all around and all about But when I m a little older I shall find the secret out How to send my vessel sailing on beyond For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm And the dolly I intend to come alive And with him beside to help me it s a sailing I shall go It s a sailing on the water when the jolly breezes blow And the vessel goes a divie divie dive O it s then you ll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds And you ll hear the water singing at the prow For beside the dolly sailor I m to voyage and explore To land upon the island where no dolly was before And to fire the penny cannon in the bow III My Kingdom Down by a shining water well I found a very little dell No higher than my head The heather and the gorse about In summer bloom were coming out Some yellow and some red I called the little pool a sea The little hills were big to me For I am very small I made a boat I made a town I searched the caverns up and down And named them one and all And all about was mine I said The little sparrows overhead The little minnows too This was the world and I was king For me the bees came by to sing For me the swallows flew I played there were no deeper seas Nor any wider plains than these Nor other kings than me At last I heard my mother call Out from the house at evenfall To call me home to tea And I must rise and leave my dell And leave my dimpled water well And leave my heather blooms Alas and as my home I neared How very big my nurse appeared How great and cool the rooms IV Picture Books in Winter Summer fading winter comes Frosty mornings tingling thumbs Window robins winter rooks And the picture story books Water now is turned to stone Nurse and I can walk upon Still we find the flowing brooks In the picture story books All the pretty things put by Wait upon the children s eye Sheep and shepherds trees and crooks In the picture story books We may see how all things are Seas and cities near and far And the flying fairies looks In the picture story books How am I to sing your praise Happy chimney corner days Sitting safe in nursery nooks Reading picture story books V My Treasures These nuts that I keep in the back of the nest Where all my tin soldiers are lying at rest Were gathered in Autumn by nursie and me In a wood with a well by the side of the sea This whistle we made and how clearly it sounds By the side of a field at the end of the grounds Of a branch of a plane with a knife of my own It was nursie who made it and nursie alone The stone with the white and the yellow and grey We discovered I cannot tell HOW far away And I carried it back although weary and cold For though father denies it I m sure it is gold But of all my treasures the last is the king For there s very few children possess such a thing And that is a chisel both handle and blade Which a man who was really a carpenter made VI Block City What are you able to build with your blocks Castles and palaces temples and docks Rain may keep raining and others go roam But I can be happy and building at home Let the sofa be mountains the carpet be sea There I ll establish a city for me A kirk and a mill and a palace beside And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride Great is the palace with pillar and wall A sort of a tower on the top of it all And steps coming down in an orderly way To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay This one is sailing and that one is moored Hark to the song of the sailors aboard And see on the steps of my palace the kings Coming and going with presents and things Now I have done with it down let it go All in a moment the town is laid low Block upon block lying scattered and free What is there left of my town by the sea Yet as I saw it I see it again The kirk and the palace the ships and the men And as long as I live and where er I may be I ll always remember my town by the sea VII The Land of Story Books At evening when the lamp is lit Around the fire my parents sit They sit at home and talk and sing And do not play at anything Now with my little gun I crawl All in the dark along the wall And follow round the forest track Away behind the sofa back There in the night where none can spy All in my hunter s camp I lie And play at books that I have read Till it is time to go to bed These are the hills these are the woods These are my starry solitudes And there the river by whose brink The roaring lions come to drink I see the others far away As if in firelit camp they lay And I like to an Indian scout Around their party prowled about So when my nurse comes in for me Home I return across the sea And go to bed with backward looks At my dear land of Story books VIII Armies in the Fire The lamps now glitter down the street Faintly sound the falling feet And the blue even slowly falls About the garden trees and walls Now in the falling of the gloom The red fire paints the empty room And warmly on the roof it looks And flickers on the back of books Armies march by tower and spire Of cities blazing in the fire Till as I gaze with staring eyes The armies fade the lustre dies Then once again the glow returns Again the phantom city burns And down the red hot valley lo The phantom armies marching go Blinking embers tell me true Where are those armies marching to And what the burning city is That crumbles in your furnaces IX The Little Land When at home alone I sit And am very tired of it I have just to shut my eyes To go sailing through the skies To go sailing far away To the pleasant Land of Play To the fairy land afar Where the Little People are Where the clover tops are trees And the rain pools are the seas And the leaves like little ships Sail about on tiny trips And above the Daisy tree Through the grasses High o erhead the Bumble Bee Hums and passes In that forest to and fro I can wander I can go See the spider and the fly And the ants go marching by Carrying parcels with their feet Down the green and grassy street I can in the sorrel sit Where the ladybird alit I can climb the jointed grass And on high See the greater swallows pass In the sky And the round sun rolling by Heeding no such things as I Through that forest I can pass Till as in a looking glass Humming fly and daisy tree And my tiny self I see Painted very clear and neat On the rain pool at my feet Should a leaflet come to land Drifting near to where I stand Straight I ll board that tiny boat Round the rain pool sea to float Little thoughtful creatures sit On the grassy coasts of it Little things with lovely eyes See me sailing with surprise Some are clad in armour green These have sure to battle been Some are pied with ev ry hue Black and crimson gold and blue Some have wings and swift are gone But they all look kindly on When my eyes I once again Open and see all things plain High bare walls great bare floor Great big knobs on drawer and door Great big people perched on chairs Stitching tucks and mending tears Each a hill that I could climb And talking nonsense all the time O dear me That I could be A sailor on a the rain pool sea A climber in the clover tree And just come back a sleepy head Late at night to go to bed Garden Days I Night and Day When the golden day is done Through the closing portal

228-133094-0022	train-other-500	He bares to all the garden ground And sheds a warm and glittering look Among the ivy s inmost nook Above the hills along the blue
228-133094-0023	train-other-500	Round the bright air with footing true
none	none	 To please the child to paint the rose The gardener of the World he goes V The Dumb Soldier 
228-133094-0024	train-other-500	When the grass was closely mown Walking on the lawn alone In the turf a hole I found And hid a soldier underground
228-133094-0025	train-other-500	Spring and daisies came apace Grasses hide my hiding place
none	none	 Grasses run like a green sea 
228-133094-0026	train-other-500	O er the lawn up to my knee Under grass alone he lies Looking up with leaden eyes Scarlet coat and pointed gun To the stars and to the sun
228-133094-0027	train-other-500	When the grass is ripe like grain
none	none	 When the scythe is stoned again 
228-133094-0028	train-other-500	When the lawn is shaven clear Then my hole shall reappear I shall find him never fear I shall find my grenadier
228-133094-0029	train-other-500	But for all that s gone and come I shall find my soldier dumb He has lived a little thing In the grassy woods of spring Done if he could tell me true
228-133094-0030	train-other-500	Just as I should like to do He has seen the starry hours And the springing of the flowers And the fairy things that pass In the forests of the grass
none	none	 In the silence he has heard 
228-133094-0031	train-other-500	Talking bee and ladybird
none	none	 And the butterfly has flown O er him as he lay alone 
228-133094-0032	train-other-500	Not a word will he disclose Not a word of all he knows
none	none	 I must lay him on the shelf And make up the tale myself VI Autumn Fires In the other gardens And 
228-133094-0033	train-other-500	all up the vale From the autumn bonfires See the smoke trail Pleasant summer over And all the summer flowers
none	none	 The red fire blazes 
228-133094-0034	train-other-500	The grey smoke towers Sing a song of seasons Something bright in all Flowers in the summer
none	none	 Fires in the fall VII The Gardener 
228-133094-0035	train-other-500	The gardener does not love to talk He makes me keep the gravel walk And when he puts his tools away He locks the door and takes the key
228-133094-0036	train-other-500	Away behind the currant row Where no one else but cook may go Far in the plots
none	none	 I see him dig 
228-133094-0037	train-other-500	Old and serious
none	none	 brown and big 
228-133094-0038	train-other-500	He digs the flowers green red and blue Nor wishes to be spoken to He digs the flowers and cuts the hay And never seems to want to play
228-133094-0039	train-other-500	Silly gardener summer goes And winter comes with pinching toes When in the garden bare and brown You must lay your barrow down
228-133094-0040	train-other-500	Well now and while the summer stays To profit by these garden days O how much wiser you would be To play at Indian wars with me
none	none	 VIII Historical Associations Dear Uncle Jim 
228-133094-0041	train-other-500	this garden ground That now you smoke your pipe around Has seen immortal actions done
none	none	 And valiant battles lost and won 
228-133094-0042	train-other-500	Here we had best on tip toe tread While I for safety march ahead For this is that enchanted ground Where all who loiter slumber sound
none	none	 Here is the sea here is the sand 
228-133094-0043	train-other-500	Here is simple Shepherd s Land Here are the fairy hollyhocks
none	none	 And there are Ali Baba s rocks But yonder see apart and high Frozen Siberia lies where I With Robert Bruce and William Tell Was bound by an enchanter s spell ENVOYS I To Willie and Henrietta If two may read aright These rhymes of old delight And house and garden play You two my cousins and you only may You in a garden green With me were king and queen Were hunter soldier tar And all the thousand things that children are Now in the elders seat We rest with quiet feet And from the window bay We watch the children our successors play Time was the golden head Irrevocably said But time which one can bind While flowing fast away leaves love behind II To My Mother You too my mother read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor III To Auntie Chief of our aunts not only I But all your dozen of nurselings cry What did the other children do And what were childhood wanting you IV To Minnie The red room with the giant bed Where none but elders laid their head The little room where you and I Did for awhile together lie And simple suitor I your hand In decent marriage did demand The great day nursery best of all With pictures pasted on the wall And leaves upon the blind A pleasant room wherein to wake And hear the leafy garden shake And rustle in the wind And pleasant there to lie in bed And see the pictures overhead The wars about Sebastopol The grinning guns along the wall The daring escalade The plunging ships the bleating sheep The happy children ankle deep And laughing as they wade All these are vanished clean away And the old manse is changed to day It wears an altered face And shields a stranger race The river on from mill to mill Flows past our childhood s garden still But ah we children never more Shall watch it from the water door Below the yew it still is there Our phantom voices haunt the air As we were still at play And I can hear them call and say How far is it to Babylon Ah far enough my dear Far far enough from here Yet you have farther gone Can I get there by candlelight So goes the old refrain I do not know perchance you might But only children hear it right Ah never to return again The eternal dawn beyond a doubt Shall break on hill and plain And put all stars and candles out Ere we be young again To you in distant India these I send across the seas Nor count it far across For which of us forgets The Indian cabinets The bones of antelope the wings of albatross The pied and painted birds and beans The junks and bangles beads and screens The gods and sacred bells And the loud humming twisted shells The level of the parlour floor Was honest homely Scottish shore But when we climbed upon a chair Behold the gorgeous East was there Be this a fable and behold Me in the parlour as of old And Minnie just above me set In the quaint Indian cabinet Smiling and kind you grace a shelf Too high for me to reach myself Reach down a hand my dear and take These rhymes for old acquaintance sake V To My Name Child one Some day soon this rhyming volume if you learn with proper speed Little Louis Sanchez will be given you to read Then you shall discover that your name was printed down By the English printers long before in London town In the great and busy city where the East and West are met All the little letters did the English printer set While you thought of nothing and were still too young to play Foreign people thought of you in places far away Ay and when you slept a baby over all the English lands Other little children took the volume in their hands Other children questioned in their homes across the seas Who was little Louis won t you tell us mother please two Now that you have spelt your lesson lay it down and go and play Seeking shells and seaweed on the sands of Monterey Watching all the mighty whalebones lying buried by the breeze Tiny sandy pipers and the huge Pacific seas And remember in your playing as the sea fog rolls to you Long ere you could read it how I told you what to do And that while you thought of no one nearly half the world away Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey VI To Any Reader As from the house your mother sees You playing round the garden trees So you may see if you will look Through the windows of this book Another child far far away And in another garden play But do not think you can at all By knocking on the window call That child to hear you He intent Is all on his play business bent He does not hear he will not look Nor yet be lured out of this book For long ago the truth to say He has grown up and gone away And it is but a child of air That lingers in the garden there End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Child s Garden of Verses by Robert Louis
