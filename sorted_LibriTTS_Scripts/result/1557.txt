INTRODUCTION The year fourteen hundred opened with more than usual peacefulness in England Only a few months before Richard II weak wicked and treacherous had been dethroned and Henry IV declared King in his stead But it was only a seeming peacefulness lasting but for a little while for though King Henry proved himself a just and a merciful man as justice and mercy went with the men of iron of those days and though he did not care to shed blood needlessly there were many noble families who had been benefited by King Richard during his reign and who had lost somewhat of their power and prestige from the coming in of the new King Among these were a number of great lords the Dukes of Albemarle Surrey and Exeter the Marquis of Dorset the Earl of Gloucester and others who had been degraded to their former titles and estates from which King Richard had lifted them These and others brewed a secret plot to take King Henry s life which plot might have succeeded had not one of their own number betrayed them Their plan had been to fall upon the King and his adherents and to massacre them during a great tournament to be held at Oxford But Henry did not appear at the lists whereupon knowing that he had been lodging at Windsor with only a few attendants the conspirators marched thither against him In the mean time the King had been warned of the plot so that instead of finding him in the royal castle they discovered through their scouts that he had hurried to London whence he was even then marching against them at the head of a considerable army So nothing was left them but flight Some betook themselves one way some another some sought sanctuary here some there but one and another they were all of them caught and killed The Earl of Kent one time Duke of Surrey and the Earl of Salisbury were beheaded in the market place at Cirencester Lord Le Despencer once the Earl of Gloucester and Lord Lumley met the same fate at Bristol the Earl of Huntingdon was taken in the Essex fens carried to the castle of the Duke of Gloucester whom he had betrayed to his death in King Richard s time and was there killed by the castle people Those few who found friends faithful and bold enough to afford them shelter dragged those friends down in their own ruin Just such a case was that of the father of the boy hero of this story the blind Lord Gilbert Reginald Falworth Baron of Falworth and Easterbridge who though having no part in the plot suffered through it ruin utter and complete He had been a faithful counsellor and adviser to King Richard and perhaps it was this as much and more than his roundabout connection with the plot that brought upon him the punishment he suffered CHAPTER one Myles Falworth was but eight years of age at that time and it was only afterwards and when he grew old enough to know more of the ins and outs of the matter that he could remember by bits and pieces the things that afterwards happened how one evening a knight came clattering into the court yard upon a horse red nostrilled and smeared with the sweat and foam of a desperate ride Sir John Dale a dear friend of the blind Lord Even though so young Myles knew that something very serious had happened to make Sir John so pale and haggard and he dimly remembered leaning against the knight s iron covered knees looking up into his gloomy face and asking him if he was sick to look so strange Thereupon those who had been too troubled before to notice him bethought themselves of him and sent him to bed rebellious at having to go so early He remembered how the next morning looking out of a window high up under the eaves he saw a great troop of horsemen come riding into the courtyard beneath where a powdering of snow had whitened everything and of how the leader a knight clad in black armor dismounted and entered the great hall door way below followed by several of the band He remembered how some of the castle women were standing in a frightened group upon the landing of the stairs talking together in low voices about a matter he did not understand excepting that the armed men who had ridden into the courtyard had come for Sir John Dale None of the women paid any attention to him so shunning their notice he ran off down the winding stairs expecting every moment to be called back again by some one of them A crowd of castle people all very serious and quiet were gathered in the hall where a number of strange men at arms lounged upon the benches while two billmen in steel caps and leathern jacks stood guarding the great door the butts of their weapons resting upon the ground and the staves crossed barring the door way In the anteroom was the knight in black armor whom Myles had seen from the window He was sitting at the table his great helmet lying upon the bench beside him and a quart beaker of spiced wine at his elbow A clerk sat at the other end of the same table with inkhorn in one hand and pen in the other and a parchment spread in front of him Master Robert the castle steward stood before the knight who every now and then put to him a question which the other would answer and the clerk write the answer down upon the parchment His father stood with his back to the fireplace looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes his brows drawn moodily together and the scar of the great wound that he had received at the tournament at York the wound that had made him blind showing red across his forehead as it always did when he was angered or troubled There was something about it all that frightened Myles who crept to his father s side and slid his little hand into the palm that hung limp and inert In answer to the touch his father grasped the hand tightly but did not seem otherwise to notice that he was there Neither did the black knight pay any attention to him but continued putting his questions to Master Robert Then suddenly there was a commotion in the hall without loud voices and a hurrying here and there The black knight half arose grasping a heavy iron mace that lay upon the bench beside him and the next moment Sir John Dale himself as pale as death walked into the antechamber He stopped in the very middle of the room I yield me to my Lord s grace and mercy said he to the black knight and they were the last words he ever uttered in this world The black knight shouted out some words of command and swinging up the iron mace in his hand strode forward clanking towards Sir John who raised his arm as though to shield himself from the blow Two or three of those who stood in the hall without came running into the room with drawn swords and bills and little Myles crying out with terror hid his face in his father s long gown The next instant came the sound of a heavy blow and of a groan then another blow and the sound of one falling upon the ground Then the clashing of steel and in the midst Lord Falworth crying in a dreadful voice Thou traitor thou coward thou murderer Master Robert snatched Myles away from his father and bore him out of the room in spite of his screams and struggles and he remembered just one instant s sight of Sir John lying still and silent upon his face and of the black knight standing above him with the terrible mace in his hand stained a dreadful red It was the next day that Lord and Lady Falworth and little Myles together with three of the more faithful of their people left the castle His memory of past things held a picture for Myles of old Diccon Bowman standing over him in the silence of midnight with a lighted lamp in his hand and with it a recollection of being bidden to hush when he would have spoken and of being dressed by Diccon and one of the women bewildered with sleep shuddering and chattering with cold He remembered being wrapped in the sheepskin that lay at the foot of his bed and of being carried in Diccon Bowman s arms down the silent darkness of the winding stair way with the great black giant shadows swaying and flickering upon the stone wall as the dull flame of the lamp swayed and flickered in the cold breathing of the night air Below were his father and mother and two or three others A stranger stood warming his hands at a newly made fire and little Myles as he peeped from out the warm sheepskin saw that he was in riding boots and was covered with mud He did not know till long years afterwards that the stranger was a messenger sent by a friend at the King s court bidding his father fly for safety They who stood there by the red blaze of the fire were all very still talking in whispers and walking on tiptoes and Myles s mother hugged him in her arms sheepskin and all kissing him with the tears streaming down her cheeks and whispering to him as though he could understand their trouble that they were about to leave their home forever Then Diccon Bowman carried him out into the strangeness of the winter midnight Outside beyond the frozen moat where the osiers stood stark and stiff in their winter nakedness was a group of dark figures waiting for them with horses In the pallid moonlight Myles recognized the well known face of Father Edward the Prior of saint Mary s After that came a long ride through that silent night upon the saddle bow in front of Diccon Bowman then a deep heavy sleep that fell upon him in spite of the galloping of the horses When next he woke the sun was shining and his home and his whole life were changed CHAPTER two From the time the family escaped from Falworth Castle that midwinter night to the time Myles was sixteen years old he knew nothing of the great world beyond Crosbey Dale A fair was held twice in a twelvemonth at the market town of Wisebey and three times in the seven years old Diccon Bowman took the lad to see the sights at that place Beyond these three glimpses of the outer world he lived almost as secluded a life as one of the neighboring monks of saint Mary s Priory Crosbey Holt their new home was different enough from Falworth or Easterbridge Castle the former baronial seats of Lord Falworth It was a long low straw thatched farm house once when the church lands were divided into two holdings one of the bailiff s houses All around were the fruitful farms of the priory tilled by well to do tenant holders and rich with fields of waving grain and meadow lands where sheep and cattle grazed in flocks and herds for in those days the church lands were under church rule and were governed by church laws and there when war and famine and waste and sloth blighted the outside world harvests flourished and were gathered and sheep were sheared and cows were milked in peace and quietness The Prior of saint Mary s owed much if not all of the church s prosperity to the blind Lord Falworth and now he was paying it back with a haven of refuge from the ruin that his former patron had brought upon himself by giving shelter to Sir John Dale I fancy that most boys do not love the grinding of school life the lessons to be conned the close application during study hours It is not often pleasant to brisk lively lads to be so cooped up I wonder what the boys of to day would have thought of Myles s training With him that training was not only of the mind but of the body as well and for seven years it was almost unremitting Thou hast thine own way to make in the world sirrah his father said more than once when the boy complained of the grinding hardness of his life and to make one s way in those days meant a thousand times more than it does now it meant not only a heart to feel and a brain to think but a hand quick and strong to strike in battle and a body tough to endure the wounds and blows in return And so it was that Myles s body as well as his mind had to be trained to meet the needs of the dark age in which he lived Every morning winter or summer rain or shine he tramped away six long miles to the priory school and in the evenings his mother taught him French Myles being prejudiced in the school of thought of his day rebelled not a little at that last branch of his studies Why must I learn that vile tongue said he Call it not vile said the blind old Lord grimly belike when thou art grown a man thou lieutenant have to seek thy fortune in France land for England is haply no place for such as be of Falworth blood And in after years true to his father s prediction the vile tongue served him well As for his physical training that pretty well filled up the hours between his morning studies at the monastery and his evening studies at home Then it was that old Diccon Bowman took him in hand than whom none could be better fitted to shape his young body to strength and his hands to skill in arms The old bowman had served with Lord Falworth s father under the Black Prince both in France and Spain and in long years of war had gained a practical knowledge of arms that few could surpass Besides the use of the broadsword the short sword the quarter staff and the cudgel he taught Myles to shoot so skilfully with the long bow and the cross bow that not a lad in the country side was his match at the village butts Attack and defence with the lance and throwing the knife and dagger were also part of his training Then in addition to this more regular part of his physical training Myles was taught in another branch not so often included in the military education of the day the art of wrestling It happened that a fellow lived in Crosbey village by name Ralph the Smith who was the greatest wrestler in the country side and had worn the champion belt for three years Every Sunday afternoon in fair weather he came to teach Myles the art and being wonderfully adept in bodily feats he soon grew so quick and active and firm footed that he could cast any lad under twenty years of age living within a range of five miles It is main ungentle armscraft that he learneth said Lord Falworth one day to Prior Edward Saving only the broadsword the dagger and the lance there is but little that a gentleman of his strain may use Neth less he gaineth quickness and suppleness and if he hath true blood in his veins he will acquire knightly arts shrewdly quick when the time cometh to learn them But hard and grinding as Myles s life was it was not entirely without pleasures There were many boys living in Crosbey Dale and the village yeomen s and farmers sons to be sure but nevertheless lads of his own age and that after all is the main requirement for friendship in boyhood s world Then there was the river to bathe in there were the hills and valleys to roam over and the wold and woodland with their wealth of nuts and birds nests and what not of boyhood s treasures Once he gained a triumph that for many a day was very sweet under the tongue of his memory As was said before he had been three times to the market town at fair time and upon the last of these occasions he had fought a bout of quarterstaff with a young fellow of twenty and had been the conqueror He was then only a little over fourteen years old Old Diccon who had gone with him to the fair had met some cronies of his own with whom he had sat gossiping in the ale booth leaving Myles for the nonce to shift for himself By and by the old man had noticed a crowd gathered at one part of the fair ground and snuffing a fight had gone running ale pot in hand Then peering over the shoulders of the crowd he had seen his young master stripped to the waist fighting like a gladiator with a fellow a head taller than himself Diccon was about to force his way through the crowd and drag them asunder but a second look had showed his practised eye that Myles was not only holding his own but was in the way of winning the victory So he had stood with the others looking on withholding himself from any interference and whatever upbraiding might be necessary until the fight had been brought to a triumphant close Lord Falworth never heard directly of the redoubtable affair but old Diccon was not so silent with the common folk of Crosbey Dale and so no doubt the father had some inkling of what had happened It was shortly after this notable event that Myles was formally initiated into squirehood His father and mother as was the custom stood sponsors for him By them each bearing a lighted taper he was escorted to the altar It was at saint Mary s Priory and Prior Edward blessed the sword and girded it to the lad s side No one was present but the four and when the good Prior had given the benediction and had signed the cross upon his forehead Myles s mother stooped and kissed his brow just where the priest s finger had drawn the holy sign Her eyes brimmed bright with tears as she did so Poor lady perhaps she only then and for the first time realized how big her fledgling was growing for his nest Henceforth Myles had the right to wear a sword Myles had ended his fifteenth year He was a bonny lad with brown face curling hair a square strong chin and a pair of merry laughing blue eyes his shoulders were broad his chest was thick of girth his muscles and thews were as tough as oak The day upon which he was sixteen years old as he came whistling home from the monastery school he was met by Diccon Bowman Master Myles said the old man with a snuffle in his voice Master Myles thy father would see thee in his chamber and bade me send thee to him as soon as thou didst come home Oh Master Myles I fear me that belike thou art going to leave home to morrow day Myles stopped short To leave home he cried Aye said old Diccon belike thou goest to some grand castle to live there and be a page there and what not and then haply a gentleman at arms in some great lord s pay What coil is this about castles and lords and gentlemen at arms said Myles What talkest thou of Diccon Art thou jesting Nay said Diccon I am not jesting But go to thy father and then thou wilt presently know all Only this I do say that it is like thou leavest us to morrow day And so it was as Diccon had said Myles was to leave home the very next morning He found his father and mother and Prior Edward together waiting for his coming We three have been talking it over this morning said his father and so think each one that the time hath come for thee to quit this poor home of ours An thou stay here ten years longer thou lieutenant be no more fit to go then than now To morrow I will give thee a letter to my kinsman the Earl of Mackworth He has thriven in these days and I have fallen away but time was that he and I were true sworn companions and plighted together in friendship never to be sundered Methinks as I remember him he will abide by his plighted troth and will give thee his aid to rise in the world So as I said to morrow morning thou shalt set forth with Diccon Bowman and shall go to Castle Devlen and there deliver this letter which prayeth him to give thee a place in his household Thou mayst have this afternoon to thyself to make read such things as thou shalt take with thee And bid me Diccon to take the gray horse to the village and have it shod Prior Edward had been standing looking out of the window As Lord Falworth ended he turned And Myles said he thou wilt need some money so I will give thee as a loan forty shillings which some day thou mayst return to me an thou wilt For this know Myles a man cannot do in the world without money Thy father hath it ready for thee in the chest and will give it thee to morrow ere thou goest Lord Falworth had the grim strength of manhood s hard sense to upbear him in sending his son into the world but the poor lady mother had nothing of that to uphold her No doubt it was as hard then as it is now for the mother to see the nestling thrust from the nest to shift for itself What tears were shed what words of love were spoken to the only man child none but the mother and the son ever knew The next morning Myles and the old bowman rode away and no doubt to the boy himself the dark shadows of leave taking were lost in the golden light of hope as he rode out into the great world to seek his fortune CHAPTER three WHAT MYLES remembered of Falworth loomed great and grand and big as things do in the memory of childhood but even memory could not make Falworth the equal of Devlen Castle when as he and Diccon Bowman rode out of Devlentown across the great rude stone bridge that spanned the river he first saw rising above the crowns of the trees those huge hoary walls and the steep roofs and chimneys clustered thickly together like the roofs and chimneys of a town The castle was built upon a plateau like rise of ground which was enclosed by the outer wall It was surrounded on three sides by a loop like bend of the river and on the fourth was protected by a deep broad artificial moat almost as wide as the stream from which it was fed The road from the town wound for a little distance along by the edge of this moat As Myles and the old bowman galloped by with the answering echo of their horses hoof beats rattling back from the smooth stone face of the walls the lad looked up wondering at the height and strength of the great ancient fortress In his air castle building Myles had pictured the Earl receiving him as the son of his one time comrade in arms receiving him perhaps with somewhat of the rustic warmth that he knew at Crosbey Dale but now as he stared at those massive walls from below and realized his own insignificance and the greatness of this great Earl he felt the first keen helpless ache of homesickness shoot through his breast and his heart yearned for Crosbey Holt again Then they thundered across the bridge that spanned the moat and through the dark shadows of the great gaping gate way and Diccon bidding him stay for a moment rode forward to bespeak the gate keeper The gate keeper gave the two in charge of one of the men at arms who were lounging upon a bench in the archway who in turn gave them into the care of one of the house servants in the outer court yard So having been passed from one to another and having answered many questions Myles in due time found himself in the outer waiting room sitting beside Diccon Bowman upon a wooden bench that stood along the wall under the great arch of a glazed window For a while the poor country lad sat stupidly bewildered He was aware of people coming and going he was aware of talk and laughter sounding around him but he thought of nothing but his aching homesickness and the oppression of his utter littleness in the busy life of this great castle Meantime old Diccon Bowman was staring about him with huge interest every now and then nudging his young master calling his attention now to this and now to that until at last the lad began to awaken somewhat from his despondency to the things around Besides those servants and others who came and went and a knot of six or eight men at arms with bills and pole axes who stood at the farther door way talking together in low tones now and then broken by a stifled laugh was a group of four young squires who lounged upon a bench beside a door way hidden by an arras and upon them Myles s eyes lit with a sudden interest Three of the four were about his own age one was a year or two older and all four were dressed in the black and yellow uniform of the house of Beaumont Myles plucked the bowman by the sleeve Be they squires Diccon said he nodding towards the door Eh said Diccon Aye they be squires And will my station be with them asked the boy Aye an the Earl take thee to service thou lieutenant haply be taken as squire Myles stared at them and then of a sudden was aware that the young men were talking of him He knew it by the way they eyed him askance and spoke now and then in one another s ears One of the four a gay young fellow with long riding boots laced with green laces said a few words the others gave a laugh and poor Myles knowing how ungainly he must seem to them felt the blood rush to his cheeks and shyly turned his head Suddenly as though stirred by an impulse the same lad who had just created the laugh arose from the bench and came directly across the room to where Myles and the bowman sat Give thee good den said he What be saint thy name and whence comest thou an I may make bold so to ask My name is Myles Falworth said Myles and I come from Crosbey Dale bearing a letter to my Lord Never did I hear of Crosbey Dale said the squire But what seekest here if so be I may ask that much I come seeking service said Myles and would enter as an esquire such as ye be in my Lord s household Myles s new acquaintance grinned Thou lieutenant make a droll squire to wait in a Lord s household said he Hast ever been in such service Nay said Myles I have only been at school and learned Latin and French and what not But Diccon Bowman here hath taught me use of arms The young squire laughed outright By r Lady thy talk doth tickle me friend Myles said he Think saint thou such matters will gain thee footing here But stay Thou didst say anon that thou hadst a letter to my Lord From whom is it It is from my father said Myles He is of noble blood but fallen in estate He is a kinsman of my Lord s and one time his comrade in arms Sayst so said the other Then mayhap thy chances are not so ill after all Then after a moment he added My name is Francis Gascoyne and I will stand thy friend in this matter Get thy letter ready for my Lord and his Grace of York are within and come forth anon The Archbishop is on his way to Dalworth and my Lord escorts him so far as Uppingham I and those others are to go along Dost thou know my Lord by sight Nay said Myles I know him not Then I will tell thee when he cometh Listen said he as a confused clattering sounded in the court yard without Yonder are the horses now They come presently Busk thee with thy letter friend Myles The attendants who passed through the anteroom now came and went more hurriedly and Myles knew that the Earl must be about to come forth He had hardly time to untie his pouch take out the letter and tie the strings again when the arras at the door way was thrust suddenly aside and a tall thin squire of about twenty came forth said some words to the young men upon the bench and then withdrew again Instantly the squires arose and took their station beside the door way A sudden hush fell upon all in the room and the men at arms stood in a line against the wall stiff and erect as though all at once transformed to figures of iron Once more the arras was drawn back and in the hush Myles heard voices in the other room My Lord cometh whispered Gascoyne in his ear and Myles felt his heart leap in answer The next moment two noblemen came into the anteroom followed by a crowd of gentlemen squires and pages One of the two was a dignitary of the Church the other Myles instantly singled out as the Earl of Mackworth CHAPTER four He was a tall man taller even than Myles s father He had a thin face deep set bushy eyebrows and a hawk nose His upper lip was clean shaven but from his chin a flowing beard of iron gray hung nearly to his waist He was clad in a riding gown of black velvet that hung a little lower than the knee trimmed with otter fur and embroidered with silver goshawks the crest of the family of Beaumont A light shirt of link mail showed beneath the gown as he walked and a pair of soft undressed leather riding boots were laced as high as the knee protecting his scarlet hose from mud and dirt Over his shoulders he wore a collar of enamelled gold from which hung a magnificent jewelled pendant and upon his fist he carried a beautiful Iceland falcon As Myles stood staring he suddenly heard Gascoyne s voice whisper in his ear Yon is my Lord go forward and give him thy letter Scarcely knowing what he did he walked towards the Earl like a machine his heart pounding within him and a great humming in his ears As he drew near the nobleman stopped for a moment and stared at him and Myles as in a dream kneeled and presented the letter The Earl took it in his hand turned it this way and that looked first at the bearer then at the packet and then at the bearer again Who art thou said he and what is the matter thou wouldst have of me I am Myles Falworth said the lad in a low voice and I come seeking service with you The Earl drew his thick eyebrows quickly together and shot a keen look at the lad Falworth said he sharply Falworth I know no Falworth The letter will tell you said Myles It is from one once dear to you The Earl took the letter and handing it to a gentleman who stood near bade him break the seal Thou mayst stand said he to Myles needst not kneel there forever Then taking the opened parchment again he glanced first at the face and then at the back and seeing its length looked vexed Then he read for an earnest moment or two skipping from line to line Presently he folded the letter and thrust it into the pouch at his side So it is your Grace said he to the lordly prelate that we who have luck to rise in the world must ever suffer by being plagued at all times and seasons Here is one I chanced to know a dozen years ago who thinks he hath a claim upon me and saddles me with his son I must e en take the lad too for the sake of peace and quietness He glanced around and seeing Gascoyne who had drawn near beckoned to him Take me this fellow said he to the buttery and see him fed and then to Sir James Lee and have his name entered in the castle books And stay sirrah he added bid me Sir James if it may be so done to enter him as a squire at arms Methinks he will be better serving so than in the household for he appeareth a soothly rough cub for a page Myles did look rustic enough standing clad in frieze in the midst of that gay company and a murmur of laughter sounded around though he was too bewildered to fully understand that he was the cause of the merriment Then some hand drew him back it was Gascoyne s there was a bustle of people passing and the next minute they were gone and Myles and old Diccon Bowman and the young squire were left alone in the anteroom Gascoyne looked very sour and put out Murrain upon it said he here is good sport spoiled for me to see thee fed I wish no ill to thee friend but I would thou hadst come this afternoon or to morrow Methinks I bring trouble and dole to every one said Myles somewhat bitterly It would have been better had I never come to this place methinks His words and tone softened Gascoyne a little Ne er mind said the squire it was not thy fault and is past mending now So come and fill thy stomach in Heaven s name Perhaps not the least hard part of the whole trying day for Myles was his parting with Diccon Gascoyne and he had accompanied the old retainer to the outer gate in the archway of which they now stood for without a permit they could go no farther The old bowman led by the bridle rein the horse upon which Myles had ridden that morning His own nag a vicious brute was restive to be gone but Diccon held him in with tight rein He reached down and took Myles s sturdy brown hand in his crooked knotted grasp Farewell young master he croaked tremulously with a watery glimmer in his pale eyes Thou wilt not forget me when I am gone Nay said Myles I will not forget thee Aye aye said the old man looking down at him and shaking his head slowly from side to side thou art a great tall sturdy fellow now yet have I held thee on my knee many and many s the time and dandled thee when thou wert only a little weeny babe Be still thou devil s limb he suddenly broke off reining back his restive raw boned steed which began again to caper and prance Myles was not sorry for the interruption he felt awkward and abashed at the parting and at the old man s reminiscences knowing that Gascoyne s eyes were resting amusedly upon the scene and that the men at arms were looking on Certainly old Diccon did look droll as he struggled vainly with his vicious high necked nag Nay a murrain on thee an thou wilt go go cried he at last with a savage dig of his heels into the animal s ribs and away they clattered the led horse kicking up its heels as a final parting setting Gascoyne fairly alaughing At the bend of the road the old man turned and nodded his head the next moment he had disappeared around the angle of the wall and it seemed to Myles as he stood looking after him as though the last thread that bound him to his old life had snapped and broken As he turned he saw that Gascoyne was looking at him Dost feel downhearted said the young squire curiously Nay said Myles brusquely Nevertheless his throat was tight and dry and the word came huskily in spite of himself CHAPTER five THE EARL of Mackworth as was customary among the great lords in those days maintained a small army of knights gentlemen men at arms and retainers who were expected to serve him upon all occasions of need and from whom were supplied his quota of recruits to fill such levies as might be made upon him by the King in time of war The knights and gentlemen of this little army of horse and foot soldiers were largely recruited from the company of squires and bachelors as the young novitiate soldiers of the castle were called This company of esquires consisted of from eighty to ninety lads ranging in age from eight to twenty years Those under fourteen years were termed pages and served chiefly the Countess and her waiting gentlewomen in whose company they acquired the graces and polish of the times such as they were After reaching the age of fourteen the lads were entitled to the name of esquire or squire In most of the great houses of the time the esquires were the especial attendants upon the Lord and Lady of the house holding such positions as body squires cup bearers carvers and sometimes the office of chamberlain But Devlen like some other of the princely castles of the greatest nobles was more like a military post or a fortress than an ordinary household Only comparatively few of the esquires could be used in personal attendance upon the Earl the others were trained more strictly in arms and served rather in the capacity of a sort of body guard than as ordinary squires For as the Earl rose in power and influence and as it so became well worth while for the lower nobility and gentry to enter their sons in his family the body of squires became almost cumbersomely large Accordingly that part which comprised the squires proper as separate from the younger pages was divided into three classes first squires of the body who were those just past pagehood and who waited upon the Earl in personal service second squires of the household who having regular hours assigned for exercise in the manual of arms were relieved from personal service excepting upon especial occasions and thirdly and lastly at the head of the whole body of lads a class called bachelors young men ranging from eighteen to twenty years of age This class was supposed to exercise a sort of government over the other and younger squires to keep them in order as much as possible to marshal them upon occasions of importance to see that their arms and equipments were kept in good order to call the roll for chapel in the morning and to see that those not upon duty in the house were present at the daily exercise at arms Orders to the squires were generally transmitted through the bachelors and the head of that body was expected to make weekly reports of affairs in their quarters to the chief captain of the body From this overlordship of the bachelors there had gradually risen a system of fagging such as is or was practised in the great English public schools enforced services exacted from the younger lads which at the time Myles came to Devlen had in the five or six years it had been in practice grown to be an absolute though unwritten law of the body a law supported by all the prestige of long continued usage At that time the bachelors numbered but thirteen yet they exercised over the rest of the sixty four squires and pages a rule of iron and were taskmasters hard exacting and oftentimes cruel The whole company of squires and pages was under the supreme command of a certain one eyed knight by name Sir James Lee a soldier seasoned by the fire of a dozen battles bearing a score of wounds won in fight and tourney and withered by hardship and labor to a leather like toughness He had fought upon the King s side in all the late wars and had at Shrewsbury received a wound that unfitted him for active service so that now he was fallen to the post of Captain of Esquires at Devlen Castle a man disappointed in life and with a temper imbittered by that failure as well as by cankering pain Yet Perhaps no one could have been better fitted for the place he held than Sir James Lee The lads under his charge were a rude rough unruly set quick like their elders to quarrel and to quarrel fiercely even to the drawing of sword or dagger But there was a cold iron sternness about the grim old man that quelled them as the trainer with a lash of steel might quell a den of young wolves The apartments in which he was lodged with his clerk were next in the dormitory of the lads and even in the midst of the most excited brawlings the distant sound of his harsh voice Silence messieurs would bring an instant hush to the loudest uproar It was into his grim presence that Myles was introduced by Gascoyne Sir James was in his office a room bare of ornament or adornment or superfluous comfort of any sort without even so much as a mat of rushes upon the cold stone pavement to make it less cheerless The old one eyed knight sat gnawing his bristling mustaches To anyone who knew him it would have been apparent that as the castle phrase went the devil sat astride of his neck which meant that some one of his blind wounds was aching more sorely than usual His clerk sat beside him with account books and parchment spread upon the table and the head squire Walter Blunt a lad some three or four years older than Myles and half a head taller black browed powerfully built and with cheek and chin darkened by the soft budding of his adolescent beard stood making his report Sir James listened in grim silence while Gascoyne told his errand So then pardee I am bid to take another one of ye am I he snarled As though ye caused me not trouble enow and this one a cub looking a very boor in carriage and breeding Mayhap the Earl thinketh I am to train boys to his dilly dally household service as well as to use of arms Sir said Gascoyne timidly my Lord sayeth he would have this one entered direct as a squire of the body so that he need not serve in the household Sayest so cried Sir James harshly Then take thou my message back again to thy Lord Not for Mackworth no nor a better man than he will I make any changes in my government An I be set to rule a pack of boys I will rule them as I list and not according to any man s bidding Tell him sirrah that I will enter no lad as squire of the body without first testing an he be fit at arms to hold that place He sat for a while glowering at Myles and gnawing his mustaches and for the time no one dared to break the grim silence What is thy name said he suddenly And then almost before Myles could answer he asked the head squire whether he could find a place to lodge him There is Gillis Whitlock s cot empty said Blunt He is in the infirmary and belike goeth home again when he cometh thence The fever hath gotten into his bones and That will do said the knight interrupting him impatiently Let him take that place or any other that thou hast And thou Jerome said he to his clerk thou mayst enter him upon the roll though whether it be as page or squire or bachelor shall be as I please and not as Mackworth biddeth me Now get ye gone Old Bruin s wound smarteth him sore Gascoyne observed as the two lads walked across the armory court He had good naturedly offered to show the new comer the many sights of interest around the castle and in the hour or so of ramble that followed the two grew from acquaintances to friends with a quickness that boyhood alone can bring about They visited the armory the chapel the stables the great hall the Painted Chamber the guard house the mess room and even the scullery and the kitchen with its great range of boilers and furnaces and ovens Last of all Myles s new friend introduced him to the armor smithy My Lord hath sent a piece of Milan armor thither to be repaired said he Belike thou would like to see it Aye said Myles eagerly that would I The smith was a gruff good natured fellow and showed the piece of armor to Myles readily and willingly enough It was a beautiful bascinet of inlaid workmanship and was edged with a rim of gold Myles scarcely dared touch it he gazed at it with an unconcealed delight that warmed the smith s honest heart I have another piece of Milan here said he Did I ever show thee my dagger Master Gascoyne Nay said the squire The smith unlocked a great oaken chest in the corner of the shop lifted the lid and brought thence a beautiful dagger with the handle of ebony and silver gilt and a sheath of Spanish leather embossed and gilt The keen well tempered blade was beautifully engraved and inlaid with niello work representing a group of figures in a then popular subject the dance of Death It was a weapon at once unique and beautiful and even Gascoyne showed an admiration scarcely less keen than Myles s openly expressed delight To whom doth it belong said he trying the point upon his thumb nail There said the smith is the jest of the whole for it belongeth to me Sir William Beauclerk bade me order the weapon through Master Gildersworthy of London town and by the time it came hither lo he had died and so it fell to my hands No one here payeth the price for the trinket and so I must e en keep it myself though I be but a poor man How much dost thou hold it for said Gascoyne Seventeen shillings buyeth it said the armorer carelessly Aye aye said Gascoyne with a sigh so it is to be poor and not be able to have such things as one loveth and would fain possess Seventeen shillings is nigh as much by half again as all my yearly wage Then a sudden thought came to Myles and as it came his cheeks glowed as hot as fire Master Gascoyne said he with gruff awkwardness thou hast been a very good true friend to me since I have come to this place and hast befriended me in all ways thou mightest do and I as well I know but a poor rustic clod Now I have forty shillings by me which I may spend as I list and so I do beseech thee that thou wilt take yon dagger of me as a love gift and have and hold it for thy very own Gascoyne stared open mouthed at Myles Dost mean it said he at last Aye said Myles I do mean it Master Smith give him the blade At first the smith grinned thinking it all a jest but he soon saw that Myles was serious enough and when the seventeen shillings were produced and counted down upon the anvil he took off his cap and made Myles a low bow as he swept them into his pouch Now by my faith and troth quoth he that I do call a true lordly gift Is it not so Master Gascoyne Aye said Gascoyne with a gulp it is in soothly earnest And thereupon to Myles s great wonderment he suddenly flung his arms about his neck and giving him a great hug kissed him upon the cheek Dear Myles said he I tell thee truly and of a verity I did feel warm towards thee from the very first time I saw thee sitting like a poor oaf upon the bench up yonder in the anteroom and now of a sooth I give thee assurance that I do love thee as my own brother Yea I will take the dagger and will stand by thee as a true friend from this time forth Mayhap thou mayst need a true friend in this place ere thou livest long with us for some of us esquires be soothly rough and knocks are more plenty here than broad pennies so that one new come is like to have a hard time gaining a footing I thank thee said Myles for thy offer of love and friendship and do tell thee upon my part that I also of all the world would like best to have thee for my friend Such was the manner In which Myles formed the first great friendship of his life a friendship that was destined to last him through many years to come As the two walked back across the great quadrangle upon which fronted the main buildings of the castle their arms were wound across one another s shoulders after the manner as a certain great writer says of boys and lovers CHAPTER six A boy s life is of a very flexible sort It takes but a little while for it to shape itself to any new surroundings in which it may be thrown to make itself new friends to settle itself to new habits and so it was that Myles fell directly into the ways of the lads of Devlen On his first morning as he washed his face and hands with the other squires and pages in a great tank of water in the armory court yard he presently found himself splashing and dashing with the others laughing and shouting as loud as any and calling some by their Christian names as though he had known them for years instead of overnight During chapel he watched with sympathetic delight the covert pranks of the youngsters during the half hour that Father Emmanuel droned his Latin and with his dagger point he carved his own name among the many cut deep into the back of the bench before him When after breakfast the squires poured like school boys into the great armory to answer to the roll call for daily exercise he came storming in with the rest beating the lad in front of him with his cap Boys are very keen to feel the influence of a forceful character A lad with a strong will is quick to reach his proper level as a greater or lesser leader among the others and Myles was of just the masterful nature to make his individuality felt among the Devlen squires He was quick enough to yield obedience upon all occasions to proper authority but would never bend an inch to the usurpation of tyranny In the school at saint Mary s Priory at Crosbey Dale he would submit without a murmur or offer of resistance to chastisement by old Father Ambrose the regular teacher but once when the fat old monk was sick and a great long legged strapping young friar who had temporarily taken his place undertook to administer punishment Myles with a wrestling trip flung him sprawling backward over a bench into the midst of a shoal of small boys amid a hubbub of riotous confusion He had been flogged soundly for it under the supervision of Prior Edward himself but so soon as his punishment was over he assured the prior very seriously that should like occasion again happen he would act in the same manner flogging or no flogging It was this bold outspoken spirit that gained him at once friends and enemies at Devlen and though it first showed itself in what was but a little matter nevertheless it set a mark upon him that singled him out from the rest and although he did not suspect it at the time called to him the attention of Sir James Lee himself who regarded him as a lad of free and frank spirit The first morning after the roll call in the armory as Walter Blunt the head bachelor rolled up the slip of parchment and the temporary silence burst forth into redoubled noise and confusion each lad arming himself from a row of racks that stood along the wall he beckoned Myles to him My Lord himself hath spoken to Sir James Lee concerning thee said he Sir James maintaineth that he will not enter thee into the body till thou hast first practised for a while at the pels and shown what thou canst do at broadsword Hast ever fought at the pel Aye answered Myles and that every day of my life sin I became esquire four years ago saving only Sundays and holy days With shield and broadsword Sometimes said Myles and sometimes with the short sword Sir James would have thee come to the tilt yard this morn he himself will take thee in hand to try what thou canst do Thou mayst take the arms upon yonder rack and use them until otherwise bidden Thou seest that the number painted above it on the wall is seventeen that will be thy number for the nonce So Myles armed himself from his rack as the others were doing from theirs The armor was rude and heavy used to accustom the body to the weight of the iron plates rather than for any defence It consisted of a cuirass or breastplate of iron opening at the side with hinges and catching with hooks and eyes epauliers or shoulder plates arm plates and leg pieces and a bascinet or open faced helmet A great triangular shield covered with leather and studded with bosses of iron and a heavy broadsword pointed and dulled at the edges completed the equipment The practice at the pels which Myles was bidden to attend comprised the chief exercise of the day with the esquires of young cadet soldiers of that time and in it they learned not only all the strokes cuts and thrusts of sword play then in vogue but also toughness endurance and elastic quickness The pels themselves consisted of upright posts of ash or oak about five feet six inches in height and in girth somewhat thicker than a man s thigh They were firmly planted in the ground and upon them the strokes of the broadsword were directed At Devlen the pels stood just back of the open and covered tilting courts and the archery ranges and thither those lads not upon household duty were marched every morning excepting Fridays and Sundays and were there exercised under the direction of Sir James Lee and two assistants The whole company was divided into two sometimes into three parties each of which took its turn at the exercise delivering at the word of command the various strokes feints attacks and retreats as the instructors ordered After five minutes of this mock battle the perspiration began to pour down the faces and the breath to come thick and short but it was not until the lads could absolutely endure no more that the order was given to rest and they were allowed to fling themselves panting upon the ground while another company took its place at the triple row of posts As Myles struck and hacked at the pel assigned to him Sir James Lee stood beside him watching him in grim silence The lad did his best to show the knight all that he knew of upper cut under cut thrust and back hand stroke but it did not seem to him that Sir James was very well satisfied with his skill Thou fightest like a clodpole said the old man Ha that stroke was but ill recovered Strike me it again and get thou in guard more quickly Myles repeated the stroke Pest cried Sir James Thou art too slow by a week Here strike thou the blow at me Myles hesitated Sir James held a stout staff in his hand but otherwise he was unarmed Strike I say said Sir James What stayest thou for Art afeard It was Myles s answer that set the seal of individuality upon him Nay said he boldly I am not afeard I fear not thee nor any man So saying he delivered the stroke at Sir James with might and main It was met with a jarring blow that made his wrist and arm tingle and the next instant he received a stroke upon the bascinet that caused his ears to ring and the sparks to dance and fly before his eyes Pardee said Sir James grimly An I had had a mace in my hand I would have knocked thy cockerel brains out that time Thou mayst take that blow for answering me so pertly And now we are quits Now strike me the stroke again an thou art not afeard Myles s eyes watered in spite of himself and he shut the lids tight to wink the dimness away Nevertheless he spoke up undauntedly as before Aye marry will I strike it again said he and this time he was able to recover guard quickly enough to turn Sir James s blow with his shield instead of receiving it upon his head So said Sir James Now mind thee of this that when thou strikest that lower cut at the legs recover thyself more quickly Now then strike me it at the pel Gascoyne and other of the lads who were just then lying stretched out upon the grass beneath a tree at the edge of the open court where stood the pels were interested spectators of the whole scene Not one of them in their memory had heard Sir James so answered face to face as Myles had answered him and after all perhaps the lad himself would not have done so had he been longer a resident in the squires quarters at Devlen By r Lady thou art a cool blade Myles said Gascoyne as they marched back to the armory again Never heard I one bespeak Sir James as thou hast done this day And after all said another of the young squires old Bruin was not so ill pleased methinks That was a shrewd blow he fetched thee on the crown Falworth Marry I would not have had it on my own skull for a silver penny CHAPTER seven So little does it take to make a body s reputation That night all the squires quarters buzzed with the story of how the new boy Falworth had answered Sir James Lee to his face without fear and had exchanged blows with him hand to hand Walter Blunt himself was moved to some show of interest What said he to thee Falworth asked he He said naught said Myles brusquely He only sought to show me how to recover from the under cut It is passing strange that he should take so much notice of thee as to exchange blows with thee with his own hand Haply thou art either very quick or parlous slow at arms It is quick that he is said Gascoyne speaking up in his friend s behalf For the second time that Falworth delivered the stroke Sir James could not reach him to return so I saw with mine own eyes But that very sterling independence that had brought Myles so creditably through this adventure was certain to embroil him with the rude half savage lads about him some of whom especially among the bachelors were his superiors as well in age as in skill and training As said before the bachelors had enforced from the younger boys a fagging sort of attendance on their various personal needs and it was upon this point that Myles first came to grief As it chanced several days passed before any demand was made upon him for service to the heads of the squirehood but when that demand was made the bachelors were very quick to see that the boy who was bold enough to speak up to Sir James Lee was not likely to be a willing fag for them I tell thee Francis he said as Gascoyne and he talked over the matter one day I tell thee I will never serve them Prithee what shame can be fouler than to do such menial service saving for one s rightful Lord Marry quoth Gascoyne I reason not of shame at this or that All I know is that others serve them who are haply as good and maybe better than I be and that if I do not serve them I get knocked i th head therefore which same goeth soothly against my stomach I judge not for thee said Myles Thou art used to these castle ways but only I know that I will not serve them though they be thirty against me instead of thirteen Then thou art a fool said Gascoyne dryly Now in this matter of service there was one thing above all others that stirred Myles Falworth s ill liking The winter before he had come to Devlen Walter Blunt who was somewhat of a Sybarite in his way and who had a repugnance to bathing in the general tank in the open armory court in frosty weather had had Dick Carpenter build a trough in the corner of the dormitory for the use of the bachelors and every morning it was the duty of two of the younger squires to bring three pails of water to fill this private tank for the use of the head esquires It was seeing two of his fellow esquires fetching and carrying this water that Myles disliked so heartily and every morning his bile was stirred anew at the sight Sooner would I die than yield to such vile service said he He did not know how soon his protestations would be put to the test One night it was a week or two after Myles had come to Devlen Blunt was called to attend the Earl at livery The livery was the last meal of the day and was served with great pomp and ceremony about nine o clock at night to the head of the house as he lay in bed Curfew had not yet rung and the lads in the squires quarters were still wrestling and sparring and romping boisterously in and out around the long row of rude cots in the great dormitory as they made ready for the night Six or eight flaring links in wrought iron brackets that stood out from the wall threw a great ruddy glare through the barrack like room a light of all others to romp by Myles and Gascoyne were engaged in defending the passage way between their two cots against the attack of three other lads and Myles held his sheepskin coverlet rolled up into a ball and balanced in his hand ready for launching at the head of one of the others so soon as it should rise from behind the shelter of a cot Just then Walter Blunt dressed with more than usual care passed by on his way to the Earl s house He stopped for a moment and said Mayhaps I will not be in until late to night Thou and Falworth Gascoyne may fetch water to morrow Then he was gone Myles stood staring after his retreating figure with eyes open and mouth agape still holding the ball of sheepskin balanced in his hand Gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank stupefied face but the next moment he laid his hand on his friend s shoulder Myles he said thou wilt not make trouble wilt thou Myles made no answer He flung down his sheepskin and sat him gloomily down upon the side of the cot I said that I would sooner die than fetch water for them said he Aye aye said Gascoyne but that was spoken in haste Myles said nothing but shook his head But after all circumstances shape themselves The next morning when he rose up through the dark waters of sleep it was to feel some one shaking him violently by the shoulder Come cried Gascoyne as Myles opened his eyes come time passeth and we are late Myles bewildered with his sudden awakening and still fuddled with the fumes of sleep huddled into his doublet and hose hardly knowing what he was doing tying a point here and a point there and slipping his feet into his shoes Then he hurried after Gascoyne frowzy half dressed and even yet only half awake It was not until he was fairly out into the fresh air and saw Gascoyne filling the three leathern buckets at the tank that he fully awakened to the fact that he was actually doing that hateful service for the bachelors which he had protested he would sooner die than render The sun was just rising gilding the crown of the donjon keep with a flame of ruddy light Below among the lesser buildings the day was still gray and misty Only an occasional noise broke the silence of the early morning a cough from one of the rooms the rattle of a pot or a pan stirred by some sleepy scullion the clapping of a door or a shutter and now and then the crowing of a cock back of the long row of stables all sounding loud and startling in the fresh dewy stillness Thou hast betrayed me said Myles harshly breaking the silence at last I knew not what I was doing or else I would never have come hither Ne theless even though I be come I will not carry the water for them So be it said Gascoyne tartly An thou canst not stomach it let be and I will e en carry all three myself It will make me two journeys but thank Heaven I am not so proud as to wish to get me hard knocks for naught So saying he picked up two of the buckets and started away across the court for the dormitory Then Myles with a lowering face snatched up the third and hurrying after gave him his hand with the extra pail So it was that he came to do service after all Why tarried ye so long said one of the older bachelors roughly as the two lads emptied the water into the wooden trough He sat on the edge of the cot blowzed and untrussed with his long hair tumbled and disordered His dictatorial tone stung Myles to fury We tarried no longer than need be answered he savagely Have we wings to fly withal at your bidding He spoke so loudly that all in the room heard him the younger squires who were dressing stared in blank amazement and Blunt sat up suddenly in his cot Why how now he cried Answerest thou back thy betters so pertly sirrah By my soul I have a mind to crack thy head with this clog for thy unruly talk He glared at Myles as he spoke and Myles glared back again with right good will Matters might have come to a crisis only that Gascoyne and Wilkes dragged their friend away before he had opportunity to answer An ill conditioned knave as ever I did see growled Blunt glaring after him Myles Myles said Gascoyne almost despairingly why wilt thou breed such mischief for thyself Seest thou not thou hast got thee the ill will of every one of the bachelors from Wat Blunt to Robin de Ramsey I care not said Myles fiercely recurring to his grievance Heard ye not how the dogs upbraided me before the whole room That Blunt called me an ill conditioned knave Marry said Gascoyne laughing and so thou art Thus it is that boldness may breed one enemies as well as gain one friends My own notion is that one s enemies are more quick to act than one s friends CHAPTER eight Every one knows the disagreeable lurking discomfort that follows a quarrel a discomfort that imbitters the very taste of life for the time being Such was the dull distaste that Myles felt that morning after what had passed in the dormitory Every one in the proximity of such an open quarrel feels a reflected constraint and in Myles s mind was a disagreeable doubt whether that constraint meant disapproval of him or of his late enemies It seemed to him that Gascoyne added the last bitter twang to his unpleasant feelings when half an hour later they marched with the others to chapel Why dost thou breed such trouble for thyself Myles said he recurring to what he had already said Is it not foolish for thee to come hither to this place and then not submit to the ways thereof as the rest of us do Thou talkest not like a true friend to chide me thus said Myles sullenly and he withdrew his arm from his friend s Marry come up said Gascoyne an I were not thy friend I would let thee jog thine own way It aches not my bones to have thine drubbed Just then they entered the chapel and words that might have led to a quarrel were brought to a close Myles was not slow to see that he had the ill will of the head of their company That morning in the armory he had occasion to ask some question of Blunt the head squire stared coldly at him for a moment gave him a short gruff answer and then turning his back abruptly began talking with one of the other bachelors Myles flushed hot at the other s insulting manner and looked quickly around to see if any of the others had observed what had passed It was a comfort to him to see that all were too busy arming themselves to think of anything else nevertheless his face was very lowering as he turned away Some day I will show him that I am as good a man as he he muttered to himself An evil hearted dog to put shame upon me The storm was brewing and ready to break That day was exceptionally hot and close and permission had been asked by and granted to those squires not on duty to go down to the river for a bath after exercise at the pels But as Myles replaced his arms in the rack a little page came with a bidding to come to Sir James in his office Look now said Myles here is just my ill fortune Why might he not have waited an hour longer rather than cause me to miss going with ye Nay said Gascoyne let not that grieve thee Myles Wilkes and I will wait for thee in the dormitory will we not Edmund Make thou haste and go to Sir James Sir James was sitting at the table studying over a scroll of parchment when Myles entered his office and stood before him at the table Well boy said he laying aside the parchment and looking up at the lad I have tried thee fairly for these few days and may say that I have found thee worthy to be entered upon the rolls as esquire of the body I give thee thanks sir said Myles The knight nodded his head in acknowledgement but did not at once give the word of dismissal that Myles had expected Dost mean to write thee a letter home soon said he suddenly Aye said Myles gaping in great wonderment at the strangeness of the question Then when thou dost so write said Sir James give thou my deep regards to thy father Then he continued after a brief pause Him did I know well in times gone by and we were right true friends in hearty love and for his sake I would befriend thee that is in so much as is fitting Sir said Myles but Sir James held up his hand and he stopped short in his thanks But boy said he that which I sent for thee for to tell thee was of more import than these Dost thou know that thy father is an attainted outlaw Nay cried Myles his cheeks blazing up as red as fire who sayeth that of him lieth in his teeth Thou dost mistake me said Sir James quietly It is sometimes no shame to be outlawed and banned Had it been so I would not have told thee thereof nor have bidden thee send my true love to thy father as I did but now But boy certes he standest continually in great danger greater than thou wottest of Were it known where he lieth hid it might be to his undoing and utter ruin Methought that belike thou mightest not know that and so I sent for thee for to tell thee that it behoovest thee to say not one single word concerning him to any of these new friends of thine nor who he is nor what he is But how came my father to be so banned said Myles in a constrained and husky voice and after a long time of silence That I may not tell thee just now said the old knight only this that I have been bidden to make it known to thee that thy father hath an enemy full as powerful as my Lord the Earl himself and that through that enemy all his ill fortune his blindness and everything hath come Moreover did this enemy know where thy father lieth he would slay him right speedily Sir cried Myles violently smiting his open palm upon the table tell me who this man is and I will kill him Sir James smiled grimly Thou talkest like a boy said he Wait until thou art grown to be a man Mayhap then thou mayst repent thee of these bold words for one time this enemy of thy father s was reckoned the foremost knight in England and he is now the King s dear friend and a great lord But said Myles after another long time of heavy silence will not my Lord then befriend me for the sake of my father who was one time his dear comrade Sir James shook his head It may not be said he Neither thou nor thy father must look for open favor from the Earl An he befriended Falworth and it came to be known that he had given him aid or succor it might belike be to his own undoing No boy thou must not even look to be taken into the household to serve with gentlemen as the other squires do serve but must even live thine own life here and fight thine own way Myles s eyes blazed Then cried he fiercely it is shame and attaint upon my Lord the Earl and cowardice as well and never will I ask favor of him who is so untrue a friend as to turn his back upon a comrade in trouble as he turneth his back upon my father Thou art a foolish boy said Sir James with a bitter smile and knowest naught of the world An thou wouldst look for man to befriend man to his own danger thou must look elsewhere than on this earth Was I not one time Mackworth s dear friend as well as thy father It could cost him naught to honor me and here am I fallen to be a teacher of boys Go to thou art a fool Then after a little pause of brooding silence he went on to say that the Earl was no better or worse than the rest of the world That men of his position had many jealous enemies ever seeking their ruin and that such must look first of all each to himself or else be certainly ruined and drag down others in that ruin Myles was silenced but the bitterness had entered his heart and abided with him for many a day afterwards Perhaps Sir James read his feelings in his frank face for he sat looking curiously at him twirling his grizzled mustache the while Thou art like to have hard knocks of it lad ere thou hast gotten thee safe through the world said he with more kindness in his harsh voice than was usual But get thee not into fights before thy time Then he charged the boy very seriously to live at peace with his fellow squires and for his father s sake as well as his own to enter into none of the broils that were so frequent in their quarters It was with this special admonition against brawling that Myles was dismissed to enter before five minutes had passed into the first really great fight of his life Besides Gascoyne and Wilkes he found gathered in the dormitory six or eight of the company of squires who were to serve that day upon household duty among others Walter Blunt and three other bachelors who were changing their coarse service clothes for others more fit for the household Why didst thou tarry so long Myles said Gascoyne as he entered Methought thou wert never coming Where goest thou Falworth called Blunt from the other end of the room where he was lacing his doublet Just now Myles had no heart in the swimming or sport of any sort but he answered shortly I go to the river to swim Nay said Blunt thou goest not forth from the castle to day Hast thou forgot how thou didst answer me back about fetching the water this morning This day thou must do penance so go thou straight to the armory and scour thou up my breastplate From the time he had arisen that morning everything had gone wrong with Myles He had felt himself already outrated in rendering service to the bachelors he had quarrelled with the head of the esquires he had nearly quarrelled with Gascoyne and then had come the bitterest and worst of all the knowledge that his father was an outlaw and that the Earl would not stretch out a hand to aid him or to give him any countenance Blunt s words brought the last bitter cut to his heart and they stung him to fury For a while he could not answer but stood glaring with a face fairly convulsed with passion at the young man who continued his toilet unconscious of the wrath of the new recruit Gascoyne and Wilkes accepting Myles s punishment as a thing of course were about to leave the dormitory when Myles checked them Stop Francis he cried hoarsely Thinkest thou that I will stay behind to do yon dog s dirty work No I go with ye A moment or two of dumb silent amazement followed his bold words then Blunt cried Art thou mad Nay answered Myles in the same hoarse voice I am not mad I tell thee a better man than thou shouldst not stay me from going an I list to go I will break thy cockerel head for that speech said Blunt furiously He stooped as he spoke and picked up a heavy clog that lay at his feet It was no insignificant weapon either The shoes of those days were sometimes made of cloth and had long pointed toes stuffed with tow or wool In muddy weather thick heavy clogs or wooden soles were strapped like a skate to the bottom of the foot That clog which Blunt had seized was perhaps eighteen or twenty inches long two or two and a half inches thick at the heel tapering to a point at the toe As the older lad advanced Gascoyne stepped between him and his victim Do not harm him Blunt he pleaded Bear thou in mind how new come he is among us He knoweth not our ways as yet Stand thou back Gascoyne said Blunt harshly as he thrust him aside I will teach him our ways so that he will not soon forget them Close to Myles s feet was another clog like that one which Blunt held He snatched it up and set his back against the wall with a white face and a heart beating heavily and tumultuously but with courage steeled to meet the coming encounter There was a hard grim look in his blue eyes that for a moment perhaps quelled the elder lad He hesitated Tom Wat Ned he called to the other bachelors come hither and lend me a hand with this knave An ye come nigh me panted Myles I will brain the first within reach Then Gascoyne dodged behind the others and without being seen slipped out of the room for help The battle that followed was quick sharp and short As Blunt strode forward Myles struck and struck with might and main but he was too excited to deliver his blow with calculation Blunt parried it with the clog he held and the next instant dropping his weapon gripped Myles tight about the body pinning his arms to his sides Myles also dropped the clog he held and wrenching out his right arm with a sudden heave struck Blunt full in the face and then with another blow sent him staggering back It all passed in an instant the next the three other bachelors were upon him catching him by the body the arms the legs For a moment or two they swayed and stumbled hither and thither and then down they fell in a struggling heap Myles fought like a wild cat kicking struggling scratching striking with elbows and fists He caught one of the three by his collar and tore his jacket open from the neck to the waist he drove his foot into the pit of the stomach of another and knocked him breathless The other lads not in the fight stood upon the benches and the beds around but such was the awe inspired by the prestige of the bachelors that not one of them dared to lend hand to help him and so Myles fought his fierce battle alone But four to one were odds too great and though Myles struggled as fiercely as ever by and by it was with less and less resistance Blunt had picked up the clog he had dropped when he first attacked the lad and now stood over the struggling heap white with rage the blood running from his lip cut and puffed where Myles had struck him and murder looking out from his face if ever it looked out of the face of any mortal being Hold him a little said he fiercely and I will still him for you Even yet it was no easy matter for the others to do his bidding but presently he got his chance and struck a heavy cruel blow at Myles s head Myles only partly warded it with his arm Hitherto he had fought in silence now he gave a harsh cry Holy Saints cried Edmund Wilkes They will kill him Blunt struck two more blows both of them upon the body and then at last they had the poor boy down with his face upon the ground and his arms pinned to his sides and Blunt bracing himself for the stroke with a grin of rage raised a heavy clog for one terrible blow that should finish the fight CHAPTER nine How now messieurs said a harsh voice that fell upon the turmoil like a thunder clap and there stood Sir James Lee Instantly the struggle ceased and the combatants scrambled to their feet The older lads stood silent before their chief but Myles was deaf and blind and mad with passion he knew not where he stood or what he said or did White as death he stood for a while glaring about him catching his breath convulsively Then he screamed hoarsely Who struck me Who struck me when I was down I will have his blood that struck me He caught sight of Blunt It was he that struck me he cried Thou foul traitor thou coward and thereupon leaped at his enemy like a wild cat Stop cried Sir James Lee clutching him by the arm Myles was too blinded by his fury to see who it was that held him I will not stop he cried struggling and striking at the knight Let me go I will have his life that struck me when I was down The next moment he found himself pinned close against the wall and then as though his sight came back he saw the grim face of the old one eyed knight looking into his Dost thou know who I am said a stern harsh voice Instantly Myles ceased struggling and his arms fell at his side Aye he said in a gasping voice I know thee He swallowed spasmodically for a moment or two and then in the sudden revulsion of feeling burst out sobbing convulsively Sir James marched the two off to his office he himself walking between them holding an arm of each the other lads following behind awe struck and silent Entering the office Sir James shut the door behind him leaving the group of squires clustered outside about the stone steps speculating in whispers as to what would be the outcome of the matter After Sir James had seated himself the two standing facing him he regarded them for a while in silence How now Walter Blunt said he at last what is to do Why this said Blunt wiping his bleeding lip That fellow Myles Falworth hath been breeding mutiny and revolt ever sin he came hither among us and because he was thus mutinous I would punish him therefor In that thou liest burst out Myles Never have I been mutinous in my life Be silent sir said Sir James sternly I will hear thee anon Nay said Myles with his lips twitching and writhing I will not be silent I am friendless here and ye are all against me but I will not be silent and brook to have lies spoken of me Even Blunt stood aghast at Myles s boldness Never had he heard any one so speak to Sir James before He did not dare for the moment even to look up Second after second of dead stillness passed while Sir James sat looking at Myles with a stern terrifying calmness that chilled him in spite of the heat of his passion Sir said the old man at last in a hard quiet voice thou dost know naught of rules and laws of such a place as this Nevertheless it is time for thee to learn them So I will tell thee now that if thou openest thy lips to say only one single word more except at my bidding I will send thee to the black vault of the donjon to cool thy hot spirits on bread and water for a week There was something in the measured quietness of the old knight s tone that quelled Myles utterly and entirely A little space of silence followed Now then Blunt said Sir James turning to the bachelor tell me all the ins and outs of this business without any more underdealing This time Blunt s story though naturally prejudiced in his own favor was fairly true Then Myles told his side of the case the old knight listening attentively Why how now Blunt said Sir James when Myles had ended I myself gave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe Wherefore shouldst thou forbid one of them I did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny said the bachelor Methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them So ye are said the knight but only to a degree Ere ye take it upon ye to gainsay any of my orders or permits come ye first to me Dost thou understand Aye answered Blunt sullenly So be it and now get thee gone said the knight and let me hear no more of beating out brains with wooden clogs An ye fight your battles let there not be murder in them This is twice that the like hath happed gin I hear more of such doings He did utter his threat but stopped short and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire Now shake hands and be ye friends said he abruptly Blunt made a motion to obey but Myles put his hand behind him Nay I shake not hands with any one who struck me while I was down So be it said the knight grimly Now thou mayst go Blunt Thou Falworth stay I would bespeak thee further Tell me said he when the elder lad had left them why wilt thou not serve these bachelors as the other squires do Such is the custom here Why wilt thou not obey it Because said Myles I cannot stomach it and they shall not make me serve them An thou bid me do it sir I will do it but not at their command Nay said the knight I do not bid thee do them service That lieth with thee to render or not as thou seest fit But how canst thou hope to fight single handed against the commands of a dozen lads all older and mightier than thou I know not said Myles but were they an hundred instead of thirteen they should not make me serve them Thou art a fool said the old knight smiling faintly for that be saint not courage but folly When one setteth about righting a wrong one driveth not full head against it for in so doing one getteth naught but hard knocks Nay go deftly about it and then when the time is ripe strike the blow Now our beloved King Henry when he was the Earl of Derby what could he have gained had he stood so against the old King Richard brooking the King face to face I tell thee he would have been knocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day Now were I thee and had to fight a fight against odds I would first get me friends behind me and then He stopped short but Myles understood him well enough Sir said he with a gulp I do thank thee for thy friendship and ask thy pardon for doing as I did anon I grant thee pardon said the knight but tell thee plainly an thou dost face me so again I will truly send thee to the black cell for a week Now get thee away All the other lads were gone when Myles came forth save only the faithful Gascoyne who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with his friend and perhaps that little act of self denial moved Myles more than many a great thing might have done It was right kind of thee Francis said he laying his hand affectionately on his friend s shoulder I know not why thou lovest me so Why for one thing this matter answered his friend because methinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of us squires Myles laughed Nevertheless Gascoyne s words were a soothing balm for much that had happened that day I will fight me no more just now said he and then he told his friend all that Sir James had advised about biding his time Gascoyne blew a long whistle Beshrew me quoth he but methinks old Bruin is on thy side of the quarrel Myles An that be so I am with thee also and others that I can name as well So be it said Myles Then am I content to abide the time when we may become strong enough to stand against them 
2185-150123-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER ten Perhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood than the finding of some secret hiding place whither a body may creep away from the bustle of the world s life to nestle in quietness for an hour or two
2185-150123-0001	train-other-500	More especially is such delightful
none	none	 if it happen that by peeping from out it 
2185-150123-0002	train-other-500	one may look down upon the bustling matters of busy every day life while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any as though one were in some strange invisible world of one s own
none	none	 Such a hiding place as would have filled the heart of almost any boy with sweet delight 
2185-150123-0003	train-other-500	Myles and Gascoyne found one summer afternoon They called it their Eyry and the name suited well for the roosting place of the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness looking down upon the shifting castle life in the courts below Behind the north stable
2185-150123-0004	train-other-500	a great long rambling building thick walled and black with age lay an older part of the castle than that peopled by the better class of life a cluster of great thick walls rudely but strongly built now the dwelling place of stable lads and hinds
2185-150123-0005	train-other-500	swine and poultry From one part of these ancient walls and fronting an inner court of the castle arose a tall circular heavy buttressed tower considerably higher than the other buildings and so mantled with a dense growth of aged ivy
2185-150123-0006	train-other-500	as to stand a shaft of solid green Above its crumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons white and pied clapping and clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air Several windows some closed with shutters
none	none	 peeped here and there from out the leaves 
2185-150123-0007	train-other-500	and near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings as though of a balcony or an airy gallery Myles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower and one day as he and Gascoyne sat together
2185-150123-0008	train-other-500	he pointed his finger and said What is yon place That answered Gascoyne
none	none	 looking over his shoulder 
2185-150123-0009	train-other-500	that they call Brutus Tower for why they do say that Brutus he built it when he came hither to Britain I believe not the tale mine own self ne theless it is marvellous ancient and old Robin the Fletcher
2185-150123-0010	train-other-500	telleth me that there be stairways built in the wall and passage ways and a maze wherein a body may get lost an he know not the way aright and never see the blessed light of day again Marry said Myles
none	none	 those same be strange sayings 
2185-150123-0011	train-other-500	Who liveth there now No one liveth there said Gascoyne saving only some of the stable villains and that half witted goose herd who flung stones at us yesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock He and his wife and those others dwell in the vaults beneath
2185-150123-0012	train-other-500	like rabbits in any warren No one else hath lived there since Earl Robert s day
none	none	 which belike was an hundred years agone 
2185-150123-0013	train-other-500	The story goeth that Earl Robert s brother or step brother was murdered there and some men say by the Earl himself Sin that day it hath been tight shut Myles stared at the tower for a while in silence
2185-150123-0014	train-other-500	It is a strange seeming place from without said he at last and mayhap it may be even more strange inside Hast ever been within Francis Nay said Gascoyne
none	none	 said I not it hath been fast locked since Earl Robert s day By r Lady said Myles 
2185-150123-0015	train-other-500	an I had lived here in this place so long as thou I wot I would have been within it ere this Beshrew me said Gascoyne but I have never thought of such a matter He turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warm sunlight with a new interest
2185-150123-0016	train-other-500	for the thought of entering it smacked pleasantly of adventure How wouldst thou set about getting within said he presently Why look said Myles seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches
2185-150123-0017	train-other-500	Methinks there is a window at that place An I mistake not it is in reach of the stable eaves A body might come up by the fagot pile to the roof of the hen house and then by the long stable to the north stable and so to that hole
none	none	 Gascoyne looked thoughtfully at the Brutus Tower and then suddenly inquired 
2185-150123-0018	train-other-500	Wouldst go there Aye said Myles briefly So be it Lead thou the way in the venture I will follow after thee said Gascoyne As Myles had said
2185-150123-0019	train-other-500	the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easy enough to an active pair of lads like themselves but when by and by they reached the wall of the tower itself they found the hidden window much higher from the roof than they had judged from below
2185-150123-0020	train-other-500	perhaps ten or twelve feet and it was besides beyond the eaves and out of their reach Myles looked up and looked down Above was the bushy thickness of the ivy the branches as thick as a woman s wrist
2185-150123-0021	train-other-500	knotted and intertwined below was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of the stable buildings Methinks I can climb to yon place said he Thou lieutenant break thy neck an thou tryest said Gascoyne hastily
2185-150123-0022	train-other-500	Nay quoth Myles I trust not but break or make we get not there without trying So here goeth for the venture Thou art a hare brained knave as ever drew breath of life quoth Gascoyne
2185-150123-0023	train-other-500	and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days Ne theless an thou be Jack Fool and lead the way go and I will be Tom Fool and follow anon If thy neck is worth so little mine is worth no more
2185-150123-0024	train-other-500	It was indeed a perilous climb but that special providence which guards reckless lads befriended them as it has thousands of their kind before and since So by climbing from one knotted clinging stem to another
2185-150123-0025	train-other-500	they were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window It was barred from within by a crumbling shutter the rusty fastening of which after some little effort upon the part of the two gave way and entering the narrow opening
2185-150123-0026	train-other-500	they found themselves in a small triangular passage way from which a steep flight of stone steps led down through a hollow in the massive wall to the room below At the bottom of the steps was a heavy oaken door which stood ajar
2185-150123-0027	train-other-500	hanging upon a single rusty hinge and from the room within a dull gray light glimmered faintly Myles pushed the door farther open it creaked and grated horribly on its rusty hinge and
2185-150123-0028	train-other-500	as in instant answer to the discordant shriek came a faint piping squeaking a rustling and a pattering of soft footsteps The ghosts cried Gascoyne in a quavering whisper and for a moment
2185-150123-0029	train-other-500	Myles felt the chill of goose flesh creep up and down his spine But the next moment he laughed Nay said he they be rats Look at yon fellow Francis Be saint as big as Mother Joan s kitten Give me that stone
2185-150123-0030	train-other-500	He flung it at the rat and it flew clattering across the floor There was another pattering rustle of hundreds of feet and then a breathless silence The boys stood looking around them and a strange enough sight it was
2185-150123-0031	train-other-500	The room was a perfect circle of about twenty feet across and was piled high with an indistinguishable mass of lumber rude tables ruder chairs ancient chests bits and remnants of cloth and sacking and leather
2185-150123-0032	train-other-500	old helmets and pieces of armor of a by gone time broken spears and pole axes pots and pans and kitchen furniture of all sorts and kinds A straight beam of sunlight fell through a broken shutter like a bar of gold
2185-150123-0033	train-other-500	and fell upon the floor in a long streak of dazzling light that illuminated the whole room with a yellow glow By r Lady said Gascoyne at last in a hushed voice here is Father Time s garret for sure Didst ever see the like Myles
2185-150123-0034	train-other-500	Look at yon arbalist sure Brutus himself used such an one Nay said Myles but look at this saddle Marry here be saint a rat s nest in it Clouds of dust rose as they rummaged among the mouldering mass
2185-150123-0035	train-other-500	setting them coughing and sneezing Now and then a great gray rat would shoot out beneath their very feet and disappear like a sudden shadow into some hole or cranny in the wall Come said Myles at last brushing the dust from his jacket
2185-150123-0036	train-other-500	an we tarry here longer we will have chance to see no other sights the sun is falling low An arched stair way upon the opposite side of the room from which they had entered wound upward through the wall
2185-150123-0037	train-other-500	the stone steps being lighted by narrow slits of windows cut through the massive masonry Above the room they had just left was another of the same shape and size but with an oak floor sagging and rising into hollows and hills where the joist had rotted away beneath
none	none	 It was bare and empty and not even a rat was to be seen 
2185-150123-0038	train-other-500	Above was another room above that another
none	none	 all the passages and stairways which connected the one story with the other being built in the wall 
2185-150123-0039	train-other-500	which was where solid perhaps fifteen feet thick From the third floor a straight flight of steps led upward to a closed door from the other side of which shone the dazzling brightness of sunlight and whence came a strange noise
2185-150123-0040	train-other-500	a soft rustling a melodious murmur The boys put their shoulders against the door which was fastened
none	none	 and pushed with might and main 
2185-150123-0041	train-other-500	once twice suddenly the lock gave way and out they pitched headlong into a blaze of sunlight A deafening clapping and uproar sounded in their ears and scores of pigeons suddenly disturbed rose in stormy flight
2185-150123-0042	train-other-500	They sat up and looked around them in silent wonder They were in a bower of leafy green It was the top story of the tower the roof of which had crumbled and toppled in leaving it open to the sky
2185-150123-0043	train-other-500	with only here and there a slanting beam or two supporting a portion of the tiled roof
none	none	 affording shelter for the nests of the pigeons crowded closely together Over everything the ivy had grown in a mantling sheet 
2185-150123-0044	train-other-500	a net work of shimmering green through which the sunlight fell flickering This passeth wonder said Gascoyne at last breaking the silence Aye said Myles I did never see the like in all my life Then
2185-150123-0045	train-other-500	Look yonder is a room beyond let us see what it is Francis Entering an arched door way the two found themselves in a beautiful little vaulted chapel about eighteen feet long and twelve or fifteen wide
2185-150123-0046	train-other-500	It comprised the crown of one of the large massive buttresses
none	none	 and from it opened the row of arched windows which could be seen from below through the green shimmering of the ivy leaves 
2185-150123-0047	train-other-500	The boys pushed aside the trailing tendrils and looked out and down The whole castle lay spread below them
none	none	 with the busy people unconsciously intent upon the matters of their daily work 
2185-150123-0048	train-other-500	They could see the gardener with bowed back patiently working among the flowers in the garden the stable boys below grooming the horses a bevy of ladies in the privy garden playing at shuttlecock with battledoors of wood
2185-150123-0049	train-other-500	a group of gentlemen walking up and down in front of the Earl s house They could see the household servants hurrying hither and thither two little scullions at fisticuffs and a kitchen girl standing in the door way scratching her frowzy head
2185-150123-0050	train-other-500	It was all like a puppetshow of real life each acting unconsciously a part in the play The cool wind came in through the rustling leaves and fanned their cheeks hot with the climb up the winding stair way
2185-150123-0051	train-other-500	We will call it our Eyry said Gascoyne
none	none	 and we will be the hawks that live here 
2185-150123-0052	train-other-500	And that was how it got its name
none	none	 The next day Myles had the armorer make him a score of large spikes which he and Gascoyne drove between the ivy branches and into the cement of the wall and so made a safe passageway by which to reach the window niche in the wall CHAPTER eleven 
2185-150124-0000	train-other-500	THE TWO friends kept the secret of the Eyry to themselves for a little while now and then visiting the old tower to rummage among the lumber stored in the lower room or to loiter away the afternoon in the windy solitudes of the upper heights And in that little time
2185-150124-0001	train-other-500	when the ancient keep was to them a small world unknown to any but themselves a world far away above all the dull matters of every day life they talked of many things that might else never have been known to one another
2185-150124-0002	train-other-500	Mostly they spoke the crude romantic thoughts and desires of boyhood s time chaff thrown to the wind in which however lay a few stray seeds fated to fall to good earth and to ripen to fruition in manhood s day
2185-150124-0003	train-other-500	In the intimate talks of that time Myles imparted something of his honest solidity to Gascoyne s somewhat weathercock nature and to Myles s ruder and more uncouth character Gascoyne lent a tone of his gentler manners
2185-150124-0004	train-other-500	learned in his pagehood service as attendant upon the Countess and her ladies In other things also the character and experience of the one lad helped to supply what was lacking in the other
none	none	 Myles was replete with old Latin gestes fables and sermons 
2185-150124-0005	train-other-500	picked up during his school life in those intervals of his more serious studies when Prior Edward had permitted him to browse in the greener pastures of the Gesta Romanorum and the Disciplina Clericalis of the monastery library
2185-150124-0006	train-other-500	and Gascoyne was never weary of hearing him tell those marvellous stories culled from the crabbed Latin of the old manuscript volumes Upon his part Gascoyne was full of the lore of the waiting room and the antechamber and Myles
2185-150124-0007	train-other-500	who in all his life had never known a lady young or old excepting his mother was never tired of lying silently listening to Gascoyne s chatter of the gay doings of the castle gentle life in which he had taken part so often in the merry days of his pagehood
2185-150124-0008	train-other-500	I do wonder said Myles quaintly that thou couldst ever find the courage to bespeak a young maid Francis Never did I do so nor ever could Rather would I face three strong men than one young damsel
2185-150124-0009	train-other-500	Whereupon Gascoyne burst out laughing Marry quoth he they be no such terrible things but gentle and pleasant spoken and soft and smooth as any cat No matter for that said Myles
2185-150124-0010	train-other-500	I would not face one such for worlds It was during the short time when so to speak the two owned the solitude of the Brutus Tower that Myles told his friend of his father s outlawry and of the peril in which the family stood
2185-150124-0011	train-other-500	And thus it was I do marvel said Gascoyne one day as the two lay stretched in the Eyry looking down into the castle court yard below I do marvel now that thou art stablished here this month and more
none	none	 that my Lord doth never have thee called to service upon household duty 
2185-150124-0012	train-other-500	Canst thou riddle me why it is so Myles The subject was a very sore one with Myles Until Sir James had told him of the matter in his office that day
none	none	 he had never known that his father was attainted and outlawed 
2185-150124-0013	train-other-500	He had accepted the change from their earlier state and the bald poverty of their life at Crosbey Holt with the easy carelessness of boyhood
none	none	 and Sir James s words were the first to awaken him to a realization of the misfortunes of the house of Falworth 
2185-150124-0014	train-other-500	His was a brooding nature and in the three or four weeks that passed he had meditated so much over what had been told him that by and by it almost seemed as if a shadow of shame rested upon his father s fair fame
2185-150124-0015	train-other-500	even though the attaint set upon him was unrighteous and unjust as Myles knew it must be He had felt angry and resentful at the Earl s neglect and as days passed and he was not noticed in any way his heart was at times very bitter
2185-150124-0016	train-other-500	So now Gascoyne s innocent question touched a sore spot and Myles spoke with a sharp angry pain in his voice that made the other look quickly up
2185-150124-0017	train-other-500	Sooner would my Lord have yonder swineherd serve him in the household than me said he Why may that be Myles said Gascoyne Because answered Myles with the same angry bitterness in his voice
2185-150124-0018	train-other-500	either the Earl is a coward that feareth to befriend me or else he is a caitiff ashamed of his own flesh and blood and of me the son of his one time comrade Gascoyne raised himself upon his elbow and opened his eyes wide in wonder
none	none	 Afeard of thee Myles quoth he 
2185-150124-0019	train-other-500	Why should he be afeared to befriend thee Who art thou that the Earl should fear thee Myles hesitated for a moment or two wisdom bade him remain silent upon the dangerous topic
2185-150124-0020	train-other-500	but his heart yearned for sympathy and companionship in his trouble I will tell thee said he suddenly and therewith poured out all of the story so far as he knew it to his listening wondering friend
2185-150124-0021	train-other-500	and his heart felt lighter to be thus eased of its burden And now said he as he concluded is not this Earl a mean hearted caitiff to leave me the son of his one time friend and kinsman
none	none	 thus to stand or to fall alone among strangers 
2185-150124-0022	train-other-500	and in a strange place without once stretching me a helping hand He waited and Gascoyne knew that he expected an answer I know not that he is a mean hearted caitiff Myles said he at last hesitatingly
2185-150124-0023	train-other-500	The Earl hath many enemies and I have heard that he hath stood more than once in peril having been accused of dealings with the King s foes He was cousin to the Earl of Kent
none	none	 and I do remember hearing that he had a narrow escape at that time from ruin 
2185-150124-0024	train-other-500	There be more reasons than thou wottest of why he should not have dealings with thy father I had not thought said Myles bitterly after a little pause that thou wouldst stand up for him and against me in this quarrel Gascoyne
2185-150124-0025	train-other-500	Him will I never forgive so long as I may live and I had thought that thou wouldst have stood by me
none	none	 So I do said Gascoyne hastily 
2185-150124-0026	train-other-500	and do love thee more than any one in all the world Myles
none	none	 but I had thought that it would make thee feel more easy 
2185-150124-0027	train-other-500	to think that the Earl was not against thee And indeed from all thou has told me I do soothly think that he and Sir James mean to befriend thee and hold thee privily in kind regard Then why doth he not stand forth like a man
2185-150124-0028	train-other-500	and befriend me and my father openly even if it be to his own peril said Myles reverting stubbornly to what he had first spoken Gascoyne did not answer but lay for a long while in silence
2185-150124-0029	train-other-500	Knowest thou he suddenly asked after a while who is this great enemy of whom Sir James speaketh and who seeketh so to drive thy father to ruin Nay said Myles I know not
2185-150124-0030	train-other-500	for my father hath never spoken of these things and Sir James would not tell me But this I know said he suddenly grinding his teeth together an I do not hunt him out some day and slay him like a dog He stopped abruptly
2185-150124-0031	train-other-500	and Gascoyne looking askance at him saw that his eyes were full of tears whereupon he turned his looks away again quickly and fell to shooting pebbles out through the open window with his finger and thumb
none	none	 Thou wilt tell no one of these things that I have said 
2185-150124-0032	train-other-500	said Myles after a while Not I said Gascoyne
none	none	 Thinkest thou I could do such a thing 
2185-150124-0033	train-other-500	Nay said Myles briefly Perhaps this talk more than anything else that had ever passed between them
none	none	 knit the two friends the closer together 
2185-150124-0034	train-other-500	for as I have said Myles felt easier now that he had poured out his bitter thoughts and words and as for Gascoyne
none	none	 I think that there is nothing so flattering to one s soul as to be made the confidant of a stronger nature 
2185-150124-0035	train-other-500	But the old tower served another purpose than that of a spot in which to pass away a few idle hours or in which to indulge the confidences of friendship for it was there that Myles gathered a backing of strength for resistance against the tyranny of the bachelors
none	none	 and it is for that more than for any other reason 
2185-150124-0036	train-other-500	that it has been told how they found the place and of what they did there feeling secure against interruption Myles Falworth was not of a kind that forgets or neglects a thing upon which the mind has once been set Perhaps his chief objective
2185-150124-0037	train-other-500	since the talk with Sir James following his fight in the dormitory had been successful resistance to the exactions of the head of the body of squires He was now more than a month had passed
none	none	 looked upon by nearly if not all of the younger lads as an acknowledged leader in his own class 
2185-150124-0038	train-other-500	So one day he broached a matter to Gascoyne that had for some time been digesting in his mind It was the formation of a secret order calling themselves the Knights of the Rose their meeting place to be the chapel of the Brutus Tower
2185-150124-0039	train-other-500	and their object to be the righting of wrongs as they said Myles of Arthur his Round table did right wrongs But prithee what wrongs are there to right in this place quoth Gascoyne
2185-150124-0040	train-other-500	after listening intently to the plan which Myles set forth Why first of all this said Myles clinching his fists as he had a habit of doing when anything stirred him deeply that we set those vile bachelors to their right place
2185-150124-0041	train-other-500	and that is that they be no longer our masters but our fellows Gascoyne shook his head He hated clashing and conflict above all things and was for peace Why should they thus rush to thrust themselves into trouble
2185-150124-0042	train-other-500	Let matters abide as they were a little longer surely life was pleasant enough without turning it all topsy turvy Then with a sort of indignation why should Myles who had only come among them a month
2185-150124-0043	train-other-500	take such service more to heart than they who had endured it for years And finally with the hopefulness of so many of the rest of us he advised Myles to let matters alone and they would right themselves in time
2185-150124-0044	train-other-500	But Myles s mind was determined his active spirit could not brook resting passively under a wrong he would endure no longer
none	none	 and now or never they must make their stand 
2185-150124-0045	train-other-500	But look thee Myles Falworth said Gascoyne all this is not to be done withouten fighting shrewdly Wilt thou take that fighting upon thine own self As for me I tell thee I love it not
2185-150124-0046	train-other-500	Why aye said Myles I ask no man to do what I will not do myself Gascoyne shrugged his shoulders So be it said he An thou hast appetite to run thy head against hard knocks
none	none	 do it i mercy s name I for one will stand thee back while thou art taking thy raps There was a spirit of drollery in Gascoyne s speech that rubbed against Myles s earnestness Out upon it cried he 
2185-150124-0048	train-other-500	his patience giving way Seest not that I am in serious earnest Why then dost thou still jest like Mad Noll my Lord s fool An thou wilt not lend me thine aid in this matter say so and ha done with it
2185-150124-0049	train-other-500	and I will bethink me of somewhere else to turn Then Gascoyne yielded at once
none	none	 as he always did when his friend lost his temper 
2185-150124-0050	train-other-500	and having once assented to it entered into the scheme heart and soul Three other lads one of them that tall thin squire Edmund Wilkes before spoken of were sounded upon the subject They also entered into the plan of the secret organization
2185-150124-0051	train-other-500	with an enthusiasm which might perhaps not have been quite so glowing had they realized how very soon Myles designed embarking upon active practical operations One day Myles and Gascoyne showed them the strange things that they had discovered in the old tower
2185-150124-0052	train-other-500	the inner staircases the winding passage ways the queer niches and cupboard and the black shaft of a well that pierced down into the solid wall and whence perhaps the old castle folk had one time drawn their supply of water in time of siege
2185-150124-0053	train-other-500	and with every new wonder of the marvellous place the enthusiasm of the three recruits rose higher and higher They rummaged through the lumber pile in the great circular room as Myles and Gascoyne had done and at last tired out they ascended to the airy chapel
none	none	 and there sat cooling themselves in the rustling freshness of the breeze 
2185-150124-0054	train-other-500	that came blowing briskly in through the arched windows It was then and there that the five discussed and finally determined upon the detailed plans of their organization canvassing the names of the squirehood and selecting from it a sufficient number of bold and daring spirits
2185-150124-0055	train-other-500	to make up a roll of twenty names in all Gascoyne had as I said entered into the matter with spirit and perhaps it was owing more to him than to any other that the project caught its delightful flavor of romance Perchance said he
2185-150124-0056	train-other-500	as the five lads lay in the rustling stillness through which sounded the monotonous and ceaseless cooing of the pigeons perchance there may be dwarfs and giants and dragons and enchanters and evil knights and what not even nowadays
none	none	 And who knows but that if we Knights of the Rose hold together 
2185-150124-0057	train-other-500	we may go forth into the world and do battle with them and save beautiful ladies and have tales and gestes written about us as they are writ about the Seven Champions and Arthur his Round table Perhaps Myles who lay silently listening to all that was said
2185-150124-0058	train-other-500	was the only one who looked upon the scheme at all in the light of real utility but I think that even with him the fun of the matter outweighed the serious part of the business So it was that the Sacred Order of the Twenty Knights of the Rose came to be initiated
2185-150124-0059	train-other-500	They appointed a code of secret passwords and countersigns which were very difficult to remember and which were only used when they might excite the curiosity of the other and uninitiated boys by their mysterious sound
2185-150124-0060	train-other-500	They elected Myles as their Grand High Commander and held secret meetings in the ancient tower where many mysteries were soberly enacted Of course in a day or two all the body of squires knew nearly everything concerning the Knights of the Rose
2185-150124-0061	train-other-500	and of their secret meetings in the old tower The lucky twenty were the objects of envy of all not so fortunate as to be included in this number and there was a marked air of secrecy about everything they did that appealed to every romantic notion of the youngsters looking on
none	none	 What was the stormy outcome of it all is now presently to be told CHAPTER twelve Thus it was that Myles with an eye to open war with the bachelors gathered a following to his support It was some little while before matters were brought to a crisis a week or ten days Perhaps even Myles had no great desire to hasten matters He knew that whenever war was declared he himself would have to bear the brunt of the battle and even the bravest man hesitates before deliberately thrusting himself into a fight One morning Myles and Gascoyne and Wilkes sat under the shade of two trees between which was a board nailed to the trunks making a rude bench always a favorite lounging place for the lads in idle moments Myles was polishing his bascinet with lard and wood ashes rubbing the metal with a piece of leather and wiping it clean with a fustian rag The other two who had just been relieved from household duty lay at length idly looking on Just then one of the smaller pages a boy of twelve or thirteen by name Robin Ingoldsby crossed the court He had been crying his face was red and blubbered and his body was still shaken with convulsive sniffs Myles looked up Come hither Robin he called from where he sat What is to do The little fellow came slowly up to where the three rested in the shade Mowbray beat me with a strap said he rubbing his sleeve across his eyes and catching his breath at the recollection Beat thee didst say said Myles drawing his brows together Why did he beat thee Because said Robin I tarried overlong in fetching a pot of beer from the buttery for him and Wyatt Then with a boy s sudden and easy quickness in forgetting past troubles Tell me Falworth said he when wilt thou give me that knife thou promised me the one thou break the blade of yesterday I know not said Myles bluntly vexed that the boy did not take the disgrace of his beating more to heart Some time soon mayhap Me thinks thou shouldst think more of thy beating than of a broken knife Now get thee gone to thy business The youngster lingered for a moment or two watching Myles at his work What is that on the leather scrap Falworth said he curiously Lard and ashes said Myles testily Get thee gone I say or I will crack thy head for thee and he picked up a block of wood with a threatening gesture The youngster made a hideous grimace and then scurried away ducking his head lest in spite of Myles s well known good nature the block should come whizzing after him Hear ye that now cried Myles flinging down the block again and turning to his two friends Beaten with straps because forsooth he would not fetch and carry quickly enough to please the haste of these bachelors Oh this passeth patience and I for one will bear it no longer Nay Myles said Gascoyne soothingly the little imp is as lazy as a dormouse and as mischievous as a monkey I ll warrant the hiding was his due and that more of the like would do him good Why how dost thou talk Francis said Myles turning upon him indignantly Thou knowest that thou likest to see the boy beaten no more than I Then after a meditative pause How many think ye we muster of our company of the Rose today Wilkes looked doubtfully at Gascoyne There be only seventeen of us here now said he at last Brinton and Lambourne are away to Roby Castle in Lord George s train and will not be back till Saturday next And Watt Newton is in the infirmary Seventeen be saint enou said Myles grimly Let us get together this afternoon such as may in the Brutus Tower for I as I did say will no longer suffer these vile bachelors Gascoyne and Wilkes exchanged looks and then the former blew a long whistle So that afternoon a gloomy set of young faces were gathered together in the Eyry fifteen of the Knights of the Rose and all knew why they were assembled The talk which followed was conducted mostly by Myles He addressed the others with a straightforward vim and earnestness but the response was only half hearted and when at last having heated himself up with his own fire he sat down puffing out his red cheeks and glaring round a space of silence followed the lads looked doubtfully at one another Myles felt the chill of their silence strike coldly on his enthusiasm and it vexed him What wouldst thou do Falworth said one of the knights at last Wouldst have us open a quarrel with the bachelors Nay said Myles gruffly I had thought that ye would all lend me a hand in a pitched battle but now I see that ye ha no stomach for that Ne theless I tell ye plainly I will not submit longer to the bachelors So now I will ask ye not to take any venture upon yourselves but only this that ye will stand by me when I do my fighting and not let five or seven of them fall upon me at once There is Walter Blunt he is parlous strong said one of the others after a time of silence Methinks he could conquer any two of us Nay said Myles ye do fear him too greatly I tell ye I fear not to stand up to try battle with him and will do so too if the need arise Only say ye that ye will stand by my back Marry said Gascoyne quaintly an thou wilt dare take the heavy end upon thee I for one am willing to stand by and see that thou have thy fill of fighting I too will stand thee by Myles said Edmund Wilkes And I and I and I said others chiming in Those who would still have held back were carried along by the stream and so it was settled that if the need should arise for Myles to do a bit of fighting the others should stand by to see that he had fair play When thinkest thou that thou wilt take thy stand against them Myles asked Wilkes Myles hesitated a moment To morrow said he grimly Several of the lads whistled softly Gascoyne was prepared for an early opening of the war but perhaps not for such an early opening as this By r Lady Myles thou art hungry for brawling said he CHAPTER thirteen After the first excitement of meeting discussing and deciding had passed Myles began to feel the weight of the load he had so boldly taken upon himself He began to reckon what a serious thing it was for him to stand as a single champion against the tyranny that had grown so strong through years of custom Had he let himself do so he might almost have repented but it was too late now for repentance He had laid his hand to the plough and he must drive the furrow Somehow the news of impending battle had leaked out among the rest of the body of squires and a buzz of suppressed excitement hummed through the dormitory that evening The bachelors to whom no doubt vague rumors had been blown looked lowering and talked together in low voices standing apart in a group Some of them made a rather marked show of secreting knives in the straw of their beds and no doubt it had its effect upon more than one young heart that secretly thrilled at the sight of the shining blades However all was undisturbed that evening The lights were put out and the lads retired with more than usual quietness only for the murmur of whispering All night Myles s sleep was more or less disturbed by dreams in which he was now conquering now being conquered and before the day had fairly broken he was awake He lay upon his cot keying himself up for the encounter which he had set upon himself to face and it would not be the truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the straw the night before had made no impression upon him By and by he knew the others were beginning to awake for he heard them softly stirring and as the light grew broad and strong saw them arise one by one and begin dressing in the gray morning Then he himself arose and put on his doublet and hose strapping his belt tightly about his waist then he sat down on the side of his cot Presently that happened for which he was waiting two of the younger squires started to bring the bachelors morning supply of water As they crossed the room Myles called to them in a loud voice a little uneven perhaps Stop We draw no more water for any one in this house saving only for ourselves Set ye down those buckets and go back to your places The two lads stopped half turned and then stood still holding the three buckets undecidedly In a moment all was uproar and confusion for by this time every one of the lads had arisen some sitting on the edge of their beds some nearly others quite dressed A half dozen of the Knights of the Rose came over to where Myles stood gathering in a body behind him and the others followed one after another The bachelors were hardly prepared for such prompt and vigorous action What is to do cried one of them who stood near the two lads with the buckets Why fetch ye not the water Falworth says we shall not fetch it answered one of the lads a boy by the name of Gosse What mean ye by that Falworth the young man called to Myles Myles s heart was beating thickly and heavily within him but nevertheless he spoke up boldly enough I mean said he that from henceforth ye shall fetch and carry for yourselves Look ee Blunt called the bachelor here is Falworth says they squires will fetch no more water for us The head bachelor had heard all that had passed and was even then hastily slipping on his doublet and hose Now then Falworth said he at last striding forward what is to do Ye will fetch no more water eh By r Lady I will know the reason why He was still advancing towards Myles with two or three of the older bachelors at his heels when Gascoyne spoke Thou hadst best stand back Blunt said he else thou mayst be hurt We will not have ye bang Falworth again as ye once did so stand thou back Blunt stopped short and looked upon the lads standing behind Myles some of them with faces a trifle pale perhaps but all grim and determined looking enough Then he turned upon his heel suddenly and walked back to the far end of the dormitory where the bachelors were presently clustered together A few words passed between them and then the thirteen began at once arming themselves some with wooden clogs and some with the knives which they had so openly concealed the night before At the sign of imminent battle all those not actively interested scuttled away to right and left climbing up on the benches and cots and leaving a free field to the combatants The next moment would have brought bloodshed Now Myles thanks to the training of the Crosbey Dale smith felt tolerably sure that in a wrestling bout he was a match perhaps more than a match for any one of the body of squires and he had determined if possible to bring the battle to a single handed encounter upon that footing Accordingly he suddenly stepped forward before the others Look ee fellow he called to Blunt thou art he who struck me whilst I was down some while since Wilt thou let this quarrel stand between thee and me and meet me man to man without weapon See I throw me down mine own and will meet thee with bare hands And as he spoke he tossed the clog he held in his hand back upon the cot So be it said Blunt with great readiness tossing down a similar weapon which he himself held Do not go Myles cried Gascoyne he is a villain and a traitor and would betray thee to thy death I saw him when he first gat from bed hide a knife in his doublet Thou liest said Blunt I swear by my faith I be barehanded as ye see me Thy friend accuses me Myles Falworth because he knoweth thou art afraid of me There thou liest most vilely exclaimed Myles Swear that thou hast no knife and I will meet thee Hast thou not heard me say that I have no knife said Blunt What more wouldst thou have Then I will meet thee halfway said Myles Gascoyne caught him by the sleeve and would have withheld him assuring him that he had seen the bachelor conceal a knife But Myles hot for the fight broke away from his friend without listening to him As the two advanced steadily towards one another a breathless silence fell upon the dormitory in sharp contrast to the uproar and confusion that had filled it a moment before The lads standing some upon benches some upon beds all watched with breathless interest the meeting of the two champions As they approached one another they stopped and stood for a moment a little apart glaring the one upon the other They seemed ill enough matched Blunt was fully half a head taller than Myles and was thick set and close knit in young manhood Nothing but Myles s undaunted pluck could have led him to dare to face an enemy so much older and stouter than himself The pause was only for a moment They who looked saw Blunt slide his hand furtively towards his bosom Myles saw too and in the flash of an instant knew what the gesture meant and sprang upon the other before the hand could grasp what it sought As he clutched his enemy he felt what he had in that instant expected to feel the handle of a dagger The next moment he cried in a loud voice Oh thou villain Help Gascoyne He hath a knife under his doublet In answer to his cry for help Myles s friends started to his aid But the bachelors shouted Stand back and let them fight it out alone else we will knife ye too And as they spoke some of them leaped from the benches whereon they stood drawing their knives and flourishing them For just a few seconds Myles s friends stood cowed and in those few seconds the fight came to an end with a suddenness unexpected to all A struggle fierce and silent followed between the two Blunt striving to draw his knife and Myles with the energy of despair holding him tightly by the wrist It was in vain the elder lad writhed and twisted he was strong enough to overbear Myles but still was not able to clutch the haft of his knife Thou shalt not draw it gasped Myles at last Thou shalt not stab me Then again some of his friends started forward to his aid but they were not needed for before they came the fight was over Blunt finding that he was not able to draw the weapon suddenly ceased his endeavors and flung his arms around Myles trying to bear him down upon the ground and in that moment his battle was lost In an instant so quick so sudden so unexpected that no one could see how it happened his feet were whirled away from under him he spun with flying arms across Myles s loins and pitched with a thud upon the stone pavement where he lay still motionless while Myles his face white with passion and his eyes gleaming stood glaring around like a young wild boar beset by the dogs The next moment the silence was broken and the uproar broke forth with redoubled violence The bachelors leaping from the benches came hurrying forward on one side and Myles s friends from the other Thou shalt smart for this Falworth said one of the older lads Belike thou hast slain him Myles turned upon the speaker like a flash and with such a passion of fury in his face that the other a fellow nearly a head taller than he shrank back cowed in spite of himself Then Gascoyne came and laid his hand on his friend s shoulder Who touches me cried Myles hoarsely turning sharply upon him and then seeing who it was Oh Francis they would ha killed me Come away Myles said Gascoyne thou knowest not what thou doest thou art mad come away What if thou hadst killed him The words called Myles somewhat to himself I care not said he but sullenly and not passionately and then he suffered Gascoyne and Wilkes to lead him away Meantime Blunt s friends had turned him over and after feeling his temples his wrist and his heart bore him away to a bench at the far end of the room There they fell to chafing his hands and sprinkling water in his face a crowd of the others gathering about Blunt was hidden from Myles by those who stood around and the lad listened to the broken talk that filled the room with its confusion his anxiety growing keener as he became cooler But at last with a heartfelt joy he gathered from the confused buzz of words that the other lad had opened his eyes and after a while he saw him sit up leaning his head upon the shoulder of one of his fellow bachelors white and faint and sick as death Thank Heaven that thou didst not kill him said Edmund Wilkes who had been standing with the crowd looking on at the efforts of Blunt s friends to revive him and who had now come and sat down upon the bed not far from Myles Aye said Myles gruffly I do thank Heaven for that 
1649_150127_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER fourteen
1649_150127_000003_000000	train-clean-360	If Myles fancied that one single victory over his enemy would cure the evil against which he fought he was grievously mistaken wrongs are not righted so easily as that 
none	none	It was only the beginning 
1649_150127_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Other and far more bitter battles lay before him ere he could look around him and say I have won the victory 
1649_150127_000004_000000	train-clean-360	For a day for two days the bachelors were demoralized at the fall of their leader and the Knights of the Rose were proportionately uplifted 
1649_150127_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The day that Blunt met his fall the wooden tank in which the water had been poured every morning was found to have been taken away 
1649_150127_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The bachelors made a great show of indignation and inquiry 
none	none	Who was it stole their tank 
1649_150127_000005_000003	train-clean-360	If they did but know he should smart for it 
none	none	Ho ho roared Edmund Wilkes so that the whole dormitory heard him smoke ye not their tricks lads See ye not that they have stolen their own water tank so that they might have no need for another fight over the carrying of the water The bachelors made an obvious show of not having heard what he said and a general laugh went around 
1649_150127_000007_000001	train-clean-360	No one doubted that Wilkes had spoken the truth in his taunt and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their own tank 
1649_150127_000007_000002	train-clean-360	So no more water was ever carried for the head squires but it was plain to see that the war for the upperhand was not yet over 
1649_150127_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Even if Myles had entertained comforting thoughts to the contrary he was speedily undeceived 
none	none	One morning about a week after the fight as he and Gascoyne were crossing the armory court they were hailed by a group of the bachelors standing at the stone steps of the great building
1649_150127_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Holloa Falworth they cried 
1649_150127_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 Knowest thou that Blunt is nigh well again 
none	none	Nay said Myles I knew it not 
1649_150127_000010_000001	train-clean-360	But I am right glad to hear it 
1649_150127_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Thou wilt sing a different song anon said one of the bachelors 
none	none	I tell thee he is hot against thee and swears when he cometh again he will carve thee soothly Aye marry said another I would not be in thy skin a week hence for a ducat 
1649_150127_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Only this morning he told Philip Mowbray that he would have thy blood for the fall thou gavest him 
1649_150127_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Look to thyself Falworth he cometh again Wednesday or Thursday next thou standest in a parlous state 
none	none	Myles said Gascoyne as they entered the great quadrangle I do indeed fear me that he meaneth to do thee evil
1649_150127_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I know not said Myles boldly but I fear him not Nevertheless his heart was heavy with the weight of impending ill 
none	none	One evening the bachelors were more than usually noisy in their end of the dormitory laughing and talking and shouting to one another Holloa you sirrah Falworth called one of them along the length of the room
1649_150127_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Blunt cometh again to morrow day 
1649_150127_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Myles saw Gascoyne direct a sharp glance at him but he answered nothing either to his enemy s words or his friend s look 
1649_150127_000018_000000	train-clean-360	As the bachelor had said Blunt came the next morning 
none	none	It was just after chapel and the whole body of squires was gathered in the armory waiting for the orders of the day and the calling of the roll of those chosen for household duty 
1649_150127_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Myles was sitting on a bench along the wall talking and jesting with some who stood by when of a sudden his heart gave a great leap within him 
1649_150127_000019_000000	train-clean-360	It was Walter Blunt 
1649_150127_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He came walking in at the door as if nothing had passed and at his unexpected coming the hubbub of talk and laughter was suddenly checked 
1649_150127_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Even Myles stopped in his speech for a moment and then continued with a beating heart and a carelessness of manner that was altogether assumed 
1649_150127_000019_000003	train-clean-360	In his hand Blunt carried the house orders for the day and without seeming to notice Myles he opened it and read the list of those called upon for household service 
none	none	Myles had risen and was now standing listening with the others 
1649_150127_000020_000001	train-clean-360	When Blunt had ended reading the list of names he rolled up the parchment and thrust it into his belt then swinging suddenly on his heel he strode straight up to Myles facing him front to front 
1649_150127_000020_000002	train-clean-360	A moment or two of deep silence followed not a sound broke the stillness 
1649_150127_000020_000003	train-clean-360	When Blunt spoke every one in the armory heard his words 
none	none	Sirrah said he thou didst put foul shame upon me some time sin Never will I forget or forgive that offence and will have a reckoning with thee right soon that thou wilt not forget to the last day of thy life 
1649_150127_000022_000000	train-clean-360	When Myles had seen his enemy turn upon him he did not know at first what to expect he would not have been surprised had they come to blows there and then and he held himself prepared for any event 
1649_150127_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He faced the other pluckily enough and without flinching and spoke up boldly in answer 
1649_150127_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 So be it Walter Blunt I fear thee not in whatever way thou mayst encounter me 
1649_150127_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Dost thou not said Blunt 
none	none	By r Lady thou lieutenant have cause to fear me ere I am through with thee He smiled a baleful lingering smile and then turned slowly and walked away What thinkest thou Myles said Gascoyne as the two left the armory together
1649_150127_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I think naught said Myles gruffly 
1649_150127_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 He will not dare to touch me to harm me 
1649_150127_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I fear him not Nevertheless he did not speak the full feelings of his heart 
1649_150127_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I know not Myles said Gascoyne shaking his head doubtfully 
none	none	Walter Blunt is a parlous evil minded knave and methinks will do whatever evil he promiseth
1649_150127_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear him not said Myles again but his heart foreboded trouble 
none	none	The coming of the head squire made a very great change in the condition of affairs Even before that coming the bachelors had somewhat recovered from their demoralization and now again they began to pluck up their confidence and to order the younger squires and pages upon this personal service or upon that See ye not said Myles one day when the Knights of the Rose were gathered in the Brutus Tower see ye not that they grow as bad as ever An we put not a stop to this overmastery now it will never stop
1649_150127_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Best let it be Myles said Wilkes 
1649_150127_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 They will kill thee an thou cease not troubling them 
none	none	Thou hast bred mischief enow for thyself already
1649_150127_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 No matter for that said Myles it is not to be borne that they order others of us about as they do 
1649_150127_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I mean to speak to them to night and tell them it shall not be 
1649_150127_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He was as good as his word 
1649_150127_000032_000001	train-clean-360	That night as the youngsters were shouting and romping and skylarking as they always did before turning in he stood upon his cot and shouted Silence 
none	none	List to me a little And then in the hush that followed I want those bachelors to hear this that we squires serve them no longer and if they would ha some to wait upon them they must get them otherwheres than here There be twenty of us to stand against them and haply more and we mean that they shall ha service of us no more 
1649_150127_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Then he jumped down again from his elevated stand and an uproar of confusion instantly filled the place 
1649_150127_000033_000001	train-clean-360	What was the effect of his words upon the bachelors he could not see 
none	none	What was the result he was not slow in discovering The next day Myles and Gascoyne were throwing their daggers for a wager at a wooden target against the wall back of the armorer s smithy Wilkes Gosse and one or two others of the squires were sitting on a bench looking on and now and then applauding a more than usually well aimed cast of the knife 
1649_150127_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Suddenly that impish little page spoken of before Robin Ingoldsby thrust his shock head around the corner of the smithy and said Ho Falworth 
none	none	Blunt is going to serve thee out to day and I myself heard him say so He says he is going to slit thine ears And then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared Myles darted after him caught him midway in the quadrangle and brought him back by the scuff of the neck squalling and struggling
1649_150127_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 There said he still panting from the chase and seating the boy by no means gently upon the bench beside Wilkes 
none	none	Sit thou there thou imp of evil And now tell me what thou didst mean by thy words anon an thou stop not thine outcry I will cut thy throat for thee and he made a ferocious gesture with his dagger 
1649_150127_000037_000000	train-clean-360	It was by no means easy to worm the story from the mischievous little monkey he knew Myles too well to be in the least afraid of his threats But at last by dint of bribing and coaxing Myles and his friends managed to get at the facts 
1649_150127_000037_000001	train-clean-360	The youngster had been sent to clean the riding boots of one of the bachelors instead of which he had lolled idly on a cot in the dormitory until he had at last fallen asleep 
1649_150127_000037_000002	train-clean-360	He had been awakened by the opening of the dormitory door and by the sound of voices among them was that of his taskmaster 
1649_150127_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Fearing punishment for his neglected duty he had slipped out of the cot and hidden himself beneath it 
none	none	Those who had entered were Walter Blunt and three of the older bachelors 
1649_150127_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Blunt s companions were trying to persuade him against something but without avail 
none	none	It was Myles s heart thrilled and his blood boiled to lie in wait for him to overpower him by numbers and to mutilate him by slitting his ears a disgraceful punishment administered as a rule only for thieving and poaching He would not dare to do such a thing cried Myles with heaving breast and flashing eyes Aye but he would said Gascoyne His father Lord Reginald Blunt is a great man over Nottingham way and my Lord would not dare to punish him even for such a matter as that 
1649_150127_000040_000002	train-clean-360	But tell me Robin Ingoldsby dost know aught more of this matter 
1649_150127_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Prithee tell it me Robin 
1649_150127_000040_000004	train-clean-360	Where do they propose to lie in wait for Falworth 
none	none	In the gate way of the Buttery Court so as to catch him when he passes by to the armory answered the boy
1649_150127_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Are they there now said Wilkes 
none	none	Aye nine of them said Robin I heard Blunt tell Mowbray to go and gather the others He heard thee tell Gosse Falworth that thou wert going thither for thy arbalist this morn to shoot at the rooks withal That will do Robin said Myles Thou mayst go And therewith the little imp scurried off pulling the lobes of his ears suggestively as he darted around the corner The others looked at one another for a while in silence
1649_150127_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 So comrades said Myles at last what shall we do now 
none	none	Go and tell Sir James said Gascoyne promptly
1649_150127_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Nay said Myles I take no such coward s part as that 
1649_150127_000049_000001	train-clean-360	I say an they hunger to fight give them their stomachful 
1649_150127_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The others were very reluctant for such extreme measures but Myles as usual carried his way and so a pitched battle was decided upon 
none	none	It was Gascoyne who suggested the plan which they afterwards followed 
1649_150127_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Then Wilkes started away to gather together those of the Knights of the Rose not upon household duty and Myles with the others went to the armor smith to have him make for them a set of knives with which to meet their enemies knives with blades a foot long pointed and double edged 
1649_150127_000052_000000	train-clean-360	The smith leaning with his hammer upon the anvil listened to them as they described the weapons 
none	none	Nay nay Master Myles said he when Myles had ended by telling the use to which he intended putting them Thou art going all wrong in this matter 
1649_150127_000053_000002	train-clean-360	With such blades ere this battle is ended some one would be slain and so murder done 
none	none	Then the family of him who was killed would haply have ye cited and mayhap it might e en come to the hanging for some of they boys ha great folkeys behind them Go ye to Tom Fletcher Master Myles and buy of him good yew staves such as one might break a head withal and with them gin ye keep your wits ye may hold your own against knives or short swords I tell thee e en though my trade be making of blades rather would I ha a good stout cudgel in my hand than the best dagger that ever was forged Myles stood thoughtfully for a moment or two then looking up Methinks thou speaketh truly Robin said he and it were ill done to have blood upon our hands CHAPTER fifteen From the long narrow stone paved Armory Court and connecting it with the inner Buttery Court ran a narrow arched passage way in which was a picket gate closed at night and locked from within It was in this arched passage way that according to little Robert Ingoldsby s report the bachelors were lying in wait for Myles Gascoyne s plan was that Myles should enter the court alone the Knights of the Rose lying ambushed behind the angle of the armory building until the bachelors should show themselves It was not without trepidation that Myles walked alone into the court which happened then to be silent and empty His heart beat more quickly than it was wont and he gripped his cudgel behind his back looking sharply this way and that so as not to be taken unawares by a flank movement of his enemies Midway in the court he stopped and hesitated for a moment then he turned as though to enter the armory The next moment he saw the bachelors come pouring out from the archway Instantly he turned and rushed back towards where his friends lay hidden shouting To the rescue To the rescue Stone him roared Blunt The villain escapes He stopped and picked up a cobble stone as he spoke flinging it after his escaping prey It narrowly missed Myles s head had it struck him there might have been no more of this story to tell To the rescue To the rescue shouted Myles s friends in answer and the next moment he was surrounded by them Then he turned and swinging his cudgel rushed back upon his foes The bachelors stopped short at the unexpected sight of the lads with their cudgels For a moment they rallied and drew their knives then they turned and fled towards their former place of hiding One of them turned for a moment and flung his knife at Myles with a deadly aim but Myles quick as a cat ducked his body and the weapon flew clattering across the stony court Then he who had flung it turned again to fly but in his attempt he had delayed one instant too long Myles reached him with a long arm stroke of his cudgel just as he entered the passage way knocking him over like a bottle stunned and senseless The next moment the picket gate was banged in their faces and the bolt shot in the staples and the Knights of the Rose were left shouting and battering with their cudgels against the palings By this time the uproar of fight had aroused those in the rooms and offices fronting upon the Armory Court heads were thrust from many of the windows with the eager interest that a fight always evokes Beware shouted Myles Here they come again He bore back towards the entrance of the alley way as he spoke those behind him scattering to right and left for the bachelors had rallied and were coming again to the attack shouting They were not a moment too soon in this retreat either for the next instant the pickets flew open and a volley of stones flew after the retreating Knights of the Rose One smote Wilkes upon the head knocking him down headlong Another struck Myles upon his left shoulder benumbing his arm from the finger tips to the armpit so that he thought at first the limb was broken Get ye behind the buttresses shouted those who looked down upon the fight from the windows get ye behind the buttresses And in answer the lads scattering like a newly flushed covey of partridges fled to and crouched in the sheltering angles of masonry to escape from the flying stones And now followed a lull in the battle the bachelors fearing to leave the protection of the arched passage way lest their retreat should be cut off and the Knights of the Rose not daring to quit the shelter of the buttresses and angles of the wall lest they should be knocked down by the stones The bachelor whom Myles had struck down with his cudgel was sitting up rubbing the back of his head and Wilkes had gathered his wits enough to crawl to the shelter of the nearest buttress Myles peeping around the corner behind which he stood could see that the bachelors were gathered into a little group consulting together Suddenly it broke asunder and Blunt turned around Ho Falworth he cried Wilt thou hold truce whiles we parley with ye Aye answered Myles Wilt thou give me thine honor that ye will hold your hands from harming us whiles we talk together Yea said Myles I will pledge thee mine honor I accept thy pledge See here we throw aside our stones and lay down our knives Lay ye by your clubs and meet us in parley at the horse block yonder So be it said Myles and thereupon standing his cudgel in the angle of the wall he stepped boldly out into the open court yard Those of his party came scatteringly from right and left gathering about him and the bachelors advanced in a body led by the head squire Now what is it thou wouldst have Walter Blunt said Myles when both parties had met at the horse block It is to say this to thee Myles Falworth said the other One time not long sin thou didst challenge me to meet thee hand to hand in the dormitory Then thou didst put a vile affront upon me for the which I ha brought on this battle to day for I knew not then that thou wert going to try thy peasant tricks of wrestling and so without guarding myself I met thee as thou didst desire But thou hadst thy knife and would have stabbed him couldst thou ha done so said Gascoyne Thou liest said Blunt I had no knife And then without giving time to answer Thou canst not deny that I met thee then at thy bidding canst thou Falworth Nay said Myles nor haply canst thou deny it either And at this covert reminder of his defeat Myles s followers laughed scoffingly and Blunt bit his lip Thou hast said it said he Then sin I met thee at thy bidding I dare to thee to meet me now at mine and to fight this battle out between our two selves with sword and buckler and bascinet as gentles should and not in a wrestling match like two country hodges Thou art a coward caitiff Walter Blunt burst out Wilkes who stood by with a swelling lump upon his head already as big as a walnut Well thou knowest that Falworth is no match for thee at broadsword play Is he not four years younger than thou and hast thou not had three times the practice in arms that he hath had I say thou art a coward to seek to fight with cutting weapons Blunt made no answer to Wilkes s speech but gazed steadfastly at Myles with a scornful smile curling the corners of his lips Myles stood looking upon the ground without once lifting his eyes not knowing what to answer for he was well aware that he was no match for Blunt with the broadsword Thou art afraid to fight me Myles Falworth said Blunt tauntingly and the bachelors gave a jeering laugh in echo Then Myles looked up and I cannot say that his face was not a trifle whiter than usual Nay said he I am not afraid and I will fight thee Blunt So be it said Blunt Then let us go at it straightway in the armory yonder for they be at dinner in the Great Hall and just now there be saint no one by to stay us Thou shalt not fight him Myles burst out Gascoyne He will murther thee Thou shalt not fight him I say Myles turned away without answering him What is to do called one of those who were still looking out of the windows as the crowd of boys passed beneath Blunt and Falworth are going to fight it out hand to hand in the armory answered one of the bachelors looking up The brawling of the squires was a jest to all the adjoining part of the house So the heads were withdrawn again some laughing at the sparring of the cockerels But it was no jesting matter to poor Myles CHAPTER sixteen I have no intention to describe the fight between Myles Falworth and Walter Blunt Fisticuffs of nowadays are brutal and debasing enough but a fight with a sharp edged broadsword was not only brutal and debasing but cruel and bloody as well From the very first of the fight Myles Falworth was palpably and obviously overmatched After fifteen minutes had passed Blunt stood hale and sound as at first but poor Myles had more than one red stain of warm blood upon doublet and hose and more than one bandage had been wrapped by Gascoyne and Wilkes about sore wounds He had received no serious injury as yet for not only was his body protected by a buckler or small oblong shield which he carried upon his left arm and his head by a bascinet or light helmet of steel but perhaps after all Blunt was not over anxious to do him any dangerous harm Nevertheless there could be but one opinion as to how the fight tended and Myles s friends were gloomy and downcast the bachelors proportionately exultant shouting with laughter and taunting Myles at every unsuccessful stroke Once as he drew back panting leaning upon Gascoyne s shoulder the faithful friend whispered with trembling lips Oh dear Myles carry it no further Thou hurtest him not and he will slay thee ere he have done with thee Thereupon Blunt who caught the drift of the speech put in a word Thou art sore hurt Myles Falworth said he and I would do thee no grievous harm Yield thee and own thyself beaten and I will forgive thee Thou hast fought a good fight and there is no shame in yielding now Never cried Myles hoarsely never will I yield me Thou mayst slay me Walter Blunt and I reck not if thou dost do so but never else wilt thou conquer me There was a tone of desperation in his voice that made all look serious Nay said Blunt I will fight thee no more Myles Falworth thou hast had enough By heavens cried Myles grinding his teeth thou shalt fight me thou coward Thou hast brought this fight upon us and either thou or I get our quittance here Let go Gascoyne he cried shaking loose his friend s hold I tell thee he shall fight me From that moment Blunt began to lose his head No doubt he had not thought of such a serious fight as this when he had given his challenge and there was a savage bull dog tenacity about Myles that could not but have had a somewhat demoralizing effect upon him A few blows were given and taken and then Myles s friends gave a shout Blunt drew back and placed his hand to his shoulder When he drew it away again it was stained with red and another red stain grew and spread rapidly down the sleeve of his jacket He stared at his hand for a moment with a half dazed look and then glanced quickly to right and left I will fight no more said he sullenly Then yield thee cried Myles exultantly The triumphant shouts of the Knights of the Rose stung Blunt like a lash and the battle began again Perhaps some of the older lads were of a mind to interfere at this point certainly some looked very serious but before they interposed the fight was ended Blunt grinding his teeth struck one undercut at his opponent the same undercut that Myles had that time struck at Sir James Lee at the knight s bidding when he first practised at the Devlen pels Myles met the blow as Sir James had met the blow that he had given and then struck in return as Sir James had struck full and true The bascinet that Blunt wore glanced the blow partly but not entirely Myles felt his sword bite through the light steel cap and Blunt dropped his own blade clattering upon the floor It was all over in an instant but in that instant what he saw was stamped upon Myles s mind with an indelible imprint He saw the young man stagger backward he saw the eyes roll upward and a red streak shoot out from under the cap and run down across the cheek Blunt reeled half around and then fell prostrate upon his face and Myles stood staring at him with the delirious turmoil of his battle dissolving rapidly into a dumb fear at that which he had done Once again he had won the victory but what a victory Is he dead he whispered to Gascoyne I know not said Gascoyne with a very pale face But come away Myles And he led his friend out of the room Some little while later one of the bachelors came to the dormitory where Myles his wounds smarting and aching and throbbing lay stretched upon his cot and with a very serious face bade him to go presently to Sir James who had just come from dinner and was then in his office By this time Myles knew that he had not slain his enemy and his heart was light in spite of the coming interview There was no one in the office but Sir James and himself and Myles without concealing anything told point by point the whole trouble Sir James sat looking steadily at him for a while after he had ended Never said he presently did I know any one of ye squires in all the time that I have been here get himself into so many broils as thou Myles Falworth Belike thou sought to take this lad s life Nay said Myles earnestly God forbid Ne theless said Sir James thou fetched him a main shrewd blow and it is by good hap and no fault of thine that he will live to do more mischief yet This is thy second venture at him the third time haply thou wilt end him for good Then suddenly assuming his grimmest and sternest manner Now sirrah do I put a stop to this and no more shall ye fight with edged tools Get thee to the dormitory and abide there a full week without coming forth Michael shall bring thee bread and water twice a day for that time That is all the food thou shalt have and we will see if that fare will not cool thy hot humors withal Myles had expected a punishment so much more severe than that which was thus meted to him that in the sudden relief he broke into a convulsive laugh and then with a hasty sweep wiped a brimming moisture from his eyes Sir James looked keenly at him for a moment Thou art white i the face said he Art thou wounded very sorely Nay said Myles it is not much but I be sick in my stomach Aye aye said Sir James I know that feeling well It is thus that one always feeleth in coming out from a sore battle when one hath suffered wounds and lost blood An thou wouldst keep thyself hale keep thyself from needless fighting Now go thou to the dormitory and as I said come thou not forth again for a week Stay sirrah he added I will send Georgebarber to thee to look to thy sores Green wounds are best drawn and salved ere they grow cold I wonder what Myles would have thought had he known that so soon as he had left the office Sir James had gone straight to the Earl and recounted the whole matter to him with a deal of dry gusto and that the Earl listened laughing Aye said he when Sir James had done the boy hath mettle sure Nevertheless we must transplant this fellow Blunt to the office of gentleman in waiting He must be old enough now and gin he stayeth in his present place either he will do the boy a harm or the boy will do him a harm So Blunt never came again to trouble the squires quarters and thereafter the youngsters rendered no more service to the elders Myles s first great fight in life was won CHAPTER seventeen The summer passed away and the bleak fall came Myles had long since accepted his position as one set apart from the others of his kind and had resigned himself to the evident fact that he was never to serve in the household in waiting upon the Earl I cannot say that it never troubled him but in time there came a compensation of which I shall have presently to speak And then he had so much the more time to himself The other lads were sometimes occupied by their household duties when sports were afoot in which they would liked to have taken part Myles was always free to enter into any matter of the kind after his daily exercise had been performed at the pels the butts or the tilting court But even though he was never called to do service in my Lord s house he was not long in gaining a sort of second hand knowledge of all the family My Lady a thin sallow faded dame not yet past middle age but looking ten years older The Lady Anne the daughter of the house a tall thin dark eyed dark haired handsome young dame of twenty or twenty one years of age hawk nosed like her father and silent proud and haughty Myles heard the squires say Lady Alice the Earl of Mackworth s niece and ward a great heiress in her own right a strikingly pretty black eyed girl of fourteen or fifteen These composed the Earl s personal family but besides them was Lord George Beaumont his Earl s brother and him Myles soon came to know better than any of the chief people of the castle excepting Sir James Lee For since Myles s great battle in the armory Lord George had taken a laughing sort of liking to the lad encouraging him at times to talk of his adventures and of his hopes and aspirations Perhaps the Earl s younger brother who was himself somewhat a soldier of fortune having fought in Spain France and Germany felt a certain kinship in spirit with the adventurous youngster who had his unfriended way to make in the world However that might have been Lord George was very kind and friendly to the lad and the willing service that Myles rendered him reconciled him not a little to the Earl s obvious neglect Besides these of the more immediate family of the Earl were a number of knights ladies and gentlemen some of them cadets some of them retainers of the house of Beaumont for the princely nobles of those days lived in state little less royal than royalty itself Most of the knights and gentlemen Myles soon came to know by sight meeting them in Lord George s apartments in the south wing of the great house and some of them following the lead of Lord George singled him out for friendly notice giving him a nod or a word in passing Every season has its pleasures for boys and the constant change that they bring is one of the greatest delights of boyhood s days All of us as we grow older have in our memory pictures of by gone times that are somehow more than usually vivid the colors of some not blurring by time as others do One of which in remembering always filled Myles s heart in after years with an indefinable pleasure was the recollection of standing with others of his fellow squires in the crisp brown autumn grass of the paddock and shooting with the long bow at wildfowl which when the east wind was straining flew low overhead to pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyond the brow of the hill More than once a brace or two of these wildfowl shot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat good natured Mother Joan graced the rude mess table of the squires in the long hall and even the toughest and fishiest drake so the fruit of their skill had a savor that somehow or other the daintiest fare lacked in after years Then fall passed and winter came bleak cold and dreary not winter as we know it nowadays with warm fires and bright lights to make the long nights sweet and cheerful with comfort but winter with all its grimness and sternness In the great cold stone walled castles of those days the only fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazing logs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace around which the folks gathered sheltering their faces as best they could from the scorching heat and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold for at the farther end of the room where giant shadows swayed and bowed and danced huge and black against the high walls the white frost glistened in the moonlight on the stone pavements and the breath went up like smoke In those days were no books to read but at the best only rude stories and jests recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listening circle gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse gross jests and coarser grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter Yet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days and cold and biting as was the frost in the cheerless windy halls and corridors of the castle it was not without its joys to the young lads for then as now boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather when the sodden snow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of Thrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over and the lads making themselves skates of marrow bones which they bought from the hall cook at a groat a pair went skimming over the smooth surface red checked and shouting while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them from the top of the bleak gray walls Then at Yule tide which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the Merry Christmas season of our day a great feast was held in the hall and all the castle folk were fed in the presence of the Earl and the Countess Oxen and sheep were roasted whole huge suet puddings made of barley meal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums were boiled in great caldrons in the open courtyard whole barrels of ale and malmsey were broached and all the folk gentle and simple were bidden to the feast Afterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play and in the evening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the north hall For a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the good things left from that great feast until everyone grew to loathe fine victuals and longed for honest beef and mustard again Then at last in that constant change the winter was gone and even the lads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm once more and the grass showed green in sunny places and the leader of the wild fowl blew his horn as they who in the fall had flown to the south flew arrow like northward again when the buds swelled and the leaves burst forth once more and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in the green grass like sparks and flames of gold With the spring came the out door sports of the season among others that of ball for boys were boys and played at ball even in those faraway days a game called trap ball Even yet in some parts of England it is played just as it was in Myles Falworth s day and enjoyed just as Myles and his friends enjoyed it So now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game of trap ball was in full swing every afternoon the play ground being an open space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and that of the privy garden the pleasance in which the ladies of the Earl s family took the air every day and upon which their apartments opened Now one fine breezy afternoon when the lads were shouting and playing at this then their favorite game Myles himself was at the trap barehanded and barearmed The wind was blowing from behind him and aided perhaps by it he had already struck three of four balls nearly the whole length of the court an unusual distance and several of the lads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden to catch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that Then once more Myles struck throwing all his strength into the blow The ball shot up into the air and when it fell it was to drop within the privy garden The shouts of the young players were instantly stilled and Gascoyne who stood nearest Myles thrust his hands into his belt giving a long shrill whistle This time thou hast struck us all out Myles said he There be no more play for us until we get another ball The outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in a little circle around Myles I could not help it said Myles in answer to their grumbling How knew I the ball would fly so far But if I ha lost the ball I can get it again I will climb the wall for it Thou shalt do naught of the kind Myles said Gascoyne hastily Thou art as mad as a March hare to think of such a venture Wouldst get thyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs like poor Diccon Cook Of all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the most sacred It was a small plot of ground only a few rods long and wide and was kept absolutely private for the use of the Countess and her family Only a little while before Myles had first come to Devlen one of the cook s men had been found climbing the wall whereupon the soldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow The poor fellow dropped from the wall into the garden and when they found him he still held a bunch of flowers in his hand which he had perhaps been gathering for his sweetheart Had Myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as Gascoyne and some of the others had done he might have thought twice before venturing to enter the ladies private garden As it was he only shook his stubborn head and said again I will climb the wall and fetch it Now at the lower extremity of the court and about twelve or fifteen feet distant from the garden wall there grew a pear tree some of the branches of which overhung into the garden beyond So first making sure that no one was looking that way and bidding the others keep a sharp lookout Myles shinned up this tree and choosing one of the thicker limbs climbed out upon it for some little distance Then lowering his body he hung at arm s length the branch bending with his weight and slowly let himself down hand under hand until at last he hung directly over the top of the wall and perhaps a foot above it Below him he could see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth of clematis and even as he hung there he noticed the broad smooth walks the grassy terrace in front of the Countess s apartments in the distance the quaint flower beds the yew trees trimmed into odd shapes and even the deaf old gardener working bare armed in the sunlight at a flower bed in the far corner by the tool house The top of the wall was pointed like a house roof and immediately below him was covered by a thick growth of green moss and it flashed through his mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slippery foothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top But it was too late to draw back now Bracing himself for a moment he loosed his hold upon the limb above The branch flew back with a rush and he dropped striving to grasp the sloping angle with his feet Instantly the treacherous slippery moss slid away from beneath him he made a vain clutch at the wall his fingers sliding over the cold stones then with a sharp exclamation down he pitched bodily into the garden beneath A thousand thoughts flew through his brain like a cloud of flies and then a leafy greenness seemed to strike up against him A splintering crash sounded in his ears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him and with one final clutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath He heard a shrill scream that seemed to find an instant echo even as he fell he had a vision of faces and bright colors and when he sat up dazed and bewildered he found himself face to face with the Lady Anne the daughter of the house and her cousin the Lady Alice who clutching one another tightly stood staring at him with wide scared eyes CHAPTER eighteen For a little time there was a pause of deep silence during which the fluttering leaves came drifting down from the broken arbor above It was the Lady Anne who first spoke Who art thou and whence comest thou said she tremulously Then Myles gathered himself up sheepishly My name is Myles Falworth said he and I am one of the squires of the body Oh aye said the Lady Alice suddenly Me thought I knew thy face Art thou not the young man that I have seen in Lord George s train Yes lady said Myles wrapping and twining a piece of the broken vine in and out among his fingers Lord George hath often had me of late about his person And what dost thou do here sirrah said Lady Anne angrily How darest thou come so into our garden I meant not to come as I did said Myles clumsily and with a face hot and red But I slipped over the top of the wall and fell hastily into the garden Truly lady I meant ye no harm or fright thereby He looked so drolly abashed as he stood before them with his clothes torn and soiled from the fall his face red and his eyes downcast all the while industriously twisting the piece of clematis in and around his fingers that Lady Anne s half frightened anger could not last She and her cousin exchanged glances and smiled at one another But said she at last trying to draw her pretty brows together into a frown tell me why didst thou seek to climb the wall I came to seek a ball said Myles which I struck over hither from the court beyond And wouldst thou come into our privy garden for no better reason than to find a ball said the young lady Nay said Myles it was not so much to find the ball but in good sooth I did truly strike it harder than need be and so gin I lost the ball I could do no less than come and find it again else our sport is done for the day So it was I came hither The two young ladies had by now recovered from their fright The Lady Anne slyly nudged her cousin with her elbow and the younger could not suppress a half nervous laugh Myles heard it and felt his face grow hotter and redder than ever Nay said Lady Anne I do believe Master Giles My name be saint Myles corrected Myles Very well then Master Myles I say I do believe that thou meanest no harm in coming hither ne theless it was ill of thee so to do An my father should find thee here he would have thee shrewdly punished for such trespassing Dost thou not know that no one is permitted to enter this place no not even my uncle George One fellow who came hither to steal apples once had his ears shaven close to his head and not more than a year ago one of the cook s men who climbed the wall early one morning was shot by the watchman Aye said Myles I knew of him who was shot and it did go somewhat against my stomach to venture knowing what had happed to him Ne theless an I gat not the ball how were we to play more to day at the trap Marry thou art a bold fellow I do believe me said the young lady and sin thou hast come in the face of such peril to get thy ball thou shalt not go away empty Whither didst thou strike it Over yonder by the cherry tree said Myles jerking his head in that direction An I may go get it I will trouble ye no more As he spoke he made a motion to leave them Stay said the Lady Anne hastily remain where thou art An thou cross the open some one may haply see thee from the house and will give the alarm and thou wilt be lost I will go get thy ball And so she left Myles and her cousin crossing the little plots of grass and skirting the rosebushes to the cherry tree When Myles found himself alone with Lady Alice he knew not where to look or what to do but twisted the piece of clematis which he still held in and out more industriously than ever Lady Alice watched him with dancing eyes for a little while Haply thou wilt spoil that poor vine said she by and by breaking the silence and laughing then turning suddenly serious again Didst thou hurt thyself by thy fall Nay said Myles looking up such a fall as that was no great matter Many and many a time I have had worse Hast thou so said the Lady Alice Thou didst fright me parlously and my coz likewise Myles hesitated for a moment and then blurted out Thereat I grieve for thee I would not fright for all the world The young lady laughed and blushed All the world is a great matter said she Yea said he it is a great matter but it is a greater matter to fright thee and so I would not do it for that and more The young lady laughed again but she did not say anything further and a space of silence fell so long that by and by she forced herself to say My cousin findeth not the ball presently Nay said Myles briefly and then again neither spoke until by and by the Lady Anne came bringing the ball Myles felt a great sense of relief at that coming and yet was somehow sorry Then he took the ball and knew enough to bow his acknowledgment in a manner neither ill nor awkward Didst thou hurt thyself asked Lady Anne Nay said Myles giving himself a shake seest thou not I be whole limb and bone Nay I have had shrewdly worse falls than that Once I fell out of an oak tree down by the river and upon a root and bethought me I did break a rib or more And then one time when I was a boy in Crosbey Dale that was where I lived before I came hither I did catch me hold of the blade of the windmill thinking it was moving slowly and that I would have a ride i th air and so was like to have had a fall ten thousand times worse than this Oh tell us more of that said the Lady Anne eagerly I did never hear of such an adventure as that Come coz and sit down here upon the bench and let us have him tell us all of that happening Now the lads upon the other side of the wall had been whistling furtively for some time not knowing whether Myles had broken his neck or had come off scot free from his fall I would like right well to stay with ye said he irresolutely and would gladly tell ye that and more an ye would have me to do so but hear ye not my friends call me from beyond Mayhap they think I break my back and are calling to see whether I be alive or no An I might whistle them answer and toss me this ball to them all would then be well and they would know that I was not hurt and so haply would go away Then answer them said the Lady Anne and tell us of that thing thou spokest of anon how thou tookest a ride upon the windmill We young ladies do hear little of such matters not being allowed to talk with lads All that we hear of perils are of knights and ladies and jousting and such like It would pleasure us right well to have thee tell of thy adventures So Myles tossed back the ball and whistled in answer to his friends Then he told the two young ladies not only of his adventure upon the windmill but also of other boyish escapades and told them well with a straightforward smack and vigor for he enjoyed adventure and loved to talk of it In a little while he had regained his ease his shyness and awkwardness left him and nothing remained but the delightful fact that he was really and actually talking to two young ladies and that with just as much ease and infinitely more pleasure than could be had in discourse with his fellow squires But at last it was time for him to go Marry said he with a half sigh methinks I did never ha so sweet and pleasant a time in all my life before Never did I know a real lady to talk with saving only my mother and I do tell ye plain methinks I would rather talk with ye than with any he in Christendom saving perhaps only my friend Gascoyne I would I might come hither again The honest frankness of his speech was irresistible the two girls exchanged glances and then began laughing Truly said Lady Anne who as was said before was some three or four years older than Myles thou art a bold lad to ask such a thing How wouldst thou come hither Wouldst tumble through our clematis arbor again as thou didst this day Nay said Myles I would not do that again but if ye will bid me do so I will find the means to come hither Nay said Lady Anne I dare not bid thee do such a foolhardy thing Nevertheless if thou hast the courage to come Yea said Myles eagerly I have the courage Then if thou hast so we will be here in the garden on Saturday next at this hour I would like right well to hear more of thy adventures But what didst thou say was thy name I have forgot it again It is Myles Falworth Then we shall yclep thee Sir Myles for thou art a soothly errant knight And stay Every knight must have a lady to serve How wouldst thou like my Cousin Alice here for thy true lady Aye said Myles eagerly I would like it right well And then he blushed fiery red at his boldness I want no errant knight to serve me said the Lady Alice blushing in answer Thou dost ill tease me coz An thou art so free in choosing him a lady to serve thou mayst choose him thyself for thy pains Nay said the Lady Anne laughing I say thou shalt be his true lady and he shall be thy true knight Who knows Perchance he may serven thee in some wondrous adventure like as Chaucer telleth of But now Sir Errant Knight thou must take thy leave of us and I must e en let thee privily out by the postern wicket And if thou wilt take the risk upon thee and come hither again prithee be wary in that coming lest in venturing thou have thine ears clipped in most unknightly fashion That evening as he and Gascoyne sat together on a bench under the trees in the great quadrangle Myles told of his adventure of the afternoon and his friend listened with breathless interest But Myles cried Gascoyne did the Lady Anne never once seem proud and unkind Nay said Myles only at first when she chid me for falling through the roof of their arbor And to think Francis Lady Anne herself bade me hold the Lady Alice as my true lady and to serve her in all knightliness Then he told his friend that he was going to the privy garden again on the next Saturday and that the Lady Anne had given him permission so to do Gascoyne gave a long wondering whistle and then sat quite still staring into the sky By and by he turned to his friend and said I give thee my pledge Myles Falworth that never in all my life did I hear of any one that had such marvellous strange happenings befall him as thou Whenever the opportunity occurred for sending a letter to Crosbey Holt Myles wrote one to his mother and one can guess how they were treasured by the good lady and read over and over again to the blind old Lord as he sat staring into darkness with his sightless eyes About the time of this escapade he wrote a letter telling of those doings wherein after speaking of his misadventure of falling from the wall and of his acquaintance with the young ladies he went on to speak of the matter in which he repeated his visits The letter was worded in the English of that day the quaint and crabbed language in which Chaucer wrote Perhaps few boys could read it nowadays so modernizing it somewhat it ran thus And now to let ye weet that thing that followed that happening that made me acquaint with they two young Damoiselles I take me to the south wall of that garden one day four and twenty great spikes which Peter Smith did forge for me and for which I pay him fivepence and that all the money that I had left of my half year s wage and wot not where I may get more at these present withouten I do betake me to Sir James who as I did tell ye hath consented to hold those moneys that Prior Edward gave me till I need them Now these same spikes I say I take me them down behind the corner of the wall and there drave them betwixt the stones my very dear comrade and true friend Gascoyne holping me thereto to do And so come Saturday I climb me over the wall and to the roof of the tool house below seeking a fitting opportunity when I might so do without being in too great jeopardy Yea and who should be there but they two ladies biding my coming who seeing me made as though they had expected me not and gave me greatest rebuke for adventuring so moughtily Yet methinks were they right well pleasured that I should so aventure which indeed I might not otherwise do seeing as I have telled to thee that one of them is mine own true lady for to serven and so was the only way that I might come to speech with her Such was Myles s own quaint way of telling how he accomplished his aim of visiting the forbidden garden and no doubt the smack of adventure and the savor of danger in the undertaking recommended him not a little to the favor of the young ladies After this first acquaintance perhaps a month passed during which Myles had climbed the wall some half a dozen times for the Lady Anne would not permit of too frequent visits and during which the first acquaintance of the three ripened rapidly to an honest pleasant friendship More than once Myles when in Lord George s train caught a covert smile or half nod from one or both of the girls not a little delightful in its very secret friendliness CHAPTER nineteen As was said perhaps a month passed then Myles s visits came to an abrupt termination and with it ended in a certain sense a chapter of his life One Saturday afternoon he climbed the garden wall and skirting behind a long row of rosebushes that screened him from the Countess s terrace came to a little summer house where the two young ladies had appointed to meet him that day A pleasant half hour or so was passed and then it was time for Myles to go He lingered for a while before he took his final leave leaning against the door post and laughingly telling how he and some of his brother squires had made a figure of straw dressed in men s clothes and had played a trick with it one night upon a watchman against whom they bore a grudge The young ladies were listening with laughing faces when suddenly as Myles looked he saw the smile vanish from Lady Alice s eyes and a wide terror take its place She gave a half articulate cry and rose abruptly from the bench upon which she was sitting Myles turned sharply and then his very heart seemed to stand still within him for there standing in the broad sunlight without and glaring in upon the party with baleful eyes was the Earl of Mackworth himself How long was the breathless silence that followed Myles could never tell He knew that the Lady Anne had also risen and that she and her cousin were standing as still as statues Presently the Earl pointed to the house with his staff and Myles noted stupidly how it trembled in his hand Ye wenches said he at last in a hard harsh voice ye wenches what meaneth this Would ye deceive me so and hold parlance thus secretly with this fellow I will settle with him anon Meantime get ye straightway to the house and to your rooms and there abide until I give ye leave to come forth again Go I say Father said Lady Anne in a breathless voice she was as white as death and moistened her lips with her tongue before she spoke father thou wilt not do harm to this young man Spare him I do beseech thee for truly it was I who bade him come hither I know that he would not have come but at our bidding The Earl stamped his foot upon the gravel Did ye not hear me said he still pointing towards the house with his trembling staff I bade ye go to your rooms I will settle with this fellow I say as I deem fitting Father began Lady Anne again but the Earl made such a savage gesture that poor Lady Alice uttered a faint shriek and Lady Anne stopped abruptly trembling Then she turned and passed out the farther door of the summerhouse poor little Lady Alice following holding her tight by the skirts and trembling and shuddering as though with a fit of the ague The Earl stood looking grimly after them from under his shaggy eyebrows until they passed away behind the yew trees appeared again upon the terrace behind entered the open doors of the women s house and were gone Myles heard their footsteps growing fainter and fainter but he never raised his eyes Upon the ground at his feet were four pebbles and he noticed how they almost made a square and would do so if he pushed one of them with his toe and then it seemed strange to him that he should think of such a little foolish thing at that dreadful time He knew that the Earl was looking gloomily at him and that his face must be very pale Suddenly Lord Mackworth spoke What hast thou to say said he harshly Then Myles raised his eyes and the Earl smiled grimly as he looked his victim over I have naught to say said the lad huskily Didst thou not hear what my daughter spake but now said the Earl She said that thou came not of thy own free will what sayst thou to that sirrah is it true Myles hesitated for a moment or two his throat was tight and dry Nay said he at last she belieth herself It was I who first came into the garden I fell by chance from the tree yonder I was seeking a ball then I asked those two if I might not come hither again and so have done some several times in all But as for her nay it was not at her bidding that I came but through mine own asking The Earl gave a little grunt in his throat And how often hast thou been here said he presently Myles thought a moment or two This maketh the seventh time said he Another pause of silence followed and Myles began to pluck up some heart that maybe all would yet be well The Earl s next speech dashed that hope into a thousand fragments Well thou knowest said he that it is forbid for any to come here Well thou knowest that twice have men been punished for this thing that thou hast done and yet thou camest in spite of all Now dost thou know what thou wilt suffer Myles picked with nervous fingers at a crack in the oaken post against which he leaned Mayhap thou wilt kill me said he at last in a dull choking voice Again the Earl smiled a grim smile Nay said he I would not slay thee for thou hast gentle blood But what sayest thou should I shear thine ears from thine head or perchance have thee scourged in the great court The sting of the words sent the blood flying back to Myles s face again and he looked quickly up Nay said he with a boldness that surprised himself thou shalt do no such unlordly thing upon me as that I be thy peer sir in blood and though thou mayst kill me thou hast no right to shame me Lord Mackworth bowed with a mocking courtesy Marry said he Methought it was one of mine own saucy popinjay squires that I caught sneaking here and talking to those two foolish young lasses and lo it is a young Lord or mayhap thou art a young Prince and commandeth me that I shall not do this and I shall not do that I crave your Lordship s honorable pardon if I have said aught that may have galled you The fear Myles had felt was now beginning to dissolve in rising wrath Nay said he stoutly I be no Lord and I be no Prince but I be as good as thou For am I not the son of thy onetime very true comrade and thy kinsman to wit the Lord Falworth whom as thou knowest is poor and broken and blind and helpless and outlawed and banned Yet cried he grinding his teeth as the thought of it all rushed in upon him I would rather be in his place than in yours for though he be ruined you He had just sense enough to stop there The Earl gripping his staff behind his back and with his head a little bent was looking keenly at the lad from under his shaggy gray brows Well said he as Myles stopped thou hast gone too far now to draw back Say thy say to the end Why wouldst thou rather be in thy father s stead than in mine Myles did not answer Thou shalt finish thy speech or else show thyself a coward Though thy father is ruined thou didst say I am what Myles keyed himself up to the effort and then blurted out Thou art attainted with shame A long breathless silence followed Myles Falworth said the Earl at last and even in the whirling of his wits Myles wondered that he had the name so pat Myles Falworth of all the bold mad hare brained fools thou art the most foolish How dost thou dare say such words to me Dost thou not know that thou makest thy coming punishment ten times more bitter by such a speech Aye cried Myles desperately but what else could I do An I did not say the words thou callest me coward and coward I am not By r Lady said the Earl I do believe thee Thou art a bold impudent varlet as ever lived to beard me so forsooth Hark ee thou sayst I think naught of mine old comrade I will show thee that thou dost belie me I will suffer what thou hast said to me for his sake and for his sake will forgive thee thy coming hither which I would not do in another case to any other man Now get thee gone straightway and come hither no more Yonder is the postern gate mayhap thou knowest the way But stay How camest thou hither Myles told him of the spikes he had driven in the wall and the Earl listened stroking his beard When the lad had ended he fixed a sharp look upon him But thou drove not those spikes alone said he who helped thee do it That I may not tell said Myles firmly So be it said the Earl I will not ask thee to tell his name Now get thee gone And as for those spikes thou mayst e en knock them out of the wall sin thou drave them in Play no more pranks an thou wouldst keep thy skin whole And now go I say Myles needed no further bidding but turned and left the Earl without another word As he went out the postern gate he looked over his shoulder and saw the tall figure in its long fur trimmed gown still standing in the middle of the path looking after him from under the shaggy eyebrows As he ran across the quadrangle his heart still fluttering in his breast he muttered to himself The old grizzle beard an I had not faced him a bold front mayhap he would have put such shame upon me as he said I wonder why he stood so staring after me as I left the garden Then for the time the matter slipped from his mind saving only that part that smacked of adventure CHAPTER twenty So for a little while Myles was disposed to congratulate himself upon having come off so well from his adventure with the Earl But after a day or two had passed and he had time for second thought he began to misdoubt whether after all he might not have carried it with a better air if he had shown more chivalrous boldness in the presence of his true lady whether it would not have redounded more to his credit if he had in some way asserted his rights as the young dame s knight errant and defender Was it not ignominious to resign his rights and privileges so easily and tamely at a signal from the Earl For in sooth said he to Gascoyne as the two talked the matter over she hath in a certain way accepted me for her knight and yet I stood me there without saying so much as one single word in her behalf Nay said Gascoyne I would not trouble me on that score Methinks that thou didst come off wondrous well out of the business I would not have thought it possible that my Lord could ha been so patient with thee as he showed himself Methinks forsooth he must hold thee privily in right high esteem Truly said Myles after a little pause of meditative silence I know not of any esteem yet I do think he was passing patient with me in this matter But ne theless Francis that changeth not my stand in the case Yea I did shamefully so to resign my lady without speaking one word nor will I so resign her even yet I have bethought me much of this matter of late Francis and now I come to thee to help me from my evil case I would have thee act the part of a true friend to me like that one I have told thee of in the story of the Emperor Justinian I would have thee when next thou servest in the house to so contrive that my Lady Alice shall get a letter which I shall presently write and wherein I may set all that is crooked straight again Heaven forbid said Gascoyne hastily that I should be such a fool as to burn my fingers in drawing thy nuts from the fire Deliver thy letter thyself good fellow So spoke Gascoyne yet after all he ended as he usually did by yielding to Myles s superior will and persistence So the letter was written and one day the good natured Gascoyne carried it with him to the house and the opportunity offering gave it to one of the young ladies attendant upon the Countess s family a lass with whom he had friendly intimacy to be delivered to Lady Alice But if Myles congratulated himself upon the success of this new adventure it was not for long That night as the crowd of pages and squires were making themselves ready for bed the call came through the uproar for Myles Falworth Myles Falworth Here I be cried Myles standing up on his cot Who calleth me It was the groom of the Earl s bedchamber and seeing Myles standing thus raised above the others he came walking down the length of the room towards him the wonted hubbub gradually silencing as he advanced and the youngsters turning staring and wondering My Lord would speak with thee Myles Falworth said the groom when he had come close enough to where Myles stood Busk thee and make ready he is at livery even now The groom s words fell upon Myles like a blow He stood for a while staring wide eyed My Lord speak with me sayst thou he ejaculated at last Aye said the other impatiently get thee ready quickly I must return anon Myles s head was in a whirl as he hastily changed his clothes for a better suit Gascoyne helping him What could the Earl want with him at this hour He knew in his heart what it was the interview could concern nothing but the letter that he had sent to Lady Alice that day As he followed the groom through the now dark and silent courts and across the corner of the great quadrangle and so to the Earl s house he tried to brace his failing courage to meet the coming interview Nevertheless his heart beat tumultuously as he followed the other down the long corridor lit only by a flaring link set in a wrought iron bracket Then his conductor lifted the arras at the door of the bedchamber whence came the murmuring sound of many voices and holding it aside beckoned him to enter and Myles passed within At the first he was conscious of nothing but a crowd of people and of the brightness of many lighted candles then he saw that he stood in a great airy room spread with a woven mat of rushes On three sides the walls were hung with tapestry representing hunting and battle scenes at the farther end where the bed stood the stone wall of the fourth side was covered with cloth of blue embroidered with silver goshawks Even now in the ripe springtime of May the room was still chilly and a great fire roared and crackled in the huge gaping mouth of the stone fireplace Not far from the blaze were clustered the greater part of those present buzzing in talk now and then swelled by murmuring laughter Some of those who knew Myles nodded to him and two or three spoke to him as he stood waiting whilst the groom went forward to speak to the Earl though what they said and what he answered Myles in his bewilderment and trepidation hardly knew As was said before the livery was the last meal of the day and was taken in bed It was a simple repast a manchette or small loaf of bread of pure white flour a loaf of household bread sometimes a lump of cheese and either a great flagon of ale or of sweet wine warm and spiced The Earl was sitting upright in bed dressed in a furred dressing gown and propped up by two cylindrical bolsters of crimson satin Upon the coverlet and spread over his knees was a large wide napkin of linen fringed with silver thread and on it rested a silver tray containing the bread and some cheese Two pages and three gentlemen were waiting upon him and Mad Noll the jester stood at the head of the bed now and then jingling his bawble and passing some quaint jest upon the chance of making his master smile Upon a table near by were some dozen or so waxen tapers struck upon as many spiked candlesticks of silver gilt and illuminating that end of the room with their bright twinkling flames One of the gentlemen was in the act of serving the Earl with a goblet of wine poured from a silver ewer by one of the squires as the groom of the chamber came forward and spoke The Earl taking the goblet turned his head and as Myles looked their eyes met Then the Earl turned away again and raised the cup to his lips while Myles felt his heart beat more rapidly than ever But at last the meal was ended and the Earl washed his hands and his mouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by another one of the squires Then leaning back against the pillows he beckoned to Myles In answer Myles walked forward the length of the room conscious that all eyes were fixed upon him The Earl said something and those who stood near drew back as he came forward Then Myles found himself standing beside the bed looking down upon the quilted counterpane feeling that the other was gazing fixedly at him I sent for thee said the Earl at last still looking steadily at him because this afternoon came a letter to my hand which thou hadst written to my niece the Lady Alice I have it here said he thrusting his hand under the bolster and have just now finished reading it Then after a moment s pause whilst he opened the parchment and scanned it again I find no matter of harm in it but hereafter write no more such He spoke entirely without anger and Myles looked up in wonder Here take it said the Earl folding the letter and tossing it to Myles who instinctively caught it and henceforth trouble thou my niece no more either by letter or any other way I thought haply thou wouldst be at some such saucy trick and I made Alice promise to let me know when it happed Now I say let this be an end of the matter Dost thou not know thou mayst injure her by such witless folly as that of meeting her privily and privily writing to her I meant no harm said Myles I believe thee said the Earl That will do now thou mayst go Myles hesitated What wouldst thou say said Lord Mackworth Only this said Myles an I have thy leave so to do that the Lady Alice hath chosen me to be her knight and so whether I may see her or speak with her or no the laws of chivalry give me who am gentle born the right to serve her as a true knight may As a true fool may said the Earl dryly Why how now thou art not a knight yet nor anything but a raw lump of a boy What rights do the laws of chivalry give thee sirrah Thou art a fool Had the Earl been ever so angry his words would have been less bitter to Myles than his cool unmoved patience it mortified his pride and galled it to the quick I know that thou dost hold me in contempt he mumbled Out upon thee said the Earl testily Thou dost tease me beyond patience I hold thee in contempt forsooth Why look thee hadst thou been other than thou art I would have had thee whipped out of my house long since Thinkest thou I would have borne so patiently with another one of ye squires had such an one held secret meeting with my daughter and niece and tampered as thou hast done with my household sending through one of my people that letter Go to thou art a fool Myles Falworth Myles stood staring at the Earl without making an effort to speak The words that he had heard suddenly flashed as it were a new light into his mind In that flash he fully recognized and for the first time the strange and wonderful forbearance the great Earl had shown to him a poor obscure boy What did it mean Was Lord Mackworth his secret friend after all as Gascoyne had more than once asserted So Myles stood silent thinking many things Meantime the other lay back upon the cylindrical bolsters looking thoughtfully at him How old art thou said he at last Seventeen last April answered Myles Then thou art old enough to have some of the thoughts of a man and to lay aside those of a boy Haply thou hast had foolish things in thy head this short time past it is time that thou put them away Harkee sirrah the Lady Alice is a great heiress in her own right and mayst command the best alliance in England an Earl a Duke She groweth apace to a woman and then her kind lieth in Courts and great houses As for thee thou art but a poor lad penniless and without friends to aid thee to open advancement Thy father is attainted and one whisper of where he lieth hid would bring him thence to the Tower and haply to the block Besides that he hath an enemy as Sir James Lee hath already told thee an enemy perhaps more great and powerful than myself That enemy watcheth for thy father and for thee shouldst thou dare raise thy head or thy fortune ever so little he would haply crop them both and that parlously quick Myles Falworth how dost thou dare to lift thine eyes to the Lady Alice de Mowbray Poor Myles stood silent and motionless Sir said he at last in a dry choking voice thou art right and I have been a fool Sir I will never raise mine eyes to look upon the Lady Alice more I say not that either boy said the Earl but ere thou dost so dare thou must first place thyself and thy family whence ye fell Till then as thou art an honest man trouble her not Now get thee gone As Myles crossed the dark and silent courtyards and looked up at the clear still twinkle of the stars he felt a kind of dull wonder that they and the night and the world should seem so much the same and he be so different The first stroke had been given that was to break in pieces his boyhood life the second was soon to follow CHAPTER twenty one There are now and then times in the life of every one when new and strange things occur with such rapidity that one has hardly time to catch one s breath between the happenings It is as though the old were crumbling away breaking in pieces to give place to the new that is soon to take its place So it was with Myles Falworth about this time The very next day after this interview in the bed chamber word came to him that Sir James Lee wished to speak with him in the office He found the lean grizzled old knight alone sitting at the heavy oaken table with a tankard of spiced ale at his elbow and a dish of wafers and some fragments of cheese on a pewter platter before him He pointed to his clerk s seat a joint stool somewhat like a camp chair but made of heavy oaken braces and with a seat of hog skin and bade Myles be seated It was the first time that Myles had ever heard of such courtesy being extended to one of the company of squires and much wondering he obeyed the invitation or rather command and took the seat The old knight sat regarding him for a while in silence his one eye as bright and as steady as that of a hawk looking keenly from under the penthouse of its bushy brows the while he slowly twirled and twisted his bristling wiry mustaches as was his wont when in meditation At last he broke the silence How old art thou said he abruptly I be turned seventeen last April Myles answered as he had the evening before to Lord Mackworth Humph said Sir James thou be saint big of bone and frame for thine age I would that thy heart were more that of a man likewise and less that of a giddy hare brained boy thinking continually of naught but mischief Again he fell silent and Myles sat quite still wondering if it was on account of any special one of his latest escapades that he had been summoned to the office the breaking of the window in the Long Hall by the stone he had flung at the rook or the climbing of the South Tower for the jackdaw s nest Thou hast a friend said Sir James suddenly breaking into his speculations of such a kind that few in this world possess Almost ever since thou hast been here he hath been watching over thee Canst thou guess of whom I speak Haply it is Lord George Beaumont said Myles he hath always been passing kind to me Nay said Sir James it is not of him that I speak though methinks he liketh thee well enow Canst thou keep a secret boy he asked suddenly Yea answered Myles And wilt thou do so in this case if I tell thee who it is that is thy best friend here Yea Then it is my Lord who is that friend the Earl himself but see that thou breathe not a word of it Myles sat staring at the old knight in utter and profound amazement and presently Sir James continued Yea almost ever since thou hast come here my Lord hath kept oversight upon all thy doings upon all thy mad pranks and thy quarrels and thy fights thy goings out and comings in What thinkest thou of that Myles Falworth Again the old knight stopped and regarded the lad who sat silent finding no words to answer He seemed to find a grim pleasure in the youngster s bewilderment and wonder Then a sudden thought came to Myles Sir said he did my Lord know that I went to the privy garden as I did Nay said Sir James of that he knew naught at first until thy father bade thy mother write and tell him My father ejaculated Myles Aye said Sir James twisting his mustaches more vigorously than ever So soon as thy father heard of that prank he wrote straightway to my Lord that he should put a stop to what might in time have bred mischief Sir said Myles in an almost breathless voice I know not how to believe all these things or whether I be awake or a dreaming Thou be saint surely enough awake answered the old man but there are other matters yet to be told My Lord thinketh as others of us do Lord George and myself that it is now time for thee to put away thy boyish follies and learn those things appertaining to manhood Thou hast been here a year now and hast had freedom to do as thou might list but boy and the old warrior spoke seriously almost solemnly upon thee doth rest matters of such great import that did I tell them to thee thou couldst not grasp them My Lord deems that thou hast mayhap promise beyond the common of men ne theless it remaineth yet to be seen an he be right it is yet to test whether that promise may be fulfilled Next Monday I and Sir Everard Willoughby take thee in hand to begin training thee in the knowledge and the use of the jousting lance of arms and of horsemanship Thou art to go to Ralph Smith and have him fit a suit of plain armor to thee which he hath been charged to make for thee against this time So get thee gone think well over all these matters and prepare thyself by next Monday But stay sirrah he added as Myles dazed and bewildered turned to obey breathe to no living soul what I ha told thee that my Lord is thy friend neither speak of anything concerning him Such is his own heavy command laid upon thee Then Myles turned again without a word to leave the room But as he reached the door Sir James stopped him a second time Stay he called I had nigh missed telling thee somewhat else My Lord hath made thee a present this morning that thou wottest not of It is then he stopped for a few moments perhaps to enjoy the full flavor of what he had to say it is a great Flemish horse of true breed and right mettle a horse such as a knight of the noblest strain might be proud to call his own Myles Falworth thou wert born upon a lucky day Sir cried Myles and then stopped short Then Sir he cried again didst thou say it the horse was to be mine Aye it is to be thine My very own Thy very own How Myles Falworth left that place he never knew He was like one in some strange some wonderful dream He walked upon air and his heart was so full of joy and wonder and amazement that it thrilled almost to agony Of course his first thought was of Gascoyne How he ever found him he never could tell but find him he did Come Francis he cried I have that to tell thee so marvellous that had it come upon me from paradise it could not be more strange Then he dragged him away to their Eyry it had been many a long day since they had been there and to all his friend s speeches to all his wondering questions he answered never a word until they had climbed the stairs and so come to their old haunt Then he spoke Sit thee down Francis said he till I tell thee that which passeth wonder As Gascoyne obeyed he himself stood looking about him This is the last time I shall ever come hither said he And thereupon he poured out his heart to his listening friend in the murmuring solitude of the airy height He did not speak of the Earl but of the wonderful new life that had thus suddenly opened before him with its golden future of limitless hopes of dazzling possibilities of heroic ambitions He told everything walking up and down the while for he could not remain quiet his cheeks glowing and his eyes sparkling Gascoyne sat quite still staring straight before him He knew that his friend was ruffling eagle pinions for a flight in which he could never hope to follow and somehow his heart ached for he knew that this must be the beginning of the end of the dear delightful friendship of the year past CHAPTER twenty two And so ended Myles Falworth s boyhood Three years followed during which he passed through that state which immediately follows boyhood in all men s lives a time when they are neither lads nor grown men but youths passing from the one to the other period through what is often an uncouth and uncomfortable age He had fancied when he talked with Gascoyne in the Eyry that time that he was to become a man all at once he felt just then that he had forever done with boyish things But that is not the way it happens in men s lives Changes do not come so suddenly and swiftly as that but by little and little For three or four days maybe he went his new way of life big with the great change that had come upon him and then now in this and now in that he drifted back very much into his old ways of boyish doings As was said one s young days do not end all at once even when they be so suddenly and sharply shaken and Myles was not different from others He had been stirred to the core by that first wonderful sight of the great and glorious life of manhood opening before him but he had yet many a sport to enjoy many a game to play many a boisterous romp to riot in the dormitory many an expedition to make to copse and spinney and river on days when he was off duty and when permission had been granted Nevertheless there was a great and vital change in his life a change which he hardly felt or realized Even in resuming his old life there was no longer the same vitality the same zest the same enjoyment in all these things It seemed as though they were no longer a part of himself The savor had gone from them and by and by it was pleasanter to sit looking on at the sports and the games of the younger lads than to take active part in them These three years of his life that had thus passed had been very full full mostly of work grinding and monotonous of training dull dry laborious For Sir James Lee was a taskmaster as hard as iron and seemingly as cold as a stone For two perhaps for three weeks Myles entered into his new exercises with all the enthusiasm that novelty brings but these exercises hardly varied a tittle from day to day and soon became a duty and finally a hard and grinding task He used in the earlier days of his castle life to hate the dull monotony of the tri weekly hacking at the pels with a heavy broadsword as he hated nothing else but now though he still had that exercise to perform it was almost a relief from the heavy dulness of riding riding riding in the tilt yard with shield and lance couch recover en passant But though he had nowadays but little time for boyish plays and escapades his life was not altogether without relaxation Now and then he was permitted to drive in mock battle with other of the younger knights and bachelors in the paddock near the outer walls It was a still more welcome change in the routine of his life when occasionally he would break a light lance in the tilting court with Sir Everard Willoughby Lord George perhaps and maybe one or two others of the Hall folk looking on Then one gilded day when Lord Dudleigh was visiting at Devlen Myles ran a course with a heavier lance in the presence of the Earl who came down to the tilt yard with his guest to see the young novitiate ride against Sir Everard He did his best and did it well Lord Dudleigh praised his poise and carriage and Lord George who was present gave him an approving smile and nod But the Earl of Mackworth only sat stroking his beard impassively as was his custom Myles would have given much to know his thoughts In all these years Sir James Lee almost never gave any expression either of approbation or disapproval excepting when Myles exhibited some carelessness or oversight Then his words were sharp and harsh enough More than once Myles s heart failed him and bitter discouragement took possession of him then nothing but his bull dog tenacity and stubbornness brought him out from the despondency of the dark hours Sir he burst out one day when his heart was heavy with some failure tell me I beseech thee do I get me any of skill at all Is it in me ever to make a worthy knight fit to hold lance and sword with other men or am I only soothly a dull heavy block worth naught of any good Thou art a fool sirrah answered Sir James in his grimmest tones Thinkest thou to learn all of knightly prowess in a year and a half Wait until thou art ripe and then I will tell thee if thou art fit to couch a lance or ride a course with a right knight Thou art an old bear muttered Myles to himself as the old one eyed knight turned on his heel and strode away Beshrew me an I show thee not that I am as worthy to couch a lance as thou one of these fine days However during the last of the three years the grinding routine of his training had not been quite so severe as at first His exercises took him more often out into the fields and it was during this time of his knightly education that he sometimes rode against some of the castle knights in friendly battle with sword or lance or wooden mace In these encounters he always held his own and held it more than well though in his boyish simplicity he was altogether unconscious of his own skill address and strength Perhaps it was his very honest modesty that made him so popular and so heartily liked by all He had by this time risen to the place of head squire or chief bachelor holding the same position that Walter Blunt had occupied when he himself had first come a raw country boy to Devlen The lesser squires and pages fairly worshipped him as a hero albeit imposing upon his good nature All took a pride in his practice in knightly exercises and fabulous tales were current among the young fry concerning his strength and skill Yet although Myles was now at the head of his class he did not as other chief bachelors had done take a leading position among the squires in the Earl s household service Lord Mackworth for his own good reasons relegated him to the position of Lord George s especial attendant Nevertheless the Earl always distinguished him from the other esquires giving him a cool nod whenever they met and Myles upon his part now that he had learned better to appreciate how much his Lord had done for him would have shed the last drop of blood in his veins for the head of the house of Beaumont As for the two young ladies he often saw them and sometimes even in the presence of the Earl exchanged a few words with them and Lord Mackworth neither forbade it nor seemed to notice it Towards the Lady Anne he felt the steady friendly regard of a lad for a girl older than himself towards the Lady Alice now budding into ripe young womanhood there lay deep in his heart the resolve to be some day her true knight in earnest as he had been her knight in pretence in that time of boyhood when he had so perilously climbed into the privy garden In body and form he was now a man and in thought and heart was quickly ripening to manhood for as was said before men matured quickly in those days He was a right comely youth for the promise of his boyish body had been fulfilled in a tall powerful well knit frame His face was still round and boyish but on cheek and chin and lip was the curl of adolescent beard soft yellow and silky His eyes were as blue as steel and quick and sharp in glance as those of a hawk and as he walked his arms swung from his broad square shoulders and his body swayed with pent up strength ready for action at any moment If little Lady Alice hearing much talk of his doings and of his promise in these latter times thought of him now and then it is a matter not altogether to be wondered at Such were the changes that three years had wrought And from now the story of his manhood really begins Perhaps in all the history of Devlen Castle even at this the high tide of pride and greatness of the house of Beaumont the most notable time was in the early autumn of the year fourteen eleven when for five days King Henry IV was entertained by the Earl of Mackworth The King was at that time making a progress through certain of the midland counties and with him travelled the Comte de Vermoise The Count was the secret emissary of the Dauphin s faction in France at that time in the very bitterest intensity of the struggle with the Duke of Burgundy and had come to England seeking aid for his master in his quarrel It was not the first time that royalty had visited Devlen Once in Earl Robert s day King Edward II had spent a week at the castle during the period of the Scottish wars But at that time it was little else than a military post and was used by the King as such Now the Beaumonts were in the very flower of their prosperity and preparations were made for the coming visit of royalty upon a scale of such magnificence and splendor as Earl Robert or perhaps even King Edward himself had never dreamed For weeks the whole castle had been alive with folk hurrying hither and thither and with the daily and almost hourly coming of pack horses laden with bales and boxes from London From morning to night one heard the ceaseless chip chipping of the masons hammers and saw carriers of stones and mortar ascending and descending the ladders of the scaffolding that covered the face of the great North Hall Within that part of the building was alive with the scraping of the carpenters saws the clattering of lumber and the rapping and banging of hammers The North Hall had been assigned as the lodging place for the King and his court and saint George s Hall as the older building adjoining it was called had been set apart as the lodging of the Comte de Vermoise and the knights and gentlemen attendant upon him The great North Hall had been very much altered and changed for the accommodation of the King and his people a beautiful gallery of carved wood work had been built within and across the south end of the room for the use of the ladies who were to look down upon the ceremonies below Two additional windows had been cut through the wall and glazed and passage ways had been opened connecting with the royal apartments beyond In the bedchamber a bed of carved wood and silver had been built into the wall and had been draped with hangings of pale blue and silver and a magnificent screen of wrought iron and carved wood had been erected around the couch rich and beautiful tapestries brought from Italy and Flanders were hung upon the walls cushions of velvets and silks stuffed with down covered benches and chairs The floor of the hall was spread with mats of rushes stained in various colors woven into curious patterns and in the smaller rooms precious carpets of arras were laid on the cold stones All of the cadets of the House had been assembled all of the gentlemen in waiting retainers and clients The castle seemed full to overflowing even the dormitory of the squires was used as a lodging place for many of the lesser gentry So at last in the midst of all this bustle of preparation came the day of days when the King was to arrive The day before a courier had come bringing the news that he was lodging at Donaster Abbey overnight and would make progress the next day to Devlen That morning as Myles was marshalling the pages and squires and with the list of names in his hand was striving to evolve some order out of the confusion assigning the various individuals their special duties these to attend in the household those to ride in the escort one of the gentlemen of Lord George s household came with an order for him to come immediately to the young nobleman s apartments Myles hastily turned over his duties to Gascoyne and Wilkes and then hurried after the messenger He found Lord George in the antechamber three gentlemen squires arming him in a magnificent suit of ribbed Milan He greeted Myles with a nod and a smile as the lad entered Sirrah said he I have had a talk with Mackworth this morn concerning thee and have a mind to do thee an honor in my poor way How wouldst thou like to ride to day as my special squire of escort Myles flushed to the roots of his hair Oh sir he cried eagerly an I be not too ungainly for thy purpose no honor in all the world could be such joy to me as that Lord George laughed A little matter pleases thee hugely said he but as to being ungainly who so sayeth that of thee belieth thee Myles thou art not ungainly sirrah But that is not to the point I have chosen thee for my equerry to day so make thou haste and don thine armor and then come hither again and Hollingwood will fit thee with a wreathed bascinet I have within and a juppon embroidered with my arms and colors When Myles had made his bow and left his patron he flew across the quadrangle and burst into the armory upon Gascoyne whom he found still lingering there chatting with one or two of the older bachelors What thinkest thou Francis he cried wild with excitement An honor hath been done me this day I could never have hoped to enjoy Out of all this household Lord George hath chose me his equerry for the day to ride to meet the King Come hasten to help me to arm Art thou not glad of this thing for my sake Francis Aye glad am I indeed cried Gascoyne that generous friend rather almost would I have this befall thee than myself And indeed he was hardly less jubilant than Myles over the honor Five minutes later he was busy arming him in the little room at the end of the dormitory which had been lately set apart for the use of the head bachelor And to think he said looking up as he kneeled strapping the thigh plates to his friend s legs that he should have chosen thee before all others of the fine knights and lords and gentlemen of quality that are here Yea said Myles it passeth wonder I know not why he should so single me out for such an honor It is strangely marvellous Nay said Gascoyne there is no marvel in it and I know right well why he chooseth thee It is because he sees as we all see that thou art the stoutest and the best skilled in arms and most easy of carriage of any man in all this place Myles laughed An thou make sport of me said he I ll rap thy head with this dagger hilt Thou art a silly fellow Francis to talk so But tell me hast thou heard who rides with my Lord Yea I heard Wilkes say anon that it was Sir James Lee I am right glad of that said Myles for then he will show me what to do and how to bear myself It frights me to think what would hap should I make some mistake in my awkwardness Methinks Lord George would never have me with him more should I do amiss this day Never fear said Gascoyne thou wilt not do amiss And now at last the Earl Lord George and all their escort were ready then the orders were given to horse the bugle sounded and away they all rode with clashing of iron hoofs and ringing and jingling of armor out into the dewy freshness of the early morning the slant yellow sun of autumn blazing and flaming upon polished helmets and shields and twinkling like sparks of fire upon spear points Myles s heart thrilled within him for pure joy and he swelled out his sturdy young breast with great draughts of the sweet fresh air that came singing across the sunny hill tops Sir James Lee who acted as the Earl s equerry for the day rode at a little distance and there was an almost pathetic contrast between the grim steadfast impassiveness of the tough old warrior and Myles s passionate exuberance of youth At the head of the party rode the Earl and his brother side by side each clad cap a pie in a suit of Milan armor the cuirass of each covered with a velvet juppon embroidered in silver with the arms and quarterings of the Beaumonts The Earl wore around his neck an S S collar with a jewelled saint George hanging from it and upon his head a vizored bascinet ornamented with a wreath covered with black and yellow velvet and glistening with jewels Lord George as was said before was clad in a beautiful suit of ribbed Milan armor It was rimmed with a thin thread of gold and like his brother he wore a bascinet wreathed with black and yellow velvet Behind the two brothers and their equerries rode the rest in their proper order knights gentlemen esquires men at arms to the number perhaps of two hundred and fifty spears and lances aslant and banners permons and pencels of black and yellow fluttering in the warm September air From the castle to the town they rode and then across the bridge and thence clattering up through the stony streets where the folk looked down upon them from the windows above or crowded the fronts of the shops of the tradesmen Lusty cheers were shouted for the Earl but the great Lord rode staring ever straight before him as unmoved as a stone Then out of the town they clattered and away in a sweeping cloud of dust across the country side It was not until they had reached the windy top of Willoughby Croft ten miles away that they met the King and his company As the two parties approached to within forty or fifty yards of one another they stopped As they came to a halt Myles observed that a gentleman dressed in a plain blue gray riding habit and sitting upon a beautiful white gelding stood a little in advance of the rest of the party and he knew that that must be the King Then Sir James nodded to Myles and leaping from his horse flung the reins to one of the attendants Myles did the like and then still following Sir James s lead as he served Lord Mackworth went forward and held Lord George s stirrup while he dismounted The two noblemen quickly removed each his bascinet and Myles holding the bridle rein of Lord George s horse with his left hand took the helmet in his right resting it upon his hip Then the two brothers walked forward bare headed the Earl a little in advance Reaching the King he stopped and then bent his knee stiffly in the armored plates until it touched the ground Thereupon the King reached him his hand and he rising again took it and set it to his lips Then Lord George advancing kneeled as his brother had kneeled and to him also the King gave his hand Myles could hear nothing but he could see that a few words of greeting passed between the three and then the King turning beckoned to a knight who stood just behind him and a little in advance of the others of the troop In answer the knight rode forward the King spoke a few words of introduction and the stranger ceremoniously drawing off his right gauntlet clasped the hand first of the Earl and then of Lord George Myles knew that he must be the great Comte de Vermoise of whom he had heard so much of late A few moments of conversation followed and then the King bowed slightly The French nobleman instantly reined back his horse an order was given and then the whole company moved forward the two brothers walking upon either side of the King the Earl lightly touching the bridle rein with his bare hand Whilst all this was passing the Earl of Mackworth s company had been drawn up in a double line along the road side leaving the way open to the other party As the King reached the head of the troop another halt followed while he spoke a few courteous words of greeting to some of the lesser nobles attendant upon the Earl whom he knew In that little time he was within a few paces of Myles who stood motionless as a statue holding the bascinet and the bridle rein of Lord George s horse What Myles saw was a plain rather stout man with a face fat smooth and waxy with pale blue eyes and baggy in the lids clean shaven except for a mustache and tuft covering lips and chin Somehow he felt a deep disappointment He had expected to see something lion like something regal and after all the great King Henry was commonplace fat unwholesome looking It came to him with a sort of a shock that after all a King was in nowise different from other men Meanwhile the Earl and his brother replaced their bascinets and presently the whole party moved forward upon the way to Mackworth CHAPTER twenty three That same afternoon the squires quarters were thrown into such a ferment of excitement as had perhaps never before stirred them About one o clock in the afternoon the Earl himself and Lord George came walking slowly across the Armory Court wrapped in deep conversation and entered Sir James Lee s office All the usual hubbub of noise that surrounded the neighborhood of the dormitory and the armory was stilled at their coming and when the two noblemen had entered Sir James s office the lads and young men gathered in knots discussing with an almost awesome interest what that visit might portend After some time Sir James Lee came to the door at the head of the long flight of stone steps and whistling beckoned one of the smaller pages to him He gave a short order that sent the little fellow flying on some mission In the course of a few minutes he returned hurrying across the stony court with Myles Falworth who presently entered Sir James s office It was then and at this sight that the intense half suppressed excitement reached its height of fever heat What did it all mean The air was filled with a thousand vague wild rumors but the very wildest surmises fell short of the real truth Perhaps Myles was somewhat pale when he entered the office certainly his nerves were in a tremor for his heart told him that something very portentous was about to befall him The Earl sat at the table and in the seat that Sir James Lee usually occupied Lord George half sat half leaned in the window place Sir James stood with his back to the empty fireplace and his hands clasped behind him All three were very serious Give thee good den Myles Falworth said the Earl as Myles bowed first to him and then to the others and I would have thee prepare thyself for a great happening Then continuing directly to the point Thou knowest sirrah why we have been training thee so closely these three years gone it is that thou shouldst be able to hold thine own in the world Nay not only hold thine own but to show thyself to be a knight of prowess shouldst it come to a battle between thee and thy father s enemy for there lieth no half way place for thee and thou must be either great or else nothing Well sir the time hath now come for thee to show thy mettle I would rather have chosen that thou hadst labored a twelvemonth longer but now as I said hath come a chance to prove thyself that may never come again Sir James tells me that thou art passably ripe in skill Thou must now show whether that be so or no Hast thou ever heard of the Sieur de la Montaigne Yea my Lord I have heard of him often answered Myles It was he who won the prize at the great tourney at Rochelle last year I see that thou hast his fame pat to thy tongue s end said the Earl he is the chevalier of whom I speak and he is reckoned the best knight of Dauphiny That one of which thou spokest was the third great tourney in which he was adjudged the victor I am glad that thou holdest his prowess highly Knowest thou that he is in the train of the Comte de Vermoise Nay said Myles flushing I did hear news he was in England but knew not that he was in this place Yea said Lord Mackworth he is here He paused for a moment then said suddenly Tell me Myles Falworth an thou wert a knight and of rank fit to run a joust with the Sieur de la Montaigne wouldst thou dare encounter him in the lists The Earl s question fell upon Myles so suddenly and unexpectedly that for a moment or so he stood staring at the speaker with mouth agape Meanwhile the Earl sat looking calmly back at him slowly stroking his beard the while It was Sir James Lee s voice that broke the silence Thou heardst thy Lord speak said he harshly Hast thou no tongue to answer sirrah Be silent Lee said Lord Mackworth quietly Let the lad have time to think before he speaketh The sound of the words aroused Myles He advanced to the table and rested his hand upon it My Lord my Lord said he I know not what to say I I am amazed and afeard How how cried Sir James Lee harshly Afeard sayst thou An thou art afeard thou knave thou needst never look upon my face or speak to me more I have done with thee forever an thou art afeard even were the champion a Sir Alisander Peace peace Lee said the Earl holding up his hand Thou art too hasty The lad shall have his will in this matter and thou and no one shall constrain him Methinks also thou dost not understand him Speak from thy heart Myles why art thou afraid Because said Myles I am so young sir I am but a raw boy How should I dare be so hardy as to venture to set lance against such an one as the Sieur de la Montaigne What would I be but a laughing stock for all the world who would see me so foolish as to venture me against one of such prowess and skill Nay Myles said Lord George thou thinkest not well enough of thine own skill and prowess Thinkest thou we would undertake to set thee against him an we did not think that thou couldst hold thine own fairly well Hold mine own cried Myles turning to Lord George Sir thou dost not mean thou canst not mean that I may hope or dream to hold mine own against the Sieur de la Montaigne Aye said Lord George that was what I did mean Come Myles said the Earl now tell me wilt thou fight the Sieur de la Montaigne Yea said Myles drawing himself to his full height and throwing out his chest Yea and his cheeks and forehead flushed red an thou bid me do so I will fight him There spake my brave lad cried Lord George heartily I give thee joy Myles said the Earl reaching him his hand which Myles took and kissed And I give thee double joy I have talked with the King concerning thee this morning and he hath consented to knight thee yea to knight thee with all honors of the Bath provided thou wilt match thee against the Sieur de la Montaigne for the honor of England and Mackworth Just now the King lieth to sleep for a little while after his dinner have thyself in readiness when he cometh forth and I will have thee presented Then the Earl turned to Sir James Lee and questioned him as to how the bachelors were fitted with clothes Myles listened only half hearing the words through the tumbling of his thoughts He had dreamed in his day dreams that some time he might be knighted but that time always seemed very very distant To be knighted now in his boyhood by the King with the honors of the Bath and under the patronage of the Earl of Mackworth to joust to actually joust with the Sieur de la Montaigne one of the most famous chevaliers of France No wonder he only half heard the words half heard the Earl s questions concerning his clothes and the discussion which followed half heard Lord George volunteer to array him in fitting garments from his own wardrobe Thou mayst go now said the Earl at last turning to him But be thou at George s apartments by two of the clock to be dressed fittingly for the occasion Then Myles went out stupefied dazed bewildered He looked around but he did not see Gascoyne He said not a word to any of the others in answer to the eager questions poured upon him by his fellow squires but walked straight away He hardly knew where he went but by and by he found himself in a grassy angle below the end of the south stable a spot overlooking the outer wall and the river beyond He looked around no one was near and he flung himself at length burying his face in his arms How long he lay there he did not know but suddenly some one touched him upon the shoulder and he sprang up quickly It was Gascoyne What is to do Myles said his friend anxiously What is all this talk I hear concerning thee up yonder at the armory Oh Francis cried Myles with a husky choking voice I am to be knighted by the King by the King himself and I I am to fight the Sieur de la Montaigne He reached out his hand and Gascoyne took it They stood for a while quite silent and when at last the stillness was broken it was Gascoyne who spoke in a choking voice Thou art going to be great Myles said he I always knew that it must be so with thee and now the time hath come Yea thou wilt be great and live at court amongst noble folk and Kings haply Presently thou wilt not be with me any more and wilt forget me by and by Nay Francis never will I forget thee answered Myles pressing his friend s hand I will always love thee better than any one in the world saving only my father and my mother Gascoyne shook his head and looked away swallowing at the dry lump in his throat Suddenly he turned to Myles Wilt thou grant me a boon Yea answered Myles What is it That thou wilt choose me for thy squire Nay said Myles how canst thou think to serve me as squire Thou wilt be a knight thyself some day Francis and why dost thou wish now to be my squire Because said Gascoyne with a short laugh I would rather be in thy company as a squire than in mine own as a knight even if I might be banneret Myles flung his arm around his friend s neck and kissed him upon the cheek Thou shalt have thy will said he but whether knight or squire thou art ever mine own true friend Then they went slowly back together hand in hand to the castle world again At two o clock Myles went to Lord George s apartments and there his friend and patron dressed him out in a costume better fitted for the ceremony of presentation a fur trimmed jacket of green brocaded velvet embroidered with golden thread a black velvet hood cap rolled like a turban and with a jewel in the front a pair of crimson hose and a pair of black velvet shoes trimmed and stitched with gold thread Myles had never worn such splendid clothes in his life before and he could not but feel that they became him well Sir said he as he looked down at himself sure it is not lawful for me to wear such clothes as these In those days there was a law known as a sumptuary law which regulated by statute the clothes that each class of people were privileged to wear It was as Myles said against the law for him to wear such garments as those in which he was clad either velvet crimson stuff fur or silver or gold embroidery nevertheless such a solemn ceremony as presentation to the King excused the temporary overstepping of the law and so Lord George told him As he laid his hand upon the lad s shoulder and held him off at arm s length he added And I pledge thee my word Myles that thou art as lusty and handsome a lad as ever mine eyes beheld Thou art very kind to me sir said Myles in answer Lord George laughed and then giving him a shake let go his shoulder It was about three o clock when little Edmond de Montefort Lord Mackworth s favorite page came with word that the King was then walking in the Earl s pleasance Come Myles said Lord George and then Myles arose from the seat where he had been sitting his heart palpitating and throbbing tumultuously At the wicket gate of the pleasance two gentlemen at arms stood guard in half armor they saluted Lord George and permitted him to pass with his protege As he laid his hand upon the latch of the wicket he paused for a moment and turned Myles said he in a low voice thou art a thoughtful and cautious lad for thy father s sake be thoughtful and cautious now Do not speak his name or betray that thou art his son Then he opened the wicket gate and entered Any lad of Myles s age even one far more used to the world than he would perhaps have felt all the oppression that he experienced under the weight of such a presentation He hardly knew what he was doing as Lord George led him to where the King stood a little apart from the attendants with the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise Even in his confusion he knew enough to kneel and somehow his honest modest diffidence became the young fellow very well He was not awkward for one so healthful in mind and body as he could not bear himself very ill and he felt the assurance that in Lord George he had a kind friend at his side and one well used to court ceremonies to lend him countenance Then there is something always pleasing in frank modest manliness such as was stamped on Myles s handsome sturdy face No doubt the King s heart warmed towards the fledgling warrior kneeling in the pathway before him He smiled very kindly as he gave the lad his hand to kiss and that ceremony done held fast to the hard brown sinewy fist of the young man with his soft white hand and raised him to his feet By the mass said he looking Myles over with smiling eyes thou art a right champion in good sooth Such as thou art haply was Sir Galahad when he came to Arthur s court And so they tell me thou hast stomach to brook the Sieur de la Montaigne that tough old boar of Dauphiny Hast thou in good sooth the courage to face him Knowest thou what a great thing it is that thou hast set upon thyself to do battle even in sport with him Yea your Majesty answered Myles well I wot it is a task haply beyond me But gladly would I take upon me even a greater venture and one more dangerous to do your Majesty s pleasure The King looked pleased Now that was right well said young man said he and I like it better that it came from such young and honest lips Dost thou speak French Yea your Majesty answered Myles In some small measure do I so I am glad of that said the King for so I may make thee acquainted with Sieur de la Montaigne He turned as he ended speaking and beckoned to a heavy thick set black browed chevalier who stood with the other gentlemen attendants at a little distance He came instantly forward in answer to the summons and the King introduced the two to one another As each took the other formally by the hand he measured his opponent hastily body and limb and perhaps each thought that he had never seen a stronger stouter better knit man than the one upon whom he looked But nevertheless the contrast betwixt the two was very great Myles young boyish fresh faced the other bronzed weather beaten and seamed with a great white scar that ran across his forehead and cheek the one a novice the other a warrior seasoned in twoscore battles A few polite phrases passed between the two the King listening smiling but with an absent and far away look gradually stealing upon his face As they ended speaking a little pause of silence followed and then the King suddenly aroused himself So said he I am glad that ye two are acquainted And now we will leave our youthful champion in thy charge Beaumont and in thine Mon Sieur as well and so soon as the proper ceremonies are ended we will dub him knight with our own hands And now Mackworth and thou my Lord Count let us walk a little I have bethought me further concerning these threescore extra men for Dauphiny Then Myles withdrew under the charge of Lord George and the Sieur de la Montaigne and while the King and the two nobles walked slowly up and down the gravel path between the tall rose bushes Myles stood talking with the gentlemen attendants finding himself with a certain triumphant exultation the peer of any and the hero of the hour That night was the last that Myles and Gascoyne spent lodging in the dormitory in their squirehood service The next day they were assigned apartments in Lord George s part of the house and thither they transported themselves and their belongings amid the awestruck wonder and admiration of their fellow squires CHAPTER twenty four In Myles Falworth s day one of the greatest ceremonies of courtly life was that of the bestowal of knighthood by the King with the honors of the Bath By far the greater number of knights were at that time created by other knights or by nobles or by officers of the crown To be knighted by the King in person distinguished the recipient for life It was this signal honor that the Earl for his own purposes wished Myles to enjoy and for this end he had laid not a few plans The accolade was the term used for the creation of a knight upon the field of battle It was a reward of valor or of meritorious service and was generally bestowed in a more or less off hand way but the ceremony of the Bath was an occasion of the greatest courtly moment and it was thus that Myles Falworth was to be knighted in addition to the honor of a royal belting A quaint old book treating of knighthood and chivalry gives a full and detailed account of all the circumstances of the ceremony of a creation of a Knight of the Bath It tells us that the candidate was first placed under the care of two squires of honor grave and well seen in courtship and nurture and also in feats of chivalry which same were likewise to be governors in all things relating to the coming honors First of all the barber shaved him and cut his hair in a certain peculiar fashion ordained for the occasion the squires of honor supervising the operation This being concluded the candidate was solemnly conducted to the chamber where the bath of tepid water was prepared hung within and without with linen and likewise covered with rich cloths and embroidered linen While in the bath two ancient grave and reverend knights attended the bachelor giving him meet instructions in the order and feats of chivalry The candidate was then examined as to his knowledge and acquirements and then all questions being answered to the satisfaction of his examiners the elder of the two dipped a handful of water out from the bath and poured it upon his head at the same time signing his left shoulder with the sign of the cross As soon as this ceremony was concluded the two squires of honor helped their charge from the bath and conducted him to a plain bed without hangings where they let him rest until his body was warm and dry Then they clad him in a white linen shirt and over it a plain robe of russet girdled about the loins with a rope and having a hood like unto a hermit As soon as the candidate had arisen the two ancient knights returned and all being in readiness he was escorted to the chapel the two walking one upon either side of him his squires of honor marching before and the whole party preceded by sundry minstrels making a loud noise of music When they came to the chapel the two knights who escorted him took leave of the candidate each saluting him with a kiss upon the cheek No one remained with him but his squires of honor the priest and the chandler In the mean time the novitiate s armor sword lance and helmet had been laid in readiness before the altar These he watched and guarded while the others slept keeping vigil until sunrise during which time he shall says the ancient authority pass the night in orisons prayers and meditation At daylight he confessed to the priest heard matins and communicated in mass and then presented a lighted candle at the altar with a piece of money stuck in it as close to the flame as could be done the candle being offered to the honor of God and the money to the honor of that person who was to make him a knight So concluded the sacred ceremony which being ended his squires conducted the candidate to his chamber and there made him comfortable and left him to repose for a while before the second and final part of the ordinance Such is a shortened account of the preparatory stages of the ceremonies through which Myles Falworth passed Matters had come upon him so suddenly one after the other and had come with such bewildering rapidity that all that week was to him like some strange wonderful mysterious vision He went through it all like one in a dream Lord George Beaumont was one of his squires of honor the other by way of a fitting complement to the courage of the chivalrous lad was the Sieur de la Montaigne his opponent soon to be They were well versed in everything relating to knightcraft and Myles followed all their directions with passive obedience Then Sir James Lee and the Comte de Vermoise administered the ceremony of the Bath the old knight examining him in the laws of chivalry It occurs perhaps once or twice in one s lifetime that one passes through great happenings sometimes of joy sometimes of dreadful bitterness in just such a dazed state as Myles passed through this It is only afterwards that all comes back to one so sharply and keenly that the heart thrills almost in agony in living it over again But perhaps of all the memory of that time when it afterwards came back piece by piece none was so clear to Myles s back turned vision as the long night spent in the chapel watching his armor thinking such wonderful thoughts and dreaming such wonderful wide eyed dreams At such times Myles saw again the dark mystery of the castle chapel he saw again the half moon gleaming white and silvery through the tall narrow window and throwing a broad form of still whiteness across stone floor empty seats and still motionless figures of stone effigies At such times he stood again in front of the twinkling tapers that lit the altar where his armor lay piled in a heap heard again the deep breathing of his companions of the watch sleeping in some empty stall wrapped each in his cloak and saw the old chandler bestir himself and rise and come forward to snuff the candles At such times he saw again the day growing clearer and clearer through the tall glazed windows saw it change to a rosy pink and then to a broad ruddy glow that threw a halo of light around Father Thomas s bald head bowed in sleep and lit up the banners and trophies hanging motionless against the stony face of the west wall heard again the stirring of life without and the sound of his companions arousing themselves saw them come forward and heard them wish him joy that his long watch was ended It was nearly noon when Myles was awakened from a fitful sleep by Gascoyne bringing in his dinner but as might be supposed he had but little hunger and ate sparingly He had hardly ended his frugal meal before his two squires of honor came in followed by a servant carrying the garments for the coming ceremony He saluted them gravely and then arising washed his face and hands in a basin which Gascoyne held then kneeled in prayer the others standing silent at a little distance As he arose Lord George came forward The King and the company come presently to the Great Hall Myles said he it is needful for thee to make all the haste that thou art able Perhaps never had Devlen Castle seen a more brilliant and goodly company gathered in the great hall than that which came to witness King Henry create Myles Falworth a knight bachelor At the upper end of the hall was a raised dais upon which stood a throne covered with crimson satin and embroidered with lions and flower deluces it was the King s seat He and his personal attendants had not yet come but the rest of the company were gathered The day being warm and sultry the balcony was all aflutter with the feather fans of the ladies of the family and their attendants who from this high place looked down upon the hall below Up the centre of the hall was laid a carpet of arras and the passage was protected by wooden railings Upon the one side were tiers of seats for the castle gentlefolks and the guests Upon the other stood the burghers from the town clad in sober dun and russet and yeomanry in green and brown The whole of the great vaulted hall was full of the dull hum of many people waiting and a ceaseless restlessness stirred the crowded throng But at last a whisper went around that the King was coming A momentary hush fell and through it was heard the noisy clatter of horses feet coming nearer and nearer and then stopping before the door The sudden blare of trumpets broke through the hush another pause and then in through the great door way of the hall came the royal procession First of all marched in the order of their rank and to the number of a score or more certain gentlemen esquires and knights chosen mostly from the King s attendants Behind these came two pursuivants at arms in tabards and following them a party of a dozen more bannerets and barons Behind these again a little space intervening came two heralds also in tabards a group of the greater nobles attendant upon the King following in the order of their rank Next came the King at arms and at a little distance and walking with sober slowness the King himself with the Earl and the Count directly attendant upon him the one marching upon the right hand and the other upon the left A breathless silence filled the whole space as the royal procession advanced slowly up the hall Through the stillness could be heard the muffled sound of the footsteps on the carpet the dry rustling of silk and satin garments and the clear clink and jingle of chains and jewelled ornaments but not the sound of a single voice After the moment or two of bustle and confusion of the King taking his place had passed another little space of expectant silence fell At last there suddenly came the noise of acclamation of those who stood without the door cheering and the clapping of hands sounds heralding the immediate advent of Myles and his attendants The next moment the little party entered the hall First of all Gascoyne bearing Myles s sword in both hands the hilt resting against his breast the point elevated at an angle of forty five degrees It was sheathed in a crimson scabbard and the belt of Spanish leather studded with silver bosses was wound crosswise around it From the hilt of the sword dangled the gilt spurs of his coming knighthood At a little distance behind his squire followed Myles the centre of all observation He was clad in a novitiate dress arranged under Lord George s personal supervision It had been made somewhat differently from the fashion usual at such times and was intended to indicate in a manner the candidate s extreme youthfulness and virginity in arms The outer garment was a tabard robe of white wool embroidered at the hem with fine lines of silver and gathered loosely at the waist with a belt of lavender leather stitched with thread of silver Beneath he was clad in armor a present from the Earl new and polished till it shone with dazzling brightness the breastplate covered with a juppon of white satin embroidered with silver Behind Myles and upon either hand came his squires of honor sponsors and friends a little company of some half dozen in all As they advanced slowly up the great dim high vaulted room the whole multitude broke forth into a humming buzz of applause Then a sudden clapping of hands began near the door way ran down through the length of the room and was taken up by all with noisy clatter Saw I never youth so comely whispered one of the Lady Anne s attendant gentlewomen Sure he looketh as Sir Galahad looked when he came first to King Arthur s court Myles knew that he was very pale he felt rather than saw the restless crowd of faces upon either side for his eyes were fixed directly before him upon the dais whereon sat the King with the Earl of Mackworth standing at his right hand the Comte de Vermoise upon the left and the others ranged around and behind the throne It was with the same tense feeling of dreamy unreality that Myles walked slowly up the length of the hall measuring his steps by those of Gascoyne Suddenly he felt Lord George Beaumont touch him lightly upon the arm and almost instinctively he stopped short he was standing just before the covered steps of the throne He saw Gascoyne mount to the third step stop short kneel and offer the sword and the spurs he carried to the King who took the weapon and laid it across his knees Then the squire bowed low and walking backward withdrew to one side leaving Myles standing alone facing the throne The King unlocked the spur chains from the sword hilt and then holding the gilt spurs in his hand for a moment he looked Myles straight in the eyes and smiled Then he turned and gave one of the spurs to the Earl of Mackworth The Earl took it with a low bow turned and came slowly down the steps to where Myles stood Kneeling upon one knee and placing Myles s foot upon the other Lord Mackworth set the spur in its place and latched the chain over the instep He drew the sign of the cross upon Myles s bended knee set the foot back upon the ground rose with slow dignity and bowing to the King drew a little to one side As soon as the Earl had fulfilled his office the King gave the second spur to the Comte de Vermoise who set it to Myles s other foot with the same ceremony that the Earl had observed withdrawing as he had done to one side An instant pause of motionless silence followed and then the King slowly arose and began deliberately to unwind the belt from around the scabbard of the sword he held As soon as he stood the Earl and the Count advanced and taking Myles by either hand led him forward and up the steps of the dais to the platform above As they drew a little to one side the King stooped and buckled the sword belt around Myles s waist then rising again lifted his hand and struck him upon the shoulder crying in a loud voice Be thou a good knight Instantly a loud sound of applause and the clapping of hands filled the whole hall in the midst of which the King laid both hands upon Myles s shoulders and kissed him upon the right cheek So the ceremony ended Myles was no longer Myles Falworth but Sir Myles Falworth Knight by Order of the Bath and by grace of the King CHAPTER twenty five It was the custom to conclude the ceremonies of the bestowal of knighthood by a grand feast given in honor of the newly created knight But in Myles s instance the feast was dispensed with The Earl of Mackworth had planned that Myles might be created a Knight of the Bath with all possible pomp and ceremony that his personality might be most favorably impressed upon the King that he might be so honorably knighted as to make him the peer of any who wore spurs in all England and finally that he might celebrate his new honors by jousting with some knight of high fame and approved valor All these desiderata chance had fulfilled in the visit of the King to Devlen As the Earl had said to Myles he would rather have waited a little while longer until the lad was riper in years and experience but the opportunity was not to be lost Young as he was Myles must take his chances against the years and grim experience of the Sieur de la Montaigne But it was also a part of the Earl s purpose that the King and Myles should not be brought too intimately together just at that time Though every particular of circumstance should be fulfilled in the ceremony it would have been ruination to the Earl s plans to have the knowledge come prematurely to the King that Myles was the son of the attainted Lord Falworth The Earl knew that Myles was a shrewd coolheaded lad but the King had already hinted that the name was familiar to his ears and a single hasty answer or unguarded speech upon the young knight s part might awaken him to a full knowledge Such a mishap was of all things to be avoided just then for thanks to the machinations of that enemy of his father of whom Myles had heard so much and was soon to hear more the King had always retained and still held a bitter and rancorous enmity against the unfortunate nobleman It was no very difficult matter for the Earl to divert the King s attention from the matter of the feast His Majesty was very intent just then upon supplying a quota of troops to the Dauphin and the chief object of his visit to Devlen was to open negotiations with the Earl looking to that end He was interested much interested in Myles and in the coming jousting in which the young warrior was to prove himself but he was interested in it by way of a relaxation from the other and more engrossing matter So though he made some passing and half preoccupied inquiry about the feast he was easily satisfied with the Earl s reasons for not holding it which were that he had arranged a consultation for that morning in regard to the troops for the Dauphin to which meeting he had summoned a number of his own more important dependent nobles that the King himself needed repose and the hour or so of rest that his barber surgeon had ordered him to take after his mid day meal that Father Thomas had laid upon Myles a petty penance that for the first three days of his knighthood he should eat his meals without meat and in his own apartment and various other reasons equally good and sufficient So the King was satisfied and the feast was dispensed with The next morning had been set for the jousting and all that day the workmen were busy erecting the lists in the great quadrangle upon which as was said before looked the main buildings of the castle The windows of Myles s apartment opened directly upon the bustling scene the carpenters hammering and sawing the upholsterers snipping cutting and tacking Myles and Gascoyne stood gazing out from the open casement with their arms lying across one another s shoulders in the old boyhood fashion and Myles felt his heart shrink with a sudden tight pang as the realization came sharply and vividly upon him that all these preparations were being made for him and that the next day he should with almost the certainty of death meet either glory or failure under the eyes not only of all the greater and lesser castle folk but of the King himself and noble strangers critically used to deeds of chivalry and prowess Perhaps he had never fully realized the magnitude of the reality before In that tight pang at his heart he drew a deep breath almost a sigh Gascoyne turned his head abruptly and looked at his friend but he did not ask the cause of the sigh No doubt the same thoughts that were in Myles s mind were in his also It was towards the latter part of the afternoon that a message came from the Earl bidding Myles attend him in his private closet After Myles had bowed and kissed his lordship s hand the Earl motioned him to take a seat telling him that he had some final words to say that might occupy a considerable time He talked to the young man for about half an hour in his quiet measured voice only now and then showing a little agitation by rising and walking up and down the room for a turn or two Very many things were disclosed in that talk that had caused Myles long hours of brooding thought for the Earl spoke freely and without concealment to him concerning his father and the fortunes of the house of Falworth Myles had surmised many things but it was not until then that he knew for a certainty who was his father s malignant and powerful enemy that it was the great Earl of Alban the rival and bitter enemy of the Earl of Mackworth It was not until then that he knew that the present Earl of Alban was the Lord Brookhurst who had killed Sir John Dale in the anteroom at Falworth Castle that morning so long ago in his early childhood It was not until then that he knew all the circumstances of his father s blindness that he had been overthrown in the melee at the great tournament at York and that that same Lord Brookhurst had ridden his iron shod war horse twice over his enemy s prostrate body before his squire could draw him from the press and had then and there given him the wound from which he afterwards went blind The Earl swore to Myles that Lord Brookhurst had done what he did wilfully and had afterwards boasted of it Then with some hesitation he told Myles the reason of Lord Brookhurst s enmity and that it had arisen on account of Lady Falworth whom he had one time sought in marriage and that he had sworn vengeance against the man who had won her Piece by piece the Earl of Mackworth recounted every circumstance and detail of the revenge that the blind man s enemy had afterwards wreaked upon him He told Myles how when his father was attainted of high treason and his estates forfeited to the crown the King had granted the barony of Easterbridge to the then newly created Earl of Alban in spite of all the efforts of Lord Falworth s friends to the contrary that when he himself had come out from an audience with the King with others of his father s friends the Earl of Alban had boasted in the anteroom in a loud voice evidently intended for them all to hear that now that he had Falworth s fat lands he would never rest till he had hunted the blind man out from his hiding and brought his head to the block Ever since then said the Earl of Mackworth he hath been striving by every means to discover thy father s place of concealment Some time haply he may find it and then Myles had felt for a long time that he was being moulded and shaped and that the Earl of Mackworth s was the hand that was making him what he was growing to be but he had never realized how great were the things expected of him should he pass the first great test and show himself what his friends hoped to see him Now he knew that all were looking upon him to act sometime as his father s champion and when that time should come to challenge the Earl of Alban to the ordeal of single combat to purge his father s name of treason to restore him to his rank and to set the house of Falworth where it stood before misfortune fell upon it But it was not alone concerning his and his father s affairs that the Earl of Mackworth talked to Myles He told him that the Earl of Alban was the Earl of Mackworth s enemy also that in his younger days he had helped Lord Falworth who was his kinsman to win his wife and that then Lord Brookhurst had sworn to compass his ruin as he had sworn to compass the ruin of his friend He told Myles how now that Lord Brookhurst was grown to be Earl of Alban and great and powerful he was forever plotting against him and showed Myles how if Lord Falworth were discovered and arrested for treason he also would be likely to suffer for aiding and abetting him Then it dawned upon Myles that the Earl looked to him to champion the house of Beaumont as well as that of Falworth Mayhap said the Earl thou didst think that it was all for the pleasant sport of the matter that I have taken upon me this toil and endeavor to have thee knighted with honor that thou mightst fight the Dauphiny knight Nay nay Myles Falworth I have not labored so hard for such a small matter as that I have had the King unknown to himself so knight thee that thou mayst be the peer of Alban himself and now I would have thee to hold thine own with the Sieur de la Montaigne to try whether thou be saint Alban s match and to approve thyself worthy of the honor of thy knighthood I am sorry ne theless he added after a moment s pause that this could not have been put off for a while longer for my plans for bringing thee to battle with that vile Alban are not yet ripe But such a chance of the King coming hither haps not often And then I am glad of this much that a good occasion offers to get thee presently away from England I would have thee out of the King s sight so soon as may be after this jousting He taketh a liking to thee and I fear me lest he should inquire more nearly concerning thee and so all be discovered and spoiled My brother George goeth upon the first of next month to France to take service with the Dauphin having under his command a company of tenscore men knights and archers thou shalt go with him and there stay till I send for thee to return With this the protracted interview concluded the Earl charging Myles to say nothing further about the French expedition for the present even to his friend for it was as yet a matter of secrecy known only to the King and a few nobles closely concerned in the venture Then Myles arose to take his leave He asked and obtained permission for Gascoyne to accompany him to France Then he paused for a moment or two for it was strongly upon him to speak of a matter that had been lying in his mind all day a matter that he had dreamed of much with open eyes during the long vigil of the night before The Earl looked up inquiringly What is it thou wouldst ask said he Myles s heart was beating quickly within him at the thought of his own boldness and as he spoke his cheeks burned like fire Sir said he mustering his courage at last haply thou hast forgot it but I have not ne theless a long time since when I spoke of serving the the Lady Alice as her true knight thou didst wisely laugh at my words and bade me wait first till I had earned my spurs But now sir I have gotten my spurs and and do now crave thy gracious leave that I may serve that lady as her true knight A space of dead silence fell in which Myles s heart beat tumultuously within him I know not what thou meanest said the Earl at last in a somewhat constrained voice How wouldst thou serve her What wouldst thou have I would have only a little matter just now answered Myles I would but crave of her a favor for to wear in the morrow s battle so that she may know that I hold her for my own true lady and that I may have the courage to fight more boldly having that favor to defend The Earl sat looking at him for a while in brooding silence stroking his beard the while Suddenly his brow cleared So be it said he I grant thee my leave to ask the Lady Alice for a favor and if she is pleased to give it to thee I shall not say thee nay But I set this upon thee as a provision that thou shalt not see her without the Lady Anne be present Thus it was as I remember thou saw her first and with it thou must now be satisfied Go thou to the Long Gallery and thither they will come anon if naught hinder them Myles waited in the Long Gallery perhaps some fifteen or twenty minutes No one was there but himself It was a part of the castle connecting the Earl s and the Countess s apartments and was used but little During that time he stood looking absently out of the open casement into the stony court yard beyond trying to put into words that which he had to say wondering with anxiety how soon the young ladies would come wondering whether they would come at all At last the door at the farther end of the gallery opened and turning sharply at the sound he saw the two young ladies enter Lady Alice leaning upon Lady Anne s arm It was the first time that he had seen them since the ceremony of the morning and as he advanced to meet them the Lady Anne came frankly forward and gave him her hand which Myles raised to his lips I give thee joy of thy knighthood Sir Myles said she and do believe in good sooth that if any one deserveth such an honor thou art he At first little Lady Alice hung back behind her cousin saying nothing until the Lady Anne turning suddenly said Come coz has thou naught to say to our new made knight Canst thou not also wish him joy of his knighthood Lady Alice hesitated a minute then gave Myles a timid hand which he with a strange mixture of joy and confusion took as timidly as it was offered He raised the hand and set it lightly and for an instant to his lips as he had done with the Lady Anne s hand but with very different emotions I give you joy of your knighthood sir said Lady Alice in a voice so low that Myles could hardly hear it Both flushed red and as he raised his head again Myles saw that the Lady Anne had withdrawn to one side Then he knew that it was to give him the opportunity to proffer his request A little space of silence followed the while he strove to key his courage to the saying of that which lay at his mind Lady said he at last and then again Lady I have a favor for to ask thee What is it thou wouldst have Sir Myles she murmured in reply Lady said he ever sin I first saw thee I have thought that if I might choose of all the world thou only wouldst I choose for for my true lady to serve as a right knight should Here he stopped frightened at his own boldness Lady Alice stood quite still with her face turned away Thou thou art not angered at what I say he said She shook her head I have longed and longed for the time said he to ask a boon of thee and now hath that time come Lady to morrow I go to meet a right good knight and one skilled in arms and in jousting as thou dost know Yea he is famous in arms and I be nobody Ne theless I fight for the honor of England and Mackworth and and for thy sake I Thou art not angered at what I say Again the Lady Alice shook her head I would that thou I would that thou would give me some favor for to wear thy veil or thy necklace He waited anxiously for a little while but Lady Alice did not answer immediately I fear me said Myles presently that I have in sooth offended thee in asking this thing I know that it is a parlous bold matter for one so raw in chivalry and in courtliness as I am and one so poor in rank to ask thee for thy favor An I ha offended I prithee let it be as though I had not asked it Perhaps it was the young man s timidity that brought a sudden courage to Lady Alice perhaps it was the graciousness of her gentle breeding that urged her to relieve Myles s somewhat awkward humility perhaps it was something more than either that lent her bravery to speak even knowing that the Lady Anne heard all She turned quickly to him Nay Sir Myles she said I am foolish and do wrong thee by my foolishness and silence for truly I am proud to have thee wear my favor She unclasped as she spoke the thin gold chain from about her neck I give thee this chain said she and it will bring me joy to have it honored by thy true knightliness and giving it I do wish thee all success Then she bowed her head and turning left him holding the necklace in his hand Her cousin left the window to meet her bowing her head with a smile to Myles as she took her cousin s arm again and led her away He stood looking after them as they left the room and when they were gone he raised the necklace to his lips with a heart beating tumultuously with a triumphant joy it had never felt before CHAPTER twenty six And now at last had come the day of days for Myles Falworth the day when he was to put to the test all that he had acquired in the three years of his training the day that was to disclose what promise of future greatness there was in his strong young body And it was a noble day one of those of late September when the air seems sweeter and fresher than at other times the sun bright and as yellow as gold the wind lusty and strong before which the great white clouds go sailing majestically across the bright blueness of the sky above while their dusky shadows skim across the brown face of the rusty earth beneath As was said before the lists had been set up in the great quadrangle of the castle than which level and smooth as a floor no more fitting place could be chosen The course was of the usual size sixty paces long and separated along its whole length by a barrier about five feet high Upon the west side of the course and about twenty paces distant from it a scaffolding had been built facing towards the east so as to avoid the glare of the afternoon sun In the centre was a raised dais hung round with cloth of blue embroidered with lions rampant Upon the dais stood a cushioned throne for the King and upon the steps below ranged in the order of their dignity were seats for the Earl his guests the family the ladies knights and gentlemen of the castle In front the scaffolding was covered with the gayest tapestries and brightest colored hangings that the castle could afford And above parti colored pennants and streamers surmounted by the royal ensign of England waved and fluttered in the brisk wind At either end of the lists stood the pavilions of the knights That of Myles was at the southern extremity and was hung by the Earl s desire with cloth of the Beaumont colors black and yellow while a wooden shield bearing three goshawks spread the crest of the house was nailed to the roof and a long streamer of black and yellow trailed out in the wind from the staff above Myles partly armed stood at the door way of the pavilion watching the folk gathering at the scaffolding The ladies of the house were already seated and the ushers were bustling hither and thither assigning the others their places A considerable crowd of common folk and burghers from the town had already gathered at the barriers opposite and as he looked at the restless and growing multitude he felt his heart beat quickly and his flesh grow cold with a nervous trepidation just such as the lad of to day feels when he sees the auditorium filling with friends and strangers who are to listen by and by to the reading of his prize poem Suddenly there came a loud blast of trumpets A great gate at the farther extremity of the lists was thrown open and the King appeared riding upon a white horse preceded by the King at arms and the heralds attended by the Earl and the Comte de Vermoise and followed by a crowd of attendants Just then Gascoyne who with Wilkes was busied lacing some of the armor plates with new thongs called Myles and he turned and entered the pavilion As the two squires were adjusting these last pieces strapping them in place and tying the thongs Lord George and Sir James Lee entered the pavilion Lord George took the young man by the hand and with a pleasant smile wished him success in the coming encounter Sir James seemed anxious and disturbed He said nothing and after Gascoyne had placed the open bascinet that supports the tilting helm in its place he came forward and examined the armor piece by piece carefully and critically testing the various straps and leather points and thongs to make sure of their strength Sir said Gascoyne who stood by watching him anxiously I do trust that I have done all meetly and well I see nothing amiss sirrah said the old knight half grudgingly So far as I may know he is ready to mount Just then a messenger entered saying that the King was seated and Lord George bade Myles make haste to meet the challenger Francis said Myles prithee give me my pouch yonder Gascoyne handed him the velvet bag and he opened it and took out the necklace that the Lady Alice had given him the day before Tie me this around my arm said he He looked down keeping his eyes studiously fixed on Gascoyne s fingers as they twined the thin golden chain around the iron plates of his right arm knowing that Lord George s eyes were upon him and blushing fiery red at the knowledge Sir James was at that moment examining the great tilting helm and Lord George watched him smiling amusedly And hast thou then already chosen thee a lady he said presently Aye my Lord answered Myles simply Marry I trust we be so honored that she is one of our castle folk said the Earl s brother For a moment Myles did not reply then he looked up My Lord said he the favor was given to me by the Lady Alice Lord George looked grave for the moment then he laughed Marry thou art a bold archer to shoot for such high game Myles did not answer and at that moment two grooms led his horse up to the door of the pavilion Gascoyne and Wilkes helped him to his saddle and then Gascoyne holding his horse by the bridle rein he rode slowly across the lists to the little open space in front of the scaffolding and the King s seat just as the Sieur de la Montaigne approached from the opposite direction As soon as the two knights champion had reached each his appointed station in front of the scaffolding the Marshal bade the speaker read the challenge which unrolling the parchment he began to do in a loud clear voice so that all might hear It was a quaint document wrapped up in the tangled heraldic verbiage of the time The pith of the matter was that the Sieur Brian Philip Francis de la Montaigne proclaimed before all men the greater chivalry and skill at arms of the knights of France and of Dauphiny and likewise the greater fairness of the ladies of France and Dauphiny and would there defend those sayings with his body without fear or attaint as to the truth of the same As soon as the speaker had ended the Marshal bade him call the defendant of the other side Then Myles spoke his part with a voice trembling somewhat with the excitement of the moment but loudly and clearly enough I Myles Edward Falworth knight so created by the hand and by the grace of his Majesty King Henry IV of England do take upon me the gage of this battle and will defend with my body the chivalry of the knights of England and the fairness of the ladies thereof Then after the speaker ended his proclamation and had retired to his place the ceremony of claiming and redeeming the helmet to which all young knights were subjected upon first entering the lists was performed One of the heralds cried in a loud voice I Gilles Hamerton herald to the most noble Clarencieux King at arms do claim the helm of Sir Myles Edward Falworth by this reason that he hath never yet entered joust or tourney To which Myles answered I do acknowledge the right of that claim and herewith proffer thee in ransom for the same this purse of one hundred marks in gold As he spoke Gascoyne stepped forward and delivered the purse with the money to the Herald It was a more than usually considerable ransom and had been made up by the Earl and Lord George that morning Right nobly hast thou redeemed thy helm said the Herald and hereafter be thou free to enter any jousting whatsoever and in whatever place So all being ended both knights bowed to the King and then escorted each by his squire returned to his pavilion saluted by the spectators with a loud clapping of hands Sir James Lee met Myles in front of his tent Coming up to the side of the horse the old man laid his hand upon the saddle looking up into the young man s face Thou wilt not fail in this venture and bring shame upon me said he Nay my dear master said Myles I will do my best I doubt it not said the old man and I believe me thou wilt come off right well From what he did say this morning methinks the Sieur de la Montaigne meaneth only to break three lances with thee and will content himself therewith without seeking to unhorse thee Ne theless be thou bold and watchful and if thou find that he endeavor to cast thee do thy best to unhorse him Remember also those things which I have told thee ten thousand times before hold thy toes well down and grip the stirrup hard more especially at the moment of meeting bend thy body forward and keep thine elbow close to thy side Bear thy lance point one foot above thine adversary s helm until within two lengths of meeting and strike thou in the very middle of his shield So Myles thou mayst hold thine own and come off with glory As he ended speaking he drew back and Gascoyne mounting upon a stool covered his friend s head and bascinet with the great jousting helm making fast the leathern points that held it to the iron collar As he was tying the last thong a messenger came from the Herald saying that the challenger was ready and then Myles knew the time had come and reaching down and giving Sir James a grip of the hand he drew on his gauntlet took the jousting lance that Wilkes handed him and turned his horse s head towards his end of the lists CHAPTER twenty seven 
2275-150140-0000	train-other-500	As Myles took his place at the south end of the lists he found the Sieur de la Montaigne already at his station Through the peep hole in the face of the huge helmet a transverse slit known as the occularium he could see like a strange narrow picture

2275-150140-0005	train-other-500	and the next moment a bugle sounded loud and clear In one blinding rush he drove his spurs into the sides of his horse and in instant answer felt the noble steed spring forward with a bound Through all the clashing of his armor reverberating in the hollow depths of his helmet
2275-150140-0006	train-other-500	he saw the mail clad figure from the other end of the lists rushing towards him looming larger and larger as they came together
none	none	 He gripped his saddle with his knees clutched the stirrup with the soles of his feet 
2275-150140-0007	train-other-500	and bent his body still more forward In the instant of meeting with almost the blindness of instinct he dropped the point of his spear against the single red flower de luce in the middle of the on coming shield There was a thunderous crash
2275-150140-0008	train-other-500	that seemed to rack every joint he heard the crackle of splintered wood
none	none	 he felt the momentary trembling recoil of the horse beneath him and in the next instant had passed by As he checked the onward rush of his horse 
2275-150140-0009	train-other-500	at the far end of the course he heard faintly in the dim hollow recess of the helm
none	none	 the loud shout and the clapping of hands of those who looked on 
2275-150140-0010	train-other-500	and found himself gripping with nervous intensity the butt of a broken spear
none	none	 his mouth clammy with excitement and his heart thumping in his throat Then he realized that he had met his opponent and had borne the meeting well 
2275-150140-0011	train-other-500	As he turned his horse s head towards his own end of the lists he saw the other trotting slowly back towards his station also holding a broken spear shaft in his hand As he passed the iron figure a voice issued from the helmet
none	none	 Well done Sir Myles nobly done and his heart bounded in answer to the words of praise 
2275-150140-0012	train-other-500	When he had reached his own end of the lists he flung away his broken spear and Gascoyne came forward with another Oh Myles he said with sob in his voice it was nobly done
none	none	 Never did I see a better ridden course in all my life I did not believe that thou couldst do half so well 
2275-150140-0013	train-other-500	Oh Myles prithee knock him out of his saddle an thou lovest me
none	none	 Myles in his high keyed nervousness could not forbear a short hysterical laugh at his friend s warmth of enthusiasm He took the fresh lance in his hand and then seeing that his opponent was walking his horse slowly up and down at his end of the lists 
2275-150140-0014	train-other-500	did the same during the little time of rest before the next encounter When in answer to the command of the Marshal he took his place a second time he found himself calmer and more collected than before
none	none	 but every faculty no less intensely fixed than it had been at first 
2275-150140-0015	train-other-500	Once more the Marshal raised his baton once more the horn sounded and once more the two rushed together with the same thunderous crash the same splinter of broken spears the same momentary trembling recoil of the horse and the same onward rush past one another
2275-150140-0016	train-other-500	Once more the spectators applauded and shouted as the two knights turned their horses and rode back towards their station This time as they met midway the Sieur de la Montaigne reined in his horse Sir Myles said his muffled voice I swear to thee by my faith
none	none	 I had not thought to meet in thee such an opponent as thou dost prove thyself to be 
2275-150140-0017	train-other-500	I had thought to find in thee a raw boy but find instead a Paladin Hitherto I have given thee grace as I would give grace to any mere lad and thought of nothing but to give thee opportunity to break thy lance
2275-150140-0018	train-other-500	Now I shall do my endeavor to unhorse thee as I would an acknowledged peer in arms Nevertheless on account of thy youth I give thee this warning so that thou mayst hold thyself in readiness I give thee gramercy for thy courtesy my Lord answered Myles speaking in French
2275-150140-0019	train-other-500	and I will strive to encounter thee as best I may and pardon me if I seem forward in so saying but were I in thy place my Lord I would change me yon breast piece and over girth of my saddle they are sprung in the stitches Nay
none	none	 said the Sieur de la Montaigne laughing 
2275-150140-0020	train-other-500	breast piece and over girth have carried me through more tilts than one and shall through this An thou give me a blow so true as to burst breast piece and over girth I will own myself fairly conquered by thee So saying
none	none	 he saluted Myles with the butt of the spear he still held 
2275-150140-0021	train-other-500	and passed by to his end of the lists
none	none	 Myles with Gascoyne running beside him rode across to his pavilion and called to Edmund Wilkes to bring him a cup of spiced wine 
2275-150140-0022	train-other-500	After Gascoyne had taken off his helmet and as he sat wiping the perspiration from his face Sir James came up and took him by the hand My dear boy said he gripping the hand he held never could I hope to be so overjoyed in mine old age as I am this day
2275-150140-0023	train-other-500	Thou dost bring honor to me for I tell thee truly thou dost ride like a knight seasoned in twenty tourneys
none	none	 It doth give me tenfold courage to hear thee so say dear master 
2275-150140-0024	train-other-500	answered Myles And truly he added I shall need all my courage this bout for the Sieur de la Montaigne telleth me that he will ride to unhorse me this time Did he indeed so say said Sir James
2275-150140-0025	train-other-500	Then belike he meaneth to strike at thy helm Thy best chance is to strike also at his Doth thy hand tremble Not now answered Myles Then keep thy head cool and thine eye true Set thy trust in God and haply
2275-150140-0026	train-other-500	thou wilt come out of this bout honorably in spite of the rawness of thy youth Just then Edmund Wilkes presented the cup of wine to Myles who drank it off at a draught and thereupon Gascoyne replaced the helm and tied the thongs
none	none	 The charge that Sir James Lee had given to Myles to strike at his adversary s helm was a piece of advice he probably would not have given to so young a knight excepting as a last resort A blow perfectly delivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the recipient to recover from 
2275-150140-0027	train-other-500	but then a blow upon the helm was not one time in fifty perfectly given The huge cylindrical tilting helm was so constructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one point That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron bands
2275-150140-0028	train-other-500	welded to the steel face plates of the helm
none	none	 where it was weakened by the opening slit of the occularium or peephole In the very centre of this cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted together and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given to be perfect 
2275-150140-0029	train-other-500	and that stroke Myles determined to attempt As he took his station Edmund Wilkes came running across from the pavilion with a lance that Sir James had chosen and Myles returning the one that Gascoyne had just given him took it in his hand
2275-150140-0030	train-other-500	It was of seasoned oak somewhat thicker than the other a tough weapon
none	none	 not easily to be broken even in such an encounter as he was like to have He balanced the weapon 
2275-150140-0031	train-other-500	and found that it fitted perfectly to his grasp As he raised the point to rest his opponent took his station at the farther extremity of the lists and again there was a little space of breathless pause
none	none	 Myles was surprised at his own coolness 
2275-150140-0032	train-other-500	every nervous tremor was gone Before he had been conscious of the critical multitude looking down upon him now it was a conflict of man to man and such a conflict had no terrors for his young heart of iron
2275-150140-0033	train-other-500	The spectators had somehow come to the knowledge that this was to be a more serious encounter than the two which had preceded it and a breathless silence fell for the moment or two that the knights stood in place Once more he breathed a short prayer Holy Mary guard me
2275-150140-0034	train-other-500	Then again for the third time the Marshal raised his baton and the horn sounded and for the third time Myles drove his spurs into his horse s flanks Again he saw the iron figure of his opponent rushing nearer nearer nearer He centred with a straining intensity
2275-150140-0035	train-other-500	every faculty of soul mind and body upon one point the cross of the occularium the mark he was to strike He braced himself for the tremendous shock which he knew must meet him
none	none	 and then in a flash dropped lance point straight and true 
2275-150140-0036	train-other-500	The next instant there was a deafening stunning crash
none	none	 a crash like the stroke of a thunder bolt There was a dazzling blaze of blinding light 
2275-150140-0037	train-other-500	and a myriad sparks danced and flickered and sparkled before his eyes He felt his horse stagger under him with the recoil and hardly knowing what he did he drove his spurs deep into its sides with a shout
none	none	 At the same moment there resounded in his ears a crashing rattle and clatter 
2275-150140-0038	train-other-500	he knew not of what and then as his horse recovered and sprang forward
none	none	 and as the stunning bewilderment passed he found that his helmet had been struck off 
2275-150140-0039	train-other-500	He heard a great shout arise from all
none	none	 and thought with a sickening bitter disappointment that it was because he had lost 
2275-150140-0040	train-other-500	At the farther end of the course he turned his horse and then his heart gave a leap and a bound as though it would burst the blood leaped to his cheeks tingling and his bosom thrilled with an almost agonizing pang of triumph of wonder of amazement
none	none	 There in a tangle of his horse s harness and of embroidered trappings the Sieur de la Montaigne lay stretched upon the ground with his saddle near by 
2275-150140-0041	train-other-500	and his riderless horse was trotting aimlessly about at the farther end of the lists Myles saw the two squires of the fallen knight run across to where their master lay he saw the ladies waving their kerchiefs and veils
none	none	 and the castle people swinging their hats and shouting in an ecstasy of delight Then he rode slowly back to where the squires 
2275-150140-0042	train-other-500	were now aiding the fallen knight to arise The senior squire drew his dagger cut the leather points and drew off the helm disclosing the knight s face a face white as death
none	none	 and convulsed with rage mortification and bitter humiliation I was not rightly unhorsed he cried hoarsely and with livid lips to the Marshal and his attendants who had ridden up I unhelmed him fairly enough but my over girth and breast strap burst and my saddle slipped I was not unhorsed I say and I lay claim that I unhelmed him Sir 
2275-150140-0043	train-other-500	said the Marshal calmly and speaking in French surely thou knowest that the loss of helmet does not decide an encounter I need not remind thee my Lord
none	none	 that it was so awarded by John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster 
2275-150140-0044	train-other-500	when in the jousting match between Reynand de Roye and John de Holland the Sieur Reynand left every point of his helm loosened so that the helm was beaten off at each stroke If he then was justified in doing so of his own choice and wilfully suffering to be unhelmed
2275-150140-0045	train-other-500	how then can this knight be accused of evil who suffered it by chance Nevertheless
none	none	 said the Sieur de la Montaigne in the same hoarse breathless voice 
2275-150140-0046	train-other-500	I do affirm and will make my affirmation good with my body that I fell only by the breaking of my girth Who says otherwise lies It is the truth he speaketh said Myles I myself saw the stitches
2275-150140-0047	train-other-500	were some little what burst and warned him thereof before we ran this course
none	none	 Sir said the Marshal to the Sieur de la Montaigne how can you now complain of that thing 
2275-150140-0048	train-other-500	which your own enemy advised you of and warned you against Was it not right knightly for him so to do The Sieur de la Montaigne stood quite still for a little while leaning on the shoulder of his chief squire looking moodily upon the ground
2275-150140-0049	train-other-500	then without making answer he turned and walked slowly away to his pavilion still leaning on his squire s shoulder
none	none	 whilst the other attendant followed behind 
2275-150140-0050	train-other-500	bearing his shield and helmet Gascoyne had picked up Myles s fallen helmet as the Sieur de la Montaigne moved away and Lord George and Sir James Lee
none	none	 came walking across the lists to where Myles still sat Then the one taking his horse by the bridle rein 
2275-150140-0051	train-other-500	and the other walking beside the saddle
none	none	 they led him before the raised dais where the King sat Even the Comte de Vermoise mortified and amazed as he must have been at the overthrow of his best knight 
2275-150140-0052	train-other-500	joined in the praise and congratulation that poured upon the young conqueror Myles his heart swelling with a passion of triumphant delight looked up and met the gaze of Lady Alice fixed intently upon him A red spot of excitement still burned in either cheek
2275-150140-0053	train-other-500	and it flamed to a rosier red as he bowed his head to her before turning away Gascoyne had just removed Myles s breastplate and gorget when Sir James Lee burst into the pavilion All his grim coldness was gone
none	none	 and he flung his arms around the young man s neck hugging him heartily 
2275-150140-0054	train-other-500	and kissing him upon either cheek Ere he let him go Mine own dear boy he said holding him off at arm s length and winking his one keen eye rapidly
none	none	 as though to wink away a dampness of which he was ashamed 
2275-150140-0055	train-other-500	mine own dear boy I do tell thee truly this is as sweet to me as though thou wert mine own son sweeter to me than when I first broke mine own lance in triumph and felt myself to be a right knight Sir answered Myles
2275-150140-0056	train-other-500	what thou sayest doth rejoice my very heart
none	none	 Ne theless it is but just to say that both his breast piece and over girth were burst in the stitches 
2275-150140-0057	train-other-500	before he ran his course for so I saw with mine own eyes Burst in the stitches snorted Sir James Thinkest thou he did not know in what condition was his horse s gearing
none	none	 I tell thee he went down because thou didst strike fair and true and he did not so strike thee Had he been Guy of Warwick he had gone down all the same under such a stroke and in such case CHAPTER twenty eight It was not until more than three weeks after the King had left Devlen Castle that Lord George and his company of knights and archers were ready for the expedition to France Two weeks of that time Myles spent at Crosbey Dale with his father and mother It was the first time that he had seen them since four years ago 
2275-150141-0000	train-other-500	he had quitted the low narrow white walled farmhouse for the castle of the great Earl of Mackworth He had never appreciated before how low and narrow and poor the farm house was Now with his eyes trained to the bigness of Devlen Castle
2275-150141-0001	train-other-500	he looked around him with wonder and pity at his father s humble surroundings He realized as he never else could have realized
none	none	 how great was the fall in fortune that had cast the house of Falworth down from its rightful station to such a level as that upon which it now rested And at the same time that he thus recognized how poor was their lot how dependent upon the charity of others 
2275-150141-0002	train-other-500	he also recognized how generous was the friendship of Prior Edward who perilled his own safety so greatly in affording the family
none	none	 of the attainted Lord an asylum in its bitter hour of need and peril 
2275-150141-0003	train-other-500	Myles paid many visits to the gentle old priest during those two weeks visit and had many long and serious talks with him One warm bright afternoon
none	none	 as he and the old man walked together in the priory garden 
2275-150141-0004	train-other-500	after a game or two of draughts the young knight talked more freely and openly of his plans his hopes his ambitions than perhaps he had ever done
none	none	 He told the old man all that the Earl had disclosed to him 
2275-150141-0005	train-other-500	concerning the fallen fortunes of his father s house and of how all who knew those circumstances looked to him to set the family in its old place once more Prior Edward added many things to those which Myles already knew things of which the Earl either did not know or did not choose to speak
none	none	 He told the young man 
2275-150141-0006	train-other-500	among other matters the reason of the bitter and lasting enmity that the King felt for the blind nobleman that Lord Falworth had been one of King Richard s council in times past that it was not a little owing to him that King Henry when Earl of Derby had been banished from England
2275-150141-0007	train-other-500	and that though he was then living in the retirement of private life he bitterly and steadfastly opposed King Richard s abdication
none	none	 He told Myles that at the time when Sir John Dale found shelter at Falworth Castle 
2275-150141-0008	train-other-500	vengeance was ready to fall upon his father at any moment and it needed only such a pretext as that of sheltering so prominent a conspirator as Sir John to complete his ruin
none	none	 Myles as he listened intently could not but confess in his own mind that the King had many rational perhaps just grounds for grievance against such an ardent opponent as the blind Lord had shown himself to be 
2275-150141-0009	train-other-500	But sir said he after a little space of silence
none	none	 when Prior Edward had ended 
2275-150141-0010	train-other-500	to hold enmity and to breed treason are very different matters Haply my father was Bolingbroke s enemy but sure thou dost not believe he is justly and rightfully tainted with treason Nay answered the priest how canst thou ask me such a thing
2275-150141-0011	train-other-500	Did I believe thy father a traitor thinkest thou I would thus tell his son thereof Nay Myles
none	none	 I do know thy father well and have known him for many years and this of him 
2275-150141-0012	train-other-500	that few men are so honorable in heart and soul as he But I have told thee all these things to show that the King is not without some reason to be thy father s unfriend Neither haply is the Earl of Alban without cause of enmity against him
2275-150141-0013	train-other-500	So thou upon thy part shouldst not feel bitter rancor against the King
none	none	 for what hath happed to thy house 
2275-150141-0014	train-other-500	nor even against William Brookhurst I mean the Earl of Alban for I tell thee the worst of our enemies and the worst of men believe themselves always to have right and justice upon their side even when they most wish evil to others
2275-150141-0015	train-other-500	So spoke the gentle old priest who looked from his peaceful haven with dreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the world s battle Had he instead been in the thick of the fight it might have been harder for him to believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side
2275-150141-0016	train-other-500	But tell me this said Myles presently dost thou then think
none	none	 that I do evil in seeking to do a battle of life or death with this wicked Earl of Alban 
2275-150141-0017	train-other-500	who hath so ruined my father in body and fortune Nay said Prior Edward thoughtfully
none	none	 I say not that thou doest evil 
2275-150141-0018	train-other-500	War and bloodshed seem hard and cruel matters to me but God hath given that they be in the world and may He forbid that such a poor worm as I should say that they be all wrong and evil
2275-150141-0019	train-other-500	Meseems even an evil thing is sometimes passing good when rightfully used Myles did not fully understand what the old man meant but this much he gathered that his spiritual father did not think ill of his fighting the Earl of Alban for his temporal father s sake
2275-150141-0020	train-other-500	So Myles went to France in Lord George s company a soldier of fortune as his Captain was He was there for only six months but those six months wrought a great change in his life In the fierce factional battles that raged around the walls of Paris
2275-150141-0021	train-other-500	in the evil life which he saw at the Burgundian court in Paris itself after the truce a court brilliant and wicked witty and cruel
none	none	 the wonderful liquor of youth had evaporated rapidly and his character 
2275-150141-0022	train-other-500	had crystallized as rapidly into the hardness of manhood The warfare
none	none	 the blood the evil pleasures which he had seen had been a fiery crucible test to his soul 
2275-150141-0023	train-other-500	and I love my hero that he should have come forth from it so well He was no longer the innocent Sir Galahad who had walked in pure white up the Long Hall to be knighted by the King but his soul was of that grim sterling rugged sort
2275-150141-0024	train-other-500	that looked out calmly from his gray eyes upon the wickedness and debauchery around him and loved it not Then one day a courier came bringing a packet It was a letter from the Earl bidding Myles return straightway to England and to Mackworth House upon the Strand nigh to London without delay
none	none	 and Myles knew that his time had come It was a bright day in April when he and Gascoyne rode clattering out through Temple Bar 
2275-150141-0025	train-other-500	leaving behind them quaint old London town its blank stone wall its crooked dirty streets its high gabled wooden houses over which rose the sharp spire of saint Paul s towering high into the golden air Before them stretched the straight broad highway of the Strand
2275-150141-0026	train-other-500	on one side the great houses and palaces of princely priests and powerful nobles on the other the Covent Garden or the Convent Garden as it was then called and the rolling country where great stone windmills swung their slow moving arms in the damp soft April breeze
none	none	 and away in the distance the Scottish Palace the White Hall and Westminster It was the first time that Myles had seen famous London town 
2275-150141-0027	train-other-500	In that dim and distant time of his boyhood six months before
none	none	 he would have been wild with delight and enthusiasm 
2275-150141-0028	train-other-500	Now he jogged along with Gascoyne
none	none	 gazing about him with calm interest at open shops and booths and tall 
2275-150141-0029	train-other-500	gabled houses at the busy throng of merchants and craftsmen jostling and elbowing one another at townsfolk men and dames picking their way along the muddy kennel of a sidewalk
none	none	 He had seen so much of the world that he had lost somewhat of interest in new things 
2275-150141-0030	train-other-500	So he did not care to tarry but rode with a mind heavy with graver matters
none	none	 through the streets and out through the Temple Bar direct for Mackworth House near the Savoy Palace It was with a great deal of interest that Myles and his patron regarded one another 
2275-150141-0031	train-other-500	when they met for the first time after that half year which the young soldier had spent in France To Myles it seemed somehow very strange that his Lordship s familiar face and figure should look so exactly the same To Lord Mackworth perhaps
none	none	 it seemed even more strange that six short months should have wrought so great a change in the young man 
2275-150141-0032	train-other-500	The rugged exposure in camp and field during the hard winter
none	none	 that had passed had roughened the smooth bloom of his boyish complexion and bronzed his fair skin almost as much as a midsummer s sun could have done 
2275-150141-0033	train-other-500	His beard and mustache had grown again now heavier and more mannish from having been shaved and the white seam of a scar over the right temple gave
none	none	 if not a stern at least a determined look to the strong square jawed young face So the two stood for a while regarding one another 
2275-150141-0034	train-other-500	Myles was the first to break the silence My Lord said he thou didst send for me to come back to England behold here am I When didst thou land Sir Myles said the Earl I and my squire landed at Dover upon Tuesday last answered the young man
2275-150141-0035	train-other-500	The Earl of Mackworth stroked his beard softly Thou art marvellous changed said he
none	none	 I would not have thought it possible 
2275-150141-0036	train-other-500	Myles smiled somewhat grimly
none	none	 I have seen such things my Lord in France and in Paris said he quietly 
2275-150141-0037	train-other-500	as mayhap may make a lad a man before his time From which I gather said the Earl that many adventures have befallen thee Methought thou wouldst find troublesome times in the Dauphin s camp else I would not have sent thee to France A little space of silence followed
2275-150141-0038	train-other-500	during which the Earl sat musingly half absently regarding the tall erect powerful young figure standing before him awaiting his pleasure in motionless patient almost dogged silence The strong sinewy hands were clasped and rested upon the long heavy sword
none	none	 around the scabbard of which the belt was loosely wrapped and the plates of mail caught and reflected in flashing 
2275-150141-0039	train-other-500	broken pieces the bright sunlight from the window behind Sir Myles said the Earl suddenly breaking the silence at last dost thou know why I sent for thee hither Aye said Myles calmly how can I else
2275-150141-0040	train-other-500	Thou wouldst not have called me from Paris but for one thing Methinks thou hast sent for me to fight the Earl of Alban and lo I am here Thou speakest very boldly said the Earl I do hope that thy deeds be as bold as thy words That
2275-150141-0041	train-other-500	said Myles thou must ask other men Methinks no one may justly call me coward By my troth said the Earl smiling looking upon thee limbs and girth bone and sinew
2275-150141-0042	train-other-500	I would not like to be the he that would dare accuse thee of such a thing As for thy surmise
none	none	 I may tell thee plain that thou art right and that it was to fight the Earl of Alban I sent for thee hither 
2275-150141-0043	train-other-500	The time is now nearly ripe and I will straightway send for thy father to come to London Meantime it would not be safe either for thee or for me to keep thee in my service
none	none	 I have spoken to his Highness the Prince of Wales who with other of the Princes is upon our side in this quarrel 
2275-150141-0044	train-other-500	He hath promised to take thee into his service until the fitting time comes to bring thee and thine enemy together and to morrow I shall take thee to Scotland Yard where his Highness is now lodging As the Earl ended his speech Myles bowed but did not speak The Earl waited for a little while

2275-150141-0053	train-other-500	and presently the Earl turned on his heel and strode to the open window A long time passed in silence while he stood there gazing out of the window into the garden beyond with his back to the young man Suddenly he swung around again Sir Myles said he
2275-150141-0054	train-other-500	the family of Falworth is as good as any in Derbyshire Just now it is poor and fallen in estate but if it is again placed in credit and honor thou who art the son of the house shalt have thy suit weighed with as much respect and consideration as though thou wert my peer in all things
none	none	 Such is my answer Art thou satisfied I could ask no more answered Myles CHAPTER twenty nine That night Myles lodged at Mackworth House The next morning as soon as he had broken his fast which he did in the privacy of his own apartments the Earl bade him and Gascoyne to make ready for the barge which was then waiting at the river stairs to take them to Scotland Yard The Earl himself accompanied them and as the heavy snub nosed boat rowed by the six oarsmen in Mackworth livery slid slowly and heavily up against the stream the Earl leaning back in his cushioned seat pointed out the various inns of the great priests or nobles palatial town residences standing mostly a little distance back from the water behind terraced high walled gardens and lawns Yon was the Bishop of Exeter s Close yon was the Bishop of Bath s that was York House and that Chester Inn So passing by gardens and lawns and palaces they came at last to Scotland Yard stairs a broad flight of marble steps that led upward to a stone platform above upon which opened the gate way of the garden beyond The Scotland Yard of Myles Falworth s day was one of the more pretentious and commodious of the palaces of the Strand It took its name from having been from ancient times the London inn which the tributary Kings of Scotland occupied when on their periodical visits of homage to England Now during this time of Scotland s independence the Prince of Wales had taken up his lodging in the old palace and made it noisy with the mad boisterous mirth of his court As the watermen drew the barge close to the landing place of the stairs the Earl stepped ashore and followed by Myles and Gascoyne ascended to the broad gate way of the river wall of the garden Three men at arms who lounged upon a bench under the shade of the little pent roof of a guard house beside the wall arose and saluted as the well known figure of the Earl mounted the steps The Earl nodded a cool answer and passing unchallenged through the gate led the way up a pleached walk beyond which as Myles could see there stretched a little grassy lawn and a stone paved terrace As the Earl and the two young men approached the end of the walk they were met by the sound of voices and laughter the clinking of glasses and the rattle of dishes Turning a corner they came suddenly upon a party of young gentlemen who sat at a late breakfast under the shade of a wide spreading lime tree They had evidently just left the tilt yard for two of the guests sturdy thick set young knights yet wore a part of their tilting armor Behind the merry scene stood the gray hoary old palace a steep flight of stone steps and a long open stone arched gallery which evidently led to the kitchen beyond for along it hurried serving men running up and down the tall flight of steps and bearing trays and dishes and cups and flagons It was a merry sight and a pleasant one The day was warm and balmy and the yellow sunlight fell in waving uncertain patches of light dappling the table cloth and twinkling and sparkling upon the dishes cups and flagons At the head of the table sat a young man some three or four years older than Myles dressed in a full suit of rich blue brocaded velvet embroidered with gold thread and trimmed with black fur His face which was turned towards them as they mounted from the lawn to the little stone flagged terrace was frank and open the cheeks smooth and fair the eyes dark and blue He was tall and rather slight and wore his thick yellow hair hanging to his shoulders where it was cut square across after the manner of the times Myles did not need to be told that it was the Prince of Wales Ho Gaffer Fox he cried as soon as he caught sight of the Earl of Mackworth what wind blows thee hither among us wild mallard drakes I warrant it is not for love of us but only to fill thine own larder after the manner of Sir Fox among the drakes Whom hast thou with thee Some gosling thou art about to pluck A sudden hush fell upon the company and all faces were turned towards the visitors The Earl bowed with a soft smile Your Highness said he smoothly is pleased to be pleasant Sir I bring you the young knight of whom I spoke to you some time since Sir Myles Falworth You may be pleased to bring to mind that you so condescended as to promise to take him into your train until the fitting time arrived for that certain matter of which we spoke Sir Myles said the Prince of Wales with a frank pleasant smile I have heard great reports of thy skill and prowess in France both from Mackworth and from others It will pleasure me greatly to have thee in my household more especially he added as it will get thee callow as thou art out of my Lord Fox s clutches Our faction cannot do without the Earl of Mackworth s cunning wits Sir Myles ne theless I would not like to put all my fate and fortune into his hands without bond I hope that thou dost not rest thy fortunes entirely upon his aid and countenance All who were present felt the discomfort of the Prince s speech It was evident that one of his mad wild humors was upon him In another case the hare brained young courtiers around might have taken their cue from him but the Earl of Mackworth was no subject for their gibes and witticisms A constrained silence fell in which the Earl alone maintained a perfect ease of manner Myles bowed to hide his own embarrassment Your Highness said he evasively I rest my fortune first of all upon God His strength and justice Thou wilt find safer dependence there than upon the Lord of Mackworth said the Prince dryly But come he added with a sudden change of voice and manner these be jests that border too closely upon bitter earnest for a merry breakfast It is ill to idle with edged tools Wilt thou not stay and break thy fast with us my Lord Pardon me your Highness said the Earl bowing and smiling the same smooth smile his lips had worn from the first such a smile as Myles had never thought to have seen upon his haughty face I crave your good leave to decline I must return home presently for even now haply your uncle his Grace of Winchester is awaiting my coming upon the business you wot of Haply your Highness will find more joyance in a lusty young knight like Sir Myles than in an old fox like myself So I leave him with you in your good care Such was Myles s introduction to the wild young madcap Prince of Wales afterwards the famous Henry V the conqueror of France For a month or more thereafter he was a member of the princely household and after a little while a trusted and honored member Perhaps it was the calm sturdy strength the courage of the young knight that first appealed to the Prince s royal heart perhaps afterwards it was the more sterling qualities that underlaid that courage that drew him to the young man certain it was that in two weeks Myles was the acknowledged favorite He made no protestation of virtue he always accompanied the Prince in those madcap ventures to London where he beheld all manner of wild revelry he never held himself aloof from his gay comrades but he looked upon all their mad sports with the same calm gaze that had carried him without taint through the courts of Burgundy and the Dauphin The gay roistering young lords and gentlemen dubbed him Saint Myles and jested with him about hair cloth shirts and flagellations but witticism and jest alike failed to move Myles s patient virtue he went his own gait in the habits of his life and in so going knew as little as the others of the mad court that the Prince s growing liking for him was perhaps more than all else on account of that very temperance Then by and by the Prince began to confide in him as he did in none of the others There was no great love betwixt the King and his son it has happened very often that the Kings of England have felt bitter jealousy towards the heirs apparent as they have grown in power and such was the case with the great King Henry IV The Prince often spoke to Myles of the clashing and jarring between himself and his father and the thought began to come to Myles s mind by degrees that maybe the King s jealousy accounted not a little for the Prince s reckless intemperance Once for instance as the Prince leaned upon his shoulder waiting whilst the attendants made ready the barge that was to carry them down the river to the city he said abruptly Myles what thinkest thou of us all Doth not thy honesty hold us in contempt Nay Highness said Myles How could I hold contempt Marry said the Prince I myself hold contempt and am not as honest a man as thou But prithee have patience with me Myles Some day perhaps I too will live a clean life Now an I live seriously the King will be more jealous of me than ever and that is not a little Maybe I live thus so that he may not know what I really am in soothly earnest The Prince also often talked to Myles concerning his own affairs of the battle he was to fight for his father s honor of how the Earl of Mackworth had plotted and planned to bring him face to face with the Earl of Alban He spoke to Myles more than once of the many great changes of state and party that hung upon the downfall of the enemy of the house of Falworth and showed him how no hand but his own could strike that enemy down if he fell it must be through the son of Falworth Sometimes it seemed to Myles as though he and his blind father were the centre of a great web of plot and intrigue stretching far and wide that included not only the greatest houses of England but royalty and the political balance of the country as well and even before the greatness of it all he did not flinch Then at last came the beginning of the time for action It was in the early part of May and Myles had been a member of the Prince s household for a little over a month One morning he was ordered to attend the Prince in his privy cabinet and obeying the summons he found the Prince his younger brother the Duke of Bedford and his uncle the Bishop of Winchester seated at a table where they had just been refreshing themselves with a flagon of wine and a plate of wafers My poor Myles said the Prince smiling as the young knight bowed to the three and then stood erect as though on duty It shames my heart brother and thou uncle it shames my heart to be one privy to this thing which we are set upon to do Here be we the greatest Lords of England making a cat s paw of this lad for he is only yet a boy and of his blind father for to achieve our ends against Alban s faction It seemeth not over honorable to my mind Pardon me your Highness said Myles blushing to the roots of his hair but an I may be so bold as to speak I reck nothing of what your aims may be I only look to restoring my father s honor and the honor of our house Truly said the Prince smiling that is the only matter that maketh me willing to lay my hands to this business Dost thou know why I have sent for thee It is because this day thou must challenge the Duke of Alban before the King The Earl of Mackworth has laid all his plans and the time is now ripe Knowest that thy father is at Mackworth House Nay said Myles I knew it not He hath been there for nearly two days said the Prince Just now the Earl hath sent for us to come first to Mackworth House Then to go to the palace for he hath gained audience with the King and hath so arranged it that the Earl of Alban is to be there as well We all go straightway so get thyself ready as soon as may be Perhaps Myles s heart began beating more quickly within him at the nearness of that great happening which he had looked forward to for so long If it did he made no sign of his emotion but only asked How must I clothe myself your Highness Wear thy light armor said the Prince but no helmet a juppon bearing the arms and colors that the Earl gave thee when thou wert knighted and carry thy right hand gauntlet under thy belt for thy challenge Now make haste for time passes CHAPTER thirty Adjoining the ancient palace of Westminster where King Henry IV was then holding his court was a no less ancient stone building known as the Painted Room Upon the walls were depicted a series of battle scenes in long bands reaching around this room one above another Some of these pictures had been painted as far back as the days of Henry III others had been added since his time They chronicled the various wars of the King of England and it was from them that the little hall took its name of the Painted Room This ancient wing or offshoot of the main buildings was more retired from the hurly burly of outer life than other parts of the palace and thither the sick King was very fond of retiring from the business of State which ever rested more and more heavily upon his shoulders sometimes to squander in quietness a spare hour or two sometimes to idle over a favorite book sometimes to play a game of chess with a favorite courtier The cold painted walls had been hung with tapestry and its floor had been spread with arras carpet These and the cushioned couches and chairs that stood around gave its gloomy antiquity an air of comfort an air even of luxury It was to this favorite retreat of the King s that Myles was brought that morning with his father to face the great Earl of Alban In the anteroom the little party of Princes and nobles who escorted the father and son had held a brief consultation Then the others had entered leaving Myles and his blind father in charge of Lord Lumley and two knights of the court Sir Reginald Hallowell and Sir Piers Averell Myles as he stood patiently waiting with his father s arm resting in his could hear the muffled sound of voices from beyond the arras Among others he recognized the well remembered tones of the King He fancied that he heard his own name mentioned more than once and then the sound of talking ceased The next moment the arras was drawn aside and the Earl entered the antechamber again All is ready cousin said he to Lord Falworth in a suppressed voice Essex hath done as he promised and Alban is within there now Then turning to Myles speaking in the same low voice and betraying more agitation than Myles had thought it possible for him to show Sir Myles said he remember all that hath been told thee Thou knowest what thou hast to say and do Then without further word he took Lord Falworth by the hand and led the way into the room Myles following close behind The King half sat half inclined upon a cushioned seat close to which stood the two Princes There were some dozen others present mostly priests and noblemen of high quality who clustered in a group at a little distance Myles knew most of them at a glance having seen them come and go at Scotland Yard But among them all he singled out only one the Earl of Alban He had not seen that face since he was a little child eight years old but now that he beheld it again it fitted instantly and vividly into the remembrance of the time of that terrible scene at Falworth Castle when he had beheld the then Lord Brookhurst standing above the dead body of Sir John Dale with the bloody mace clinched in his hand There were the same heavy black brows sinister and gloomy the same hooked nose the same swarthy cheeks He even remembered the deep dent in the forehead where the brows met in perpetual frown So it was that upon that face his looks centred and rested The Earl of Alban had just been speaking to some Lord who stood beside him and a half smile still hung about the corners of his lips At first as he looked up at the entrance of the newcomers there was no other expression then suddenly came a flash of recognition a look of wide eyed amazement then the blood left the cheeks and the lips and the face grew very pale No doubt he saw at a flash that some great danger overhung him in this sudden coming of his old enemy for he was as keen and as astute a politician as he was a famous warrior At least he knew that the eyes of most of those present were fixed keenly and searchingly upon him After the first start of recognition his left hand hanging at his side gradually closed around the scabbard of his sword clutching it in a vice like grip Meantime the Earl of Mackworth had led the blind Lord to the King where both kneeled Why how now my Lord said the King Methought it was our young Paladin whom we knighted at Devlen that was to be presented and here thou bringest this old man A blind man ha What is the meaning of this Majesty said the Earl I have taken this chance to bring to thy merciful consideration one who hath most wofully and unjustly suffered from thine anger Yonder stands the young knight of whom we spake this is his father Gilbert Reginald whilom Lord Falworth who craves mercy and justice at thy hands Falworth said the King placing his hand to his head The name is not strange to mine ears but I cannot place it My head hath troubled me sorely to day and I cannot remember At this point the Earl of Alban came quietly and deliberately forward Sire said he pardon my boldness in so venturing to address you but haply I may bring the name more clearly to your mind He is as my Lord of Mackworth said the whilom Baron Falworth the outlawed attainted traitor so declared for the harboring of Sir John Dale who was one of those who sought your Majesty s life at Windsor eleven years ago Sire he is mine enemy as well and is brought hither by my proclaimed enemies Should aught occur to my harm I rest my case in your gracious hands The dusty red flamed into the King s pale sickly face in answer and he rose hastily from his seat Aye said he I remember me now I remember me the man and the name Who hath dared bring him here before us All the dull heaviness of sickness was gone for the moment and King Henry was the King Henry of ten years ago as he rolled his eyes balefully from one to another of the courtiers who stood silently around The Earl of Mackworth shot a covert glance at the Bishop of Winchester who came forward in answer Your Majesty said he here am I your brother who beseech you as your brother not to judge over hastily in this matter It is true that this man has been adjudged a traitor but he has been so adjudged without a hearing I beseech thee to listen patiently to whatsoever he may have to say The King fixed the Bishop with a look of the bitterest deepest anger holding his nether lip tightly under his teeth a trick he had when strongly moved with anger and the Bishop s eyes fell under the look Meantime the Earl of Alban stood calm and silent No doubt he saw that the King s anger was likely to befriend him more than any words that he himself could say and he perilled his case with no more speech which could only prove superfluous At last the King turned a face red and swollen with anger to the blind Lord who still kneeled before him What hast thou to say he said in a deep and sullen voice Gracious and merciful Lord said the blind nobleman I come to thee the fountain head of justice craving justice Sire I do now and here deny my treason which denial I could not before make being blind and helpless and mine enemies strong and malignant But now sire Heaven hath sent me help and therefore I do acclaim before thee that my accuser William Bushy Brookhurst Earl of Alban is a foul and an attainted liar in all that he hath accused me of To uphold which allegation and to defend me who am blinded by his unknightliness I do offer a champion to prove all that I say with his body in combat The Earl of Mackworth darted a quick look at Myles who came forward the moment his father had ended and kneeled beside him The King offered no interruption to his speech but he bent a look heavy with anger upon the young man My gracious Lord and King said Myles I the son of the accused do offer myself as his champion in this cause beseeching thee of thy grace leave to prove the truth of the same being a belted knight by thy grace and of thy creation and the peer of any who weareth spurs Thereupon rising he drew his iron gauntlet from his girdle and flung it clashing down upon the floor and with his heart swelling within him with anger and indignation and pity of his blind father he cried in a loud voice I do accuse thee William of Alban that thou liest vilely as aforesaid and here cast down my gage daring thee to take it up The Earl of Alban made as though he would accept the challenge but the King stopped him hastily Stop he cried harshly Touch not the gage Let it lie let it lie I tell thee my Lord Now then said he turning to the others tell me what meaneth all this coil Who brought this man hither He looked from one to another of those who stood silently around but no one answered I see said he ye all have had to do with it It is as my Lord of Alban sayeth ye are his enemies and ye are my enemies as well In this I do smell a vile plot I cannot undo what I have done and since I have made this young man a knight with mine own hands I cannot deny that he is fit to challenge my Lord of Alban Ne theless the High Court of Chivalry shall adjudge this case Meantime said he turning to the Earl Marshal who was present I give thee this attainted Lord in charge Convey him presently to the Tower and let him abide our pleasure there Also thou mayst take up yon gage and keep it till it is redeemed according to our pleasure He stood thoughtfully for a moment and then raising his eyes looked fixedly at the Earl of Mackworth I know he said that I be a right sick man and there be some who are already plotting to overthrow those who have held up my hand with their own strength for all these years Then speaking more directly My Lord Earl of Mackworth I see your hand in this before all others It was thou who so played upon me as to get me to knight this young man and thus make him worthy to challenge my Lord of Alban It was thy doings that brought him here to day backed by mine own sons and my brother and by these noblemen Then turning suddenly to the Earl of Alban Come my Lord said he I am aweary with all this coil Lend me thine arm to leave this place So it was that he left the room leaning upon the Earl of Alban s arm and followed by the two or three of the Alban faction who were present Your Royal Highness said the Earl Marshal I must e en do the King s bidding and take this gentleman into arrest Do thy duty said the Prince We knew it must come to this Meanwhile he is to be a prisoner of honor and see that he be well lodged and cared for Thou wilt find my barge at the stairs to convey him down the river and I myself will come this afternoon to visit him CHAPTER thirty one It was not until the end of July that the High Court of Chivalry rendered its judgment There were many unusual points in the case some of which bore heavily against Lord Falworth some of which were in his favor He was very ably defended by the lawyers whom the Earl of Mackworth had engaged upon his side nevertheless under ordinary circumstances the judgment no doubt would have been quickly rendered against him As it was however the circumstances were not ordinary and it was rendered in his favor The Court besought the King to grant the ordeal by battle to accept Lord Falworth s champion and to appoint the time and place for the meeting The decision must have been a most bitter galling one for the sick King He was naturally of a generous forgiving nature but Lord Falworth in his time of power had been an unrelenting and fearless opponent and his Majesty who like most generous men could on occasions be very cruel and intolerant had never forgiven him He had steadily thrown the might of his influence with the Court against the Falworths case but that influence was no longer all powerful for good or ill He was failing in health and it could only be a matter of a few years probably of only a few months before his successor sat upon the throne Upon the other hand the Prince of Wales s faction had been steadily and of late rapidly increasing in power and in the Earl of Mackworth its virtual head it possessed one of the most capable politicians and astute intriguers in Europe So as the outcome of all the plotting and counter plotting scheming and counter scheming the case was decided in Lord Falworth s favor The knowledge of the ultimate result was known to the Prince of Wales s circle almost a week before it was finally decided Indeed the Earl of Mackworth had made pretty sure of that result before he had summoned Myles from France but upon the King it fell like the shock of a sudden blow All that day he kept himself in moody seclusion nursing his silent bitter anger and making only one outbreak in which he swore by the Holy Rood that should Myles be worsted in the encounter he would not take the battle into his own hands but would suffer him to be slain and furthermore that should the Earl show signs of failing at any time he would do all in his power to save him One of the courtiers who had been present and who was secretly inclined to the Prince of Wales s faction had repeated this speech at Scotland Yard and the Prince had said That meaneth Myles that thou must either win or die And so I would have it to be my Lord Myles had answered It was not until nearly a fortnight after the decision of the Court of Chivalry had been rendered that the King announced the time and place of battle the time to be the threed of September the place to be Smithfield a spot much used for such encounters During the three weeks or so that intervened between this announcement and the time of combat Myles went nearly every day to visit the lists in course of erection Often the Prince went with him always two or three of his friends of the Scotland Yard court accompanied him The lists were laid out in the usual form The true or principal list in which the combatants were to engage was sixty yards long and forty yards wide this rectangular space being surrounded by a fence about six feet high painted vermilion Between the fence and the stand where the King and the spectators sat and surrounding the central space was the outer or false list also surrounded by a fence In the false list the Constable and the Marshal and their followers and attendants were to be stationed at the time of battle to preserve the general peace during the contest between the principals One day as Myles his princely patron and his friends entered the barriers leaving their horses at the outer gate they met the Earl of Alban and his followers who were just quitting the lists which they also were in the habit of visiting nearly every day As the two parties passed one another the Earl spoke to a gentleman walking beside him and in a voice loud enough to be clearly overheard by the others Yonder is the young sprig of Falworth said he His father my Lords is not content with forfeiting his own life for his treason but must forsooth throw away his son s also I have faced and overthrown many a better knight than that boy Myles heard the speech and knew that it was intended for him to hear it but he paid no attention to it walking composedly at the Prince s side The Prince had also overheard it and after a little space of silence asked Dost thou not feel anxiety for thy coming battle Myles Yea my Lord said Myles sometimes I do feel anxiety but not such as my Lord of Alban would have me feel in uttering the speech that he spake anon It is anxiety for my father s sake and my mother s sake that I feel for truly there are great matters for them pending upon this fight Ne theless I do know that God will not desert me in my cause for verily my father is no traitor But the Earl of Alban said the Prince gravely is reputed one of the best skilled knights in all England moreover he is merciless and without generosity so that an he gain aught advantage over thee he will surely slay thee I am not afraid my Lord said Myles still calmly and composedly Nor am I afraid for thee Myles said the Prince heartily putting his arm as he spoke around the young man s shoulder for truly wert thou a knight of forty years instead of one of twenty thou couldst not bear thyself with more courage As the time for the duel approached the days seemed to drag themselves along upon leaden feet nevertheless the days came and went as all days do bringing with them at last the fateful threed of September Early in the morning while the sun was still level and red the Prince himself unattended came to Myles s apartment in the outer room of which Gascoyne was bustling busily about arranging the armor piece by piece renewing straps and thongs but not whistling over his work as he usually did The Prince nodded to him and then passed silently through to the inner chamber Myles was upon his knees and Father Ambrose the Prince s chaplain was beside him The Prince stood silently at the door until Myles having told his last bead rose and turned towards him My dear Lord said the young knight I give you gramercy for the great honor you do me in coming so early for to visit me Nay Myles give me no thanks said the Prince frankly reaching him his hand which Myles took and set to his lips I lay bethinking me of thee this morning while yet in bed and so as I could not sleep any more I was moved to come hither to see thee Quite a number of the Prince s faction were at the breakfast at Scotland Yard that morning among others the Earl of Mackworth All were more or less oppressed with anxiety for nearly all of them had staked much upon the coming battle If Alban conquered he would be more powerful to harm them and to revenge himself upon them than ever and Myles was a very young champion upon whom to depend Myles himself perhaps showed as little anxiety as any he certainly ate more heartily of his breakfast that morning than many of the others After the meal was ended the Prince rose The boat is ready at the stairs said he if thou wouldst go to the Tower to visit thy father Myles before hearing mass I and Cholmondeley and Vere and Poins will go with thee if ye Lords and gentlemen will grant me your pardon for leaving you Are there any others that thou wouldst have accompany thee I would have Sir James Lee and my squire Master Gascoyne if thou art so pleased to give them leave to go answered Myles So be it said the Prince We will stop at Mackworth stairs for the knight The barge landed at the west stairs of the Tower wharf and the whole party were received with more than usual civilities by the Governor who conducted them at once to the Tower where Lord Falworth was lodged Lady Falworth met them at the head of the stairs her eyes were very red and her face pale and as Myles raised her hand and set a long kiss upon it her lips trembled and she turned her face quickly away pressing her handkerchief for one moment to her eyes Poor lady What agony of anxiety and dread did she not suffer for her boy s sake that day Myles had not hidden both from her and his father that he must either win or die As Myles turned from his mother Prior Edward came out from the inner chamber and was greeted warmly by him The old priest had arrived in London only the day before having come down from Crosbey Priory to be with his friend s family during this their time of terrible anxiety After a little while of general talk the Prince and his attendants retired leaving the family together only Sir James Lee and Gascoyne remaining behind Many matters that had been discussed before were now finally settled the chief of which was the disposition of Lady Falworth in case the battle should go against them Then Myles took his leave kissing his mother who began crying and comforting her with brave assurances Prior Edward accompanied him as far as the head of the Tower stairs where Myles kneeled upon the stone steps while the good priest blessed him and signed the cross upon his forehead The Prince was waiting in the walled garden adjoining and as they rowed back again up the river to Scotland Yard all were thoughtful and serious even Poins and Vere s merry tongues being stilled from their usual quips and jesting It was about the quarter of the hour before eleven o clock when Myles with Gascoyne set forth for the lists The Prince of Wales together with most of his court had already gone on to Smithfield leaving behind him six young knights of his household to act as escort to the young champion Then at last the order to horse was given the great gate swung open and out they rode clattering and jingling the sunlight gleaming and flaming and flashing upon their polished armor They drew rein to the right and so rode in a little cloud of dust along the Strand Street towards London town with the breeze blowing merrily and the sunlight shining as sweetly and blithesomely as though they were riding to a wedding rather than to a grim and dreadful ordeal that meant either victory or death CHAPTER thirty two In the days of King Edward III a code of laws relating to trial by battle had been compiled for one of his sons Thomas of Woodstock In this work each and every detail to the most minute had been arranged and fixed and from that time judicial combats had been regulated in accordance with its mandates It was in obedience to this code that Myles Falworth appeared at the east gate of the lists the east gate being assigned by law to the challenger clad in full armor of proof attended by Gascoyne and accompanied by two of the young knights who had acted as his escort from Scotland Yard At the barriers he was met by the attorney Willingwood the chief lawyer who had conducted the Falworth case before the High Court of Chivalry and who was to attend him during the administration of the oaths before the King As Myles presented himself at the gate he was met by the Constable the Marshal and their immediate attendants The Constable laying his hand upon the bridle rein said in a loud voice Stand Sir Knight and tell me why thou art come thus armed to the gates of the lists What is thy name Wherefore art thou come Myles answered I am Myles Falworth a Knight of the Bath by grace of his Majesty King Henry IV and by his creation and do come hither to defend my challenge upon the body of William Bushy Brookhurst Earl of Alban proclaiming him an unknightly knight and a false and perjured liar in that he hath accused Gilbert Reginald Lord Falworth of treason against our beloved Lord his Majesty the King and may God defend the right As he ended speaking the Constable advanced close to his side and formally raising the umbril of the helmet looked him in the face Thereupon having approved his identity he ordered the gates to be opened and bade Myles enter the lists with his squire and his friends At the south side of the lists a raised scaffolding had been built for the King and those who looked on It was not unlike that which had been erected at Devlen Castle when Myles had first jousted as belted knight here were the same raised seat for the King the tapestries the hangings the fluttering pennons and the royal standard floating above only here were no fair faced ladies looking down upon him but instead stern browed Lords and knights in armor and squires and here were no merry laughing and buzz of talk and flutter of fans and kerchiefs but all was very quiet and serious Myles riding upon his horse with Gascoyne holding the bridle rein and his attorney walking beside him with his hand upon the stirrups followed the Constable across the lists to an open space in front of the seat where the King sat Then having reached his appointed station he stopped and the Constable advancing to the foot of the stair way that led to the dais above announced in a loud voice that the challenger had entered the lists Then called the defendant straightway said the King for noon draweth nigh The day was very warm and the sun bright and unclouded shone fiercely down upon the open lists Perhaps few men nowadays could bear the scorching heat of iron plates such as Myles wore from which the body was only protected by a leathern jacket and hose But men s bodies in those days were tougher and more seasoned to hardships of weather than they are in these our times Myles thought no more of the burning iron plates that incased him than a modern soldier thinks of his dress uniform in warm weather Nevertheless he raised the umbril of his helmet to cool his face as he waited the coming of his opponent He turned his eyes upward to the row of seats on the scaffolding above and even in the restless bewildering multitude of strange faces turned towards him recognized those that he knew the Prince of Wales his companions of the Scotland Yard household the Duke of Clarence the Bishop of Winchester and some of the noblemen of the Earl of Mackworth s party who had been buzzing about the Prince for the past month or so But his glance swept over all these rather perceiving than seeing them and then rested upon a square box like compartment not unlike a prisoner s dock in the courtroom of our day for in the box sat his father with the Earl of Mackworth upon one side and Sir James Lee upon the other The blind man s face was very pale but still wore its usual expression of calm serenity the calm serenity of a blind face The Earl was also very pale and he kept his eyes fixed steadfastly upon Myles with a keen and searching look as though to pierce to the very bottom of the young man s heart and discover if indeed not one little fragment of dryrot of fear or uncertainty tainted the solid courage of his knighthood Then he heard the criers calling the defendant at the four corners of the list Oyez Oyez Oyez William Bushy Brookhurst Earl of Alban come to this combat in which you be enterprised this day to discharge your sureties before the King the Constable and the Marshal and to encounter in your defence Myles Falworth knight the accepted champion upon behalf of Gilbert Reginald Falworth the challenger Oyez Oyez Oyez Let the defendant come So they continued calling until by the sudden turning of all faces Myles knew that his enemy was at hand Then presently he saw the Earl and his attendants enter the outer gate at the west end of the barrier he saw the Constable and Marshal meet him he saw the formal words of greeting pass he saw the Constable raise the umbril of the helmet Then the gate opened and the Earl of Alban entered clad cap a pie in a full suit of magnificent Milan armor without juppon or adornment of any kind As he approached across the lists Myles closed the umbril of his helmet and then sat quite still and motionless for the time was come So he sat erect and motionless as a statue of iron half hearing the reading of the long intricately worded bills absorbed in many thoughts of past and present things At last the reading ended and then he calmly and composedly obeyed under the direction of his attorney the several forms and ceremonies that followed answered the various official questions took the various oaths Then Gascoyne leading the horse by the bridle rein conducted him back to his station at the east end of the lists As the faithful friend and squire made one last and searching examination of arms and armor the Marshal and the clerk came to the young champion and administered the final oath by which he swore that he carried no concealed weapons The weapons allowed by the High Court were then measured and attested They consisted of the long sword the short sword the dagger the mace and a weapon known as the hand gisarm or glave lot a heavy swordlike blade eight palms long a palm in breadth and riveted to a stout handle of wood three feet long The usual lance had not been included in the list of arms the hand gisarm being substituted in its place It was a fearful and murderous weapon though cumbersome Unhandy and ill adapted for quick or dexterous stroke nevertheless the Earl of Alban had petitioned the King to have it included in the list and in answer to the King s expressed desire the Court had adopted it in the stead of the lance yielding thus much to the royal wishes Nor was it a small concession The hand gisarm had been a weapon very much in vogue in King Richard s day and was now nearly if not entirely out of fashion with the younger generation of warriors The Earl of Alban was of course well used to the blade with Myles it was strange and new either for attack or in defence With the administration of the final oath and the examination of the weapons the preliminary ceremonies came to an end and presently Myles heard the criers calling to clear the lists As those around him moved to withdraw the young knight drew off his mailed gauntlet and gave Gascoyne s hand one last final clasp strong earnest and intense with the close friendship of young manhood and poor Gascoyne looked up at him with a face ghastly white Then all were gone the gates of the principal list and that of the false list were closed clashing and Myles was alone face to face with his mortal enemy CHAPTER thirty three There was a little while of restless rustling silence during which the Constable took his place in the seat appointed for him directly in front of and below the King s throne A moment or two when even the restlessness and the rustling were quieted and then the King leaned forward and spoke to the Constable who immediately called out in a loud clear voice Let them go Then again Let them go Then for the third and last time Let them go and do their endeavor in God s name At this third command the combatants each of whom had till that moment been sitting as motionless as a statue of iron tightened rein and rode slowly and deliberately forward without haste yet without hesitation until they met in the very middle of the lists In the battle which followed Myles fought with the long sword the Earl with the hand gisarm for which he had asked The moment they met the combat was opened and for a time nothing was heard but the thunderous clashing and clamor of blows now and then beating intermittently now and then pausing Occasionally as the combatants spurred together checked wheeled and recovered they would be hidden for a moment in a misty veil of dust which again drifting down the wind perhaps revealed them drawn a little apart resting their panting horses Then again they would spur together striking as they passed wheeling and striking again Upon the scaffolding all was still only now and then for the buzz of muffled exclamations or applause of those who looked on Mostly the applause was from Myles s friends for from the very first he showed and steadily maintained his advantage over the older man Hah well struck well recovered Look ye the sword bit that time Nay look saw ye him pass the point of the gisarm Then Falworth Falworth as some more than usually skilful stroke or parry occurred Meantime Myles s father sat straining his sightless eyeballs as though to pierce his body s darkness with one ray of light that would show him how his boy held his own in the fight and Lord Mackworth leaning with his lips close to the blind man s ear told him point by point how the battle stood Fear not Gilbert said he at each pause in the fight He holdeth his own right well Then after a while God is with us Gilbert Alban is twice wounded and his horse faileth One little while longer and the victory is ours A longer and more continuous interval of combat followed this last assurance during which Myles drove the assault fiercely and unrelentingly as though to overbear his enemy by the very power and violence of the blows he delivered The Earl defended himself desperately but was borne back back back farther and farther Every nerve of those who looked on was stretched to breathless tensity when almost as his enemy was against the barriers Myles paused and rested Out upon it exclaimed the Earl of Mackworth almost shrilly in his excitement as the sudden lull followed the crashing of blows Why doth the boy spare him That is thrice he hath given him grace to recover an he had pushed the battle that time he had driven him back against the barriers It was as the Earl had said Myles had three times given his enemy grace when victory was almost in his very grasp He had three times spared him in spite of all he and those dear to him must suffer should his cruel and merciless enemy gain the victory It was a false and foolish generosity partly the fault of his impulsive youth more largely of his romantic training in the artificial code of French chivalry He felt that the battle was his and so he gave his enemy these three chances to recover as some chevalier or knight errant of romance might have done instead of pushing the combat to a mercifully speedy end and his foolish generosity cost him dear In the momentary pause that had thus stirred the Earl of Mackworth to a sudden outbreak the Earl of Alban sat upon his panting sweating war horse facing his powerful young enemy at about twelve paces distant He sat as still as a rock holding his gisarm poised in front of him He had as the Earl of Mackworth had said been wounded twice and each time with the point of the sword so much more dangerous than a direct cut with the weapon One wound was beneath his armor and no one but he knew how serious it might be the other was under the overlapping of the epauhere and from it a finger s breadth of blood ran straight down his side and over the housings of his horse From without the still motionless iron figure appeared calm and expressionless within who knows what consuming blasts of hate rage and despair swept his heart as with a fiery whirlwind As Myles looked at the motionless bleeding figure his breast swelled with pity My Lord said he thou art sore wounded and the fight is against thee wilt thou not yield thee No one but that other heard the speech and no one but Myles heard the answer that came back hollow cavernous Never thou dog Never Then in an instant as quick as a flash his enemy spurred straight upon Myles and as he spurred he struck a last desperate swinging blow in which he threw in one final effort all the strength of hate of fury and of despair Myles whirled his horse backward warding the blow with his shield as he did so The blade glanced from the smooth face of the shield and whether by mistake or not fell straight and true and with almost undiminished force upon the neck of Myles s war horse and just behind the ears The animal staggered forward and then fell upon its knees and at the same instant the other as though by the impetus of the rush dashed full upon it with all the momentum lent by the weight of iron it carried The shock was irresistible and the stunned and wounded horse was flung upon the ground rolling over and over As his horse fell Myles wrenched one of his feet out of the stirrup the other caught for an instant and he was flung headlong with stunning violence his armor crashing as he fell In the cloud of dust that arose no one could see just what happened but that what was done was done deliberately no one doubted The earl at once checking and spurring his foaming charger drove the iron shod war horse directly over Myles s prostrate body Then checking him fiercely with the curb reined him back the hoofs clashing and crashing over the figure beneath So he had ridden over the father at York and so he rode over the son at Smithfield Myles as he lay prostrate and half stunned by his fall had seen his enemy thus driving his rearing horse down upon him but was not able to defend himself A fallen knight in full armor was utterly powerless to rise without assistance Myles lay helpless in the clutch of the very iron that was his defence He closed his eyes involuntarily and then horse and rider were upon him There was a deafening sparkling crash a glimmering faintness then another crash as the horse was reined furiously back again and then a humming stillness In a moment upon the scaffolding all was a tumult of uproar and confusion shouting and gesticulation only the King sat calm sullen impassive The Earl wheeled his horse and sat for a moment or two as though to make quite sure that he knew the King s mind The blow that had been given was foul unknightly but the King gave no sign either of acquiescence or rebuke he had willed that Myles was to die Then the Earl turned again and rode deliberately up to his prostrate enemy When Myles opened his eyes after that moment of stunning silence it was to see the other looming above him on his war horse swinging his gisarm for one last mortal blow pitiless merciless The sight of that looming peril brought back Myles s wandering senses like a flash of lightning He flung up his shield and met the blow even as it descended turning it aside It only protracted the end Once more the Earl of Alban raised the gisarm swinging it twice around his head before he struck This time though the shield glanced it the blow fell upon the shoulder piece biting through the steel plate and leathern jack beneath even to the bone Then Myles covered his head with his shield as a last protecting chance for life For the third time the Earl swung the blade flashing and then it fell straight and true upon the defenceless body just below the left arm biting deep through the armor plates For an instant the blade stuck fast and that instant was Myles s salvation Under the agony of the blow he gave a muffled cry and almost instinctively grasped the shaft of the weapon with both hands Had the Earl let go his end of the weapon he would have won the battle at his leisure and most easily as it was he struggled violently to wrench the gisarm away from Myles In that short fierce struggle Myles was dragged to his knees and then still holding the weapon with one hand he clutched the trappings of the Earl s horse with the other The next moment he was upon his feet The other struggled to thrust him away but Myles letting go the gisarm which he held with his left hand clutched him tightly by the sword belt in the intense vise like grip of despair In vain the Earl strove to beat him loose with the shaft of the gisarm in vain he spurred and reared his horse to shake him off Myles held him tight in spite of all his struggles He felt neither the streaming blood nor the throbbing agony of his wounds every faculty of soul mind body every power of life was centered in one intense burning effort He neither felt thought nor reasoned but clutching with the blindness of instinct the heavy spiked iron headed mace that hung at the Earl s saddle bow he gave it one tremendous wrench that snapped the plaited leathern thongs that held it as though they were skeins of thread Then grinding his teeth as with a spasm he struck as he had never struck before once twice thrice full upon the front of the helmet Crash crash And then even as the Earl toppled sidelong crash And the iron plates split and crackled under the third blow Myles had one flashing glimpse of an awful face and then the saddle was empty Then as he held tight to the horse panting dizzy sick to death he felt the hot blood gushing from his side filling his body armor and staining the ground upon which he stood Still he held tightly to the saddle bow of the fallen man s horse until through his glimmering sight he saw the Marshal the Lieutenant and the attendants gather around him He heard the Marshal ask him in a voice that sounded faint and distant if he was dangerously wounded He did not answer and one of the attendants leaping from his horse opened the umbril of his helmet disclosing the dull hollow eyes the ashy colorless lips and the waxy forehead upon which stood great beads of sweat Water water he cried hoarsely give me to drink Then quitting his hold upon the horse he started blindly across the lists towards the gate of the barrier A shadow that chilled his heart seemed to fall upon him It is death he muttered then he stopped then swayed for an instant and then toppled headlong crashing as he fell CONCLUSION But Myles was not dead Those who had seen his face when the umbril of the helmet was raised and then saw him fall as he tottered across the lists had at first thought so But his faintness was more from loss of blood and the sudden unstringing of nerve and sense from the intense furious strain of the last few moments of battle than from the vital nature of the wound Indeed after Myles had been carried out of the lists and laid upon the ground in the shade between the barriers Master Thomas the Prince s barber surgeon having examined the wounds declared that he might be even carried on a covered litter to Scotland Yard without serious danger The Prince was extremely desirous of having him under his care and so the venture was tried Myles was carried to Scotland Yard and perhaps was none the worse therefore The Prince the Earl of Mackworth and two or three others stood silently watching as the worthy shaver and leecher assisted by his apprentice and Gascoyne washed and bathed the great gaping wound in the side and bound it with linen bandages Myles lay with closed eyelids still pallid weak as a little child Presently he opened his eyes and turned them dull and languid to the Prince What hath happed my father my Lord said he in a faint whispering voice Thou hath saved his life and honor Myles the Prince answered He is here now and thy mother hath been sent for and cometh anon with the priest who was with them this morn Myles dropped his eyelids again his lips moved but he made no sound and then two bright tears trickled across his white cheek He maketh a woman of me the Prince muttered through his teeth and then swinging on his heel he stood for a long time looking out of the window into the garden beneath May I see my father said Myles presently without opening his eyes The Prince turned around and looked inquiringly at the surgeon The good man shook his head Not to day said he haply to morrow he may see him and his mother The bleeding is but new stanched and such matters as seeing his father and mother may make the heart to swell and so maybe the wound burst afresh and he die An he would hope to live he must rest quiet until to morrow day But though Myles s wound was not mortal it was very serious The fever which followed lingered longer than common perhaps because of the hot weather and the days stretched to weeks and the weeks to months and still he lay there nursed by his mother and Gascoyne and Prior Edward and now and again by Sir James Lee One day a little before the good priest returned to Saint Mary s Priory as he sat by Myles s bedside his hands folded and his sight turned inward the young man suddenly said Tell me holy father is it always wrong for man to slay man The good priest sat silent for so long a time that Myles began to think he had not heard the question But by and by he answered almost with a sigh It is a hard question my son but I must in truth say meseems it is not always wrong Sir said Myles I have been in battle when men were slain but never did I think thereon as I have upon this matter Did I sin in so slaying my father s enemy Nay said Prior Edward quietly thou didst not sin It was for others thou didst fight my son and for others it is pardonable to do battle Had it been thine own quarrel it might haply have been more hard to have answered thee Who can gainsay even in these days of light the truth of this that the good priest said to the sick lad so far away in the past One day the Earl of Mackworth came to visit Myles At that time the young knight was mending and was sitting propped up with pillows and was wrapped in Sir James Lee s cloak for the day was chilly After a little time of talk a pause of silence fell My Lord said Myles suddenly dost thou remember one part of a matter we spoke of when I first came from France The Earl made no pretence of ignorance I remember said he quietly looking straight into the young man s thin white face And have I yet won the right to ask for the Lady Alice de Mowbray to wife said Myles the red rising faintly to his cheeks Thou hast won it said the Earl with a smile Myles s eyes shone and his lips trembled with the pang of sudden joy and triumph for he was still very weak My Lord said he presently belike thou camest here to see me for this very matter The Earl smiled again without answering and Myles knew that he had guessed aright He reached out one of his weak pallid hands from beneath the cloak The Earl of Mackworth took it with a firm pressure then instantly quitting it again rose as if ashamed of his emotion stamped his feet as though in pretence of being chilled and then crossed the room to where the fire crackled brightly in the great stone fireplace Little else remains to be told only a few loose strands to tie and the story is complete Though Lord Falworth was saved from death at the block though his honor was cleansed from stain he was yet as poor and needy as ever The King in spite of all the pressure brought to bear upon him refused to restore the estates of Falworth and Easterbridge the latter of which had again reverted to the crown upon the death of the Earl of Alban without issue upon the grounds that they had been forfeited not because of the attaint of treason but because of Lord Falworth having refused to respond to the citation of the courts So the business dragged along for month after month until in January the King died suddenly in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Then matters went smoothly enough and Falworth and Mackworth swam upon the flood tide of fortune So Myles was married for how else should the story end And one day he brought his beautiful young wife home to Falworth Castle which his father had given him for his own and at the gateway of which he was met by Sir James Lee and by the newly knighted Sir Francis Gascoyne One day soon after this home coming as he stood with her at an open window into which came blowing the pleasant May time breeze he suddenly said What didst thou think of me when I first fell almost into thy lap like an apple from heaven I thought thou wert a great good hearted boy as I think thou art now said she twisting his strong sinewy fingers in and out If thou thoughtst me so then what a very fool I must have looked to thee when I so clumsily besought thee for thy favor for my jousting at Devlen Did I not so Thou didst look to me the most noble handsome young knight that did ever live thou didst look to me Sir Galahad as they did call thee withouten taint or stain Myles did not even smile in answer but looked at his wife with such a look that she blushed a rosy red Then laughing she slipped from his hold and before he could catch her again was gone I am glad that he was to be rich and happy and honored and beloved after all his
