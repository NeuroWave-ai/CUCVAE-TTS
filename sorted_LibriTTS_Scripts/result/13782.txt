none	none	upon my soul it is Jacob Why Delafield my dear fellow how are you So saying on a February evening a good many years ago an elderly gentleman in evening dress flung himself out of his cab which had just stopped before a house in Bruton Street and hastily went to meet a young man who was at the same moment stepping out of another hansom a little farther down the pavement The pleasure in the older man s voice rang clear and the younger met him with an equal cordiality expressed perhaps through a manner more leisurely and restrained So you are home Sir Wilfrid You were announced I saw But I thought Paris would have detained you a bit Paris Not I Half the people I ever knew there are dead and the rest are uncivil Well and how are you getting on Making your fortune eh And slipping his arm inside the young man s the speaker walked back with him along a line of carriages towards a house which showed a group of footmen at its open door Jacob Delafield smiled The business of a land agent seems to be to spend some one else s as far as I ve yet gone Land agent I thought you were at the bar I was but the briefs didn t come in My cousin offered me the care of his Essex estates I like the country always have So I thought I d better accept What the Duke Lucky fellow A regular income and no anxieties I expect you re pretty well paid Oh I m not badly paid replied the young man tranquilly Of course you re going to Lady Henry s Of course Here we are The older man paused outside the line of servants waiting at the door and spoke in a lower tone How is she Failing at all Jacob Delafield hesitated She s grown very blind and perhaps rather more infirm generally But she is at home as usual every evening for a few people and for a good many on Wednesdays Is she still alone or is there any relation who looks after her Relation No She detests them all Except you Delafield raised his shoulders without an answering smile Yes she is good enough to except me You re one of her trustees aren t you At present the only one But while I have been in Persia the lawyers have done all that was necessary Lady Henry herself never writes a letter she can help I really have heard next to nothing about her for more than a year This morning I arrived from Paris sent round to ask if she would be at home and here I am Ah said Delafield looking down Well there is a lady who has been with her now for more than two years Ah yes yes I remember Old Lady Seathwaite told me last year Mademoiselle Le Breton isn t that her name What she reads to her and writes letters for her that kind of thing Yes that kind of thing said the other after a moment s hesitation Wasn t that a spot of rain Shall I charge these gentry And he led the way through the line of footmen which however was not of the usual Mayfair density For the party within was not a crush The hostess who had collected it was of opinion that the chief object of your house is not to entice the mob but to keep it out The two men mounted the stairs together What a charming house said the elder looking round him I remember when your uncle rebuilt it And before that I remember his mother the old Duchess here with her swarm of parsons Upon my word London tastes good after Teheran And the speaker threw back his fair grizzled head regarding the lights the house the guests with the air of a sensitive dog on a familiar scent Ah you re fresh home said Delafield laughing But let s just try to keep you here My dear fellow who is that at the top of the stairs The old diplomat paused In front of the pair some half a dozen guests were ascending and as many coming down At the top stood a tall lady in black receiving and dismissing Delafield looked up That is Mademoiselle Le Breton he said quietly She receives She distributes the guests Lady Henry generally establishes herself in the back drawing room It doesn t do for her to see too many people at once Mademoiselle arranges it Lady Henry must indeed be a good deal more helpless that I remember her murmured Sir Wilfrid in some astonishment She is physically

none	none	doubt of it Otherwise you won t find much change Shall I introduce you They were approaching a woman whose tall slenderness combined with a remarkable physiognomy arrested the old man s attention She was not handsome that surely was his first impression The cheek bones were too evident the chin and mouth too strong And yet the fine pallor of the skin the subtle black and white in which so to speak the head and face were drawn the life the animation of the whole were these not beauty or more than beauty As for the eyes the carriage of the head the rich magnificence of hair arranged with an artful eighteenth century freedom as Madame Vigee Le Brun might have worn it with the second glance the effect of them was such that Sir Wilfrid could not cease from looking at the lady they adorned It was an effect as of something over living over brilliant an animation an intensity so strong that at first beholding a by stander could scarcely tell whether it pleased him or no Mademoiselle Le Breton Sir Wilfrid Bury said Jacob Delafield introducing them Is she French thought the old diplomat puzzled And have I ever seen her before Lady Henry will be so glad said a low agreeable voice You are one of the old friends aren t you I have often heard her talk of you You are very good Certainly I am an old friend a connection also There was the slightest touch of stiffness in Sir Wilfrid s tone of which the next moment he was ashamed I am very sorry to hear that Lady Henry has grown so much more helpless since I left England She has to be careful of fatigue Two or three people go in to see her at a time She enjoys them more so In my opinion said Delafield one more device of milady s for getting precisely what she wants The young man s gay undertone together with the look which passed between him and Mademoiselle Le Breton added to Sir Wilfrid s stifled feeling of surprise You ll tell her Jacob that I m here He turned abruptly to the young man Certainly when mademoiselle allows me Ah here comes the Duchess said Delafield in another voice Mademoiselle Le Breton who had moved a few steps away from the stair head with Sir Wilfrid Bury turned hastily A slight small woman delicately fair and sparkling with diamonds was coming up the stairs alone My dear said the new comer holding out her hands eagerly to Mademoiselle Le Breton I felt I must just run in and have a look at you But Freddie says that I ve got to meet him at that tiresome Foreign Office So I can only stay ten minutes How are you then in a lower voice almost a whisper which however reached Sir Wilfrid Bury s ears worried to death Mademoiselle Le Breton raised eyes and shoulders for a moment then smiling put her finger to her lip You re coming to me to morrow afternoon said the Duchess in the same half whisper I don t think I can get away Nonsense My dear you must have some air and exercise Jacob will you see she comes Oh I m no good said that young man turning away Duchess you remember Sir Wilfrid Bury She would be an unnatural goddaughter if she didn t said that gentleman smiling She may be your cousin but I knew her before you did The young Duchess turned with a start Sir Wilfrid A sight for sair een When did you get back She put her slim hands into both of his and showered upon him all proper surprise and the greetings due to her father s oldest friend Voice gesture words all were equally amiable well trained and perfunctory Sir Wilfrid was well aware of it He was possessed of a fine straw colored mustache and long eyelashes of the same color Both eyelashes and mustache made a screen behind which as was well known their owner observed the world to remarkably good purpose He perceived the difference at once when the Duchess having done her social and family duty left him to return to Mademoiselle Le Breton It was such a bore you couldn t come this afternoon I wanted you to see the babe dance she s too great a duck And that Canadian girl came to sing The voice is magnificent but she has some tiresome tricks and I didn t know what to say to her As to the other music on the sixteenth I say can t we find a corner somewhere And the Duchess looked round the beautiful drawing room which she and her companions had just entered with a dissatisfied air Lady Henry you ll remember doesn t like corners said Mademoiselle Le Breton smiling Her tone delicately free and allusive once more drew Sir Wilfrid s curious eyes to her and he caught also the impatient gesture with which the Duchess received the remark Ah that s all right said Mademoiselle Le Breton suddenly turning round to himself Here is mister Montresor going on too I suppose to the Foreign Office Now there ll be some chance of getting at Lady Henry Sir Wilfrid looked down the drawing room to see the famous War Minister coming slowly through the well filled but not crowded room stopping now and then to exchange a greeting or a farewell and much hampered as it seemed in so doing by a pronounced and disfiguring short sight He was a strongly built man of more than middle height His iron gray hair deeply carved features and cavernous black eyes gave him the air of power that his reputation demanded On the other hand his difficulty of eyesight combined with the marked stoop of overwork produced a qualifying impression as of power teased and fettered a Samson among the Philistines My dear lady good night I must go and fight with wild beasts in Whitehall worse luck Ah Duchess All very well but you can t shirk either So saying mister Montresor shook hands with Mademoiselle Le Breton and smiled upon the Duchess both actions betraying precisely the same degree of playful intimacy How did you find Lady Henry said Mademoiselle Le Breton in a lowered voice Very well but very cross She scolds me perpetually I haven t got a skin left Ah Sir Wilfrid very glad to see you When did you arrive I thought I might perhaps find you at the Foreign Office I m going on there presently said Sir Wilfrid Ah but that s no good Dine with me to morrow night if you are free Excellent that s arranged Meanwhile send him in mademoiselle send him in He s fresh let him take his turn And the Minister grinning pointed backward over his shoulder towards an inner drawing room where the form of an old lady seated in a wheeled invalid chair between two other persons could be just dimly seen When the Bishop goes said Mademoiselle Le Breton with a laughing shake of the head But I told him not to stay long He won t want to Lady Henry pays no more attention to his cloth than to my gray hairs The rating she has just given me for my speech of last night Well good night dear lady good night You are better I think mister Montresor threw a look of scrutiny no less friendly than earnest at the lady to whom he was speaking and immediately afterwards Sir Wilfrid who was wedged in by an entering group of people caught the murmured words Consult me when you want me at any time Mademoiselle Le Breton raised her beautiful eyes to the speaker in a mute gratitude And five minutes ago I thought her plain said Sir Wilfrid to himself as he moved away Upon my word for a dame de compagnie that young woman is at her ease But where the deuce have I seen her or her double before He paused to look round the room a moment before yielding himself to one of the many possible conversations which as he saw it contained for him It was a stately panelled room of the last century furnished with that sure instinct both for comfort and beauty which a small minority of English rich people have always possessed Two glorious Gainsboroughs clad in the subtlest brilliance of pearly white and shimmering blue hung on either side of the square opening leading to the inner room The fair clouded head of a girl by Romney looked down from the panelling above the hearth A gowned abbe by Vandyck made the centre of another wall facing the Gainsboroughs The pictures were all famous and had been associated for generations with the Delafield name Beneath them the carpets were covered by fine eighteenth century furniture much of it of a florid Italian type subdued to a delicate and faded beauty by time and use The room was cleverly broken into various circles and centres for conversation the chairs were many and comfortable flowers sheltered tete a tetes or made a setting for beautiful faces the lamps were soft the air warm and light A cheerful hum of voices rose as of talk enjoyed for talking s sake and a general effect of intimacy or gayety of an unfeigned social pleasure seemed to issue from the charming scene and communicate itself to the onlooker And for a few moments before he was discovered and tumultuously annexed by a neighboring group Sir Wilfrid watched the progress of Mademoiselle Le Breton through the room with the young Duchess in her wake Wherever she moved she was met with smiles deference and eager attention Here and there she made an introduction she redistributed a group she moved a chair It was evident that her eye was everywhere that she knew every one her rule appeared to be at once absolute and welcome Presently when she herself accepted a seat she became as Sir Wilfrid perceived in the intervals of his own conversation the leader of the most animated circle in the room The Duchess with one delicate arm stretched along the back of Mademoiselle Le Breton s chair laughed and chattered two young girls in virginal white placed themselves on big gilt footstools at her feet man after man joined the group that stood or sat around her and in the centre of it the brilliance of her black head sharply seen against a background of rose brocade the grace of her tall form which was thin almost to emaciation the expressiveness of her strange features the animation of her gestures the sweetness of her voice drew the eyes and ears of half the room to Lady Henry s companion Presently there was a movement in the distance A man in knee breeches and silver buckled shoes emerged from the back drawing room Mademoiselle Le Breton rose at once and went to meet him The Bishop has had a long innings said an old general to Sir Wilfrid Bury And here is Mademoiselle Julie coming for you Sir Wilfrid rose in obedience to a smiling sign from the lady thus described and followed her floating black draperies towards the farther room Who are those two persons with Lady Henry he asked of his guide as they approached the penetralia where reigned the mistress of the house Ah I see one is doctor Meredith but the other The other is Captain Warkworth said Mademoiselle Le Breton Do you know him Warkworth Warkworth Ah of course the man who distinguished himself in the Mahsud expedition But why is he home again so soon Mademoiselle Le Breton smiled uncertainly I think he was invalided home she said with that manner at once restrained and gracious that Sir Wilfrid had already observed in her It was the manner of some one who counted and through all outward modesty knew it He wants something out of the ministry I remember the man was Sir Wilfrid s unspoken comment But they had entered the inner room Lady Henry looked round Over her wrinkled face now parchment white there shone a ray of pleasure sudden vehement and unfeigned Sir Wilfrid She made a movement as though to rise from her chair which was checked by his gesture and her helplessness Well this is good fortune she said as she put both her hands into both of his This morning as I was dressing I had a feeling that something agreeable was going to happen at last and then your note came Sit down there You know doctor Meredith He s as quarrelsome as ever Captain Warkworth Sir Wilfrid Bury The square headed spectacled journalist addressed as doctor Meredith greeted the new comer with the quiet cordiality of one for whom the day holds normally so many events that it is impossible to make much of any one of them And the man on the farther side of Lady Henry rose and bowed He was handsome and slenderly built The touch of impetuosity in his movement and the careless ease with which he carried his curly head somehow surprised Sir Wilfrid He had expected another sort of person I will give you my chair said the Captain pleasantly I have had more than my turn Shall I bring in the Duchess said Mademoiselle Le Breton in a low tone as she stooped over the back of Lady Henry s chair That lady turned abruptly to the speaker Let her do precisely as she pleases said a voice sharp lowered also but imperious like the drawing of a sword If she wants me she knows where I am She would be so sorry Ne jouez pas la comedie ma chere Where is Jacob In the other room Shall I tell him you want him I will send for him when it suits me Meanwhile as I particularly desired you to let me know when he arrived He has only been here twenty minutes murmured Mademoiselle Le Breton I thought while the Bishop was here you would not like to be disturbed You thought The speaker raised her shoulders fiercely Comme toujours vous vous etes trop bien amusee pour vous souvenir de mes instructions voila la verite doctor Meredith the whole imperious form swung round again towards the journalist unless you forbid me I shall tell Sir Wilfrid who it was reviewed his book for you Oh good Heavens I forbid you with all the energy of which I am capable said the startled journalist raising appealing hands while Lady Henry delighted with the effect produced by her sudden shaft sank back in her chair and grimly smiled Meanwhile Sir Wilfrid Bury s attention was still held by Mademoiselle Le Breton In the conversation between her and Lady Henry he had noticed an extraordinary change of manner on the part of the younger lady Her ease her grace had disappeared Her tone was humble her manner quivering with nervous anxiety And now as she stood a moment behind Lady Henry s chair one trembling hand steadying the other Sir Wilfrid was suddenly aware of yet another impression Lady Henry had treated her companion with a contemptuous and haughty ill humor Face to face with her mistress Mademoiselle Le Breton had borne it with submission almost with servility But now as she stood silent behind the blind old lady who had flouted her her wonderfully expressive face her delicate frame spoke for her with an energy not to be mistaken Her dark eyes blazed She stood for anger she breathed humiliation A dangerous woman and an extraordinary situation so ran his thought while aloud he was talking Central Asian politics and the latest Simla gossip to his two companions Meanwhile Captain Warkworth and Mademoiselle Le Breton returned together to the larger drawing room and before long doctor Meredith took his leave Lady Henry and her old friend were left alone I am sorry to hear that your sight troubles you more than of old said Sir Wilfrid drawing his chair a little nearer to her Lady Henry gave an impatient sigh Everything troubles me more than of old There is one disease from which no one recovers my dear Wilfrid and it has long since fastened upon me You mean old age Oh you are not so much to be pitied for that said Sir Wilfrid smiling Many people would exchange their youth for your old age Then the world contains more fools than even I give it credit for said Lady Henry with energy Why should any one exchange with me a poor blind gouty old creature with no chick or child to care whether she lives or dies Ah well that s a misfortune I won t deny that said Sir Wilfrid kindly But I come home after three years I find your house as thronged as ever in the old way I see half the most distinguished people in London in your drawing room It is sad that you can no longer receive them as you used to do but here you sit like a queen and people fight for their turn with you Lady Henry did not smile She laid one of her wrinkled hands upon his arm Is there any one else within hearing she said in a quick undertone Sir Wilfrid was touched by the vague helplessness of her gesture as she looked round her No one we are quite alone They are not here for me those people she said quivering with a motion of her hand towards the large drawing room My dear friend

none	none	They are here come closer I don t want to be overheard for a woman whom I took in in a moment of lunacy who is now robbing me of my best friends and supplanting me in my own house The pallor of the old face had lost all its waxen dignity The lowered voice hissed in his ear Sir Wilfrid startled and repelled hesitated for his reply Meanwhile Lady Henry who could not see it seemed at once to divine the change in his expression Oh I suppose you think I m mad she said impatiently or ridiculous Well see for yourself judge for yourself In fact I have been looking hungering for your return You have helped me through emergencies before now And I am in that state at present that I trust no one talk to no one except of banalites But I should be greatly obliged if you would come and listen to me and what is more advise me some day Most gladly said Sir Wilfrid embarrassed then after a pause Who is this lady I find installed here Lady Henry hesitated then shut her strong mouth on the temptation to speak It is not a story for to night she said and it would upset me But when you first saw her how did she strike you I saw at once said her companion after a pause that you had caught a personality A personality Lady Henry gave an angry laugh That s one way of putting it But physically did she remind you of no one Sir Wilfrid pondered a moment Yes Her face haunted me when I first saw it But

none	none	put any names Lady Henry gave a little snort of disappointment Well think You knew her mother quite well You have known her grandfather all your life If you re going on to the Foreign Office as I suppose you are you ll probably see him to night She is uncannily like him As to her father I don t know but he was a rolling stone of a creature you very likely came across him I knew her mother and her father said Sir Wilfrid astonished and pondering They had no right to be her mother and her father said Lady Henry with grimness Ah So if one does guess You ll please hold your tongue But at present I m completely mystified said Sir Wilfrid Perhaps it ll come to you later You ve a good memory generally for such things Anyway I can t tell you anything now But when ll you come again To morrow luncheon I really want you Would you be alone Certainly That at least I can still do lunch as I please and with whom I please Who is this coming in Ah you needn t tell me The old lady turned herself towards the entrance with a stiffening of the whole frame an instinctive and passionate dignity in her whole aspect which struck a thrill through her companion The little Duchess approached amid a flutter of satin and lace heralded by the scent of the Parma violets she wore in profusion at her breast and waist Her eye glanced uncertainly and she approached with daintiness like one stepping on mined ground Aunt Flora I must have just a minute I know no reason against your having ten if you want them said Lady Henry as she held out three fingers to the new comer You promised yesterday to come and give me a full account of the Devonshire House ball But it doesn t matter and you have forgotten No indeed I haven t said the Duchess embarrassed But you seemed so well employed to night with other people And now Now you are going on said Lady Henry with a most unfriendly suavity Freddie says I must said the other in the attitude of a protesting child Alors said Lady Henry lifting her hand We all know how obedient you are Good night The Duchess flushed She just touched her aunt s hand and then turning an indignant face on Sir Wilfrid she bade him farewell with an air which seemed to him intended to avenge upon his neutral person the treatment which from Lady Henry even so spoiled a child of fortune as herself could not resent Twenty minutes later Sir Wilfrid entered the first big room of the Foreign Office party He looked round him with a revival of the exhilaration he had felt on Lady Henry s staircase enjoying after his five years in Teheran after his long homeward journey by desert and sea even the common trivialities of the scene the lights the gilding the sparkle of jewels the scarlet of the uniforms the noise and movement of the well dressed crowd Then after this first physical thrill began the second stage of pleasure the recognitions and the greetings after long absence which show a man where he stands in the great world which sum up his past and forecast his future Sir Wilfrid had no reason to complain Cabinet ministers and great ladies members of Parliament and the permanent officials who govern but do not rule soldiers journalists barristers were all glad it seemed to grasp him by the hand He had returned with a record of difficult service brilliantly done and the English world rewarded him in its accustomed ways It was towards one o clock that he found himself in a crowd pressing towards the staircase in the wake of some departing royalties A tall man in front turned round to look for some ladies behind him from whom he had been separated in the crush Sir Wilfrid recognized old Lord Lackington the veteran of marvellous youth painter poet and sailor who as a gay naval lieutenant had entertained Byron in the AEgean whose fame as one of the raciest of naval reformers was in all the newspapers whose personality was still at seventy five charming to most women and challenging to most men As the old man turned he was still smiling as though in unison with something which had just been said to him and his black eyes under his singularly white hair searched the crowd with the animation of a lad of twenty Through the energy of his aspect the flame of life still burned as the evening sun through a fine sky The face had a faulty yet most arresting brilliance The mouth was disagreeable the chin common But the general effect was still magnificent Sir Wilfrid started He recalled the drawing room in Bruton Street the form and face of Mademoiselle Le Breton the sentences by which Lady Henry had tried to put him on the track His mind ran over past years and pieced together the recollections of a long past scandal Of course Of course he said to himself not without excitement She is not like her mother but she has all the typical points of her mother s race II It was a cold clear morning in February with a little pale sunshine playing on the bare trees of the Park 
6849-69603-0000	train-other-500	Sir Wilfrid walking southward from the Marble Arch to his luncheon with Lady Henry was gladly conscious of the warmth of his fur collared coat though none the less ready to envy careless youth as it crossed his path now and then great coatless and ruddy
6849-69603-0001	train-other-500	courting the keen air Just as he was about to make his exit towards Mount Street he became aware of two persons walking southward like himself but on the other side of the roadway He soon identified Captain Warkworth
none	none	 in the slim soldierly figure of the man 
6849-69603-0002	train-other-500	And the lady There also with the help of his glasses he was soon informed Her trim black hat and her black cloth costume seemed to him to have a becoming and fashionable simplicity and she moved in morning dress with the same ease and freedom
6849-69603-0003	train-other-500	that had distinguished her in Lady Henry s drawing room the night before He asked himself whether he should interrupt Mademoiselle Le Breton with a view to escorting her to Bruton Street He understood indeed
6849-69603-0004	train-other-500	that he and Lady Henry were to be alone at luncheon Mademoiselle Julie had no doubt her own quarters and attendants But she seemed to be on her way home An opportunity for some
6849-69603-0005	train-other-500	perhaps exploratory conversation with her before he found himself face to face with Lady Henry seemed to him not undesirable But he quickly decided to walk on Mademoiselle Le Breton and Captain Warkworth paused in their walk
6849-69603-0006	train-other-500	about no doubt to say good bye but very clearly loath to say it They were indeed in earnest conversation The Captain spoke with eagerness Mademoiselle Julie with downcast eyes smiled and listened
6849-69603-0007	train-other-500	Is the fellow making love to her thought the old man in some astonishment as he turned away
none	none	 Hardly the place for it either one would suppose 
6849-69603-0008	train-other-500	He vaguely thought that he would both sound and warn Lady Henry Warn her of what
none	none	 He happened on the way home to have been thrown with a couple of Indian officers whose personal opinion of Harry Warkworth was not a very high one in spite of the brilliant distinction which the young man had earned for himself in the Afridi campaign 
6849-69603-0009	train-other-500	just closed But how was he to hand that sort of thing on to Lady Henry
none	none	 and because he happened to have seen her lady companion and Harry Warkworth together 
6849-69603-0010	train-other-500	No doubt Mademoiselle Julie was on her employer s business Yet
none	none	 the little encounter added somehow to his already lively curiosity on the subject of Lady Henry s companion Thanks to a remarkable physical resemblance he was practically certain that he had guessed the secret 
6849-69603-0011	train-other-500	of Mademoiselle Le Breton s parentage At any rate on the supposition that he had his thoughts began to occupy themselves with the story to which his guess pointed Some thirty years before he had known both in London and in Italy
6849-69603-0012	train-other-500	a certain Colonel Delaney and his wife once Lady Rose Chantrey the favorite daughter of Lord Lackington They were not a happy couple She was a woman of great intelligence but endowed with one of those natures sensitive plastic
6849-69603-0013	train-other-500	eager to search out and to challenge life which bring their possessors some great joys hardly to be balanced against a final sum of pain Her husband absorbed in his military life
none	none	 silent narrowly able and governed by a strict Anglicanism 
6849-69603-0014	train-other-500	that seemed to carry with it innumerable shalts and shalt nots disagreeable to the natural man or woman soon found her a tiring and trying companion She asked him for what he could not give
none	none	 she coquetted with questions he thought it impious to raise 
6849-69603-0015	train-other-500	the persons she made friends with were distasteful to him and without complaining he soon grew to think it intolerable
none	none	 that a woman married to a soldier should care so little for his professional interests 
6849-69603-0016	train-other-500	and ambitions Though when she pretended to care for them she annoyed him if possible still more As for Lady Rose she went through all the familiar emotions of the femme incomprise And with the familiar result
6849-69603-0017	train-other-500	There presently appeared in the house a man of good family thirty five or so traveller painter and dreamer with fine long drawn features bronzed by the sun of the East and bringing with him the reputation of having plotted
6849-69603-0018	train-other-500	and fought for most of the lost causes of our generation including several which had led him into conflict with British authorities and British officials To Colonel Delaney he was an agitator if not a rebel
6849-69603-0019	train-other-500	and the careless pungency of his talk soon classed him as an atheist besides In the case of Lady Rose this man s free and generous nature his independence of money and convention his passion for the things of the mind his contempt for the mode
6849-69603-0020	train-other-500	whether in dress or politics his light evasions of the red tape of life as of something that no one could reasonably expect of a vagabond like himself these things presently transformed a woman in despair
none	none	 to a woman in revolt 
6849-69603-0021	train-other-500	She fell in love with an intensity befitting her true temperament and with a stubbornness that bore witness to the dreary failure of her marriage Marriott Dalrymple returned her love and nothing in his view of life predisposed him
6849-69603-0022	train-other-500	to put what probably appeared to him
none	none	 a mere legality before the happiness of two people meant for each other 
6849-69603-0023	train-other-500	There were no children of the Delaney marriage and in his belief the husband had enjoyed too long a companionship he had never truly deserved So Lady Rose faced her husband told him the truth and left him
6849-69603-0024	train-other-500	She and Dalrymple went to live in Belgium in a small country house some twenty or thirty miles from Brussels They severed themselves from England they asked nothing more of English life Lady Rose suffered from the breach with her father for Lord Lackington never saw her again
none	none	 And there was a young sister whom she had brought up 
6849-69603-0025	train-other-500	whose image could often rouse in her a sense of loss that showed itself in occasional spells of silence and tears But substantially she never repented what she had done although Colonel Delaney made the penalties of it as heavy as he could
6849-69603-0026	train-other-500	Like Karennine in Tolstoy s great novel he refused to sue for a divorce and for something of the same reasons Divorce was in itself impious and sin should not be made easy
6849-69603-0027	train-other-500	He was at any time ready to take back his wife so far as the protection of his name and roof were concerned should she penitently return to him So the child that was presently born to Lady Rose could not be legitimized
6849-69603-0028	train-other-500	Sir Wilfrid stopped short at the Park end of Bruton Street with a start of memory I saw it once I remember now perfectly And he went on to recall a bygone moment in the Brussels Gallery
6849-69603-0029	train-other-500	when as he was standing before the great Quintin Matsys he was accosted with sudden careless familiarity by a thin shabbily dressed man in whose dark distinction made still more fantastic and conspicuous
6849-69603-0030	train-other-500	by the fever and the emaciation of consumption he recognized at once Marriott Dalrymple He remembered certain fragments of their talk about the pictures the easy mastery now brusque now poetic
6849-69603-0031	train-other-500	with which Dalrymple had shown him the treasures of the gallery in the manner of one whose learning was merely the food of fancy the stuff on which imagination and reverie grew rich Then suddenly his own question And Lady Rose
6849-69603-0032	train-other-500	And Dalrymple s quiet Very well She d see you I think if you want to come
none	none	 She has scarcely seen an English person in the last three years 
6849-69603-0033	train-other-500	And as when a gleam searches out some blurred corner of a landscape there returned upon him his visit to the pair in their country home He recalled the small eighteenth century house the chateau of the village built on the French model with its high mansarde roof
6849-69603-0034	train-other-500	the shabby stateliness of its architecture
none	none	 matching plaintively with the field of beet root that grew up to its very walls 
6849-69603-0035	train-other-500	around it the flat rich fields with their thin lines of poplars the slow canalized streams the unlovely farms and cottages the mire of the lanes and shrouding all
6849-69603-0036	train-other-500	a hot autumn mist sweeping slowly through the damp meadows and blotting all cheerfulness from the sun
none	none	 And in the midst of this pale landscape 
6849-69603-0037	train-other-500	so full of ragged edges to an English eye the English couple with their books their child and a pair of Flemish servants
none	none	 It had been evident to him at once that their circumstances 
6849-69603-0038	train-other-500	were those of poverty Lady Rose s small fortune indeed had been already mostly spent on causes of many kinds in many countries She and Dalrymple were almost vegetarians and wine never entered the house save for the servants
6849-69603-0039	train-other-500	who seemed to regard their employers with a real but half contemptuous affection He remembered the scanty ill cooked luncheon the difficulty in providing a few extra knives and forks the wrangling with the old bonne housekeeper
6849-69603-0040	train-other-500	which was necessary before serviettes could be produced And afterwards the library with its deal shelves from floor to ceiling put up by Dalrymple himself its bare polished floor Dalrymple s table and chair on one side of the open hearth
none	none	 Lady Rose s on the other on his table the sheets of verse translation from AEschylus and Euripides 
6849-69603-0041	train-other-500	which represented his favorite hobby on hers the socialist and economical books they both studied and the English or French poets they both loved The walls hung with the faded damask of a past generation were decorated with a strange crop of pictures
6849-69603-0042	train-other-500	pinned carelessly into the silk
none	none	 photographs or newspaper 
6849-69603-0043	train-other-500	portraits of modern men and women representing all possible revolt against authority political religious even scientific the Everlasting No of an untiring and ubiquitous dissent Finally in the centre of the polished floor
6849-69603-0044	train-other-500	the strange child whom Lady Rose had gone to fetch after lunch with its high crest of black hair its large jealous eyes its elfin hands
none	none	 and the sudden smile with which after half an hour of silence and apparent scorn it had rewarded Sir Wilfrid s advances He saw himself sitting bewitched beside it 
6849-69603-0045	train-other-500	Poor Lady Rose He remembered her as he and she parted at the gate of the neglected garden the anguish in her eyes as they turned to look after the bent and shrunken figure of Dalrymple carrying the child back to the house
none	none	 If you meet any of his old friends don t don t say anything We ve just saved enough money to go to Sicily for the winter 
6849-69603-0046	train-other-500	that ll set him right And then barely a year later the line in a London newspaper which had reached him at Madrid chronicling the death of Marriott Dalrymple as of a man once on the threshold of fame
6849-69603-0047	train-other-500	but long since exiled from the thoughts of practical men Lady Rose too was dead many years since so much he knew But how and where
none	none	 And the child She was now Mademoiselle Le Breton 
6849-69603-0048	train-other-500	the centre and apparently the chief attraction of Lady Henry s once famous salon And by Jove several of her kinsfolk there relations of the mother or the father if what I suppose is true thought Sir Wilfrid remembering one or two of the guests
6849-69603-0049	train-other-500	Were they was she aware of it
none	none	 The old man strode on full of a growing eagerness 
6849-69603-0050	train-other-500	and was soon on Lady Henry s doorstep Her ladyship is in the dining room said the butler and Sir Wilfrid was ushered there straight Good morning Wilfrid said the old lady raising herself on her silver headed sticks as he entered
none	none	 I prefer to come down stairs by myself 
6849-69603-0051	train-other-500	The more infirm I am the less I like it and to be helped enrages me Sit down Lunch is ready and I give you leave to eat some And you
6849-69603-0052	train-other-500	said Sir Wilfrid as they seated themselves almost side by side at the large round table in the large dingy room The old lady shook her head All the world eats too much
none	none	 I was brought up with people who lunched on a biscuit and a glass of sherry 
6849-69603-0053	train-other-500	Lord Russell Lord Palmerston suggested Sir Wilfrid attacking his own lunch meanwhile with unabashed vigor
none	none	 That sort 
6849-69603-0054	train-other-500	I wish we had their like now Their successors don t please you Lady Henry shook her head The Tories have gone to the deuce and there are no longer enough Whigs even to do that
6849-69603-0055	train-other-500	I wouldn t read the newspapers at all if I could help it But I do So I understand said Sir Wilfrid you let Montresor know it last night Montresor said Lady Henry with a contemptuous movement
none	none	 What a poseur 
6849-69603-0056	train-other-500	He lets the army go to ruin I understand while he joins Dante societies Sir Wilfrid raised his eyebrows I think if I were you I should have some lunch he said gently pushing the admirable salmi which the butler had left in front of him towards his old friend
6849-69603-0057	train-other-500	Lady Henry laughed Oh my temper will be better presently when those men are gone she nodded towards the butler and footman in the distance and I can have my say Sir Wilfrid hurried his meal as much as Lady Henry
none	none	 who as it turned out was not at all minded to starve him would allow 
6849-69603-0058	train-other-500	She meanwhile talked politics and gossip to him with her old caustic force nibbling a dry biscuit at intervals and sipping a cup of coffee She was a wilful characteristic figure as she sat there beneath her own portrait as a bride
6849-69603-0059	train-other-500	which hung on the wall behind her The portrait represented a very young woman with plentiful brown hair gathered into a knot on the top of her head a high waist a blue waist ribbon and inflated sleeves Handsome imperious
6849-69603-0060	train-other-500	the corners of the mouth well down the look straight and daring the Lady Henry of the picture a bride of nineteen was already formidable And the old woman sitting beneath it with the strong white hair which
6849-69603-0061	train-other-500	the ample cap found some difficulty even now in taming and confining the droop of the mouth accentuated the nose more masterful the double chin grown evident the light of the eyes gone out breathed pride
6849-69603-0062	train-other-500	and will from every feature of her still handsome face pride of race and pride of intellect combined with a hundred other subtler and smaller prides that only an intimate knowledge of her could detect
6849-69603-0063	train-other-500	The brow and eyes so beautiful in the picture were however still agreeable in the living woman if generosity lingered anywhere it was in them The door was hardly closed upon the servants
none	none	 when she bent forward Well have you guessed Sir Wilfrid looked at her thoughtfully as he stirred the sugar in his coffee I think so he said She is Lady Rose Delaney s daughter Lady Henry gave a sudden laugh I hardly expected you to guess What helped you First your own hints 
6849-69603-0064	train-other-500	Then the strange feeling I had that I had seen the face or some face just like it before And lastly at the Foreign Office I caught sight for a moment of Lord Lackington That finished it Ah said Lady Henry with a nod
none	none	 Yes that likeness is extraordinary Isn t it amazing that that foolish old man has never perceived it 
6849-69603-0065	train-other-500	He knows nothing Oh nothing
none	none	 Nobody does 
6849-69603-0066	train-other-500	However that ll do presently But Lord Lackington comes here mumbles about his music and his water colors and his flirtations seventy four if you please last birthday
none	none	 talks about himself endlessly to Julie or to me 
6849-69603-0067	train-other-500	whoever comes handy and never has an inkling an idea
none	none	 And she Oh she knows I should rather think she does 
6849-69603-0068	train-other-500	And Lady Henry pushed away her coffee cup with the ill suppressed vehemence which any mention of her companion seemed to produce in her Well now I suppose you d like to hear the story Wait a minute
6849-69603-0069	train-other-500	It ll surprise you to hear that I not only knew this lady s mother and father but that I ve seen her herself before
none	none	 You 
6849-69603-0070	train-other-500	Lady Henry looked incredulous
none	none	 I never told you of my visit to that menage 
6849-69603-0071	train-other-500	four and twenty years ago Never that I remember
none	none	 But if you had I should have forgotten What did they matter to me then 
6849-69603-0072	train-other-500	I myself only saw Lady Rose once so far as I remember before she misconducted herself And afterwards well one doesn t trouble one s self about the women that have gone under Something lightened behind Sir Wilfrid s straw colored lashes He bent over his coffee cup
none	none	 and daintily knocked off the end of his cigarette with a beringed little 
6849-69603-0073	train-other-500	finger The women who have not been able to pull up Lady Henry paused
none	none	 If you like to put it so 
6849-69603-0074	train-other-500	she said at last Sir Wilfrid did not raise his eyes Lady Henry took up her strongest glasses from the table and put them on But it was pitifully evident that even so equipped she saw but little
none	none	 and that her strong nature fretted perpetually against the physical infirmity that teased it 
6849-69603-0075	train-other-500	Nevertheless some unspoken communication passed between them and Sir Wilfrid knew that he had effectually held up a protecting hand for Lady Rose
none	none	 Well let me tell you my tale first he said 
6849-69603-0076	train-other-500	and gave the little reminiscence in full When he described the child Lady Henry listened eagerly
none	none	 Hm she said when he came to an end 
6849-69603-0077	train-other-500	she was jealous you say of her mother s attentions to you She watched you and in the end she took possession of you Much the same creature apparently then as now No moral please till the tale is done
none	none	 said Sir Wilfrid smiling It s your turn Lady Henry s face grew sombre Illustration LADY HENRY LISTENED EAGERLY All very well she said What did your tale matter to you As for mine The substance of hers was as follows put into chronological order Lady Rose had lived some ten years after Dalrymple s death 
6849-69603-0078	train-other-500	That time she passed in great poverty in some chambres garnies at Bruges with her little girl and an old Madame Le Breton the maid housekeeper and general factotum who had served them in the country This woman
6849-69603-0079	train-other-500	though of a peevish grumbling temper was faithful affectionate and not without education She was certainly attached to little Julie whose nurse she had been during a short period of her infancy It was natural that Lady Rose should leave the child to her care
6849-69603-0080	train-other-500	Indeed she had no choice An old Ursuline nun and a kind priest
none	none	 who at the nun s instigation occasionally came to see her in the hopes of converting her were her only other friends in the world She wrote however to her father shortly before her death 
6849-69603-0081	train-other-500	bidding him good bye and asking him to do something for the child She is wonderfully like you so ran part of the letter You won t ever acknowledge her I know That is your strange code
6849-69603-0082	train-other-500	But at least give her what will keep her from want till she can earn her living Her old nurse will take care of her I have taught her so far She is already very clever When I am gone she will attend one of the convent schools here
none	none	 And I have found an honest lawyer who will receive and pay out money 
6849-69603-0083	train-other-500	To this letter Lord Lackington replied promising to come over and see his daughter But an attack of gout delayed him and before he was out of his room Lady Rose was dead Then he no longer talked of coming over
6849-69603-0084	train-other-500	and his solicitors arranged matters
none	none	 An allowance of a hundred pounds a year was made to Madame Le Breton 
6849-69603-0085	train-other-500	through the honest lawyer whom Lady Rose had found for the benefit of Julie Dalrymple the capital value to be handed over to that young lady herself on the attainment of her eighteenth birthday always provided that neither she nor anybody on her behalf
6849-69603-0086	train-other-500	made any further claim on the Lackington family that her relationship to them was dropped and her mother s history buried in oblivion Accordingly the girl grew to maturity in Bruges By the lawyer s advice after her mother s death
6849-69603-0087	train-other-500	she took the name of her old gouvernante and was known thenceforward as Julie Le Breton The Ursuline nuns to whose school she was sent took the precaution after her mother s death
6849-69603-0088	train-other-500	of having her baptized straightway into the Catholic faith and she made her premiere communion in their church In the course of a few years she became a remarkable girl the source of many anxieties to the nuns
6849-69603-0089	train-other-500	For she was not only too clever for their teaching and an inborn sceptic but wherever she appeared she produced parties and the passions of parties And though as she grew older she showed much adroitness in managing those who were hostile to her she was never without enemies
none	none	 and intrigues followed her I might have been warned in time said Lady Henry in whose wrinkled cheeks 
6849-69603-0090	train-other-500	a sharp and feverish color had sprung up as her story approached the moment of her own personal acquaintance with Mademoiselle Le Breton For one or two of the nuns when I saw them in Bruges before the bargain was finally struck were candid enough However
none	none	 now I come to the moment when I first set 
6849-69603-0091	train-other-500	eyes on her You know my little place in Surrey About a mile from me is a manor house belonging to an old Catholic family terribly devout and as poor as church mice They sent their daughters to school in Bruges
6849-69603-0092	train-other-500	One summer holiday these girls brought home with them Julie Dalrymple as their quasi holiday governess It was three years ago
none	none	 I had just seen Liebreich He told me that I should soon be blind and naturally it was a blow to me 
6849-69603-0093	train-other-500	Sir Wilfrid made a murmur of sympathy Oh don t pity me I don t pity other people
none	none	 This odious body of ours has got to wear out sometime it s in the bargain 
6849-69603-0094	train-other-500	Still just then I was low There are two things I care about one is talk with the people that amuse me and the other is the reading of French books I didn t see how I was going to keep my circle here together and my own mind in decent repair
6849-69603-0095	train-other-500	unless I could find somebody to be eyes for me and to read to me And as I m a bundle of nerves and I never was agreeable to illiterate people nor they to me I was rather put to it Well one day these girls and their mother came over to tea
6849-69603-0096	train-other-500	and as you guess of course they brought Mademoiselle Le Breton with them I had asked them to come but when they arrived I was bored and cross and like a sick dog in a hole And then as you have seen her I suppose you can guess what happened
6849-69603-0097	train-other-500	You discovered an exceptional person Lady Henry laughed I was limed there and then old bird as I am I was first struck with the girl s appearance
none	none	 une belle laide 
6849-69603-0098	train-other-500	with every movement just as it ought to be infinitely more attractive to me than any pink and white beauty It turned out that she had just been for a month in Paris with another school fellow Something she said about a new play suddenly made me look at her
none	none	 Venez vous asseoir ici mademoiselle s il vous plait 
6849-69603-0099	train-other-500	pres de moi I said to her I can hear my own voice now poor fool
none	none	 and see her flush up Ah 
6849-69603-0100	train-other-500	Lady Henry s interjection dropped to a note of rage that almost upset Sir Wilfrid s gravity but he restrained himself and she resumed We talked for two hours
6849-69603-0101	train-other-500	it seemed to me ten minutes I sent the others out to the gardens She stayed with me The new French books the theatre poems plays novels memoirs even politics she could talk of them all or rather
6849-69603-0102	train-other-500	for mark you that s her gift she made me talk It seemed to me I had not been so brilliant for months I was as good in fact as I had ever been The difficulty in England is to find any one to keep up the ball She does it to perfection
6849-69603-0103	train-other-500	She never throws to win never but so as to leave you all the chances You make a brilliant stroke she applauds and in a moment she has arranged you another
none	none	 Oh it is the most extraordinary gift of conversation and she never says a thing that you want to remember 
6849-69603-0104	train-other-500	There was a silence Lady Henry s old fingers drummed restlessly on the table Her memory seemed to be wandering angrily among her first experiences of the lady they were discussing Well said Sir Wilfrid at last
6849-69603-0105	train-other-500	so you engaged her as lectrice and thought yourself very lucky Oh don t suppose that I was quite an idiot I made some inquiries I bored myself to death with civilities to the stupid family she was staying with and presently
6849-69603-0106	train-other-500	I made her stay with me And of course I soon saw there was a history
none	none	 She possessed jewels laces little personal belongings of various kinds that wanted explaining 
6849-69603-0107	train-other-500	So I laid traps for her I let her also perceive whither my own plans were drifting She did not wait to let me force her hand She made up her mind One day I found left carelessly on the drawing room table a volume of Saint Simon
6849-69603-0108	train-other-500	beautifully bound in old French morocco with something thrust between the leaves I opened it On the fly leaf was written the name Marriott Dalrymple
none	none	 and the leaves opened 
6849-69603-0109	train-other-500	a little farther on a miniature of Lady Rose Delaney So Apparently it was her traps that worked said Sir Wilfrid smiling Lady Henry returned the smile unwillingly as one loath to acknowledge her own folly
6849-69603-0110	train-other-500	I don t know that I was trapped We both desired to come to close quarters Anyway she soon showed me books letters from Lady Rose from Dalrymple Lord Lackington the evidence was complete Very well I said
6849-69603-0111	train-other-500	it isn t your fault All the better if you are well born I am not a person of prejudices But understand
none	none	 if you come to me there must be no question of worrying your relations 
6849-69603-0112	train-other-500	There are scores of them in London I know them all
none	none	 or nearly all and of course you ll come across them 
6849-69603-0113	train-other-500	But unless you can hold your tongue don t come to me
none	none	 Julie Dalrymple has disappeared and I ll be no party to her resurrection 
6849-69603-0114	train-other-500	If Julie Le Breton becomes an inmate of my house there shall be no raking up of scandals much better left in their graves If you haven t got a proper parentage consistently thought out we must invent one I hope
6849-69603-0115	train-other-500	I may some day be favored with it said Sir Wilfrid Lady Henry laughed uncomfortably Oh I ve had to tell lies she said plenty of them What
none	none	 It was you that told the lies 
6849-69603-0116	train-other-500	Lady Henry s look flashed The open and honest ones she said defiantly Well said Sir Wilfrid regretfully
none	none	 some sort were indispensable 
6849-69603-0117	train-other-500	So she came How long ago Three years For the first half of that time I did nothing but plume myself on my good fortune
none	none	 I said to myself that if I had searched Europe through I could not have fared better 
6849-69603-0118	train-other-500	My household my friends my daily ways she fitted into them all to perfection
none	none	 I told people that I had discovered her through a Belgian acquaintance 
6849-69603-0119	train-other-500	Every one was amazed at her manners her intelligence She was perfectly modest perfectly well behaved The old Duke he died six months after she came to me was charmed with her
none	none	 Montresor Meredith Lord Robert 
6849-69603-0120	train-other-500	all my habitues congratulated me
none	none	 Such cultivation such charm such savoir faire Where on earth did you pick up such a treasure 
6849-69603-0121	train-other-500	What are her antecedents et cetera et cetera So then of course I hope no more than were absolutely necessary said Sir Wilfrid hastily I had to do it well said Lady Henry with decision I can t say I didn t
none	none	 That state of things lasted more or less about a year and a half And by now where do you think it has all worked out 
6849-69603-0122	train-other-500	You gave me a few hints last night said Sir Wilfrid hesitating Lady Henry pushed her chair back from the table Her hands trembled on her stick Hints she said scornfully
6849-69603-0123	train-other-500	I m long past hints I told you last night and I repeat that woman has stripped me of
none	none	 all my friends 
6849-69603-0124	train-other-500	She has intrigued with them all in turn against me She has done the same even with my servants I can trust none of them where she is concerned I am alone in my own house My blindness makes me her tool her plaything As for my salon
6849-69603-0125	train-other-500	as you call it it has become hers I am a mere courtesy figurehead
none	none	 her chaperon in fact I provide the house the footmen the champagne the guests are hers 
6849-69603-0126	train-other-500	And she has done this by constant intrigue and deception by flattery by lying The old face had become purple Lady Henry breathed hard My dear friend said Sir Wilfrid quickly laying a calming hand on her arm
6849-69603-0127	train-other-500	don t let this trouble you so Dismiss her And accept solitary confinement for the rest of my days I haven t the courage yet said Lady Henry bitterly You don t know how I have been isolated and betrayed
none	none	 And I haven t told you the worst of all Listen Do you know whom she has got into her toils 
6849-69603-0128	train-other-500	She paused drawing herself rigidly erect Sir Wilfrid looking up sharply remembered the little scene in the Park and waited Did you have any opportunity last night said Lady Henry slowly
6849-69603-0129	train-other-500	of observing her and Jacob Delafield She spoke with passionate intensity her frowning brows meeting above a pair of eyes that struggled to see and could not But the effect she listened for was not produced
6849-69603-0130	train-other-500	Sir Wilfrid drew back uncertainly
none	none	 Jacob Delafield 
6849-69603-0131	train-other-500	he said Jacob Delafield Are you sure Sure cried Lady Henry angrily Then disdaining to support her statement she went on
none	none	 He hesitates But she ll soon make an end of that And do you realize what that means what Jacob s possibilities are 
6849-69603-0132	train-other-500	Kindly recollect that Chudleigh has one boy
none	none	 one sickly tuberculous boy who might die any day 
6849-69603-0133	train-other-500	And Chudleigh himself is a poor life Jacob has more than a good chance ninety chances out of a hundred she ground the words out with emphasis of inheriting
none	none	 the dukedom Good gracious 
6849-69603-0134	train-other-500	said Sir Wilfrid throwing away his cigarette There said Lady Henry in sombre triumph Now you can understand what I have brought on poor Henry s family A low knock was heard at the door Come in
6849-69603-0135	train-other-500	said Lady Henry impatiently The door opened and Mademoiselle Le Breton appeared on the threshold carrying a small gray terrier under each arm I thought I had better tell you she said humbly
none	none	 that I am taking the dogs out Shall I get some fresh wool for your knitting III It was nearly four o clock Sir Wilfrid had just closed Lady Henry s door behind him and was again walking along Bruton Street He was thinking of the little scene of Mademoiselle Le Breton s appearance on the threshold of Lady Henry s dining room of the insolent sharpness with which Lady Henry had given her order upon order as to the dogs the books for the circulating library a message for her dressmaker certain directions for the tradesmen et cetera et cetera as though for the mere purpose of putting the woman who had dared to be her rival in her right place before Sir Wilfrid Bury And at the end as she was departing Mademoiselle Le Breton trusting no doubt to Lady Henry s blindness had turned towards himself raising her downcast eyes upon him suddenly with a proud passionate look Her lips had moved Sir Wilfrid had half risen from his chair Then quickly the door had closed upon her Sir Wilfrid could not think of it without a touch of excitement Was she reminding me of Gherardtsloo he said to himself Upon my word I must find some means of conversation with her in spite of Lady Henry He walked towards Bond Street pondering the situation of the two women the impotent jealousy and rancor with which Lady Henry was devoured the domestic slavery contrasted with the social power of Mademoiselle Le Breton Through the obscurity and difficulty of circumstance how marked was the conscience of race in her and as he also thought of high intelligence The old man was deeply interested He felt a certain indulgent pity for his lifelong friend Lady Henry but he could not get Mademoiselle Julie out of his head Why on earth does she stay where she is He had asked the same question of Lady Henry who had contemptuously replied Because she likes the flesh pots and won t give them up No doubt she doesn t find my manners agreeable but she knows very well that she wouldn t get the chances she gets in my house anywhere else I give her a foothold She ll not risk it for a few sour speeches on my part I may say what I like to her and I intend to say what I like Besides you watch her and see whether she s made for poverty She takes to luxury as a fish to water What would she be if she left me A little visiting teacher perhaps in a Bloomsbury lodging That s not her line at all But somebody else might employ her as you do Sir Wilfrid had suggested You forget I should be asked for a character said Lady Henry Oh I admit there are possibilities on her side That silly goose Evelyn Crowborough would have taken her in but I had a few words with Crowborough and he put his foot down He told his wife he didn t want an intriguing foreigner to live with them No for the present we are chained to each other I can t get rid of her and she doesn t want to get rid of me Of course things might become intolerable for either of us But at present self interest on both sides keeps us going Oh don t tell me the thing is odious I know it Every day she stays in the house I become a more abominable old woman A more exacting one certainly Sir Wilfrid thought with pity and amusement of the commissions with which Mademoiselle Julie had been loaded She earns her money any way he thought Those things will take her a hard afternoon s work But bless my soul he paused in his walk what about that engagement to Duchess Evelyn that I heard her make Not a word by the way to Lady Henry about it Oh this is amusing He went meditatively on his way and presently turned into his club to write some letters But at five o clock he emerged and told a hansom to drive him to Grosvenor Square He alighted at the great red brick mansion of the Crowboroughs and asked for the Duchess The magnificent person presiding over the hall an old family retainer remembered him and made no difficulty about admitting him Anybody with her grace he inquired as the man handed him over to the footman who was to usher him up stairs Only Miss Le Breton and mister Delafield Sir Wilfrid Her grace told me to say not at home this afternoon but I am sure sir she will see you Sir Wilfrid smiled As he entered the outer drawing room the Duchess and the group surrounding her did not immediately perceive the footman nor himself and he had a few moments in which to take in a charming scene A baby girl in a white satin gown down to her heels and a white satin cap lace edged and tied under her chin was holding out her tiny skirt with one hand and dancing before the Duchess and Miss Le Breton who was at the piano The child s other hand held up a morsel of biscuit wherewith she directed the movements of her partner a small black spitz of a slim and silky elegance who straining on his hind legs his eager attention fixed upon the biscuit followed every movement of his small mistress while she her large blue eyes now solemn now triumphant her fair hair escaping from her cap in fluttering curls her dainty feet pointed her dimpled arm upraised repeated in living grace the picture of her great great grandmother which hung on the wall in front of her a masterpiece from Reynolds s happiest hours Behind Mademoiselle Le Breton stood Jacob Delafield while the Duchess in a low chair beside them beat time gayly to the gavotte that Mademoiselle Julie was playing and laughed encouragement and applause to the child in front of her She herself with her cloud of fair hair the delicate pink and white of her skin the laughing lips and small white hands that rose and fell with the baby steps seemed little more than a child Her pale blue dress for which she had just exchanged her winter walking costume fell round her in sweeping folds of lace and silk a French fairy dressed by Woerth she was possessed by a wild gayety and her silvery laugh held the room Beside her Julie Le Breton very thin very tall very dark was laughing too The eyes which Sir Wilfrid had lately seen so full of pride were now alive with pleasure Jacob Delafield also from behind grinned applause or shouted to the babe Brava Tottie well done Three people a baby and a dog more intimately pleased with one another s society it would have been difficult to discover Sir Wilfrid The Duchess sprang up astonished and in a moment to Sir Wilfrid s chagrin the little scene fell to pieces The child dropped on the floor defending herself and the biscuit as best she could against the wild snatches of the dog Delafield composed his face in a moment to its usual taciturnity Mademoiselle Le Breton rose from the piano No no said Sir Wilfrid stopping short and holding up a deprecating hand Too bad Go on Oh we were only fooling with baby said the Duchess It is high time she went to her nurse Sit here Sir Wilfrid Julie will you take the babe or shall I ring for missus Robson I ll take her said Mademoiselle Le Breton She knelt down by the child who rose with alacrity Catching her skirts round her with one eye half laughing half timorous turned over her shoulder towards the dog the baby made a wild spring into Mademoiselle Julie s arms tucking up her feet instantly with a shriek of delight out of the dog s way Then she nestled her fair head down upon her bearer s shoulder and throbbing with joy and mischief was carried away Sir Wilfrid hat in hand stood for a moment watching the pair A bygone marriage uniting the Lackington family with that of the Duchess had just occurred to him in some bewilderment He sat down beside his hostess while she made him some tea But no sooner had the door of the farther drawing room closed behind Mademoiselle Le Breton than with a dart of all her lively person she pounced upon him Well so Aunt Flora has been complaining to you Sir Wilfrid s cup remained suspended in his hand He glanced first at the speaker and then at Jacob Delafield Oh Jacob knows all about it said the Duchess eagerly This is Julie s headquarters we are on her staff You come from the enemy Sir Wilfrid took out his white silk handkerchief and waved it Here is my flag of truce he said Treat me well We are only too anxious to parley with you said the Duchess laughing Aren t we Jacob Then she drew closer What has Aunt Flora been saying to you Sir Wilfrid paused As he sat there apparently studying his boots his blond hair now nearly gray carefully parted in the middle above his benevolent brow he might have been reckoned a tame and manageable person Jacob Delafield however knew him of old I don t think that s fair said Sir Wilfrid at last looking up I m the new comer I ought to be allowed the questions Go on said the Duchess her chin on her hand Jacob and I will answer all we know Delafield nodded Sir Wilfrid looking from one to the other quickly reminded himself that they had been playmates from the cradle or might have been Well in the first place he said slowly I am lost in admiration at the rapidity with which Mademoiselle Le Breton does business An hour and a half ago he looked at his watch I stood by while Lady Henry enumerated commissions it would have taken any ordinary man mortal half a day to execute The Duchess clapped her hands My maid is now executing them she said with glee In an hour she will be back Julie will go home with everything done and I shall have had nearly two hours of her delightful society What harm is there in that Where are the dogs said Sir Wilfrid looking round Aunt Flora s dogs In the housekeeper s room eating sweet biscuit They adore the groom of the chambers Is Lady Henry aware of this this division of labor said Sir Wilfrid smiling Of course not said the Duchess flushing She makes Julie s life such a burden to her that something has to be done Now what has Aunt Flora been telling you We were certain she would take you into council she has dropped various hints of it I suppose she has been telling you that Julie has been intriguing against her taking liberties separating her from her friends and so on Sir Wilfrid smilingly presented his cup for some more tea I beg to point out he said that I have only been allowed two questions so far But if things are to be at all fair and equal I am owed at least six The Duchess drew back checked and rather annoyed Jacob Delafield on the other hand bent forward We are anxious Sir Wilfrid to tell you all we know he replied with quiet emphasis Sir Wilfrid looked at him The flame in the young man s eyes burned clear and steady but flame it was Sir Wilfrid remembered him as a lazy rather somnolent youth the man s advance in expression in significant power of itself told much In the first place can you give me the history of this lady s antecedents He glanced from one to the other The Duchess and Jacob Delafield exchanged glances Then the Duchess spoke uncertainly Yes we know She has confided in us There is nothing whatever to her discredit Sir Wilfrid s expression changed Ah cried the Duchess bending forward You know too I knew her father and mother said Sir Wilfrid simply The Duchess gave a little cry of relief Jacob Delafield rose took a turn across the room and came back to Sir Wilfrid Now we can really speak frankly he said The situation has grown very difficult and we did not know Evelyn and I whether we had a right to explain it But now that Lady Henry Oh yes said Sir Wilfrid that s all right The fact of Mademoiselle Le Breton s parentage Is really what makes Lady Henry so jealous cried the Duchess indignantly Oh she s a tyrant is Aunt Flora It is because Julie is of her own world of our world by blood whatever the law may say that she can t help making a rival out of her and tormenting her morning noon and night I tell you Sir Wilfrid what that poor girl has gone through no one can imagine but we who have watched it Lady Henry owes her every thing this last three years Where would she have been without Julie She talks of Julie s separating her from her friends cutting her out imposing upon her and nonsense of that kind How would she have kept up that salon alone I should like to know a blind old woman who can t write a note for herself or recognize a face First of all she throws everything upon Julie is proud of her cleverness puts her forward in every way tells most unnecessary falsehoods about her Julie has felt that very much and then when Julie has a great success when people begin to come to Bruton Street for her sake as well as Lady Henry s then Lady Henry turns against her complains of her to everybody talks about treachery and disloyalty and Heaven knows what and begins to treat her like the dirt under her feet How can Julie help being clever and agreeable she is clever and agreeable As mister Montresor said to me yesterday As soon as that woman comes into a room my spirits go up And why Because she never thinks of herself she always makes other people show at their best And then Lady Henry behaves like this The Duchess threw out her hands in scornful reprobation And the question is of course Can it go on I don t gather said Sir Wilfrid hesitating that Lady Henry wants immediately to put an end to it Delafield gave an angry laugh The point is whether Mademoiselle Julie and Mademoiselle Julie s friends can put up with it much longer You see said the Duchess eagerly Julie is such a loyal affectionate creature She knows Lady Henry was kind to her to begin with that she gave her great chances and that she s getting old and infirm Julie s awfully sorry for her She doesn t want to leave her all alone to the mercy of her servants I understand the servants too are devoted to Mademoiselle Julie said Sir Wilfrid Yes that s another grievance said Delafield contemptuously Why shouldn t they be When the butler had a child very ill it was Mademoiselle Julie who went to see it in the mews who took it flowers and grapes Lady Henry s grapes threw in Sir Wilfrid What does it matter said Delafield impatiently Lady Henry has more of everything than she knows what to do with But it wasn t grapes only It was time and thought and consideration Then when the younger footman wanted to emigrate to the States it was Mademoiselle Julie who found a situation for him who got mister Montresor to write to some American friends and finally sent the lad off devoted to her of course for life I should like to know when Lady Henry would have done that kind of thing Naturally the servants like her she deserves it I see I see said Sir Wilfrid nodding gently his eyes on the carpet A very competent young lady Delafield looked at the older man half in annoyance half in perplexity Is there anything to complain of in that he said rather shortly Oh nothing nothing said Sir Wilfrid hastily And this word intrigue that Lady Henry uses Has mademoiselle always steered a straightforward course with her employer Oh well said the Duchess shrugging her shoulders how can you always be perfectly straightforward with such a tyrannical old person She has to be managed Lately in order to be sure of every minute of Julie s time she has taken to heaping work upon her to such a ridiculous extent that unless I come to the rescue the

none	none	gets no rest and no amusement And last summer there was an explosion because Julie who was supposed to be in Paris for her holiday with a school friend really spent a week of it with the Buncombes Lady Henry s married niece who has a place in Kent The Buncombes knew her at Lady Henry s parties of course Then they met her in the Louvre took her about a little were delighted with her and begged her to come and stay with them they have a place near Canterbury on the way home They and Julie agreed that it would be best to say nothing to Lady Henry about it she is too absurdly jealous but then it leaked out unluckily and Lady Henry was furious I must say said Delafield hurriedly I always thought frankness would have been best there Well perhaps said the Duchess unwillingly with another shrug But now what is to be done Lady Henry really must behave better or Julie can t and sha n t stay with her Julie has a great following hasn t she Jacob They won t see her harassed to death Certainly not said Delafield At the same time we all see he turned to Sir Wilfrid what the advantages of the present combination are Where would Lady Henry find another lady of Mademoiselle Le Breton s sort to help her with her house and her salon For the last two years the Wednesday evenings have been the most brilliant and successful things of their kind in London And of course for Mademoiselle Le Breton it is a great thing to have the protection of Lady Henry s name A great thing cried Sir Wilfrid Everything my dear Jacob I don t know said Delafield slowly It may be bought too dear Sir Wilfrid looked at the speaker with curiosity It had been at all times possible to rouse Jacob Delafield as child as school boy as undergraduate from an habitual carelessness and idleness by an act or a tale of injustice or oppression Had the Duchess pressed him into her service and was he merely taking sides for the weaker out of a natural bent towards that way of looking at things Or Well certainly we must do our best to patch it up said Sir Wilfrid after a pause Perhaps Mademoiselle Le Breton will allow me a word with her by and by I think I have still some influence with Lady Henry But dear goddaughter he bent forward and laid his hand on that of the Duchess don t let the maid do the commissions But I must cried the Duchess Just think there is my big bazaar on the sixteenth You don t know how clever Julie is at such things I want to make her recite her French is too beautiful And then she has such inventiveness such a head Everything goes if she takes it in hand But if I say anything to Aunt Flora she ll put a spoke in all our wheels She ll hate the thought of anything in which Julie is successful and conspicuous Of course she will All the same Evelyn said Delafield uncomfortable apparently for the second time I really think it would be best to let Lady Henry know Well then we may as well give it up said the Duchess pettishly turning aside Delafield who was still pacing the carpet suddenly raised his hand in a gesture of warning Mademoiselle Le Breton was crossing the outer drawing room Julie come here cried the Duchess springing up and running towards her Jacob is making himself so disagreeable He thinks we ought to tell Lady Henry about the sixteenth The speaker put her arm through Julie Le Breton s looking up at her with a frowning brow The contrast between her restless prettiness the profusion of her dress and hair and Julie s dark lissome strength gowned and gloved in neat close black was marked enough As the Duchess spoke Julie looked smiling at Jacob Delafield I am in your hands she said gently Of course I don t want to keep anything from Lady Henry Please decide for me Sir Wilfrid s mouth showed a satirical line He turned aside and began to play with a copy of the Spectator Julie said the Duchess hesitating I hope you won t mind but we have been discussing things a little with Sir Wilfrid I felt sure Aunt Flora had been talking to him Of course said Julie I knew she would She looked towards Sir Wilfrid slightly drawing herself up Her manner was quiet but all her movements were somehow charged with a peculiar and interesting significance The force of the character made itself felt through all disguises In spite of himself Sir Wilfrid began to murmur apologetic things It was natural mademoiselle that Lady Henry should confide in me She has perhaps told you that for many years I have been one of the trustees of her property That has led to her consulting me on a good many matters And evidently from what she says and what the Duchess says nothing could be of more importance to her happiness now in her helpless state than her relations to you He spoke with a serious kindness in which the tinge of mocking habitual to his sleek and well groomed visage was wholly lost Julie Le Breton met him with dignity Yes they are important But I fear they cannot go on as they are There was a pause Then Sir Wilfrid approached her I hear you are returning to Bruton Street immediately Might I be your escort Certainly The Duchess a little sobered by the turn events had taken and the darkened prospects of her bazaar protested in vain against this sudden departure Julie resumed her furs which as Sir Wilfrid who was curious in such things happened to notice were of great beauty and made her farewells Did her hand linger in Jacob Delafield s Did the look with which that young man received it express more than the steadfast support which justice offers to the oppressed Sir Wilfrid could not be sure Illustration INDEED I WILL CRIED SIR WILFRID AND THEY WALKED ON As they stepped out into the frosty lamp lit dark of Grosvenor Square Julie Le Breton turned to her companion You knew my mother and father she said abruptly I remember your coming What was in her voice her rich beautiful voice Sir Wilfrid only knew that while perfectly steady it seemed to bring emotion near to make all the aspects of things dramatic Yes yes he replied in some confusion I knew her well from the time when she was a girl in the school room Poor Lady Rose The figure beside him stood still Then if you were my mother s friend she said huskily you will hear patiently what I have to say even though you are Lady Henry s trustee Indeed I will cried Sir Wilfrid and they walked on IV But first of all said Mademoiselle Le Breton looking in some annoyance at the brace of terriers circling and barking round them we must take the dogs home otherwise no talk will be possible You have no more business to do His companion smiled Everything Lady Henry wants is here she said pointing to the bag upon her arm which had been handed to her as Sir Wilfrid remembered after some whispered conversation in the hall of Crowborough House by an elegantly dressed woman who was no doubt the Duchess s maid Allow me to carry it for you Many thanks said Mademoiselle Le Breton firmly retaining it but those are not the things I mind They walked on quickly to Bruton Street The dogs made conversation impossible If they were on the chain it was one long battle between them and their leader If they were let loose it seemed to Sir Wilfrid that they ranged every area on the march and attacked all elderly gentlemen and most errand boys Do you always take them out he asked when both he and his companion were crimson and out of breath Always Do you like dogs I used to Perhaps some day I shall again As for me I wish they had but one neck said Sir Wilfrid who had but just succeeded in dragging Max the bigger of the two out of the interior of a pastry cook s hand cart which had been rashly left with doors open for a few minutes in the street while its responsible guardian was gossiping in an adjacent kitchen Mademoiselle Julie meanwhile was wrestling with Nero the younger who had dived to the very heart of a peculiarly unsavory dust box standing near the entrance of a mews So you commonly go through the streets of London in this whirlwind asked Sir Wilfrid again incredulous when at last they had landed their charges safe at the Bruton Street door Morning and evening said Mademoiselle Julie smiling Then she addressed the butler Tell Lady Henry please that I shall be at home in half an hour As they turned westward the winter streets were gay with lights and full of people Sir Wilfrid was presently conscious that among all the handsome and well dressed women who brushed past them Mademoiselle Le Breton more than held her own She reminded him now not so much of her mother as of Marriott Dalrymple Sir Wilfrid had first seen this woman s father at Damascus when Dalrymple at twenty six was beginning the series of Eastern journeys which had made him famous He remembered the brillance of the youth the power physical and mental which radiated from him making all things easy the scorn of mediocrity the incapacity for subordination I should like you to understand said the lady beside him that I came to Lady Henry prepared to do my very best I am sure of that said Sir Wilfrid hastily recalling his thoughts from Damascus And you must have had a very difficult task Mademoiselle Le Breton shrugged her shoulders I knew of course it must be difficult And as to the drudgery of it the dogs and that kind of thing nothing of that sort matters to me in the least But I cannot be humiliated before those who have become my friends entirely because Lady Henry wished it to be so Lady Henry at first showed you every confidence After the first month or two she put everything into my hands her household her receptions her letters you may almost say her whole social existence She trusted me with all her secrets No no my dear lady thought Sir Wilfrid She let me help her with all her affairs And honestly I did all I could to make her life easy That I understand from herself Then why cried Mademoiselle Le Breton turning round to him with sudden passion why couldn t Lady Henry leave things alone Are devotion and and the kind of qualities she wanted so common I said to myself that blind and helpless as she was she should lose nothing Not only should her household be well kept her affairs well managed but her salon should be as attractive her Wednesday evenings as brilliant as ever The world was deserting her I helped her to bring it back She cannot live without social success yet now she hates me for what I have done Is it sane is it reasonable She feels I suppose said Sir Wilfrid gravely that the success is no longer hers So she says But will you please examine that remark When her guests assemble can I go to bed and leave her to grapple with them I have proposed it often but of course it is impossible And if I am to be there I must behave I suppose like a lady not like the housemaid Really Lady Henry asks too much In my mother s little flat in Bruges with the two or three friends who frequented it I was brought up in as good society and as good talk as Lady Henry has ever known They were passing an electric lamp and Sir Wilfrid looking up was half thrilled half repelled by the flashing energy of the face beside him Was ever such language on the lips of a paid companion before His sympathy for Lady Henry revived Can you really give me no clew to the to the sources of Lady Henry s dissatisfaction he said at last rather coldly Mademoiselle Le Breton hesitated I don t want to make myself out a saint she said at last in another voice and with a humility which was in truth hardly less proud than her self assertion I I was brought up in poverty and my mother died when I was fifteen I had to defend myself as the poor defend themselves by silence I learned not to talk about my own affairs I couldn t afford to be frank like a rich English girl
6637_69607_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say 
none	none	sometimes I have concealed things which had been better made plain They were never of any real importance and if Lady Henry had shown any consideration Her voice failed her a little evidently to her annoyance They walked on without speaking for a few paces Never of any real importance Sir Wilfrid wondered Their minds apparently continued the conversation though their lips were silent for presently Julie Le Breton said abruptly Of course I am speaking of matters where Lady Henry might have some claim to information With regard to many of my thoughts and feelings Lady Henry has no right whatever to my confidence She gives us fair warning thought Sir Wilfrid Aloud he said It is not a question of thoughts and feelings I understand but of actions Like the visit to the Duncombes said Mademoiselle Le Breton impatiently Oh I quite admit it that s only one of several instances Lady Henry might have brought forward You see she led me to make these friendships and now because they annoy her I am to break them But she forgets Friends are too too new in my life too precious Again the voice wavered How it thrilled and penetrated Sir Wilfrid found himself listening for every word No she resumed If it is a question of renouncing the friends I have made in her house or going it will be going That may as well be quite clear Sir Wilfrid looked up Let me ask you one question mademoiselle Certainly Whatever you like Have you ever had have you now any affection for Lady Henry Affection I could have had plenty Lady Henry is most interesting to watch It is magnificent the struggles she makes with her infirmities Nothing could have been more agreeable than the modulation of these words the passage of the tone from a first note of surprise to its grave and womanly close Again the same suggestions of veiled and vibrating feeling Sir Wilfrid s nascent dislike softened a little After all he said with gentleness one must make allowance for old age and weakness mustn t one Oh as to that you can t say anything to me that I am not perpetually saying to myself was her somewhat impetuous reply Only there is a point when ill temper becomes not only tormenting to me but degrading to herself Oh if you only knew the speaker drew an indignant breath I can hardly bring myself to speak of such miseres But everything excites her everything makes her jealous It is a grievance that I should have a new dress that mister Montresor should send me an order for the House of Commons that Evelyn Crowborough should give me a Christmas present Last Christmas Evelyn gave me these furs she is the only creature in London from whom I would accept a farthing or the value of a farthing She paused then rapidly threw him a question Why do you suppose did I take it from her She is your kinswoman said Wilfrid quietly Ah you knew that Well then mayn t Evelyn be kind to me though I am what I am I reminded Lady Henry but she only thought me a mean parasite sponging on a duchess for presents above my station She said things hardly to be forgiven I was silent But I have never ceased to wear the furs With what imperious will did the thin shoulders straighten themselves under the folds of chinchilla The cloak became symbolic a flag not to be struck I never answer back please understand never she went on hurriedly You saw to day how Lady Henry gave me her orders There is not a servant in the house with whom she would dare such a manner Did I resent it You behaved with great forbearance I watched you with admiration Ah forbearance I fear you don t understand one of the strangest elements in the whole case I am afraid of Lady Henry mortally afraid When she speaks to me I feel like a child who puts up its hands to ward off a blow My instinct is not merely to submit but to grovel When you have had the youth that I had when you have existed learned amused yourself on sufferance when you have had somehow to maintain yourself among girls who had family friends money name while you Her voice stopped resolutely silenced before it broke Sir Wilfrid uncomfortably felt that he had no sympathy to produce worthy of the claim that her whole personality seemed to make upon it But she recovered herself immediately Now I think I had better give you an outline of the last six months she said turning to him Of course it is my side of the matter But you have heard Lady Henry s And with great composure she laid before him an outline of the chief quarrels and grievances which had embittered the life of the Bruton Street house during the period she had named It was a wretched story and she clearly told it with repugnance and disgust There was in her tone a note of offended personal delicacy as of one bemired against her will Evidently Lady Henry was hardly to be defended The thing had been odious indeed Two women of great ability and different ages shut up together and jarring at every point the elder furiously jealous and exasperated by what seemed to her the affront offered to her high rank and her past ascendency by the social success of her dependant the other defending herself first by the arts of flattery and submission and then when these proved hopeless by a social skill that at least wore many of the aspects of intrigue these were the essential elements of the situation and as her narrative proceeded Sir Wilfrid admitted to himself that it was hard to see any way out of it As to his own sympathies he did not know what to make of them No I have been only too yielding said Mademoiselle Le Breton sorely when her tale was done I am ashamed when I look back on what I have borne But now it has gone too far and something must be done If I go frankly Lady Henry will suffer Sir Wilfrid looked at his companion Lady Henry is well aware of it Yes was the calm reply she knows it but she does not realize it You see if it comes to a rupture she will allow no half measures Those who stick to me will have to quarrel with her And there will be a great many who will stick to me Sir Wilfrid s little smile was not friendly It is indeed evident he said that you have thought it all out Mademoiselle Le Breton did not reply They walked on a few minutes in silence till she said with a suddenness and in a low tone that startled her companion If Lady Henry could ever have felt that she humbled me that I acknowledged myself at her mercy But she never could She knows that I feel myself as well born as she that I am not ashamed of my parents that my principles give me a free mind about such things Your principles murmured Sir Wilfrid You were right she turned upon him with a perfectly quiet but most concentrated passion I have had to think things out I know of course that the world goes with Lady Henry Therefore I must be nameless and kinless and hold my tongue If the world knew it would expect me to hang my head I don t I am as proud of my mother as of my father I adore both their memories Conventionalities of that kind mean nothing to me My dear lady Oh I don t expect you or any one else to feel with me said the voice which for all its low pitch was beginning to make him feel as though he were in the centre of a hail storm You are a man of the world you knew my parents and yet I understand perfectly that for you too I am disgraced So be it So be it I don t quarrel with what any one may choose to think but She recaptured herself with difficulty and there was silence They were walking through the purple February dusk towards the Marble Arch It was too dark to see her face under its delicate veil and Sir Wilfrid did not wish to see it But before he had collected his thoughts sufficiently his companion was speaking again in a wholly different manner I don t know what made me talk in this way It was the contact with some one I suppose who had seen us at Gherardtsloo She raised her veil and he thought that she dashed away some tears That never happened to me before in London Well now to return If there is a breach Why should there be a breach said Sir Wilfrid My dear Miss Le Breton listen to me for a few minutes I see perfectly that you have a great deal to complain of but I also see that Lady Henry has something of a case And with a courteous authority and tact worthy of his trade the old diplomat began to discuss the situation Presently he found himself talking with an animation a friendliness an intimacy that surprised himself What was there in the personality beside him that seemed to win a way inside a man s defences in spite of him Much of what she had said had seemed to him arrogant or morbid And yet as she listened to him with an evident dying down of passion an evident forlornness he felt in her that woman s weakness and timidity of which she had accused herself in relation to Lady Henry and was somehow manlike softened and disarmed She had been talking wildly because no doubt she felt herself in great difficulties But when it was his turn to talk she neither resented nor resisted what he had to say The kinder he was the more she yielded almost eagerly at times as though the thorniness of her own speech had hurt herself most and there were behind it all a sad life and a sad heart that only asked in truth for a little sympathy and understanding I shall soon be calling her my dear and patting her hand thought the old man at last astonished at himself For the dejection in her attitude and gait began to weigh upon him he felt a warm desire to sustain and comfort her More and more thought more and more contrivance did he throw into the straightening out of this tangle between two excitable women not it seemed for Lady Henry s sake not surely for Miss Le Breton s sake But ah those two poor dead folk who had touched his heart long ago did he feel the hovering of their ghosts beside him in the wintry wind At any rate he abounded in shrewd and fatherly advice and Mademoiselle Le Breton listened with a most flattering meekness Well now I think we have come to an understanding he urged hopefully as they turned down Bruton Street again Mademoiselle Le Breton sighed It is very kind of you Oh I will do my best But She shook her head uncertainly No no buts cried Sir Wilfrid cheerfully Suppose as a first step he smiled at his companion you tell Lady Henry about the bazaar By all means She won t let me go But Evelyn will find some one else Oh we ll see about that said the old man almost crossly If you ll allow me I ll try my hand Julie Le Breton did not reply but her face glimmered upon him with a wistful friendliness that did not escape him even in the darkness In this yielding mood her voice and movements had so much subdued sweetness so much distinction that he felt himself more than melting towards her Then of a sudden a thought a couple of thoughts sped across him He drew himself rather sharply together mister Delafield I gather has been a good deal concerned in the whole matter Mademoiselle Le Breton laughed and hesitated He has been very kind He heard Lady Henry s language once when she was excited It seemed to shock him He has tried once or twice to smooth her down Oh he has been most kind Has he any influence with her Not much Do you think well of him He turned to her with a calculated abruptness She showed a little surprise I But everybody thinks well of him They say the Duke trusts everything to him When I left England he was still a rather lazy and unsatisfactory undergraduate I was curious to know how he had developed Do you know what his chief interests are now Mademoiselle Le Breton hesitated I m really afraid I don t know she said at last smiling and as it were regretful But Evelyn Crowborough of course could tell you all about him She and he are very old friends No birds out of that cover was Sir Wilfrid s inward comment The lamp over Lady Henry s door was already in sight when Sir Wilfrid after some talk of the Montresors with whom he was going to dine that night carelessly said That s a very good looking fellow that Captain Warkworth whom I saw with Lady Henry last night Ah yes Lady Henry has made great friends with him said Mademoiselle Julie readily She consults him about her memoir of her husband Memoir of her husband Sir Wilfrid stopped short Heavens above Memoir of Lord Henry She is half way through it I thought you knew Well upon my word Whom shall we have a memoir of next Henry Delafield Henry Delafield Good gracious And Sir Wilfrid walked along slashing at the railings with his stick as though the action relieved him Julie Le Breton quietly resumed I understand that Lord Henry and Captain Warkworth s father went through the Indian Mutiny together and Captain Warkworth has some letters Oh I dare say I dare say muttered Sir Wilfrid What s this man home for just now Well I think Lady Henry knows said Mademoiselle Julie turning to him an open look like one who once more would gladly satisfy a questioner if they could He talks to her a great deal But why shouldn t he come home Because he ought to be doing disagreeable duty with his regiment instead of always racing about the world in search of something to get his name up said Sir Wilfrid rather sharply At least that s the view his brother officers mostly take of him Oh said Mademoiselle Julie with amiable vagueness is there anything particular that you suppose he wants I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions said Sir Wilfrid lifting his shoulders But you and Lady Henry seemed well acquainted with him The straw colored lashes veered her way I had some talk with him in the Park this morning said Julie Le Breton reflectively He wants me to copy his father s letters for Lady Henry and to get her to return the originals as soon as possible He feels nervous when they are out of his hands Hm said Sir Wilfrid At that moment Lady Henry s door bell presented itself The vigor with which Sir Wilfrid rang it may perhaps have expressed the liveliness of his unspoken scepticism He did not for one moment believe that General Warkworth s letters had been the subject of the conversation he had witnessed that morning in the Park nor that filial veneration had had anything whatever to say to it Julie Le Breton gave him her hand Thank you very much she said gravely and softly Sir Wilfrid at the moment before had not meant to press it at all But he did press it aware the while of the most mingled feelings On the contrary you were very good to allow me this conversation Command me at any time if I can be useful to you and Lady Henry Julie Le Breton smiled upon him and was gone Sir Wilfrid ran down the steps chafing at himself She somehow gets round one he thought with a touch of annoyance I wonder whether I made any real impression upon her Hm Let s see whether Montresor can throw any more light upon her He seemed to be pretty intimate Her principles eh A dangerous view to take for a woman of that provenance An hour or two later Sir Wilfrid Bury presented himself in the Montresors drawing room in Eaton Place He had come home feeling it essential to impress upon the cabinet a certain line of action with regard to the policy of Russia on the Persian Gulf But the first person he perceived on the hearth rug basking before the Minister s ample fire was Lord Lackington The sight of that vivacious countenance that shock of white hair that tall form still boasting the spareness and almost the straightness of youth that unsuspecting complacency confused his ideas and made him somehow feel the whole world a little topsy turvy Nevertheless after dinner he got his fifteen minutes of private talk with his host and conscientiously made use of them Then after an appointment had been settled for a longer conversation on another day both men felt that they had done their duty and as it appeared the same subject stirred in both their minds Well and what did you think of Lady Henry said Montresor with a smile as he lighted another cigarette She s very blind said Sir Wilfrid and more rheumatic But else there s not much change On the whole she wears wonderfully well Except as to her temper poor lady laughed the Minister She has really tried all our nerves of late And the worst of it is that most of it falls upon that poor woman who lives with her the Minister lowered his voice one of the most interesting and agreeable creatures in the world Sir Wilfrid glanced across the table Lord Lackington was telling scandalous tales of his youth to a couple of Foreign Office clerks who sat on either side of him laughing and spurring him on The old man s careless fluency and fun were evidently contagious animation reigned around him he was the spoiled child of the dinner and knew it I gather that you have taken a friendly interest in Miss Le Breton said Bury turning to his host Oh the Duchess and Delafield and I have done our best to protect her and to keep the peace I am quite sure Lady Henry has poured out her grievances to you hasn t she Alack she has I knew she couldn t hold her tongue to you even for a day She has really been losing her head over it And it is a thousand pities So you think all the fault s on Lady Henry s side The Minister gave a shrug At any rate I have never myself seen anything to justify Lady Henry s state of feeling On the famous Wednesdays Mademoiselle Julie always appears to make Lady Henry her first thought And in other ways she has really worn herself to death for the old lady It makes one rather savage sometimes to see it So in your eyes she is a perfect companion Montresor laughed Oh as to perfection Lady Henry accuses her of intrigue You have seen no traces of it The Minister smiled a little oddly Not as regards Lady Henry Oh Mademoiselle Julie is a very astute lady A ripple from some source of secret amusement spread over the dark lined face What do you mean by that She knows how to help her friends better than most people I have known three men at least made by Mademoiselle Le Breton within the last two or three years She has just got a fresh one in tow Sir Wilfrid moved a little closer to his host They turned slightly from the table and seemed to talk into their cigars Young Warkworth said Bury The Minister smiled again and hesitated Oh she doesn t bother me she is much too clever But she gets at me in the most amusing indirect ways I know perfectly well when she has been at work There are two or three men high up you understand who frequent Lady Henry s evenings and who are her very good friends Oh I dare say she ll get what she wants he added with nonchalance Between you and me do you suspect any direct interest in the young man Montresor shrugged his shoulders I don t know Not necessarily She loves to feel herself a power all the more I think because of her anomalous position It is very curious at bottom very feminine and amusing and quite harmless You and others don t resent it No not from her said the Minister after a pause But she is rather going it just now Three or four batteries have opened upon me at once She must be thinking of little else Sir Wilfrid grew a trifle red He remembered the comedy of the door step Is there anything that he particularly wants His tone assumed a certain asperity Well as for me I cannot help feeling that Lady Henry has something to say for herself It is very strange mysterious even the kind of ascendency this lady has obtained for herself in so short a time Oh I dare say it s hard for Lady Henry to put up with mused Montresor Without family without connections He raised his head quietly and put on his eye glasses Then his look swept the face of his companion Sir Wilfrid with a scarcely perceptible yet significant gesture motioned towards Lord Lackington mister Montresor started The eyes of both men travelled across the table then met again You know said Montresor under his breath Sir Wilfrid nodded Then some instinct told him that he had now exhausted the number of the initiated When the men reached the drawing room which was rather emptily waiting for the reception missus Montresor was about to hold in it Sir Wilfrid fell into conversation with Lord Lackington The old man talked well though flightily with a constant reference of all topics to his own standards recollections and friendships which was characteristic but in him not unattractive Sir Wilfrid noticed certain new and pitiful signs of age The old man was still a rattle But every now and then the rattle ceased abruptly and a breath of melancholy made itself felt like a chill and sudden gust from some unknown sea They were joined presently as the room filled up by a young journalist an art critic who seemed to know Lord Lackington and his ways The two fell eagerly into talk about pictures especially of an exhibition at Antwerp from which the young man had just returned I looked in at Bruges on the way back for a few hours said the new comer presently The pictures there are much better seen than they used to be When were you there last He turned to Lord Lackington Bruges said Lord Lackington with a start Oh I haven t been there for twenty years And he suddenly sat down dangling a paper knife between his hands and staring at the carpet His jaw dropped a little A cloud seemed to interpose between him and his companions Sir Wilfrid with Lady Henry s story fresh in his memory was somehow poignantly conscious of the old man Did their two minds hold the same image of Lady Rose drawing her last breath in some dingy room beside one of the canals that wind through Bruges laying down there the last relics of that life beauty and intelligence that had once made her the darling of the father who for some reason still hard to understand had let her suffer and die alone V On leaving the Montresors Sir Wilfrid seeing that it was a fine night with mild breezes abroad refused a hansom and set out to walk home to his rooms in Duke Street saint James s He was so much in love with the mere streets the mere clatter of the omnibuses and shimmer of the lamps after his long absence that every step was pleasure At the top of Grosvenor Place he stood still awhile only to snuff up the soft rainy air or to delight his eye now with the shining pools which some showers of the afternoon had left behind them on the pavement and now with the light veil of fog which closed in the distance of Piccadilly And there are silly persons who grumble about the fogs he thought contemptuously while he was thus yielding himself heart and sense to his beloved London As for him dried and wilted by long years of cloudless heat he drank up the moisture and the mist with a kind of physical passion the noises and the lights no less And when he had resumed his walk along the crowded street the question buzzed within him whether he must indeed go back to his exile either at Teheran or nearer home in some more exalted post I ve got plenty of money why the deuce don t I give it up and come home and enjoy myself Only a few more years after all why not spend them here in one s own world among one s own kind It was the weariness of the governing Englishman and it was answered immediately by that other instinct partly physical partly moral which keeps the elderly man of affairs to his task Idleness No That way lies the end To slacken the rush of life for men of his sort is to call on death death the secret pursuer who is not far from each one of us No no Fight on It was only the long drudgery behind under alien suns together with the iron certainty of fresh drudgery ahead that gave value after all to this rainy this enchanting Piccadilly that kept the string of feeling taut and all its notes clear Going to bed Sir Wilfrid said a voice behind him as he turned down saint James s Street Delafield The old man faced round with alacrity Where have you sprung from Delafield explained that he had been dining with the Crowboroughs and was now going to his club to look for news of a friend s success or failure in a north country election Oh that ll keep said Sir Wilfrid Turn in with me for half an hour I m at my old rooms you know in Duke Street All right said the young man after what seemed to Sir Wilfrid a moment of hesitation Are you often up in town this way asked Bury as they walked on Land agency seems to be a profession with mitigations There is some London business thrown in We have some large milk depots in town that I look after There was just a trace of hurry in the young man s voice and Bury surveyed him with a smile No other attractions eh Not that I know of By the way Sir Wilfrid I never asked you how Dick Mason was getting on Dick Mason Is he a friend of yours Well we were at Eton and Oxford together Were you I never heard him mention your name The young man laughed I don t mean to suggest he couldn t live without me You ve left him in charge haven t you at Teheran Yes I have worse luck So you re deeply interested in Dick Mason Oh come I liked him pretty well Hm I don t much care about him And I don t somehow believe you do And Bury with a smile slipped a friendly hand within the arm of his companion Delafield reddened It s decent I suppose to inquire after an old school fellow Exemplary But there are things more amusing to talk about Delafield was silent Sir Wilfrid s fair mustaches approached his ear I had my interview with Mademoiselle Julie So I suppose I hope you did some good I doubt it Jacob between ourselves the little Duchess hasn t been a miracle of wisdom No perhaps not said the other unwillingly She realizes I suppose that they are connected Of course It isn t very close Lady Rose s brother married Evelyn s aunt her mother s sister Yes that s it She and Mademoiselle Julie ought to have called the same person uncle but for lack of certain ceremonies they don t By the way what became of Lady Rose s younger sister Lady Blanche Oh she married Sir John Moffatt and has been a widow for years He left her a place in Westmoreland and she lives there generally with her girl Has Mademoiselle Julie ever come across them No She speaks of them Yes We can t tell her much about them except that the girl was presented last year and went to a few balls in town But neither she nor her mother cares for London Lady Blanche Moffatt Lady Blanche Moffatt said Sir Wilfrid pausing Wasn t she in India this winter Yes I believe they went out in November and are to be home by April Somebody told me they had met her and the girl at Peshawar and then at Simla said Sir Wilfrid ruminating Now I remember She s a great heiress isn t she and pretty to boot I know Somebody told me that fellow Warkworth had been making up to her Warkworth Jacob Delafield stood still a moment and Sir Wilfrid caught a sudden contraction of the brow That of course was just a bit of Indian gossip I don t think so said Sir Wilfrid dryly My informants were two frontier officers I came from Egypt with them who had recently been at Peshawar good fellows both of them not at all given to take young ladies names in vain Jacob made no reply They had let themselves into the Duke Street house and were groping their way up the dim staircase to Sir Wilfrid s rooms There all was light and comfort Sir Wilfrid s valet much the same age as himself hovered round his master brought him his smoking coat offered Delafield cigars and provided Sir Wilfrid strange to say with a large cup of tea I follow mister Gladstone said Sir Wilfrid with a sigh of luxury as he sank into an easy chair and extended a very neatly made pair of legs and feet to the blaze He seems to have slept the sleep of the just on a cup of tea at midnight through the rise and fall of cabinets So I m trying the receipt Does that mean that you are hankering after politics Heavens When you come to doddering Jacob it s better to dodder in the paths you know I salute mister G s physique that s all Well now Jacob do you know anything about this Warkworth Warkworth Delafield withdrew his cigar and seemed to choose his words a little Well I know what all the world knows Hm you seemed very sure just now that he wasn t going to marry Miss Moffatt Sure I m not sure of anything said the young man slowly Well what I should like to know said Sir Wilfrid cradling his teacup in both hands is what particular interest has Mademoiselle Julie in that young soldier Delafield looked into the fire Has she any She seems to be moving heaven and earth to get him what he wants By the way what does he want He wants the special mission to Mokembe as I understand said Delafield after a moment But several other people want it too Indeed Sir Wilfrid nodded reflectively So there is to be one Well it s about time The travellers of the other European firms have been going it lately in that quarter Jacob your mademoiselle also is a bit of an intriguer Delafield made a restless movement Why do you say that Well to say the least of it frankness is not one of her characteristics I tried to question her about this man I had seen them together in the Park talking as intimates So when our conversation had reached a friendly stage I threw out a feeler or two just to satisfy myself about her But He pulled his fair mustaches and smiled Well said the young man with a kind of reluctant interrogation She played with me Jacob But really she overdid it For such a clever woman I assure you she overdid it I don t see why she shouldn t keep her friendships to herself said Delafield with sudden heat Oh so you admit it is a friendship Delafield did not reply He had laid down his cigar and with his hands on his knees was looking steadily into the fire His attitude however was not one of reverie but rather of a strained listening What is the meaning Jacob of a young woman taking so keen an interest in the fortunes of a dashing soldier for between you and me I hear she is moving heaven and earth to get him this post and then concealing it Why should she want her kindnesses talked of said the young man impetuously She was perfectly right I think to fence with your questions Sir Wilfrid It s one of the secrets of her influence that she can render a service and keep it dark Sir Wilfrid shook his head She overdid it he repeated However what do you think of the man yourself Jacob Well I don t take to him said the other unwillingly He isn t my sort of man And Mademoiselle Julie you think nothing but well of her I don t like discussing a lady but you see with Lady Henry to manage one must feel the ground as one can Sir Wilfrid looked at his companion and then stretched his legs a little farther towards the fire The lamp light shone full on his silky eyelashes and beard on his neatly parted hair and the diamond on his fine left hand The young man beside him could not emulate his easy composure He fidgeted nervously as he replied with warmth I think she has had an uncommonly hard time that she wants nothing but what is reasonable and that if she threw you off the scent Sir Wilfrid with regard to Warkworth she was quite within her rights You probably deserved it He threw up his head with a quick gesture of challenge Sir Wilfrid shrugged his shoulders I vow I didn t he murmured However that s all right What do you do with yourself down in Essex Jacob The lines of the young man s attitude showed a sudden unconscious relief from tension He threw himself back in his chair Well it s a big estate There s plenty to do You live by yourself Yes There s an agent s house a small one in one of the villages How do you amuse yourself Plenty of shooting I suppose Too much I can t do with more than a certain amount Golfing Oh yes said the young man indifferently There s a fair links Do you do any philanthropy Jacob I like bossing the village said Delafield with a laugh It pleases one s vanity That s about all there is to it What clubs and temperance that kind of thing Can you take any real interest in the people Delafield hesitated Well yes he said at last as though he grudged the admission There s nothing else to take an interest in is there By the way he jumped up I think I ll bid you good night for I ve got to go down to morrow in a hurry I must be off by the first train in the morning What s the matter Oh it s only a wretched old man that two beasts of women have put into the workhouse infirmary against his will I only heard it to night I must go and get him out He looked round for his gloves and stick Why shouldn t he be there Because it s an infernal shame said the other shortly He s an old laborer who d saved quite a lot of money He kept it in his cottage and the other day it was all stolen by a tramp He has lived with these two women his sister in law and her daughter for years and years As long as he had money to leave nothing was too good for him The shock half killed him and now that he s a pauper these two harpies will have nothing to say to nursing him and looking after him He told me the other day he thought they d force him into the infirmary I didn t believe it But while I ve been away they ve gone and done it Well what ll you do now Get him out And then Delafield hesitated Well then I suppose he can come to my place till I can find some decent woman to put him with Sir Wilfrid rose I think I ll run down and see you some day Will there be paupers in all the bedrooms Delafield grinned You ll find a rattling good cook and a jolly snug little place I can tell you Do come But I shall see you again soon I must be up next week and very likely I shall be at Lady Henry s on Wednesday All right I shall see her on Sunday so I can report Not before Sunday Delafield paused His clear blue eyes looked down dissatisfied upon Sir Wilfrid Impossible before I have all sorts of official people to see to morrow and Saturday And Jacob keep the Duchess quiet She may have to give up Mademoiselle Julie for her bazaar I ll tell her By the way is that little person happy said Sir Wilfrid as he opened the door to his departing guest When I left England she was only just married Oh yes she s happy enough though Crowborough s rather an ass How particularly Delafield smiled Well he s rather a sticky sort of person He thinks there s something particularly interesting in dukes which makes him a bore Take care Jacob Who knows that you won t be a duke yourself some day What do you mean The young man glowered almost fiercely upon his old friend I hear Chudleigh s boy is but a poor creature said Sir Wilfrid gravely Lady Henry doesn t expect him to live Why that s the kind that always does live cried Delafield with angry emphasis And as for Lady Henry her imagination is a perfect charnel house She likes to think that everybody s dead or dying but herself The fact is that Mervyn is a good deal stronger this year than he was last Really Lady Henry The tone lost itself in a growl of wrath Well well said Sir Wilfrid smiling A man beduked against his will etcetera Good night my dear Jacob and good luck to your old pauper But Delafield turned back a moment on the stairs I say he hesitated you won t shirk talking to Lady Henry No no Sunday certainly honor bright Oh I think we shall straighten it out Delafield ran down the stairs and Sir Wilfrid returned to his warm room and the dregs of his tea Now is he in love with her and hesitating for social reasons Or is he jealous of this fellow Warkworth Or has she snubbed him and both are keeping it dark Not very likely that in view of his prospects She must want to regularize her position Or is he not in love with her at all On which cogitations there fell presently the strokes of many bells tolling midnight and left them still unresolved Only one positive impression remained that Jacob Delafield had somehow grown vaguely but enormously in mental and moral bulk during the years since he had left Oxford the years of Bury s Persian exile Sir Wilfrid had been an intimate friend of his dead father Lord Hubert and on very friendly terms with his lethargic good natured mother She by the way was still alive and living in London with a daughter He must go and see them As for Jacob Sir Wilfrid had cherished a particular weakness for him in the Eton jacket stage and later on indeed when the lad enjoyed a brief moment of glory in the Eton eleven But at Oxford to Sir Wilfrid s thinking he had suffered eclipse had become a somewhat heavy apathetic pseudo cynical youth displaying his mother s inertia without her good temper too slack to keep up his cricket too slack to work for the honor schools at no time without friends but an enigma to most of them and apparently something of a burden to himself And now out of that ugly slough a man had somehow emerged in whom Sir Wilfrid who was well acquainted with the race discerned the stirring of all sorts of strong inherited things formless still but struggling to expression He looked at me just now when I talked of his being duke as his father would sometimes look His father Hubert Delafield had been an obstinate dare devil heroic sort of fellow who had lost his life in the Chudleigh salmon river trying to save a gillie who had missed his footing A man much hated and much beloved capable of the most contradictory actions He had married his wife for money would often boast of it and would none the less give away his last farthing recklessly passionately if he were asked for it in some way that touched his feelings Able too though not so able as the great Duke his father Hubert Delafield was never happy that I can remember thought Wilfrid Bury as he sat over his fire and this chap has the same expression That woman in Bruton Street would never do for him apart from all the other unsuitability He ought to find something sweet and restful And yet I don t know The Delafields are a discontented lot If you plague them they are inclined to love you They want something hard to get their teeth in How the old Duke adored his termagant of a wife It was late on Sunday afternoon before Sir Wilfrid was able to present himself in Lady Henry s drawing room and when he arrived there he found plenty of other people in possession and had to wait for his chance Lady Henry received him with a brusque At last which however he took with equanimity He was in no sense behind his time On Thursday when parting with her he had pleaded for deliberation Let me study the situation a little and don t for Heaven s sake let s be too tragic about the whole thing Whether Lady Henry was now in the tragic mood or no he could not at first determine She was no longer confined to the inner shrine of the back drawing room Her chair was placed in the large room and she was the centre of a lively group of callers who were discussing the events of the week in Parliament with the light and mordant zest of people well acquainted with the personalities they were talking of She was apparently better in health he noticed at any rate she was more at ease and enjoying herself more than on the previous Wednesday All her social characteristics were in full play the blunt and careless freedom which made her the good comrade of the men she talked with as good a brain and as hard a hitter as they mingled with the occasional sally or caprice which showed her very much a woman Very few other women were there Lady Henry did not want women on Sundays and was at no pains whatever to hide the fact But Mademoiselle Julie was at the tea table supported by an old white haired general in whom Sir Wilfrid recognized a man recently promoted to one of the higher posts in the War Office Tea however had been served and Mademoiselle Le Breton was now showing her companion a portfolio of photographs on which the old man was holding forth Am I too late for a cup said Sir Wilfrid after she had greeted him with cordiality And what are those pictures They are some photos of the Khaibar and Tirah said Mademoiselle Le Breton Captain Warkworth brought them to show Lady Henry Ah the scene of his exploits said Sir Wilfrid after a glance at them The young man distinguished himself I understand Oh very much so said General M Gill with emphasis He showed brains and he had luck A great deal of luck I hear said Sir Wilfrid accepting a piece of cake He ll get his step up I suppose Anything else Difficult to say But the good men are always in request said General M Gill smiling By the way I heard somebody mention his name last night for this Mokembe mission said Sir Wilfrid helping himself to tea cake Oh that s quite undecided said the General sharply There is no immediate hurry for a week or two and the government must send the best man possible No doubt said Sir Wilfrid It interested him to observe that Mademoiselle Le Breton was no longer pale As the General spoke a bright color had rushed into her cheeks It seemed to Sir Wilfrid that she turned away and busied herself with the photographs in order to hide it The General rose a thin soldierly figure with gray hair that drooped forward and two bright spots of red on the cheek bones In contrast with the expansiveness of his previous manner to Mademoiselle Le Breton he was now a trifle frowning and stiff the high official once more and great man Good night Sir Wilfrid I must be off How are your sons said Sir Wilfrid as he rose The eldest is in Canada with his regiment And the second The second is in orders Overworking himself in the East End as all the young parsons seem to be doing That is precisely what he has been doing But now I am thankful to say a country living has been offered him and his mother and I have persuaded him to take it A country living Where One of the Duke of Crowborough s Shropshire livings said the General after what seemed to be an instant s hesitation Mademoiselle Le Breton had moved away and was replacing the photographs in the drawer of a distant bureau Ah one of Crowborough s Well I hope it is a living with something to live on Not so bad as times go said the General smiling It has been a great relief to our minds There were some chest symptoms his mother was alarmed The Duchess has been most kind she took quite a fancy to the lad and What a woman wants she gets Well I hope he ll like it Good night General Shall I look you up at the War Office some morning By all means The old soldier whose tanned face had shown a singular softness while he was speaking of his son took his leave Sir Wilfrid was left meditating his eyes absently fixed on the graceful figure of Mademoiselle Le Breton who shut the drawer she had been arranging and returned to him Do you know the General s sons he asked her while she was preparing him a second cup of tea I have seen the younger She turned her beautiful eyes upon him It seemed to Sir Wilfrid that he perceived in them a passing tremor of nervous defiance as though she were in some way bracing herself against him But her self possession was complete Lady Henry seems in better spirits he said bending towards her She did not reply for a moment Her eyes dropped Then she raised them again and gently shook her head without a word The melancholy energy of her expression gave him a moment s thrill Is it as bad as ever he asked her in a whisper It s pretty bad I ve tried to appease her I told her about the bazaar She said she couldn t spare me and of course I acquiesced Then yesterday the Duchess hush Mademoiselle Lady Henry s voice rang imperiously through the room Yes Lady Henry Mademoiselle Le Breton stood up expectant Find me please that number of the Revue des Deux Mondes which came in yesterday I can prove it to you in two minutes she said turning triumphantly to Montresor on her right What s the matter said Sir Wilfrid joining Lady Henry s circle while Mademoiselle Le Breton disappeared into the back drawing room Oh nothing said Montresor tranquilly Lady Henry thinks she has caught me out in a blunder about Favre and the negotiations at Versailles I dare say she has I am the most ignorant person alive Then are the rest of us spooks said Sir Wilfrid smiling as he seated himself beside his hostess Montresor whose information on most subjects was prodigious laughed and adjusted his eye glass These battles royal on a date or a point of fact between him and Lady Henry were not uncommon Lady Henry was rarely victorious This time however she was confident and she sat frowning and impatient for the book that didn t come Mademoiselle Le Breton indeed returned from the back drawing room empty handed left the room apparently to look elsewhere and came back still without the book Everything in this house is always in confusion said Lady Henry angrily No order no method anywhere Mademoiselle Julie said nothing She retreated behind the circle that surrounded Lady Henry But Montresor jumped up and offered her his chair I wish I had you for a secretary mademoiselle he said gallantly I never before heard Lady Henry ask you for anything you couldn t find Lady Henry flushed and turning abruptly to Bury began a new topic Julie quietly refused the seat offered to her and was retiring to an ottoman in the background when the door was thrown open and the footman announced Captain Warkworth VI The new comer drew all eyes as he approached the group surrounding Lady Henry 
6637_69607_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Montresor put up his glasses and bestowed on him a few moments of scrutiny during which the Minister s heavily marked face took on the wary fighting aspect which his department and the House of Commons knew 
6637_69607_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The statesman slipped in for an instant between the trifler coming and the trifler gone 
6637_69607_000003_000000	train-clean-360	As for Wilfrid Bury he was dazzled by the young man s good looks Young Harry with his beaver up he thought admiring against his will as the tall slim soldier paid his respects to Lady Henry and with a smiling word or two to the rest of those present took his place beside her in the circle 
none	none	Well have you come for your letters said Lady Henry eying him with a grim favor I think I came for conversation was Warkworth s laughing reply as he looked first at his hostess and then at the circle
6637_69607_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I fear you won t get it said Lady Henry throwing herself back in her chair 
6637_69607_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Montresor can do nothing but quarrel and contradict 
6637_69607_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Montresor lifted his hands in wonder 
6637_69607_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Had I been AEsop he said slyly I would have added another touch to a certain tale 
6637_69607_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Observe please even after the Lamb has been devoured he is still the object of calumny on the part of the Wolf 
none	none	Well well Mademoiselle come and console me 
6637_69607_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Tell me what new follies the Duchess has on foot 
none	none	And pushing his chair back till he found himself on a level with Julie Le Breton the great man plunged into a lively conversation with her Sir Wilfrid Warkworth and a few other habitues endeavored meanwhile to amuse Lady Henry 
6637_69607_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But it was not easy 
none	none	Her brow was lowering her talk forced 
6637_69607_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Throughout Sir Wilfrid perceived in her a strained attention directed towards the conversation on the other side of the room 
6637_69607_000009_000004	train-clean-360	She could neither see it nor hear it but she was jealously conscious of it 
none	none	As for Montresor there was no doubt an element of malice in the court he was now paying to Mademoiselle Julie 
6637_69607_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Lady Henry had been thorny over much during the afternoon even for her oldest friend she had passed bounds he desired perhaps to bring it home to her 
6637_69607_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Julie Le Breton after a first moment of reserve and depression had been beguiled carried away 
none	none	She yielded to her own instincts her own gifts till Montresor drawn on and drawn out found himself floating on a stream of talk which Julie led first into one channel and then into another as she pleased and all to the flattery and glorification of the talker The famous Minister had come to visit Lady Henry as he had done for many Sundays in many years but it was not Lady Henry but her companion to whom his homage of the afternoon was paid who gave him his moment of enjoyment the moment that would bring him there again Lady Henry s fault no doubt but Wilfrid Bury uneasily aware every now and then of the dumb tumult that was raging in the breast of the haughty being beside him felt the pathos of this slow discrowning and was inclined once more rather to be sorry for the older woman than to admire the younger 
6637_69607_000011_000000	train-clean-360	At last Lady Henry could bear it no longer 
6637_69607_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Mademoiselle be so good as to return his father s letters to Captain Warkworth she said abruptly in her coldest voice just as Montresor dropping his head thrown back and knees crossed was about to pour into the ears of his companion the whole confidential history of his appointment to office three years before 
6637_69607_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Julie Le Breton rose at once 
none	none	She went towards a table at the farther end of the large room and Captain Warkworth followed her 
6637_69607_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Montresor perhaps repenting himself a little returned to Lady Henry and though she received him with great coolness the circle round her now augmented by doctor Meredith and another politician or two was reconstituted and presently with a conscious effort visible at least to Bury she exerted herself to hold it and succeeded 
none	none	Suddenly just as Bury had finished a very neat analysis of the Shah s public and private character and while the applauding laughter of the group of intimates amid which he sat told him that his epigrams had been good he happened to raise his eyes towards the distant settee where Julie Le Breton was sitting 
6637_69607_000015_000000	train-clean-360	His smile stiffened on his lips 
6637_69607_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Like an icy wave a swift and tragic impression swept through him 
6637_69607_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He turned away ashamed of having seen and hid himself as it were with relief in the clamor of amusement awakened by his own remarks 
none	none	What had he seen 
6637_69607_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Merely or mainly a woman s face 
6637_69607_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Young Warkworth stood beside the sofa on which sat Lady Henry s companion his hands in his pockets his handsome head bent towards her 
6637_69607_000016_000003	train-clean-360	They had been talking earnestly wholly forgetting and apparently forgotten by the rest of the room 
none	none	On his side there was an air of embarrassment 
6637_69607_000016_000005	train-clean-360	He seemed to be choosing his words with difficulty his eyes on the floor 
6637_69607_000016_000006	train-clean-360	Julie Le Breton on the contrary was looking at him looking with all her soul her ardent unhappy soul unconscious of aught else in the wide world 
6637_69607_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Good God she is in love with him was the thought that rushed through Sir Wilfrid s mind 
none	none	Poor thing Poor thing 
6637_69607_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Sir Wilfrid outstayed his fellow guests 
6637_69607_000018_000001	train-clean-360	By seven o clock all were gone Mademoiselle Le Breton had retired 
6637_69607_000018_000002	train-clean-360	He and Lady Henry were left alone 
none	none	Shut the doors she said peremptorily looking round her as the last guest disappeared
6637_69607_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I must have some private talk with you 
6637_69607_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Well I understand you walked home from the Crowboroughs the other night with that woman 
6637_69607_000020_000000	train-clean-360	She turned sharply upon him 
6637_69607_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The accent was indescribable 
none	none	And with a fierce hand she arranged the folds of her own thick silk dress as though for some relief to the stormy feeling within she would rather have torn than smoothed it Sir Wilfrid seated himself beside her knees crossed finger tips lightly touching the fair eyelashes somewhat lowered Calm beside Tempest
6637_69607_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sorry to hear you speak so he said gravely after a pause Yes I talked with her 
none	none	She met me very fairly on the whole It seemed to me she was quite conscious that her behavior had not been always what it should be and that she was sincerely anxious to change it 
6637_69607_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I did my best as a peacemaker 
none	none	Has she made no signs since no advances 
6637_69607_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Lady Henry threw out her hand in disdain 
none	none	She confessed to me that she had pledged a great deal of the time for which I pay her to Evelyn Crowborough s bazaar and asked what she was to do 
6637_69607_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I told her of course that I would put up with nothing of the kind 
none	none	And were more annoyed alack than propitiated by her confession said Sir Wilfrid with a shrug
6637_69607_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say said Lady Henry 
6637_69607_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 You see I guessed that it was not spontaneous that you had wrung it out of her 
6637_69607_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 What else did you expect me to do cried Sir Wilfrid 
none	none	I seem indeed to have jolly well wasted my time Oh no 
6637_69607_000028_000001	train-clean-360	You were very kind 
6637_69607_000028_000002	train-clean-360	And I dare say you might have done some good 
6637_69607_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I was beginning to to have some returns on myself when the Duchess appeared on the scene 
none	none	Oh the little fool ejaculated Sir Wilfrid under his breath
6637_69607_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 She came of course to beg and protest 
6637_69607_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She offered me her valuable services for all sorts of superfluous things that I didn t want if only I would spare her Julie for this ridiculous bazaar 
none	none	So then my back was put up again and I told her a few home truths about the way in which she had made mischief and forced Julie into a totally false position On which she flew into a passion and said a lot of silly nonsense about Julie that showed me among other things that Mademoiselle Le Breton had broken her solemn compact with me and had told her family history both to Evelyn and to Jacob Delafield 
6637_69607_000030_000003	train-clean-360	That alone would be sufficient to justify me in dismissing her 
none	none	N est ce pas
6637_69607_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes murmured Sir Wilfrid if you want to dismiss her 
6637_69607_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall come to that presently said Lady Henry shortly 
none	none	Imagine please the kind of difficulties in which these confidences if they have gone any further and who knows may land me I shall have old Lord Lackington who behaved like a brute to his daughter while she was alive and is all the same a poseur from top to toe walking in here one night and demanding his granddaughter spreading lies perhaps that I have been ill treating her 
6637_69607_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Who can say what absurdities may happen if it once gets out that she is Lady Rose s child 
6637_69607_000032_000004	train-clean-360	I could name half a dozen people who come here habitually who would consider themselves insulted if they knew what you and I know 
6637_69607_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 insulted 
none	none	if they knew what you and I know Insulted 
6637_69607_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Because her mother 
6637_69607_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Because her mother broke the seventh commandment 
6637_69607_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Oh dear no That in my opinion doesn t touch people much nowadays 
6637_69607_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Insulted because they had been kept in the dark that s all 
6637_69607_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Vanity not morals 
6637_69607_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 As far as I can ascertain said Sir Wilfrid meditatively only the Duchess Delafield Montresor and myself are in the secret 
6637_69607_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Montresor cried Lady Henry beside herself 
none	none	Montresor That s new to me Oh she shall go at once at once She breathed hard
6637_69607_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait a little 
6637_69607_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Have you had any talk with Jacob 
6637_69607_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 I should think not 
6637_69607_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Evelyn of course brings him in perpetually Jacob this and Jacob that 
none	none	He seems to have been living in her pocket and the three have been intriguing against me morning noon and night 
6637_69607_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Where Julie has found the time I can t imagine I thought I had kept her pretty well occupied 
none	none	Sir Wilfrid surveyed his angry companion and held his peace
6637_69607_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 So you don t know what Jacob thinks 
6637_69607_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should I want to know said Lady Henry disdainfully 
6637_69607_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 A lad whom I sent to Eton and Oxford when his father couldn t pay his bills what does it matter to me what he thinks 
6637_69607_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 what does it matter to me 
none	none	what he thinks
6637_69607_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Women are strange folk thought Sir Wilfrid 
none	none	A man wouldn t have said that 
6637_69607_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Then aloud 
6637_69607_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you were afraid lest he should want to marry her 
none	none	Oh let him cut his throat if he likes said Lady Henry with the inconsistency of fury What does it matter to me
6637_69607_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 By the way as to that he spoke as though feeling his way have you never had suspicions in quite another direction 
none	none	What do you mean
6637_69607_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I hear a good deal in various quarters of the trouble Mademoiselle Le Breton is taking on behalf of that young soldier who was here just now Harry Warkworth 
6637_69607_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Lady Henry laughed impatiently 
none	none	I dare say 
6637_69607_000050_000001	train-clean-360	She is always wanting to patronize or influence somebody It s in her nature 
none	none	She s a born intrigante If you knew her as well as I do you wouldn t think much of that Oh no make your mind easy It s Jacob she wants it s Jacob she ll get very likely 
6637_69607_000050_000005	train-clean-360	What can an old blind creature like me do to stop it 
6637_69607_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 And as Jacob s wife the wife perhaps of the head of the family you still mean to quarrel with her 
none	none	Yes I do mean to quarrel with her and Lady Henry lifted herself in her chair a pale and quivering image of war Duchess or no Duchess Did you see the audacious way in which she behaved this afternoon how she absorbs my guests how she allows and encourages a man like Montresor to forget himself eggs him on to put slights on me in my own drawing room No no 
6637_69607_000053_000001	train-clean-360	You are really unjust said Sir Wilfrid laying a kind hand upon her arm 
6637_69607_000053_000002	train-clean-360	 That was not her fault 
none	none	It is her fault that she is what she is that her character is such that she forces comparisons between us between her and me that she pushes herself into a prominence that is intolerable considering who and what she is that she makes me appear in an odious light to my old friends 
6637_69607_000054_000001	train-clean-360	No no Wilfrid your first instinct was the true one 
6637_69607_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I shall have to bring myself to it whatever it costs 
6637_69607_000054_000003	train-clean-360	She must take her departure or I shall go to pieces morally and physically 
none	none	To be in a temper like this at my age shortens one s life you know that
6637_69607_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 And you can t subdue the temper he asked with a queer smile 
none	none	No I can t 
6637_69607_000056_000001	train-clean-360	That s flat 
6637_69607_000056_000002	train-clean-360	She gets on my nerves and I m not responsible 
none	none	C est fini
6637_69607_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he said slowly I hope you understand what it means 
none	none	Oh I know she has plenty of friends she said defiantly But her old hands trembled on her knee Unfortunately they were and are yours 
6637_69607_000059_000001	train-clean-360	At least he entreated don t quarrel with everybody who may sympathize with her 
6637_69607_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Let them take what view they please 
none	none	Ignore it be as magnanimous as you can
6637_69607_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 On the contrary She was now white to the lips 
6637_69607_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Whoever goes with her gives me up 
none	none	They must choose once for all
6637_69607_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear friend listen to reason 
6637_69607_000062_000000	train-clean-360	And drawing his chair close to her he argued with her for half an hour 
none	none	At the end of that time her gust of passion had more or less passed away she was to some extent ashamed of herself and as he believed not far from tears When I am gone she will think of what I have been saying he assured himself and he rose to take his leave 
6637_69607_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Her look of exhaustion distressed him and for all her unreason he felt himself astonishingly in sympathy with her 
6637_69607_000063_000002	train-clean-360	The age in him held out secret hands to the age in her as against encroaching and rebellious youth 
6637_69607_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Perhaps it was the consciousness of this mood in him which at last partly appeased her 
6637_69607_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I ll try again 
none	none	I ll try to hold my tongue she granted him sullenly But understand she sha n t go to that bazaar
6637_69607_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a great pity was his naive reply 
6637_69607_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 Nothing would put you in a better position than to give her leave 
6637_69607_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall do nothing of the kind she vowed 
none	none	And now good night Wilfrid good night You re a very good fellow and if I can take your advice I will 
6637_69607_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Lady Henry sat alone in her brightly lighted drawing room for some time She could neither read nor write nor sew owing to her blindness and in the reaction from her passion of the afternoon she felt herself very old and weary 
6637_69607_000069_000000	train-clean-360	But at last the door opened and Julie Le Breton s light step approached 
6637_69607_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 May I read to you she said gently 
none	none	Lady Henry coldly commanded the Observer and her knitting 
6637_69607_000072_000000	train-clean-360	She had no sooner however begun to knit than her very acute sense of touch noticed something wrong with the wool she was using 
6637_69607_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 This is not the wool I ordered she said fingering it carefully 
6637_69607_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 You remember I gave you a message about it on Thursday 
none	none	What did they say about it at Winton s 
6637_69607_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Julie laid down the newspaper and looked in perplexity at the ball of wool 
6637_69607_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 I remember you gave me a message she faltered 
6637_69607_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what did they say 
6637_69607_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose that was all they had 
6637_69607_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Something in the tone struck Lady Henry s quick ears 
none	none	She raised a suspicious face
6637_69607_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you ever go to Winton s at all she said quickly 
none	none	Illustration LADY HENRY GASPED SHE FELL BACK INTO HER CHAIR
6637_69607_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I am so sorry 
6637_69607_000081_000001	train-clean-360	The Duchess s maid was going there said Julie hurriedly and she went for me 
none	none	I thought I had given her your message most carefully
6637_69607_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Hm said Lady Henry slowly 
6637_69607_000082_000001	train-clean-360	 So you didn t go to Winton s 
none	none	May I ask whether you went to Shaw s or to Beatson s or the Stores or any of the other places for which I gave you commissions Her voice cut like a knife 
6637_69607_000083_000000	train-clean-360	Julie hesitated 
6637_69607_000083_000001	train-clean-360	She had grown very white 
6637_69607_000083_000002	train-clean-360	Suddenly her face settled and steadied 
6637_69607_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 No she said calmly 
6637_69607_000084_000001	train-clean-360	 I meant to have done all your commissions 
none	none	But I was persuaded by Evelyn to spend a couple of hours with her and her maid undertook them 
6637_69607_000085_000000	train-clean-360	Lady Henry flushed deeply 
none	none	So mademoiselle unknown to me you spent two hours of my time amusing yourself at Crowborough House 
6637_69607_000086_000001	train-clean-360	May I ask what you were doing there 
6637_69607_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 I was trying to help the Duchess in her plans for the bazaar 
none	none	Indeed 
6637_69607_000088_000001	train-clean-360	Was any one else there 
6637_69607_000088_000002	train-clean-360	Answer me mademoiselle 
6637_69607_000089_000000	train-clean-360	Julie hesitated again and again spoke with a kind of passionate composure 
none	none	Yes 
6637_69607_000090_000001	train-clean-360	mister Delafield was there 
none	none	So I supposed 
6637_69607_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Allow me to assure you mademoiselle Lady Henry rose from her seat leaning on her stick surely no old face was ever more formidable more withering that whatever ambitions you may cherish Jacob Delafield is not altogether the simpleton you imagine 
none	none	I know him better than you 
6637_69607_000091_000003	train-clean-360	He will take some time before he really makes up his mind to marry a woman of your disposition and your history 
6637_69607_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Julie Le Breton also rose 
none	none	I am afraid Lady Henry that here too you are in the dark she said quietly though her thin arm shook against her dress
6637_69607_000093_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall not marry mister Delafield 
6637_69607_000093_000002	train-clean-360	But it is because I have refused him twice 
none	none	Lady Henry gasped 
6637_69607_000094_000001	train-clean-360	She fell back into her chair staring at her companion 
6637_69607_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 You have refused him 
6637_69607_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 A month ago and last year 
none	none	It is horrid of me to say a word 
6637_69607_000096_000002	train-clean-360	But you forced me 
none	none	Julie was now leaning to support herself on the back of an old French chair 
6637_69607_000097_000001	train-clean-360	Feeling and excitement had blanched her no less than Lady Henry but her fine head and delicate form breathed a will so proud a dignity so passionate that Lady Henry shrank before her 
6637_69607_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you refuse him 
6637_69607_000099_000000	train-clean-360	Julie shrugged her shoulders 
6637_69607_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 That I think is my affair 
6637_69607_000100_000001	train-clean-360	But if I had loved him I should not have consulted your scruples Lady Henry 
6637_69607_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 That s frank said Lady Henry 
6637_69607_000101_000001	train-clean-360	 I like that better than anything you ve said yet 
none	none	You are aware that he may inherit the dukedom of Chudleigh
6637_69607_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 I have several times heard you say so said the other coldly 
none	none	Lady Henry looked at her long and keenly 
6637_69607_000103_000001	train-clean-360	Various things that Wilfrid Bury had said recurred to her 
6637_69607_000103_000002	train-clean-360	She thought of Captain Warkworth She wondered 
none	none	Suddenly she held out her hand I dare say you won t take it mademoiselle 
6637_69607_000105_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose I ve been insulting you 
6637_69607_000105_000002	train-clean-360	But you have been playing tricks with me 
6637_69607_000105_000003	train-clean-360	In a good many ways we re quits 
6637_69607_000105_000004	train-clean-360	Still I confess I admire you a good deal 
6637_69607_000105_000005	train-clean-360	Anyway I offer you my hand 
6637_69607_000105_000006	train-clean-360	I apologize for my recent remarks 
6637_69607_000105_000007	train-clean-360	Shall we bury the hatchet and try and go on as before 
6637_69607_000106_000000	train-clean-360	Julie Le Breton turned slowly and took the hand without unction 
6637_69607_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 I make you angry she said and her voice trembled without knowing how or why 
6637_69607_000108_000000	train-clean-360	Lady Henry gulped

none	none	Another day like this would put an end to me VII Julie le Breton was sitting alone in her own small sitting room It was the morning of the Tuesday following her Sunday scene with Lady Henry and she was busy with various household affairs A small hamper of flowers newly arrived from Lady Henry s Surrey garden and not yet unpacked was standing open on the table with various empty flower glasses beside it Julie was at the moment occupied with the Stores order for the month and Lady Henry s cook housekeeper had but just left the room after delivering an urgent statement on the need for relining a large number of Lady Henry s copper saucepans The room was plain and threadbare It had been the school room of various generations of Delafields in the past But for an observant eye it contained a good many objects which threw light upon its present occupant s character and history In a small bookcase beside the fire were a number of volumes in French bindings They represented either the French classics Racine Bossuet Chateaubriand Lamartine which had formed the study of Julie s convent days or those other books George Sand Victor Hugo Alfred de Musset Mazzini Leopardi together with the poets and novelists of revolutionary Russia or Polish nationalism or Irish rebellion which had been the favorite reading of both Lady Rose and her lover They were but a hundred in all but for Julie Le Breton they stood for the bridge by which at will memory and dreamful pity might carry her back into that vanished life she had once shared with her parents those strange beings so calm and yet so passionate in their beliefs so wilful and yet so patient in their deeds by whose acts her own experience was still wholly conditioned In her little room there were no portraits of them visible But on a side table stood a small carved triptych The oblong wings which were open contained photographs of figures from one of the great Bruges Memlings The centre was covered by two wooden leaves delicately carved and the leaves were locked The inquisitive housemaid who dusted the room had once tried to open them in vain On a stand near the fire lay two or three yellow volumes some recent French essays a volume of memoirs a tale of Bourget s and so forth These were flanked by Sir Henry Maine s Popular Government and a recent brilliant study of English policy in Egypt both of them with the name Richard J Montresor on the title page The last number of doctor Meredith s paper The New Rambler was there also and with the paper knife still in its leaves the journal of the latest French traveller in Mokembe a small H W inscribed in the top right hand corner of its gray cover Julie finished her Stores order with a sigh of relief Then she wrote half a dozen business notes and prepared a few checks for Lady Henry s signature When this was done the two dachshunds who had been lying on the rug spying out her every movement began to jump upon her But Julie laughed in their faces It s raining she said pointing to the window raining So there Either you won t go out at all or you ll go with John John was the second footman whom the dogs hated They returned crestfallen to the rug and to a hungry waiting on Providence Julie took up a letter on foreign paper which had reached her that morning glanced at the door and began to reread its closely written sheets It was from an English diplomat on a visit to Egypt a man on whom the eyes of Europe were at that moment fixed That he should write to a woman at all on the subjects of the letter involved a compliment hors ligne that he should write with this ease this abandonment was indeed remarkable Julie flushed a little as she read But when she came to the end she put it aside with a look of worry I wish he d write to Lady Henry was her thought She hasn t had a line from him for weeks I shouldn t wonder if she suspects already When any one talks of Egypt I daren t open my lips For fear of betraying the very minute and first hand information that was possessed by Lady Henry s companion With a smile and a shrug she locked the letter away in one of the drawers of her writing table and took up an envelope which had lain beneath it From this again with a look round her she half drew out a photograph The grizzled head and spectacled eyes of doctor Meredith emerged Julie s expression softened her eyebrows went up a little then she slightly shook her head like one who protests that if something has gone wrong it isn t isn t their fault Unwillingly she looked at the last words of the letter So remember I can give you work if you want it and paying work I would rather give you my life and my all But these it seems are commodities for which you have no use So be it But if you refuse to let me serve you when the time comes in such ways as I have suggested in this letter then indeed you would be unkind I would almost dare to say ungrateful Yours always F M This letter also she locked away But her hand lingered on the last of all She had read it three times already and knew it practically by heart So she left the sheets undisturbed in their envelope But she raised the whole to her lips and pressed it there while her eyes as they slowly filled with tears travelled unseeing to the wintry street beyond the window Eyes and face wore the same expression as Wilfrid Bury had surprised there the dumb utterance of a woman hard pressed not so much by the world without as by some wild force within In that still moment the postman s knock was heard in the street outside Julie Le Breton started for no one whose life is dependent on a daily letter can hear that common sound without a thrill Then she smiled sadly at herself My joy is over for to day And she turned away with the letter in her hand But she did not place it in the same drawer with the others She moved across to the little carved triptych and after listening a moment to the sounds in the house she opened its closed doors with a gold key that hung on her watch chain and had been hidden in the bosom of her dress The doors fell open Inside on a background of dark velvet hung two miniatures lightly framed in gold and linked together by a graceful scroll work in gold They were of fine French work and they represented a man and woman both handsome young and of a remarkable distinction of aspect The faces nevertheless hardly gave pleasure There was in each of them a look at once absent and eager the look of those who have cared much and ardently for man and very little comparatively for men The miniatures had not been meant for the triptych nor the triptych for them It had been adapted to them by loving hands but there was room for other things in the velvet lined hollow and a packet of letters was already reposing there Julie slipped the letter of the morning inside the elastic band which held the packet then she closed and locked the doors returning the key to its place in her dress Both the lock and hinges of this little hiding place were well and strongly made and when the wings also were shut and locked one saw nothing but a massively framed photograph of the Bruges belfry resting on a wooden support She had hardly completed her little task when there was a sudden noise of footsteps in the passage outside Julie said a light voice subdued to a laughing whisper May I come in The Duchess stood on the threshold her small shell pink face emerging from a masterly study in gray presented by a most engaging costume Julie in surprise advanced to meet her visitor and the old butler who was Miss Le Breton s very good friend quickly and discreetly shut the door upon the two ladies Oh my dear said the Duchess throwing herself into Julie s arms I came up so quietly I told Hutton not to disturb Lady Henry and I just crept up stairs holding my skirts Wasn t it heroic of me to put my poor little head into the lion s den like this But when I got your letter this morning saying you couldn t come to me I vowed I would just see for myself how you were and whether there was anything left of you Oh you poor pale thing And drawing Julie to a chair the little Duchess sat down beside her holding her friend s hands and studying her face Tell me what s been happening I believe you ve been crying Oh the old wretch You re quite mistaken said Julie smiling Lady Henry says I may help you with the bazaar No The Duchess threw up her hands in amazement How have you managed that By giving in But Evelyn I m not coming Oh Julie The Duchess threw herself back in her chair and fixed a pair of very blue and very reproachful eyes on Miss Le Breton No I m not coming If I m to stay here even for a time I mustn t provoke her any more She says I may come but she doesn t mean it She couldn t mean anything civil or agreeable How has she been behaving since Sunday Julie looked uncertain Oh there is an armed truce I was made to have a fire in my bedroom last night And Hutton took the dogs out yesterday The Duchess laughed And there was quite a scene on Sunday You don t tell me much about it in your letter But Julie her voice dropped to a whisper was anything said about Jacob Julie looked down A bitterness crept into her face Yes I can t forgive myself I was provoked into telling the truth You did Well I suppose Aunt Flora thought it was all your fault that he proposed and an impertinence that you refused She was complimentary at the time said Julie half smiling But since No I don t feel that she is appeased Of course not Affronted more likely There was a silence The Duchess was looking at Julie but her thoughts were far away And presently she broke out with the etourderie that became her I wish I understood it myself Julie I know you like him Immensely But we should fight Miss Le Breton looked up with animation Oh that s not a reason said the Duchess rather annoyed It s the reason I don t know there is something of iron in mister Delafield and Julie emphasized the words with a shrug which was almost a shiver And as I m not in love with him I m afraid of him That s the best way of being in love cried the Duchess And then Julie she paused and at last added naively as she laid her little hands on her friend s knee haven t you got any ambitions Plenty Oh I should like very well to play the duchess with you to instruct me said Julie caressing the hands But I must choose my duke And till the right one appears I prefer my own wild ways Afraid of Jacob Delafield How odd said the Duchess with her chin on her hands It may be odd to you said Julie with vivacity In reality it s not in the least odd There s the same quality in him that there is in Lady Henry something that beats you down she added under her breath There that s enough about mister Delafield quite enough And rising Julie threw up her arms and clasped her hands above her head The gesture was all strength and will like the stretching of a sea bird s wings The Duchess looked at her with eyes that had begun to waver Julie I heard such an odd piece of news last night Julie turned You remember the questions you asked me about Aileen Moffatt Perfectly Well I saw a man last night who had just come home from Simla He saw a great deal of her and he says that she and her mother were adored in India They were thought so quaint and sweet unlike other people and the girl so lovely in a sort of gossamer way And who do you think was always about with them at Peshawar first and then at Simla so that everybody talked Captain Warkworth My man believed there was an understanding between them Julie had begun to fill the flower glasses with water and unpack the flower basket Her back was towards the Duchess After a moment she replied her hands full of forced narcissuses Well that would be a coup for him I should think so She is supposed to have half a million in coal mines alone besides land Has Captain Warkworth ever said anything to you about them No He has never mentioned them The Duchess reflected her eyes still on Julie s back Everybody wants money nowadays And the soldiers are just as bad as anybody else They don t look money as the City men do that s why we women fall in love with them but they think it all the same Julie made no reply The Duchess could see nothing of her But the little lady s face showed the flutter of one determined to venture yet a little farther on thin ice Julie I ve done everything you ve asked me I sent a card for the twentieth to that rather dreadful woman Lady Froswick I was very clever with Freddie about that living and I ve talked to mister Montresor But Julie if you don t mind I really should like to know why you re so keen about it The Duchess s cheeks were by now one flush She had a romantic affection for Julie and would not have offended her for the world Julie turned round She was always pale and the Duchess saw nothing unusual Am I so keen Julie you have done everything in the world for this man since he came home Well he interested me said Julie stepping back to look at the effect of one of the vases The first evening he was here he saved me from Lady Henry twice He s alone in the world too which attracts me You see I happen to know what it s like An only son and an orphan and no family interest to push him So you thought you d push him Oh Julie you re a darling but you re rather a wire puller aren t you Julie smiled faintly Well perhaps I like to feel sometimes that I have a little power I haven t much else The Duchess seized one of her hands and pressed it to her cheek You have power because every one loves and admires you As for me I would cut myself in little bits to please you Well I only hope when he s married his heiress if he does marry her they ll remember what they owe to you Did she feel the hand lying in her own shake At any rate it was brusquely withdrawn and Julie walked to the end of the table to fetch some more flowers I don t want any gratitude she said abruptly from any one Well now Evelyn you understand about the bazaar I wish I could but I can t Yes I understand Julie The Duchess rose impulsively and threw herself into a chair beside the table where she could watch the face and movements of Mademoiselle Le Breton Julie I want so much to talk to you about business You re not to be offended Julie if you leave Lady Henry how will you manage How shall I live you mean said Julie smiling at the euphemism in which this little person for whom existence had rained gold and flowers since her cradle had enwrapped the hard facts of bread and butter facts with which she was so little acquainted that she approached them with a certain delicate mystery You must have some money you know Julie said the Duchess timidly her upraised face and Paris hat well matched by the gay poinsettias the delicate eucharis and arums with which the table was now covered I shall earn some said Julie quietly Oh but Julie you can t be bothered with any other tiresome old lady No I should keep my freedom But doctor Meredith has offered me work and got me a promise of more The Duchess opened her eyes Writing Well of course we all know you can do anything you want to do And you won t let anybody help you at all I won t let anybody give me money if that s what you mean said Julie smiling But it was a smile without accent without gayety The Duchess watching her said to herself Since I came in she is changed quite changed Julie you re horribly proud Julie s face contracted a little How much power should I have left do you think how much self respect if I took money from my friends Well not money perhaps But Julie you know all about Freddie s London property It s abominable how much he has There are always a few houses he keeps in his own hands If Lady Henry does quarrel with you and we could lend you a little house for a time wouldn t you take it Julie Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child Julie hesitated Only if the Duke himself offered it she said finally with a brusque stiffening of her whole attitude The Duchess flushed and stood up Oh well that s all right she said but no longer in the same voice Remember I have your promise Good bye Julie you darling Oh by the way what an idiot I am Here am I forgetting the chief thing I came about Will you come with me to Lady Hubert to night Do Freddie s away and I hate going by myself To Lady Hubert s said Julie starting a little I wonder what Lady Henry would say Tell her Jacob won t be there said the Duchess laughing Then she won t make any difficulties Shall I go and ask her Gracious let me get out of the house first Give her a message from me that I will come and see her to morrow morning We ve got to make it up Freddie says so the sooner it s over the better Say all the civil things you can to her about to night and wire me this afternoon If all s well I come for you at eleven The Duchess rustled away Julie was left standing by the table alone Her face was very still but her eyes shone her teeth pressed her lip Unconsciously her hand closed upon a delicate blossom of eucharis and crushed it I ll go she said to herself Yes I ll go Her letter of the morning as it happened had included the following sentences I think to night I must put in an appearance at the Hubert Delafields though I own that neither the house nor the son of the house is very much to my liking But I hear that he has gone back to the country And there are a few people who frequent Lady Hubert who might just now be of use Lady Henry gave her consent that Mademoiselle Le Breton should accompany the Duchess to Lady Hubert s party almost with effusion It will be very dull she said My sister in law makes a desert and calls it society But if you want to go go As to Evelyn Crowborough I am engaged to my dentist to morrow morning When at night this message was reported to the Duchess as she and Julie were on their way to Rutland Gate she laughed How much leek shall I have to swallow What s to morrow Wednesday Hm cards in the afternoon in the evening I appear sit on a stool at Lady Henry s feet and look at you through my glasses as though I had never seen you before On Thursday I leave a French book on Friday I send the baby to see her Goodness what a time it takes said the Duchess raising her very white and very small shoulders Well for my life I mustn t fail to morrow night At Lady Hubert s they found a very tolerable not to say lively gathering which quite belied Lady Henry s slanders There was not the same conscious brilliance the same thrill in the air as pertained to the gatherings in Bruton Street But there was a more solid social comfort such as befits people untroubled by the certainty that the world is looking on The guests of Bruton Street laughed as well bred people should at the estimation in which Lady Henry s salon was held by those especially who did not belong to it Still the mere knowledge of this outside estimate kept up a certain tension At Lady Hubert s there was no tension and the agreeable nobodies who found their way in were not made to blush for the agreeable nothings of their conversation Lady Hubert herself made for ease partly no doubt for stupidity She was fair sleepy and substantial Her husband had spent her fortune and ruffled all the temper she had The Hubert Delafields were now however better off than they had been investments had recovered and Lady Hubert s temper was once more placid as Providence had meant it to be During the coming season it was her firm intention to marry her daughter who now stood beside her as she received her guests a blonde sweet featured girl given however so it was said to good works and not at all inclined to trouble herself overmuch about a husband The rooms were fairly full and the entry of the Duchess and Mademoiselle Le Breton was one of the incidents of the evening and visibly quickened the pulses of the assembly The little Dresden china Duchess with her clothes her jewels and her smiles had been since her marriage one of the chief favorites of fashion She had been brought up in the depths of the country and married at eighteen After six years she was not in the least tired of her popularity or its penalties All the life in her dainty person her glancing eyes and small smiling lips rose as it were to meet the stir that she evoked She vaguely saw herself as Titania and played the part with childish glee And like Titania as she had more than once ruefully reflected she was liable to be chidden by her lord But the Duke was on this particular evening debating high subjects in the House of Lords and the Duchess was amusing herself Sir Wilfrid Bury who arrived not long after his goddaughter found her the centre first of a body guard of cousins including among them apparently a great many handsome young men and then of a small crowd whose vaguely smiling faces reflected the pleasure that was to be got even at a distance out of her young and merry beauty Julie Le Breton was not with her But in the next room Sir Wilfrid soon perceived the form and face which in their own way exacted quite as much attention from the world as those of the Duchess She was talking with many people and as usual he could not help watching her Never yet had he seen her wide black eyes more vivid than they were to night Now as on his first sight of her he could not bring himself to call them beautiful Yet beautiful they were by every canon of form and color No doubt it was something in their expression that offended his own well drilled instincts He found himself thinking suspicious thoughts about most of the conversations in which he saw her engaged Why was she bestowing those careful smiles on that intolerable woman Lady Froswick And what an acquaintance she seemed to have among these elderly soldiers who might at all times be reckoned on at Lady Hubert s parties One gray haired veteran after another recalled himself to her attention got his few minutes with her and passed on smiling Certain high officials too were no less friendly Her court it seemed to him was mainly composed of the middle aged to night at any rate she left the young to the Duchess And it was on the whole a court of men The women as he now perceived were a trifle more reserved There was not indeed a trace of exclusion They were glad to see her glad he thought to be noticed by her But they did not yield themselves or so he fancied with the same wholeness as their husbands How old is she he asked himself About nine and twenty Jacob s age or a trifle older After a time he lost sight of her and in the amusement of his own evening forgot her But as the rooms were beginning to thin he walked through them looking for a famous collection of miniatures that belonged to Lady Hubert English family history was one of his hobbies and he was far better acquainted with the Delafield statesmen and the Delafield beauties of the past than were any of their modern descendants Lady Hubert s Cosways and Plimers had made a lively impression upon him in days gone by and he meant to renew acquaintance with them But they had been moved from the room in which he remembered them and he was led on through a series of drawing rooms now nearly empty till on the threshold of the last he paused suddenly A lady and gentleman rose from a sofa on which they had been sitting Captain Warkworth stood still Mademoiselle Le Breton advanced to the new comer Is it very late she said gathering up her fan and gloves We have been looking at Lady Hubert s miniatures That lady with the muff she pointed to the case which occupied a conspicuous position in the room is really wonderful Can you tell me Sir Wilfrid where the Duchess is No but I can help you find her said that gentleman forgetting the miniatures and endeavoring to look at neither of his companions And I must rush said Captain Warkworth looking at his watch I told a man to come to my rooms at twelve Heavens He shook hands with Miss Le Breton and hurried away Sir Wilfrid and Julie moved on together That he had disturbed a most intimate and critical conversation was somehow borne in upon Sir Wilfrid But kind and even romantic as was the old man s inmost nature his feelings were not friendly How does the biography get on he asked his companion with a smile A bright flush appeared in Mademoiselle Le Breton s cheek I think Lady Henry has dropped it Ah well I don t imagine she will regret it he said dryly She made no reply He mentally accused himself for a brute and then shook off the charge Surely a few pin pricks were her desert That she should defend her own secrets was as Delafield had said legitimate enough But when a man offers you his services you should not befool him beyond a certain point She must be aware of what he was thinking He glanced at her curiously at the stately dress gleaming with jet which no longer affected anything of the girl at the fine but old fashioned necklace of pearls and diamonds no doubt her mother s which clasped her singularly slender throat At any rate she showed nothing She began to talk again of the Delafield miniatures using her fan the while with graceful deliberation and presently they found the Duchess Is she an adventuress or is she not thought Bury as his hansom carried him away from Rutland Gate If she marries Jacob it will be a queer business VIII Meanwhile the Duchess had dropped Julie Le Breton at Lady Henry s door Julie groped her way up stairs through the sleeping house She found her room in darkness and she turned on no light There was still a last glimmer of fire and she sank down by it her long arms clasped round her knees her head thrown back as though she listened still to words in her ears Oh such a child Such a dear simple minded child Report engaged her to at least ten different people at Simla She had a crowd of cavaliers there I was one of them The whole place adored her She is a very rare little creature but well looked after I can tell you a long array of guardians in the background How was it possible not to trust that aspect and that smile Her mind travelled back to the autumn days when she had seen them first reviewed the steps so little noticed at first so rapid lately and full of fate by which she had come into this bondage wherein she stood She saw the first appearance of the young soldier in Lady Henry s drawing room her first conversation with him and all the subtle development of that singular relation between them into which so many elements had entered The flattering sense of social power implied both in the homage of this young and successful man and in the very services that she on her side was able to render him impulsive gratitude for that homage at a time when her very soul was smarting under Lady Henry s contemptuous hostility and then the sweet advances of a friendship that was to unite them in a bond secret and unique a bond that took no account of the commonplaces of love and marriage the link of equal and kindred souls in a common struggle with hard and sordid circumstance I have neither family nor powerful friends he had written to her a few weeks after their first meeting all that I have won I have won for myself Nobody ever made interest for me but you You too are alone in the world You too have to struggle for yourself Let us unite our forces cheer each other care for each other and keep our friendship a sacred secret from the world that would misunderstand it I will not fail you I will give you all my confidence and I will try and understand that noble wounded heart of yours with its memories and all those singular prides and isolations that have been imposed on it by circumstance I will not say let me be your brother there is something banal in that friend is good enough for us both and there is between us a community of intellectual and spiritual interest which will enable us to add new meaning even to that sacred word I will write to you every day you shall know all that happens to me and whatever grateful devotion can do to make your life smoother shall be done Five months ago was it that that letter was written Its remembered phrases already rang bitterly in an aching heart Since it reached her she had put out all her powers as a woman all her influence as an intelligence in the service of the writer And now here she sat in the dark tortured by a passion of which she was ashamed before which she was beginning to stand helpless in a kind of terror The situation was developing and she found herself wondering how much longer she would be able to control herself or it Very miserably conscious too was she all the time that she was now playing for a reward that was secretly tacitly humiliatingly denied her How could a poor man with Harry Warkworth s ambitions think for a moment of marriage with a woman in her ambiguous and dependent position Her common sense told her that the very notion was absurd And yet since the Duchess s gossip had given point and body to a hundred vague suspicions she was no longer able to calm to master herself Suddenly a thought of another kind occurred to her It added to her smart that Sir Wilfrid in their meeting at Lady Hubert s had spoken to her and looked at her with that slight touch of laughing contempt There had been no insincerity in that emotion with which she had first appealed to him as her mother s friend she did truly value the old man s good opinion And yet she had told him lies I can t help it she said to herself with a little shiver The story about the biography had been the invention of a moment It had made things easy and it had a small foundation in the fact that Lady Henry had talked vaguely of using the letters lent her by Captain Warkworth for the elucidation perhaps in a Nineteenth Century article of certain passages in her husband s Indian career Jacob Delafield too There also it was no less clear to her than to Sir Wilfrid that she had overdone it It was true then what Lady Henry said of her that she had an overmastering tendency to intrigue to a perpetual tampering with the plain fact Well it is the way in which such people as I defend themselves she said obstinately repeating to herself what she had said to Sir Wilfrid Bury And then she set against it proudly that disinterestedness of which as she vowed to herself no one but she knew the facts It was true what she had said to the Duchess and to Sir Wilfrid Plenty of people would give her money would make her life comfortable without the need for any daily slavery She would not take it Jacob Delafield would marry her if she lifted her finger and she would not lift it doctor Meredith would marry her and she had said him nay She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity It comforted her pride It drew a veil over that wounding laughter which had gleamed for a moment through those long lashes of Sir Wilfrid Bury Last of all as she sank into her restless sleep came the remembrance that she was still under Lady Henry s roof In the silence of the night the difficulties of her situation pressed upon and tormented her What was she to do Whom was she to trust Dixon how is Lady Henry Much too ill to come down stairs miss She s very much put out in fact miss the maid lowered her voice you hardly dare go near her But she says herself it would be absurd to attempt it Has Hatton had any orders Yes miss I ve just told him what her ladyship wishes He s to tell everybody that Lady Henry s very sorry and hoped up to the last moment to be able to come down as usual Has Lady Henry all she wants Dixon Have you taken her the evening papers Oh yes miss But if you go in to her much her ladyship says you re disturbing her and if you don t go why of course everybody s neglecting her Do you think I may go and say good night to her Dixon The maid hesitated I ll ask her miss I ll certainly ask her The door closed and Julie was left alone in the great drawing room of the Bruton Street house It had been prepared as usual for the Wednesday evening party The flowers were fresh the chairs had been arranged as Lady Henry liked to have them the parquet floors shone under the electric light the Gainsboroughs seemed to look down from the walls with a gay and friendly expectancy For herself Julie had just finished her solitary dinner still buoyed up while she was eating it by the hope that Lady Henry would be able to come down The bitter winds of the two previous days however had much aggravated her chronic rheumatism She was certainly ill and suffering but Julie had known her make such heroic efforts before this to keep her Wednesdays going that not till Dixon appeared with her verdict did she give up hope So everybody would be turned away Julie paced the drawing room a solitary figure amid its lights and flowers solitary and dejected In a couple of hours time all her particular friends would come to the door and it would be shut against them Of course expect me to night had been the concluding words of her letter of the morning Several people also had announced themselves for this evening whom it was extremely desirable she should see A certain eminent colonel professor at the Staff College was being freely named in the papers for the Mokembe mission Never was it more necessary for her to keep all the threads of her influence in good working order And these Wednesday evenings offered her the occasions when she was most successful most at her ease especially whenever Lady Henry was not well enough to leave the comparatively limited sphere of the back drawing room Moreover the gatherings themselves ministered to a veritable craving in Julie Le Breton the craving for society and conversation She shared it with Lady Henry but in her it was even more deeply rooted Lady Henry had ten talents in the Scriptural sense money rank all sorts of inherited bonds and associations Julie Le Breton had but this one Society was with her both an instinct and an art With the subtlest and most intelligent ambition she had trained and improved her natural gift for it during the last few years And now to the excitement of society was added the excitement of a new and tyrannous feeling for which society was henceforth a mere weapon to be used She fumed and fretted for a while in silence Every now and then she would pause in front of one of the great mirrors of the room and look at the reflection of her tall thinness and the trailing satin of her gown The girl so pretty in a gossamer sort of way The words echoed in her mind and vaguely beside her own image in the glass there rose a vision of girlhood pale gold hair pink cheeks white frock and she turned away miserable from that conscious that intellectual distinction with which in general she could persuade herself to be very fairly satisfied Hutton the butler came in to look at the fire Will you be sitting here to night miss Oh no Hutton I shall go back to the library I think the fire in my own room is out I had better put out these lights anyway said the man looking round the brilliant room Oh certainly said Julie and she began to assist him to do so Suddenly a thought occurred to her Hutton She went up to him and spoke in a lower tone If the Duchess of Crowborough comes to night I should very much like to see her and I know she wants to see me Do you think it could possibly disturb Lady Henry if you were to show her into the library for twenty minutes The man considered I don t think there could be anything heard up stairs miss I should of course warn her grace that her ladyship was ill Well then Hutton please ask her to come in said Miss Le Breton hurriedly And Hutton doctor Meredith and mister Montresor you know how disappointed they ll be not to find Lady Henry at home Yes miss They ll want to know how her ladyship is no doubt I ll tell them you re in the library And Captain Warkworth miss he s never missed a Wednesday evening for weeks Oh well if he comes you must judge for yourself Hutton said Miss Le Breton occupying herself with the electric switches I should like to tell them all the old friends how Lady Henry is The butler s face was respectful discretion itself Of course miss And shall I bring tea and coffee Oh no said Miss Le Breton hastily and then after reflection Well have it ready but I don t suppose anybody will ask for it Is there a good fire in the library Oh yes miss I thought you would be coming down there again Shall I take some of these flowers down The room looks rather bare if anybody s coming in Julie colored a little Well you might not many And Hutton you re sure we can t disturb Lady Henry Hutton s expression was not wholly confident Her ladyship s very quick of hearing miss But I ll shut those doors at the foot of the back stairs and I ll ask every one to come in quietly Thank you Hutton thank you That ll be very good of you And Hutton Yes miss The man paused with a large vase of white arums in his hand You ll say a word to Dixon won t you If anybody comes in there ll be no need to trouble Lady Henry about it I can tell her to morrow Very good miss Dixon will be down to her supper presently The butler departed Julie was left alone in the now darkened room lighted only by one lamp and the bright glow of the fire She caught her breath suddenly struck with the audacity of what she had been doing Eight or ten of these people certainly would come in eight or ten of Lady Henry s intimates If Lady Henry discovered it after this precarious truce between them had just been patched up Julie made a step towards the door as though to recall the butler then stopped herself The thought that in an hour s time Harry Warkworth might be within a few yards of her and she not permitted to see him worked intolerably in heart and brain dulling the shrewd intelligence by which she was ordinarily governed She was conscious indeed of some profound inner change Life had been difficult enough before the Duchess had said those few words to her But since Suppose he had deceived her at Lady Hubert s party Through all her mounting passion her acute sense of character did not fail her She secretly knew that it was quite possible he had deceived her But the knowledge merely added to the sense of danger which in this case was one of the elements of passion itself He must have money of course he must have money she was saying feverishly to herself But I ll find ways Why should he marry yet for years It would be only hampering him Again she paused before the mirrored wall and again imagination evoked upon the glass the same white and threatening image her own near kinswoman the child of her mother s sister How strange Where was the little gossamer creature now in what safe haven of money and family affection and all the spoiling that money brings From the climbing paths of her own difficult and personal struggle Julie Le Breton looked down with sore contempt on such a degenerate ease of circumstance She had heard it said that the mother and daughter were lingering abroad for a time on their way home from India Yet was the girl all the while pining for England thinking not of her garden her horse her pets but only of this slim young soldier who in a few minutes perhaps would knock at Lady Henry s door in quest of Aileen Moffatt s unknown unguessed of cousin These thoughts sent wild combative thrills through Julie s pulses She turned to one of the old French clocks How much longer now till he came Her ladyship would like to see you miss The voice was Dixon s and Julie turned hurriedly recalling all her self possession She climbed some steep stairs still unmodernized to Lady Henry s floor That lady slept at the back of the house so as to be out of noise Her room was an old fashioned apartment furnished about the year Queen Victoria came to the throne with furniture chintzes and carpet of the most approved early Victorian pattern What had been ugly then was dingy now and its strong mistress who had known so well how to assimilate and guard the fine decorations and noble pictures of the drawing rooms would not have a thing in it touched It suits me she would say impatiently when her stout sister in law pleaded placidly for white paint and bright colors If it s ugly so am I Fierce certainly and forbidding she was on this February evening She lay high on her pillow tormented by her chronic bronchitis and by rheumatic pain her brows drawn together her vigorous hands clasped before her in an evident tension as though she only restrained herself with difficulty from defying maid doctor and her own sense of prudence Well you have dressed she said sharply as Julie Le Breton entered her room I did not get your message till I had finished dinner And I dressed before dinner Lady Henry looked her up and down like a cat ready to pounce You didn t bring me those letters to sign No I thought you were not fit for it I said they were to go to night Kindly bring them at once Julie brought them With groans and flinchings that she could not repress Lady Henry read and signed them Then she demanded to be read to Julie sat down trembling How fast the hands of Lady Henry s clock were moving on Mercifully Lady Henry was already somewhat sleepy partly from weakness partly from a dose of bromide I hear nothing she said putting out an impatient hand You should raise your voice I didn t mean you to shout of course Thank you that ll do Good night Tell Hutton to keep the house as quiet as he can People must knock and ring I suppose but if all the doors are properly shut it oughtn t to bother me Are you going to bed I shall sit up a little to write some letters But I sha n t be late Why should you be late said Lady Henry tartly as she turned away Julie made her way down stairs with a beating heart All the doors were carefully shut behind her When she reached the hall it was already half past ten o clock She hurried to the library the large panelled room behind the dining room How bright Hutton had made it look Up shot her spirits With a gay and dancing step she went from chair to chair arranging everything instinctively as she was accustomed to do in the drawing room She made the flowers less stiff she put on another light she drew one table forward and pushed its fellow back against the wall What a charming old room after all What a pity Lady Henry so seldom used it It was panelled in dark oak while the drawing room was white But the pictures of which there were two or three looked even better here than up stairs That beautiful Lawrence a red boy in gleaming satin that pair of Hoppners fine studies in blue why who had ever seen them before And another light or two would show them still better A loud knock and ring Julie held her breath Ah A distant voice in the hall She moved to the fire and stood quietly reading an evening paper Captain Warkworth would be glad if you would see him for a few minutes miss He would like to ask you himself about her ladyship Please ask him to come in Hutton Hutton effaced himself and the young man entered Then Julie raised her voice Remember please Hutton that I particularly want to see the Duchess Hutton bowed and retired Warkworth came forward What luck to find you like this He threw her one look Julie knew it to be a look of scrutiny and then as she held out her hand he stooped and kissed it He wants to know that my suspicions are gone she thought At any rate he should believe it The great thing she said with her finger to her lip is that Lady Henry should hear nothing She motioned her somewhat puzzled guest to a seat on one side of the fire and herself fell into another opposite A wild vivacity was in her face and manner Isn t this amusing Isn t the room charming I think I should receive very well she looked round her in my own house You would receive well in a garret a stable he said But what is the meaning of this Explain Lady Henry is ill and is gone to bed That made her very cross poor Lady Henry She thinks I too am in bed But you see you forced your way in didn t you to inquire with greater minuteness after Lady Henry s health She bent towards him her eyes dancing Of course I did Will there presently be a swarm on my heels all possessed with a similar eagerness or He drew his chair smiling a little closer to her She on the contrary withdrew hers There will no doubt be six or seven she said demurely who will want personal news But now before they come her tone changed is there anything to tell me Plenty he said drawing a letter out of his pocket Your writ my dear lady runs as easily in the City as elsewhere And he held up an envelope She flushed You have got your allotment But I knew you would Lady Froswick promised And a large allotment too he said joyously I am the envy of all my friends Some of them have got a few shares and have already sold them grumbling I keep mine three days more on the best advice the price may go higher yet But anyway there he shook the envelope there it is deliverance from debt peace of mind for the first time since I was a lad at school the power of going properly fitted out and equipped to Africa if I go and not like a beggar all in that bit of paper and all the work of some one you and I know Fairy godmother tell me please how to say a proper thank you The young soldier dropped his voice Those blue eyes which had done him excellent service in many different parts of the globe were fixed with brilliance on his companion the lines of a full lipped mouth quivered with what seemed a boyish pleasure The comfort of money relief was never acknowledged more frankly or more handsomely Julie hurriedly repressed him Did she feel instinctively that there are thanks which it sometimes humiliates a man to remember lavishly as he may have poured them out at the moment thanks which may easily count in the long run not for but against the donor She rather haughtily asked what she had done but say a chance word to Lady Froswick The shares had to be allotted to somebody She was glad of course very glad if he were relieved from anxiety So did she free herself and him from a burdensome gratitude and they passed to discussing the latest chances of the Mokembe appointment The Staff College Colonel was no doubt formidable the Commander in Chief who had hitherto allowed himself to be much talked to on the subject of young Warkworth s claims by several men in high place General M Gill among them well known in Lady Henry s drawing room was perhaps inclining to the new suggestion which was strongly supported by important people in Egypt he had one or two recent appointments on his conscience not quite of the highest order and the Staff College man in addition to a fine military record was virtue poverty and industry embodied was nobody s cousin and would altogether produce a good effect Could anything more be done and fresh threads set in motion They bandied names a little Julie quite as subtly and minutely informed as the man with regard to all the sources of patronage New devices fresh modes of approach revealed themselves to the woman s quick brain Yet she did not chatter about them still less parade her own resources Only in talking with her dead walls seemed to give way vistas of hope and possibility opened in the very heart of discouragement She found the right word the right jest the right spur to invention or effort while all the time she was caressing and appeasing her companion s self love placing it like a hot house plant in an atmosphere of expansion and content with that art of hers which for the ambitious and irritable man more conscious of the kicks than of the kisses of fortune made conversation with her an active and delightful pleasure I don t know how it is Warkworth presently declared but after I have been talking to you for ten minutes the whole world seems changed The sky was ink and you have turned it rosy But suppose it is all mirage and you the enchanter He smiled at her consciously superabundantly It was not easy to keep quite cool with Julie Le Breton the self satisfaction she could excite in the man she wished to please recoiled upon the woman offering the incense The flattered one was apt to be foolishly responsive That is my risk she said with a little shrug If I make you confident and nothing comes of it I hope I shall know how to behave myself cried Warkworth You see you hardly understand forgive me your own personal effect When people are face to face with you they want to please you to say what will please you and then they go away and Resolve not to be made fools of she said smiling But isn t that the whole art when you re guessing what will happen to be able to strike the balance of half a dozen different attractions Montresor as the ocean said Warkworth musing with half a dozen different forces tugging at him Well dear lady be the moon to these tides while this humble mortal looks on and hopes He bent forward and across the glowing fire their eyes met She looked so cool so handsome so little yielding at that moment that in addition to gratitude and nattered vanity Warkworth was suddenly conscious of a new stir in the blood It begat however instant recoil Wariness let that be the word both for her sake and his own What had he to reproach himself with so far Nothing He had never offered himself as the lover as the possible husband They were both esprits faits they understood each other As for little Aileen well whatever had happened or might happen that was not his secret to give away And a woman in Julie Le Breton s position and with her intelligence knows very well what the difficulties of her case are Poor Julie If she had been Lady Henry what a career she would have made for herself He was very curious as to her birth and antecedents of which he knew little or nothing with him she had always avoided the subject She was the child he understood of English parents who had lived abroad Lady Henry had come across her by chance But there must be something in her past to account for this distinction this ease with which she held her own in what passes as the best of English society Julie soon found herself unwilling to meet the gaze fixed upon her She flushed a little and began to talk of other things Everybody surely is unusually late It will be annoying indeed if the Duchess doesn t come The Duchess is a delicious creature but not for me said Warkworth with a laugh She dislikes me Ah now then for the fray For the outer bell rang loudly and there were steps in the hall Oh Julie in swept a white whirlwind with the smallest white satin shoes twinkling in front of it how clever of you you naughty angel Aunt Flora in bed and you down here And I who came prepared for such a dose of humble pie What a relief Oh how do you do The last words were spoken in quite another tone as the Duchess for the first time perceiving the young officer on the more shaded side of the fireplace extended to him a very high wrist and a very stiff hand Then she turned again to Julie My dear there s a small mob in the hall mister Montresor and General Somebody and Jacob and doctor Meredith with a Frenchman Oh and old Lord Lackington and Heaven knows who Hutton told me I might come in so I promised to come first and reconnoitre But what s Hutton to do You really must take a line The carriages are driving up at a fine rate I ll go and speak to Hutton said Julie And she hurried into the hall IX 
7467-69610-0000	train-other-500	When Miss Le Breton reached the hall a footman was at the outer door reciting Lady Henry s excuses as each fresh carriage drove up while in the inner vestibule which was well screened from the view of the street
7467-69610-0001	train-other-500	was a group of men still in their hats and over coats talking and laughing in subdued voices Julie Le Breton came forward The hats were removed and the tall stooping form of Montresor advanced
none	none	 Lady Henry is so sorry 
7467-69610-0002	train-other-500	said Julie in a soft lowered voice But I am sure she would like me to give you her message and to tell you how she is She would not like her old friends to be alarmed Would you come in for a moment There is a fire in the library
7467-69610-0003	train-other-500	mister Delafield don t you think that would be best Will you tell Hutton not to let in anybody else She looked at him uncertainly as though appealing to him as a relation of Lady Henry s to take the lead By all means
7467-69610-0004	train-other-500	said that young man after perhaps a moment s hesitation and throwing off his coat Only please make no noise said Miss Le Breton turning to the group Lady Henry might be disturbed
7467-69610-0005	train-other-500	Every one came in as it were on tiptoe In each face a sense of the humor of the situation fought with the consciousness of its dangers As soon as Montresor saw the little Duchess by the fire
7467-69610-0006	train-other-500	he threw up his hands in relief I breathe again he said greeting her with effusion Duchess where thou goest I may go But I feel like a boy robbing a hen roost Let me introduce my friend General Fergus
none	none	 Take us both pray under your protection 
7467-69610-0007	train-other-500	On the contrary said the Duchess as she returned General Fergus s bow
none	none	 you are both so magnificent that no one would dare to protect you 
7467-69610-0008	train-other-500	For they were both in uniform and the General was resplendent with stars and medals
none	none	 We have been dining with royalty 
7467-69610-0009	train-other-500	said Montresor We want some relaxation He put on his eye glasses looked round the room and gently rubbed his hands How very agreeable this is What a charming room
none	none	 I never saw it before What are we doing here 
7467-69610-0010	train-other-500	Is it a party Why shouldn t it be Meredith
none	none	 have you introduced M du Bartas to the Duchess 
7467-69610-0011	train-other-500	Ah I see For Julie Le Breton was already conversing with the distinguished Frenchman
none	none	 wearing the rosette of the Legion of Honor in his button hole who had followed doctor Meredith into the room As Montresor spoke however 
7467-69610-0012	train-other-500	she came forward and in a French which was a joy to the ear
none	none	 she presented M du Bartas a tall well built Norman with a fair mustache first to the Duchess and then to Lord Lackington 
7467-69610-0013	train-other-500	and Jacob The director of the French Foreign Office said Montresor in an aside to the Duchess
none	none	 He hates us like poison But if you haven t already asked him to dinner I warned you last week he was coming pray do it at once 
7467-69610-0014	train-other-500	Meanwhile the Frenchman his introductions over looked curiously round the room studied its stately emptiness the books on the walls under a trellis work faintly gilt the three fine pictures
none	none	 then his eyes passed to the tall and slender lady who had addressed him in such perfect French and to the little Duchess in her flutter of lace and satin the turn of her small neck and the blaze of her jewels 
7467-69610-0015	train-other-500	These Englishwomen overdo their jewels he thought with distaste But they overdo everything That is a handsome fellow by the way who was with la petite fee when we arrived
7467-69610-0016	train-other-500	And his shrewd small eyes travelled from Warkworth to the Duchess his mind the while instinctively assuming some hidden relation between them
none	none	 Meanwhile Montresor was elaborately informing himself as to Lady Henry 
7467-69610-0017	train-other-500	This is the first time for twenty years that I have not found her on a Wednesday evening he said with a sudden touch of feeling which became him At our age the smallest break in the old habit He sighed
7467-69610-0018	train-other-500	and then quickly threw off his depression Nonsense Next week she will be scolding us all with double energy Meanwhile may we sit down mademoiselle Ten minutes
7467-69610-0019	train-other-500	And upon my word the very thing my soul was longing for a cup of coffee
none	none	 For at the moment Hutton and two footmen 
7467-69610-0020	train-other-500	entered with trays containing tea and coffee lemonade and cakes Shut the door Hutton please Mademoiselle Le Breton implored and the door was shut at once We mustn t mustn t
7467-69610-0021	train-other-500	make any noise she said her finger on her lip looking first at Montresor and then at Delafield
none	none	 The group laughed moved their spoons softly 
7467-69610-0022	train-other-500	and once more lowered their voices But the coffee brought a spirit of festivity Chairs were drawn up The blazing fire shone out upon a semicircle of people representing just those elements of mingled intimacy and novelty
7467-69610-0023	train-other-500	which go to make conversation And in five minutes Mademoiselle Le Breton was leading it as usual A brilliant French book had recently appeared dealing with certain points of the Egyptian question in a manner so interesting
7467-69610-0024	train-other-500	supple and apparently impartial that the attention of Europe had been won Its author had been formerly a prominent official of the French Foreign Office and was now somewhat out of favor with his countrymen
none	none	 Julie put some questions about him to M du Bartas 
7467-69610-0025	train-other-500	The Frenchman feeling himself among comrades worthy of his steel
none	none	 and secretly pricked by the presence of an English cabinet minister 
7467-69610-0026	train-other-500	relinquished the half disdainful reserve with which he had entered and took pains He drew the man in question en silhouette with a hostile touch so sure an irony so light that his success was instant and great
7467-69610-0027	train-other-500	Lord Lackington woke up Handsome white haired dreamer that he was he had been looking into the fire half smiling more occupied in truth with his own thoughts than with his companions Delafield had brought him in
none	none	 he did not exactly know why he was there 
7467-69610-0028	train-other-500	except that he liked Mademoiselle Le Breton and often wondered how the deuce Lady Henry had ever discovered such an interesting and delightful person to fill such an uncomfortable position But this Frenchman challenged and excited him
7467-69610-0029	train-other-500	He too began to talk French and soon
none	none	 the whole room was talking it with an advantage to Julie Le Breton 
7467-69610-0030	train-other-500	which quickly made itself apparent In English she was a link a social conjunction she eased all difficulties she pieced all threads But in French her tongue was loosened
7467-69610-0031	train-other-500	though never beyond the point of grace the point of delicate adjustment to the talkers round her So that presently and by insensible gradations she was the queen of the room The Duchess in ecstasy pinched Jacob Delafield s wrist
none	none	 and forgetting all that she ought to have remembered 
7467-69610-0032	train-other-500	whispered rapturously in his ear Isn t she enchanting Julie to night That gentleman made no answer The Duchess remembering shrank back and spoke no more
7467-69610-0033	train-other-500	till Jacob looked round upon her with a friendly smile which set her tongue free again
none	none	 M du Bartas 
7467-69610-0034	train-other-500	meanwhile began to consider this lady in black with more and more attention The talk glided into a general discussion of the Egyptian position
none	none	 Those were the days before Arabi 
7467-69610-0035	train-other-500	when elements of danger and of doubt abounded and none knew what a month might bring forth With perfect tact Julie guided the conversation so that all difficulties whether for the French official or the English statesman
7467-69610-0036	train-other-500	were avoided with a skill that no one realized till each separate rock was safely passed Presently
none	none	 Montresor looked from her 
7467-69610-0037	train-other-500	to Du Bartas with a grin The Frenchman s eyes were round with astonishment
none	none	 Julie had been saying the lightest but the wisest things 
7467-69610-0038	train-other-500	she had been touching incidents and personalities known only to the initiated with a restrained gayety which often broke down into a charming shyness which was ready to be scared away in a moment by a tone too serious or too polemical
7467-69610-0039	train-other-500	which jarred with the general key of the conversation which never imposed itself
none	none	 and was like the ripple on a summer sea But the summer sea has its depths 
7467-69610-0040	train-other-500	and this modest gayety was the mark of an intimate and first hand knowledge Ah I see thought Montresor amused P has been writing to her the little minx
none	none	 He seems to have been telling her all the secrets I think I ll stop it Even she mayn t quite understand what should and shouldn t be said before this gentleman 
7467-69610-0041	train-other-500	So he gave the conversation a turn and Mademoiselle Le Breton took the hint at once
none	none	 She called others to the front it was like a change of dancers in the ballet 
7467-69610-0042	train-other-500	while she rested no less charming as a listener than as a talker
none	none	 her black eyes turning from one to another 
7467-69610-0043	train-other-500	and radiant with the animation of success But one thing at last she had forgotten She had forgotten to impose any curb upon the voices round her The Duchess and Lord Lackington were sparring like a couple of children
7467-69610-0044	train-other-500	and Montresor broke in from time to time
none	none	 with his loud laugh and gruff throat voice 
7467-69610-0045	train-other-500	Meredith the Frenchman Warkworth and General Fergus were discussing a grand review which had been held the day before Delafield had moved round to the back of Julie s chair and she was talking to him
none	none	 while all the time her eyes were on General Fergus 
7467-69610-0046	train-other-500	and her brain was puzzling as to how she was to secure the five minutes talk
none	none	 with him she wanted 
7467-69610-0047	train-other-500	He was one of the intimates of the Commander in Chief She herself had suggested to Montresor of course in Lady Henry s name that he should be brought to Bruton Street some Wednesday evening Presently
7467-69610-0048	train-other-500	there was a little shifting of groups Julie saw that Montresor and Captain Warkworth were together by the fireplace
none	none	 that the young man with his hands held out to the blaze and his back to her was talking eagerly while Montresor looking outward into the room his great black head bent a little towards his companion 
7467-69610-0049	train-other-500	was putting sharp little questions from time to time with as few words as might be Julie understood that an important conversation was going on that Montresor
none	none	 whose mind various friends of hers 
7467-69610-0050	train-other-500	had been endeavoring to make up for him was now perhaps engaged in making it up for himself With a quickened pulse she turned to find General Fergus beside her What a frank and soldierly countenance a little roughly cut
7467-69610-0051	train-other-500	with a strong mouth slightly underhung and a dogged chin the whole lit by eyes that were the chosen homes of truth humanity and will Presently she discovered as they drew their chairs a little back from the circle that she too
7467-69610-0052	train-other-500	was to be encouraged to talk about Warkworth The General was of course intimately acquainted with his professional record but there were certain additional Indian opinions a few incidents in the young man s earlier career
7467-69610-0053	train-other-500	including especially a shooting expedition of much daring in the very district
none	none	 to which the important Mokembe mission 
7467-69610-0054	train-other-500	was now to be addressed together with some quotations from private letters of her own or Lady Henry s which Julie with her usual skill was able to slip into his ear all on the assumption delicately maintained
none	none	 that she was merely talking of a friend of Lady Henry s 
7467-69610-0055	train-other-500	as Lady Henry herself would have talked to much better effect had she been present The General gave her a grave and friendly attention Few men had done sterner or more daring feats in the field Yet here he sat
7467-69610-0056	train-other-500	relaxed courteous kind trusting his companions simply as it was his instinct to trust all women Julie s heart beat fast What an exciting what an important evening
7467-69610-0057	train-other-500	Suddenly there was a voice in her ear Do you know I think we ought to clear out It must be close on midnight She looked up startled to see Jacob Delafield His expression of doubt
7467-69610-0058	train-other-500	or discomfort recalled her at once to the realities of her own situation But before she could reply a sound struck on her ear She sprang to her feet What was that she said A voice was heard in the hall
7467-69610-0059	train-other-500	Julie Le Breton caught the chair behind her and Delafield saw her turn pale But before she or he could speak again the door of the library was thrown open Good Heavens said Montresor springing to his feet
none	none	 Lady Henry M du Bartas 
7467-69610-0060	train-other-500	lifted astonished eyes On the threshold of the room stood an old lady leaning heavily on two sticks She was deathly pale and her fierce eyes blazed upon the scene before her
none	none	 Within the bright fire lit room 
7467-69610-0061	train-other-500	the social comedy was being played at its best but here surely was Tragedy or Fate Who was she What did it mean The Duchess rushed to her and fell of course upon the one thing she should not have said
7467-69610-0062	train-other-500	Oh Aunt Flora dear Aunt Flora But we thought you were too ill to come down So I perceive said Lady Henry putting her aside
7467-69610-0063	train-other-500	So you and this lady she pointed a shaking finger at Julie have held my reception for me I am enormously obliged You have also
none	none	 she looked at the coffee cups 
7467-69610-0064	train-other-500	provided my guests with refreshment I thank you I trust my servants have given you satisfaction Gentlemen she turned to the rest of the company who stood stupefied
7467-69610-0065	train-other-500	I fear I cannot ask you to remain with me longer The hour is late and I am as you see indisposed But I trust on some future occasion I may have the honor
none	none	 She looked round upon them challenging and defying them all 
7467-69610-0066	train-other-500	Montresor went up to her My dear old friend let me introduce to you
none	none	 M du Bartas of the French Foreign Office At this appeal to her English hospitality 
7467-69610-0067	train-other-500	and her social chivalry Lady Henry looked grimly at the Frenchman
none	none	 M du Bartas 
7467-69610-0068	train-other-500	I am charmed to make your acquaintance With your leave I will pursue it when I am better able to profit by it To morrow I will write to you to propose another meeting should my health allow
none	none	 Enchante madame murmured the Frenchman more embarrassed than he had ever been in his life Permettez moi de vous faire mes plus sinceres excuses Not at all monsieur you owe me none 
7467-69610-0069	train-other-500	Montresor again approached her Let me tell you he said imploringly
none	none	 how this has happened how innocent we all are 
7467-69610-0070	train-other-500	Another time if you please she said with a most cutting calm As I said before it is late If I had been equal to entertaining you she looked round upon them all
7467-69610-0071	train-other-500	I should not have told my butler to make my excuses As it is I must beg you to allow me to bid you good night Jacob will you kindly get the Duchess her cloak Good night Good night
7467-69610-0072	train-other-500	As you see she pointed to the sticks which supported her I have no hands to night My infirmities have need of them Montresor approached her again
none	none	 in real and deep distress 
7467-69610-0073	train-other-500	Dear Lady Henry Go she said under her breath looking him in the eyes and he turned and went without a word So did the Duchess whimpering her hand in Delafield s arm As she passed Julie who stood
none	none	 as though turned to stone 
7467-69610-0074	train-other-500	she made a little swaying movement towards her Dear Julie she cried imploringly But Lady Henry turned You will have every opportunity to morrow she said As far as I am concerned
7467-69610-0075	train-other-500	Miss Le Breton will have no engagements Lord Lackington quietly said Good night Lady Henry and without offering to shake hands walked past her As he came to the spot where Julie Le Breton stood
7467-69610-0076	train-other-500	that lady made a sudden impetuous movement towards him Strange words were on her lips a strange expression in her eyes You must help me she said brokenly It is my right
7467-69610-0077	train-other-500	Was that what she said Lord Lackington looked at her in astonishment He did not see that Lady Henry was watching them with eagerness leaning heavily on her sticks her lips parted in a keen expectancy
7467-69610-0078	train-other-500	Then Julie withdrew I beg your pardon she said hurriedly I beg your pardon Good night Lord Lackington hesitated His face took a puzzled expression Then he held out his hand
7467-69610-0079	train-other-500	and she placed hers in it mechanically It will be all right he whispered kindly Lady Henry will soon be herself again Shall I tell the butler to call for some one her maid Julie shook her head
7467-69610-0080	train-other-500	and in another moment he too was gone doctor Meredith and General Fergus stood beside her The General had a keen sense of humor and as he said good night to this unlawful hostess whose plight he understood no more than his own
7467-69610-0081	train-other-500	his mouth twitched with repressed laughter But doctor Meredith did not laugh
none	none	 He pressed Julie s hand in both of his 
7467-69610-0082	train-other-500	Looking behind him he saw that Jacob Delafield who had just returned from the hall was endeavoring to appease Lady Henry He bent towards Julie Don t deceive yourself he said quickly in a low voice this is the end
7467-69610-0083	train-other-500	Remember my letter Let me hear to morrow As doctor Meredith left the room Julie lifted her eyes Only Jacob Delafield and Lady Henry were left Harry Warkworth too was gone without a word
7467-69610-0084	train-other-500	She looked round her piteously She could not remember that he had spoken that he had bade her farewell A strange pang convulsed her
none	none	 She scarcely heard what Lady Henry was saying to Jacob Delafield 
7467-69610-0085	train-other-500	Yet the words were emphatic enough Much obliged to you Jacob
none	none	 But when I want your advice in my household affairs I will ask it 
7467-69610-0086	train-other-500	You and Evelyn Crowborough have meddled a good deal too much in them already Good night
none	none	 Hutton will get you a cab And with a slight but imperious gesture 
7467-69610-0087	train-other-500	Lady Henry motioned towards the door Jacob hesitated then quietly took his departure He threw Julie a look of anxious appeal as he went out But she did not see it
7467-69610-0088	train-other-500	her troubled gaze was fixed on Lady Henry That lady eyed her companion with composure though by now even the old lips were wholly blanched
7467-69610-0089	train-other-500	There is really no need for any conversation between us Miss Le Breton said the familiar voice But if there were
none	none	 I am not to night as you see 
7467-69610-0090	train-other-500	in a condition to say it So when you came up to say good night to me you had determined on this adventure You had been good enough I see to rearrange my room
7467-69610-0091	train-other-500	to give my servants your orders Julie stood stonily erect
none	none	 She made her dry lips answer as best they could 
7467-69610-0092	train-other-500	We meant no harm she said coldly It all came about very simply A few people came in to inquire after you I regret they should have stayed talking so long
7467-69610-0093	train-other-500	Lady Henry smiled in contempt You hardly show your usual ability by these remarks The room you stand in she glanced significantly at the lights and the chairs gives you the lie
none	none	 You had planned it all with Hutton who has become your tool before you came to me 
7467-69610-0094	train-other-500	Don t contradict It distresses me to hear you Well now we part Of course
none	none	 Perhaps to morrow you will allow me a few last words 
7467-69610-0095	train-other-500	I think not This will cost me dear said Lady Henry her white lips twitching Say them now mademoiselle You are suffering Julie made an uncertain step forward You ought to be in bed
7467-69610-0096	train-other-500	That has nothing to do with it
none	none	 What was your object to night 
7467-69610-0097	train-other-500	I wished to see the Duchess It is not worth while to prevaricate The Duchess was not your first visitor Julie flushed Captain Warkworth arrived first that was a mere chance
7467-69610-0098	train-other-500	It was to see him that you risked the whole affair You have used my house for your own intrigues Julie felt herself physically wavering under the lash of these sentences But with a great effort
7467-69610-0099	train-other-500	she walked towards the fireplace recovered her gloves and handkerchief which were on the mantel piece and then turned slowly to Lady Henry I have done nothing in your service that I am ashamed of On the contrary
7467-69610-0100	train-other-500	I have borne what no one else would have borne I have devoted myself to you and your interests and you have trampled upon and tortured me
none	none	 For you I have been merely a servant 
7467-69610-0101	train-other-500	and an inferior Lady Henry nodded grimly It is true she said interrupting I was not able to take your romantic view of the office of companion You need only have taken a human view
7467-69610-0102	train-other-500	said Julie in a voice that pierced I was alone poor worse than motherless You might have done what you would with me A little indulgence and I should have been your devoted slave But you chose to humiliate and crush me
7467-69610-0103	train-other-500	and in return to protect myself I in defending myself have been led I admit it into taking liberties There is no way out of it I shall of course leave you to morrow morning
none	none	 Then at last we understand each other 
7467-69610-0104	train-other-500	said Lady Henry with a laugh
none	none	 Good night Miss Le Breton 
7467-69610-0105	train-other-500	She moved heavily on her sticks Julie stood aside to let her pass One of the sticks slipped a little on the polished floor Julie with a cry ran forward but Lady Henry fiercely motioned her aside
7467-69610-0106	train-other-500	Don t touch me Don t come near me She paused
none	none	 a moment to recover breath and balance 
7467-69610-0107	train-other-500	Then she resumed her difficult walk Julie followed her Kindly put out the electric lights said Lady Henry and Julie obeyed They entered the hall in which one little light was burning
7467-69610-0108	train-other-500	Lady Henry with great difficulty and panting began to pull herself up the stairs Oh do let me help you
none	none	 said Julie in an agony 
7467-69610-0109	train-other-500	You will kill yourself Let me at least call Dixon You will do nothing of the kind said Lady Henry indomitable
none	none	 though tortured by weakness and rheumatism Dixon is in my room where I bade her remain 
7467-69610-0110	train-other-500	You should have thought of the consequences of this before you embarked upon it If I were to die in mounting these stairs I would not let you help me Oh cried Julie as though she had been struck and hid her eyes with her hand
7467-69610-0111	train-other-500	Slowly laboriously Lady Henry dragged herself from step to step
none	none	 As she turned the corner of the staircase and could therefore be no longer seen from below 
7467-69610-0112	train-other-500	some one softly opened the door of the dining room and entered the hall Julie looked round her startled She saw Jacob Delafield who put his finger to his lip Moved by a sudden impulse she bowed her head
7467-69610-0113	train-other-500	on the banister of the stairs against which she was leaning and broke into stifled sobs
none	none	 Jacob Delafield came up to her and took her hand 
7467-69610-0114	train-other-500	She felt his own tremble and yet its grasp was firm and supporting Courage he said bending over her Try not to give way You will want all your fortitude Listen
none	none	 She gasped trying vainly to control herself and they both listened to the sounds above them in the dark house 
7467-69610-0115	train-other-500	the labored breath the slow painful step Oh she wouldn t let me help her She said she would rather die Perhaps I have killed her And I could I could yes I could have loved her
none	none	 She was in an anguish of feeling of sharp and penetrating remorse 
7467-69610-0116	train-other-500	Jacob Delafield held her hand close in his and when at last the sounds had died in the distance he lifted it to his lips You know that I am your friend and servant he said in a queer muffled voice You promised I should be
7467-69610-0117	train-other-500	She tried to withdraw her hand but only feebly
none	none	 Neither physically nor mentally had she the strength to repulse him If he had taken her in his arms 
7467-69610-0118	train-other-500	she could hardly have resisted But he did not attempt to conquer more than her hand He stood beside her letting her feel the whole mute impetuous offer of his manhood thrown at her feet to do what she would with Presently
none	none	 when once more she moved away he said to her in a whisper 
7467-69610-0119	train-other-500	Go to the Duchess to morrow morning as soon as you can get away She told me to say that Hutton gave me a little note from her
none	none	 Your home must be with her till we can all settle what is best You know very well you have devoted friends 
7467-69610-0120	train-other-500	But now good night Try to sleep Evelyn and I will do all we can with Lady Henry Julie drew herself out of his hold
7467-69610-0121	train-other-500	Tell Evelyn I will come to see her at any rate as soon as I can put my things together Good night And she too dragged herself up stairs sobbing
none	none	 starting at every shadow All her nerve and daring were gone The thought that she must spend yet another night under the roof of this old woman who hated her filled her with terror When she reached her room she locked her door and wept for hours in a forlorn and aching misery X The Duchess was in her morning room On the rug in marked and as it seemed to her plaintive eyes brutal contrast with the endless photographs of her babies and women friends which crowded her mantel piece stood the Duke much out of temper He was a powerfully built man some twenty years older than his wife with a dark complexion enlivened by ruddy cheeks and prominent red lips His eyes were of a cold clear gray his hair very black thick and wiry An extremely vigorous person more than adequately aware of his own importance tanned and seasoned by the life of his class by the yachting hunting and shooting in which his own existence was largely spent slow in perception and of a sulky temper so one might have read him at first sight But these impressions only took you a certain way in judging the character of the Duchess s husband As to the sulkiness there could be no question on this particular morning though indeed his ill humor deserved a more positive and energetic name You have got yourself and me he was declaring into a most disagreeable and unnecessary scrape This letter of Lady Henry s he held it up is one of the most annoying that I have received for many a day Lady Henry seems to me perfectly justified You have been behaving in a quite unwarrantable way And now you tell me that this woman who is the cause of it all of whose conduct I thoroughly and entirely disapprove is coming to stay here in my house whether I like it or not and you expect me to be civil to her If you persist I shall go down to Brackmoor till she is pleased to depart I won t countenance the thing at all and whatever you may do I shall apologize to Lady Henry There s nothing to apologize for cried the drooping Duchess plucking up a little spirit Nobody meant any harm Why shouldn t the old friends go in to ask after her Hutton that old butler that has been with Aunt Flora for twenty years asked us to come in Then he did what he had no business to do and he deserves to be dismissed at a day s notice Why Lady Henry tells me that it was a regular party that the room was all arranged for it by that most audacious young woman that the servants were ordered about that it lasted till nearly midnight and that the noise you all made positively woke Lady Henry out of her sleep Really Evelyn that you should have been mixed up in such an affair is more unpalatable to me than I can find words to describe And he paced fuming up and down before her Anybody else than Aunt Flora would have laughed said the Duchess defiantly And I declare Freddie I won t be scolded in such a tone Besides if you only knew She threw back her head and looked at him her cheeks flushed her lips quivering with a secret that once out would perhaps silence him at once would at any rate as children do when they give a shake to their spillikins open up a number of new chances in the game If I only knew what The Duchess pulled at the hair of the little spitz on her lap without replying What is there to know that I don t know insisted the Duke Something that makes the matter still worse I suppose Well that depends said the Duchess reflectively A gleam of mischief had slipped into her face though for a moment the tears had not been far off The Duke looked at his watch Don t keep me here guessing riddles longer than you can help he said impatiently I have an appointment in the City at twelve and I want to discuss with you the letter that must be written to Lady Henry That s your affair said the Duchess I haven t made up my mind yet whether I mean to write at all And as for the riddle Freddie you ve seen Miss Le Breton Once I thought her a very pretentious person said the Duke stiffly I know you didn t get on But Freddie didn t she remind you of somebody The Duchess was growing excited Suddenly she jumped up the little spitz rolled off her lap she ran to her husband and took him by the fronts of his coat Freddie you ll be very much astonished And suddenly releasing him she began to search among the photographs on the mantel piece Freddie you know who that is She held up a picture Of course I know What on earth has that got to do with the subject we have been discussing Well it has a good deal to do with it said the Duchess slowly That s my uncle George Chantrey isn t it Lord Lackington s second son who married mamma s sister Well oh you won t like it Freddie but you ve got to know that s Julie s uncle too What in the name of fortune do you mean said the Duke staring at her His wife again caught him by the coat and so imprisoning him she poured out her story very fast very incoherently and with a very evident uncertainty as to what its effect might be And indeed the effect was by no means easy to determine The Duke was first incredulous then bewildered by the very mixed facts which she poured out upon him He tried to cross examine her en route but he gained little by that she only shook him a little insisting the more vehemently on telling the story her own way At last their two impatiences had nearly come to a dead lock But the Duke managed to free himself physically and so regained a little freedom of mind Well upon my word he said as he resumed his march up and down upon my word Then as he stood still before her You say she is Marriott Dalrymple s daughter And Lord Lackington s granddaughter said the Duchess panting a little from her exertions And oh what a blind bat you were not to see it at once from the likeness As if one had any right to infer such a thing from a likeness said the Duke angrily Really Evelyn your talk is most most unbecoming It seems to me that Mademoiselle Le Breton has already done you harm All that you have told me supposing it to be true oh of course I know you believe it to be true only makes me he stiffened his back the more determined to break off the connection between her and you A woman of such antecedents is not a fit companion for my wife independently of the fact that she seems to be in herself an intriguing and dangerous character How could she help her antecedents cried the Duchess I didn t say she could help them But if they are what you say she ought well she ought to be all the more careful to live in a modest and retired way instead of as I understand making herself the rival of Lady Henry I never heard anything so preposterous so so indecent She shows no proper sense and as for you I deeply regret you should have been brought into any contact with such a disgraceful story Freddie The Duchess went into a helpless half hysterical fit of laughter But the Duke merely expanded as it seemed still further to his utmost height and bulk Oh dear thought the Duchess in despair now he is going to be like his mother Her strictly Evangelical mother in law with whom the Duke had made his bachelor home for many years had been the scourge of her early married life and though for Freddie s sake she had shed a few tears over her death eighteen months before this date the tears as indeed the Duke had thought at the time had been only too quickly dried There could be no question about it the Duke was painfully like his mother as he replied I fear that your education Evelyn has led you to take such things far more lightly than you ought I am old fashioned Illegitimacy with me does carry a stigma and the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children At any rate we who occupy a prominent social place have no right to do anything which may lead others to think lightly of God s law I am sorry to speak plainly Evelyn I dare say you don t like these sentiments but you know at least that I am quite honest in expressing them The Duke turned to her not without dignity He was and had been from his boyhood a person of irreproachable morals earnest and religious according to his lights a good son husband and father His wife looked at him with mingled feelings Well all I know is she said passionately beating her little foot on the carpet before her that by all accounts the only thing to do with Colonel Delaney was to run away from him The Duke shrugged his shoulders You don t expect me to be much moved by a remark of that kind As to this lady your story does not affect me in her favor in the smallest degree She has had her education Lord Lackington gives her one hundred pounds a year if she is a self respecting woman she will look after herself I don t want to have her here and I beg you won t invite her A couple of nights perhaps I don t mind that but not for longer Oh as to that you may be very sure she won t stay here unless you re very particularly nice to her There ll be plenty of people glad enchanted to have her I don t care about that but what I do want is the Duchess looked up with calm audacity that you should find her a house The Duke paused in his walk and surveyed his wife with amazement Evelyn are you quite mad Not in the least You have more houses than you know what to do with and a great deal more money than anybody in the world ought to have If they ever do set up the guillotine at Hyde Park Corner we shall be among the first we ought to be What is the good of talking nonsense like this Evelyn said the Duke once more consulting his watch Let s go back to the subject of my letter to Lady Henry It s most excellent sense cried the Duchess springing up You have more houses than you know what to do with and you have one house in particular that little place at the back of Cureton Street where Cousin Mary Leicester lived so long which is in your hands still I know for you told me so last week which is vacant and furnished Cousin Mary left you the furniture as if we hadn t got enough and it would be the very thing for Julie if only you d lend it to her till she can turn round The Duchess was now standing up confronting her lord her hands grasping the chair behind her her small form alive with eagerness and the feminine determination to get her own way by fair means or foul Cureton Street said the Duke almost at the end of his tether And how do you propose that this young woman is to live in Cureton Street or anywhere else She means to write said the Duchess shortly doctor Meredith has promised her work Sheer lunacy In six months time you d have to step in and pay all her bills I should like to see anybody dare to propose to Julie to pay her bills cried the Duchess with scorn You see the great pity is Freddie that you don t know anything at all about her But that house wasn t it made out of a stable It has got six rooms I know three bedrooms up stairs and two sitting rooms and a kitchen below With one good maid and a boy Julie could be perfectly comfortable She would earn four hundred pounds doctor Meredith has promised her she has one hundred pounds a year of her own She would pay no rent of course She would have just enough to live on poor dear thing And she would be able to gather her old friends round her when she wanted them A cup of tea and her delightful conversation that s all they d ever want Oh go on go on said the Duke throwing himself exasperated into an arm chair the ease with which you dispose of my property on behalf of a young woman who has caused me most acute annoyance who has embroiled us with a near relation for whom I have a very particular respect Her friends indeed Lady Henry s friends you mean Poor Lady Henry tells me in this letter that her circle will be completely scattered This mischievous woman in three years has destroyed what it has taken Lady Henry nearly thirty to build up Now look here Evelyn the Duke sat up and slapped his knee as to this Cureton Street plan I will do nothing of the kind You may have Miss Le Breton here for two or three nights if you like I shall probably go down to the country and of course I have no objection to make if you wish to help her find another situation Another situation cried the Duchess beside herself Freddie you really are impossible Do you understand that I regard Julie Le Breton as my relation whatever you may say that I love her dearly that there are fifty people with money and influence ready to help her if you won t because she is one of the most charming and distinguished women in London that you ought to be proud to do her a service that I want you to have the honor of it there And if you won t do this little favor for me when I ask and beg it of you I ll make you remember it for a very long time to come you may be sure of that And his wife turned upon him as an image of war her fair hair ruffling about her ears her cheeks and eyes brilliant with anger and something more The Duke rose in silent ferocity and sought for some letters which he had left on the mantel piece I had better leave you to come to your senses by yourself and as quickly as possible he said as he put them into his pockets No good can come of any more discussion of this sort The Duchess said nothing She looked out of the window busily and bit her lip Her silence served her better than her speech for suddenly the Duke looked round hesitated threw down a book he carried walked up to her and took her in his arms You are a very foolish child he declared as he held her by main force and kissed away her tears You make me lose my temper and waste my time for nothing Not at all said the sobbing Duchess trying to push herself away and denying him as best she could her soft flushed face You don t or you won t understand I was I was very fond of Uncle George Chantrey He would have helped Julie if he were alive And as for you you re Lord Lackington s godson and you re always preaching what he s done for the army and what the nation owes him and and Does he know said the Duke abruptly marvelling at the irrelevance of these remarks No not a word Only six people in London know Aunt Flora Sir Wilfrid Bury the Duke made an exclamation mister Montresor Jacob you and I Jacob said the Duke What s he got to do with it The Duchess suddenly saw her opportunity and rushed upon it Only that he s madly in love with her that s all And to my knowledge she has refused him both last year and this Of course naturally if you won t do anything to help her she ll probably marry him simply as a way out Well of all the extraordinary affairs The Duke released her and stood bewildered The Duchess watched him in some excitement He was about to speak when there was a sound in the anteroom They moved hastily apart The door was thrown open and the footman announced Miss Le Breton Julie Le Breton entered and stood a moment on the threshold looking not in embarrassment but with a certain hesitation at the two persons whose conversation she had disturbed She was pale with sleeplessness her look was sad and weary But never had she been more composed more elegant Her closely fitting black cloth dress her strangely expressive face framed by a large hat very simple but worn as only the woman of fashion knows how her miraculous yet most graceful slenderness the delicacy of her hands the natural dignity of her movements these things produced an immediate though no doubt conflicting impression upon the gentleman who had just been denouncing her He bowed with an involuntary deference which he had not at all meant to show to Lady Henry s insubordinate companion and then stood frowning But the Duchess ran forward and quite heedless of her husband threw herself into her friend s arms Oh Julie is there anything left of you I hardly slept a wink for thinking of you What did that old oh I forgot do you know my husband Freddie this is my great friend Miss Le Breton The Duke bowed again silently Julie looked at him and then still holding the Duchess by the hand she approached him a pair of very fine and pleading eyes fixed upon his face You have probably heard from Lady Henry have you not she said addressing him In a note I had from her this morning she told me she had written to you I could not help coming to day because Evelyn has been so kind But is it your wish that I should come here The Christian name slipped out unawares and the Duke winced at it The likeness to Lord Lackington it was certainly astonishing There ran through his mind the memory of a visit paid long ago to his early home by Lord Lackington and two daughters Rose and Blanche He the Duke had then been a boy home from school The two girls one five or six years older than the other had been the life and charm of the party He remembered hunting with Lady Rose But the confusion in his mind had somehow to be mastered and he made an effort I shall be glad if my wife is able to be of any assistance to you Miss Le Breton he said coldly but it would not be honest if I were to conceal my opinion so far as I have been able to form it that Lady Henry has great and just cause of complaint You are quite right quite right said Julie almost with eagerness She has indeed The Duke was taken by surprise Imperious as he was and stiffened by a good many of those petty prides which the spoiled children of the world escape so hardly he found himself hesitating groping for his words The Duchess meanwhile drew Julie impulsively towards a chair Do sit down You look so tired But Julie s gaze was still bent upon the Duke She restrained her friend s eager hand and the Duke collected himself He brought a chair and Julie seated herself I am deeply deeply distressed about Lady Henry she said in a low voice by which the Duke felt himself most unwillingly penetrated I don t oh no indeed I don t defend last night Only my position has been very difficult lately I wanted very much to see the Duchess and it was natural wasn t it that the old friends should like to be personally informed about Lady Henry s illness But of course they stayed too long it was my fault I ought to have prevented it She paused This stern looking man who stood with his back to the mantel piece regarding her Philistine though he was had yet a straight disinterested air from which she shrank a little Honestly she would have liked to tell him the truth But how could she She did her best and her account certainly was no more untrue than scores of narratives of social incident which issue every day from lips the most respected and the most veracious As for the Duchess she thought it the height of candor and generosity The only thing she could have wished perhaps in her inmost heart was that she had not found Julie alone with Harry Warkworth But her loyal lips would have suffered torments rather than accuse or betray her friend The Duke meanwhile went through various phases of opinion as Julie laid her story before him Perhaps he was chiefly affected by the tone of quiet independence as from equal to equal in which she addressed him His wife s cousin by marriage the granddaughter of an old and intimate friend of his own family the daughter of a man known at one time throughout Europe and himself amply well born all these facts warm living and still efficacious stood as it were behind this manner of hers prompting and endorsing it But good Heavens was illegitimacy to be as legitimacy to carry with it no stains and penalties Was vice to be virtue or as good The Duke rebelled It is a most unfortunate affair of that there can be no doubt he said after a moment s silence when Julie had brought her story to an end and then more sternly I shall certainly apologize for my wife s share in it Lady Henry won t be angry with the Duchess long said Julie Le Breton As for me her voice sank my letter this morning was returned to me unopened There was an uncomfortable pause then Julie resumed in another tone But what I am now chiefly anxious to discuss is how can we save Lady Henry from any further pain or annoyance She once said to me in a fit of anger that if I left her in consequence of a quarrel and any of her old friends sided with me she would never see them again I know said the Duke sharply Her salon will break up She already foresees it But why why cried Julie in a most becoming distress Somehow we must prevent it Unfortunately I must live in London I have the offer of work here journalist s work which cannot be done in the country or abroad But I would do all I could to shield Lady Henry What about mister Montresor said the Duke abruptly Montresor had been the well known Chateaubriand to Lady Henry s Madame Recamier for more than a generation Julie turned to him with eagerness mister Montresor wrote to me early this morning The letter reached me at breakfast In missus Montresor s name and his own he asked me to stay with them till my plans developed He he was kind enough to say he felt himself partly responsible for last night And you replied The Duke eyed her keenly Julie sighed and looked down I begged him not to think any more of me in the matter but to write at once to Lady Henry I hope he has done so And so you refused excuse these questions missus Montresor s invitation The working of the Duke s mind was revealed in his drawn and puzzled brows Certainly The speaker looked at him with surprise Lady Henry would never have forgiven that It could not be thought of Lord Lackington also but her voice wavered Yes said the Duchess eagerly throwing herself on a stool at Julie s feet and looking up into her face He too has written to me He wants to help me But I can t let him The words ended in a whisper She leaned back in her chair and put her handkerchief to her eyes It was very quietly done and very touching The Duchess threw a lightning glance at her husband and then possessing herself of one of Julie s hands she kissed it and murmured over it Was there ever such a situation thought the Duke much shaken And she has already if Evelyn is to be believed refused the chance the practical certainty of being Duchess of Chudleigh He was a man with whom a gran rifiuto of this kind weighed heavily His moral sense exacted such things rather of other people than himself But when made he could appreciate them After a few turns up and down the room he walked up to the two women Miss Le Breton he said in a far more hurried tone than was usual to him I cannot approve and Evelyn ought not to approve of much that has taken place during your residence with Lady Henry But I understand that your post was not an easy one and I recognize the forbearance of your present attitude Evelyn is much distressed about it all On the understanding that you will do what you can to soften this breach for Lady Henry I shall be glad if you will allow me to come partially to your assistance Julie looked up gravely her eyebrows lifting The Duke found himself reddening as he went on I have a little house near here a little furnished house Evelyn will explain to you It happens to be vacant If you will accept a loan of it say for six months the Duchess frowned you will give me pleasure I will explain my action to Lady Henry and endeavor to soften her feelings He paused Miss Le Breton s face was grateful touched with emotion but more than hesitating You are very good But I have no claim upon you at all And I can support myself A touch of haughtiness slipped into her manner as she gently rose to her feet Thank God I did not offer her money thought the Duke strangely perturbed Julie dear Julie implored the Duchess It s such a tiny little place and it is quite musty for want of living in Nobody has set foot in it but the caretaker for two years and it would be really a kindness to us to go and live there wouldn t it Freddie And there s all the furniture just as it was down to the bellows and the snuffers If you d only use it and take care of it Freddie hasn t liked to sell it because it s all old family stuff and he was very fond of Cousin Mary Leicester Oh do say yes Julie They shall light the fires and I ll send in a few sheets and things and you ll feel as though you d been there for years Do Julie Julie shook her head I came here she said in a voice that was still unsteady to ask for advice not favors But it s very good of you And with trembling fingers she began to refasten her veil Julie where are you going cried the Duchess You re staying here Staying here said Julie turning round upon her Do you think I should be a burden upon you or any one But Julie you told Jacob you would come I have come I wanted your sympathy and your counsel I wished also to confess myself to the Duke and to point out to him how matters could be made easier for Lady Henry The penitent yet dignified sadness of her manner and voice completed the discomfiture the temporary discomfiture of the Duke Miss Le Breton he said abruptly coming to stand beside her I remember your mother Julie s eyes filled Her hand still held her veil but it paused in its task I was a small school boy when she stayed with us resumed the Duke She was a beautiful girl She let me go out hunting with her She was very kind to me and I thought her a kind of goddess When I first heard her story years afterwards it shocked me awfully For her sake accept my offer I don t think lightly of such actions as your mother s not at all But I can t bear to think of her daughter alone and friendless in London Yet even as he spoke he seemed to be listening to another person He did not himself understand the feelings which animated him nor the strength with which his recollections of Lady Rose had suddenly invaded him Julie leaned her arms on the mantel piece and hid her face She had turned her back to them and they saw that she was crying softly The Duchess crept up to her and wound her arms round her You will Julie you will Lady Henry has turned you out of doors at a moment s notice And it was a great deal my fault You must let us help you Julie did not answer but partially disengaging herself and without looking at him she held out her hand to the Duke He pressed it with a cordiality that amazed him That s right that s right Now Evelyn I leave you to make the arrangements The keys shall be here this afternoon Miss Le Breton of course stays here till things are settled As for me I must really be off to my meeting One thing Miss Le Breton Yes I think he said gravely you ought to reveal yourself to Lord Lackington She shrank You ll let me take my own time for that was her appealing reply Very well very well We ll speak of it again And he hurried away As he descended his own stairs astonishment at what he had done rushed upon him and overwhelmed him How on earth am I ever to explain the thing to Lady Henry And as he went citywards in his cab he felt much more guilty than his wife had ever done What could have made him behave in this extraordinary this preposterous way A touch of foolish romance immoral romance of which he was already ashamed Or the one bare fact that this woman had refused Jacob Delafield XI Here it is said the Duchess as the carriage stopped Isn t it an odd little place And as she and Julie paused on the pavement 
7522-69612-0000	train-other-500	Julie looked listlessly at her new home It was a two storied brick house built about seventeen eighty The front door boasted a pair of Ionian columns and a classical canopy or pediment
none	none	 The windows had still the original small panes 
7522-69612-0001	train-other-500	the mansarde roof with its one dormer was untouched The little house had rather deep eaves three windows above two and the front door below It wore a prim old fashioned air a good deal softened and battered however by age
7522-69612-0002	train-other-500	and it stood at the corner of two streets both dingily quiet and destined no doubt to be rebuilt before long in the general rejuvenation of Mayfair As the Duchess had said it occupied the site of what had once about seventeen forty
7522-69612-0003	train-other-500	been the westerly end of a mews belonging to houses in Cureton Street long since pulled down The space filled by these houses was now occupied by one great mansion and its gardens The rest of the mews had been converted into three story houses of a fair size
7522-69612-0004	train-other-500	looking south with a back road between them and the gardens of Cureton House But at the southwesterly corner of what was now Heribert Street fronting west and quite out of line and keeping with the rest was this curious little place
7522-69612-0005	train-other-500	built probably at a different date and for some special family reason The big planes in the Cureton House gardens came close to it and overshadowed it one side wall of the house in fact formed part of the wall of the garden The Duchess full of nervousness
7522-69612-0006	train-other-500	ran up the steps put in the key herself and threw open the door An elderly Scotchwoman the caretaker appeared from the back and stood waiting to show them over Oh Julie perhaps it s too queer and musty cried the Duchess
none	none	 looking round her in some dismay 
7522-69612-0007	train-other-500	I thought you know it would be a little out of the way and quaint unlike other people just what you ought to have But I think it s delightful said Julie standing absently before a case of stuffed birds somewhat moth eaten
none	none	 which took up a good deal of space in the little hall 
7522-69612-0008	train-other-500	I love stuffed birds The Duchess glanced at her uneasily What is she thinking about she wondered But Julie roused herself Why
7522-69612-0009	train-other-500	it looks as though everything here had gone to sleep for a hundred years she said gazing in astonishment at the little hall with its old clock its two or three stiff hunting pictures its drab painted walls its poker work chest And the drawing room
7522-69612-0010	train-other-500	The caretaker had opened the windows It was a mild March day and there were misty sun gleams stealing along the lawns of Cureton House None entered the room itself for its two semi circular windows looked north over the gardens Yet
7522-69612-0011	train-other-500	it was not uncheerful Its faded curtains of blue rep
none	none	 its buff walls on which the pictures and miniatures in their tarnished gilt frames were arranged at intervals in stiff patterns and groups the Italian glass painted with dilapidated Cupids over the mantel piece the two or three Sheraton arm chairs and settees covered with threadbare needle work from the days of Evelina 
7522-69612-0012	train-other-500	a carpet of old and well preserved Brussels blue arabesques on a white ground one or two pieces of old satin wood furniture very fine and perfect a heavy centre table its cloth garnished with some early Victorian wool work
none	none	 and a pair of pink glass vases on another small table close by of a most dainty and spindle legged correctness 
7522-69612-0013	train-other-500	a set of Indian chessmen under a glass shade and on another a collection of tiny animals stags and dogs for the most part deftly pinched out of soft paper also under glass and as perfect as when their slender limbs were first fashioned
7522-69612-0014	train-other-500	by Cousin Mary Leicester s mother somewhere about the year that Marie Antoinette mounted the scaffold These various elements ugly and beautiful combined to make a general effect clean fastidious
7522-69612-0015	train-other-500	frugal and refined that was in truth full of a sort of acid charm Oh I like it I like it so much cried Julie throwing herself down into one of the straight backed arm chairs
none	none	 and looking first round the walls and then through the windows 
7522-69612-0016	train-other-500	to the gardens outside My dear said the Duchess flitting from one thing to another frowning and a little fussed those curtains won t do at all I must send some from home No no Evelyn Not a thing shall be changed You shall lend it me just as it is or not at all
7522-69612-0017	train-other-500	What a character it has I taste the person who lived here Cousin Mary Leicester said the Duchess Well she was rather an oddity She was Low Church like my mother in law but oh so much nicer
7522-69612-0018	train-other-500	Once I let her come to Grosvenor Square and speak to the servants about going to church The groom of the chambers said she was a dear old lady and if she were his cousin he wouldn t mind her being a bit touched My maid
7522-69612-0019	train-other-500	said she had no idea poke bonnets could be so sweet It made her understand what the Queen looked like when she was young And none of them have ever been to church since that I can make out
none	none	 There was one very curious thing about Cousin Mary Leicester 
7522-69612-0020	train-other-500	added the Duchess slowly she had second sight She saw her old mother in this room once or twice
none	none	 after she had been dead for years And she saw Freddie once when he was away on a long voyage 
7522-69612-0021	train-other-500	Ghosts too said Julie crossing her hands before her with a little shiver that completes it Sixty years said the Duchess musing It was a long time wasn t it to live in this little house and scarcely ever leave it
7522-69612-0022	train-other-500	Oh she had quite a circle of her own For many years her funny little sister lived here too And there was a time Freddie says when there was almost a rivalry between them and two other famous old ladies who lived in Bruton Street what was their name
none	none	 Oh the Miss Berrys Horace Walpole s Miss Berrys All sorts of famous people I believe have sat in these chairs But the Miss Berrys won Not in years Cousin Mary outlived them Ah but she was dead long before she died 
7522-69612-0023	train-other-500	said the Duchess as she came to perch on the arm of Julie s chair
none	none	 and threw her arm round her friend s neck 
7522-69612-0024	train-other-500	After her little sister departed this life she became a very silent shrivelled thing
none	none	 except for her religion 
7522-69612-0025	train-other-500	and very few people saw her She took a fancy to me which was odd wasn t it when I m such a worldling and she let me come in and out Every morning she read the Psalms and Lessons with her old maid who was just her own age in this very chair
none	none	 And two or three times a month 
7522-69612-0026	train-other-500	Freddie would slip round and read them with her you know Freddie s very religious And then she d work at flannel petticoats for the poor or something of that kind till lunch Afterwards she d go and read the Bible to people in the workhouse or in hospital
7522-69612-0027	train-other-500	When she came home the butler brought her the Times and sometimes you d find her by the fire straining her old eyes over a little Dante
none	none	 And she always dressed for dinner everything was quite smart and her old butler served her 
7522-69612-0028	train-other-500	Afterwards her maid played dominoes or spillikins with her
none	none	 all her life she never touched a card and they read a chapter and Cousin Mary played a hymn on that funny little old piano there in the corner and at ten they all went to bed Then 
7522-69612-0029	train-other-500	one morning the maid went in to wake her and she saw her dear sharp nose and chin against the light and her hands like that in front of her and well I suppose she d gone to play hymns in heaven dear Cousin Mary Julie isn t it strange the kind of lives so many of us have to lead
7522-69612-0030	train-other-500	Julie the little Duchess laid her cheek against her friend s do you believe in another life You forget I m a Catholic said Julie smiling rather doubtfully Are you Julie I d forgotten The good nuns at Bruges took care of that
none	none	 Do you ever go to mass 
7522-69612-0031	train-other-500	Sometimes Then you re not a good Catholic Julie No
none	none	 said Julie after a pause not at all But it sometimes catches hold of me The old clock in the hall struck The Duchess sprang up Oh Julie I have got to be at Clarisse s by four I promised her I d go and settle about my Drawing room dress to day Let s see the rest of the house 
7522-69612-0032	train-other-500	And they went rapidly through it All of it was stamped with the same character representing as it were the meeting point between an inherited luxury and a personal asceticism
none	none	 Beautiful chairs or cabinets transported sixty years before from one of the old Crowborough houses in the country to this little abode side by side with things the cheapest and the commonest all that Cousin Mary Leicester could ever persuade herself to buy with her own money 
7522-69612-0033	train-other-500	For all the latter part of her life she had been half a mystic and half a great lady secretly hating the luxury from which she had not the strength to free herself dressing ceremoniously as the Duchess had said for a solitary dinner and all the while going in sore remembrance of a Master who had not where to lay his head
7522-69612-0034	train-other-500	At any rate there was an ample supply of household stuff for a single woman and her maids In the china cupboard
none	none	 there were still the old fashioned Crown Derby services the costly cut glass 
7522-69612-0035	train-other-500	the Leeds and Wedgewood dessert dishes that Cousin Mary Leicester had used for half a century
none	none	 The caretaker produced the keys of the iron lined plate cupboard and showed its old world contents clean and in order Why Julie If we d only ordered the dinner I might have come to dine with you to night cried the Duchess enjoying and peering into everything like a child with its doll s house 
7522-69612-0036	train-other-500	And the linen gracious as the doors of another cupboard were opened to her But now I remember
none	none	 Freddie said nothing was to be touched till he made up his mind what to do with the little place Why there s everything And they both looked in astonishment at the white fragrant rows 
7522-69612-0037	train-other-500	at the worn monogram in the corners of the sheets at the little bags of lavender and pot pourri ranged along the shelves Suddenly Julie turned away and sat down by an open window
none	none	 carrying her eyes far from the house and its stores It is too much Evelyn she said sombrely It oppresses me I don t think I can live up to it Julie and again the little Duchess came to stand caressingly beside her Why you must have sheets and knives and forks 
7522-69612-0038	train-other-500	Why should you get ugly new ones when you can use Cousin Mary s
none	none	 She would have loved you to have them 
7522-69612-0039	train-other-500	She would have hated me with all her strength said Miss Le Breton probably with much truth The two were silent a little Through Julie s stormy heart there swept longings and bitternesses inexpressible What did she care for the little house and all its luxuries
none	none	 She was sorry that she had fettered herself with it 
7522-69612-0040	train-other-500	Nearly four o clock in the afternoon and no letter not a word Julie said the Duchess softly in her ear you know you can t live here alone I m afraid Freddie would make a fuss I ve thought of that said Julie wearily But shall we really go on with it Evelyn
7522-69612-0041	train-other-500	The Duchess looked entreaty Julie repented and drawing her friend towards her rested her head against the chinchilla cloak I m tired I suppose she said in a low voice Don t think me an ungrateful wretch Well there s my foster sister and her child
none	none	 Madame Bornier and the little cripple girl cried the Duchess Excellent Where are they Leonie is in the French Governesses Home as it happens looking out for a situation and the child is in the Orthopaedic Hospital They ve been straightening her foot It s wonderfully better and she s nearly ready to come out Are they nice Julie Therese is an angel you must be the one thing or the other apparently if you re a cripple And as for Leonie well if she comes here nobody need be anxious about my finances She d count every crust and cinder We couldn t keep any English servant but we could get a Belgian one But is she nice repeated the Duchess I m used to her said Julie in the same inanimate voice Suddenly the clock in the hall below struck four Heavens cried the Duchess You don t know how Clarisse keeps you to your time Shall I go on and send the carriage back for you Don t trouble about me I should like to look round me here a little longer You ll remember that some of our fellow criminals may look in after five doctor Meredith and Lord Lackington said as we were getting away last night oh how that doorstep of Aunt Flora s burned my shoes that they should come round And Jacob is coming he ll stay and dine And Julie I ve asked Captain Warkworth to dine to morrow night Have you That s noble of you for you don t like him I don t know him cried the Duchess protesting If you like him of course it s all right Was he was he very agreeable last night she added slyly 
7522-69612-0042	train-other-500	What a word to apply to anybody or anything connected with last night Are you very sore Julie Well on this very day of being turned out it hurts I wonder who is writing Lady Henry s letters for her this afternoon
7522-69612-0043	train-other-500	I hope they are not getting written said the Duchess savagely and that she s missing you abominably
none	none	 Good bye au revoir If I am twenty minutes late with Clarisse I sha n t get any fitting duchess or no duchess And the little creature hurried off not so fast however but that she found time to leave a number of parting instructions as to the house with the Scotch caretaker on her way to her carriage 
7522-69612-0044	train-other-500	Julie rose and made her way down to the drawing room again The Scotchwoman saw that she wanted to be alone and left her The windows were still open to the garden outside Julie examined the paths the shrubberies the great plane trees
7522-69612-0045	train-other-500	she strained her eyes towards the mansion itself But not much of it could be seen The little house at the corner had been carefully planted out What wealth it implied that space and size in London Evidently the house was still shut up
none	none	 The people who owned it were now living the same cumbrous magnificent life in the country 
7522-69612-0046	train-other-500	which they would soon come up to live in the capital Honors parks money birth all were theirs as naturally as the sun rose Julie envied and hated the big house and all it stood for
none	none	 she flung a secret defiance at this coveted and elegant Mayfair that lay around her this heart of all that is recognized accepted carelessly sovereign in our materialized upper class And yet all the while she knew that it was an unreal and passing defiance 
7522-69612-0047	train-other-500	She would not be able in truth to free herself from the ambition to live and shine in this world of the English rich and well born For after all as she told herself with rebellious passion
7522-69612-0048	train-other-500	it was or ought to be her world And yet her whole being was sore from the experiences of these three years with Lady Henry from those above all of the preceding twenty four hours She wove no romance about herself
none	none	 I should have dismissed myself long ago she would have said contemptuously to 
7522-69612-0049	train-other-500	any one who could have compelled the disclosure of her thoughts
none	none	 But the long and miserable struggle of her self love with Lady Henry s arrogance of her gifts with her circumstances 
7522-69612-0050	train-other-500	the presence in this very world where she had gained so marked a personal success of two clashing estimates of herself both of which she perfectly understood
none	none	 the one exalting her the other merely implying the cool and secret judgment of persons who see the world as it is these things made a heat and poison in her blood 
7522-69612-0051	train-other-500	She was not good enough not desirable enough to be the wife of the man she loved Here was the plain fact that stung and stung
none	none	 Jacob Delafield had thought her good enough She still felt the pressure of his warm strong fingers the touch of his kiss upon her hand 
7522-69612-0052	train-other-500	What a paradox was she living in The Duchess might well ask why indeed
none	none	 had she refused Jacob Delafield that first time As to the second refusal that needed no explanation at least for herself 
7522-69612-0053	train-other-500	When upon that winter day now some six weeks past which had beheld Lady Henry more than commonly tyrannical and her companion more than commonly weary and rebellious Delafield s stammered words as he and she were crossing Grosvenor Square in the January dusk
7522-69612-0054	train-other-500	had struck for the second time upon her ear she was already under Warkworth s charm But before the first time
none	none	 She had come to Lady Henry firmly determined to marry as soon and as well as she could to throw off the slur on her life to regularize her name and place in the world And then the possible heir of the Chudleighs proposes to her and she rejects him It was sometimes difficult for her now to remember all the whys and wherefores of this strange action of which she was secretly so proud But the explanation was in truth not far from that she had given to the Duchess 
7522-69612-0055	train-other-500	The wild strength in her own nature had divined and shrunk from a similar strength in Delafield s Here indeed one came upon the fact which forever differentiated her from the adventuress had Sir Wilfrid known She wanted money and name there were days when she hungered for them
7522-69612-0056	train-other-500	But she would not give too reckless a price for them She was a personality a soul not a vulgar woman not merely callous or greedy She dreaded to be miserable she had a thirst for happiness and the heart was after all stronger than the head
7522-69612-0057	train-other-500	Jacob Delafield No Her being contracted and shivered at the thought of him
none	none	 A will tardily developed if all accounts of his school and college days were true 
7522-69612-0058	train-other-500	but now as she believed invincible a mystic an ascetic
7522-69612-0059	train-other-500	a man under whose modest or careless or self mocking ways she with her eye for character divined the most critical instincts and a veracity iron scarcely human a man before whom one must be always posing at one s best
none	none	 that was a personal risk too great to take for a Julie Le Breton 
7522-69612-0060	train-other-500	Unless indeed if it came to this that one must think no more of love but only of power why then A ring at the door resounding through the quiet side street
none	none	 After a minute the Scotchwoman opened the drawing room door Please miss is this meant for you 
7522-69612-0061	train-other-500	Julie took the letter in astonishment
none	none	 Then through the door she saw a man standing in the hall and recognized Captain Warkworth s Indian servant 
7522-69612-0062	train-other-500	I don t understand him said the Scotchwoman shaking her head
none	none	 Julie went out to speak with him The man had been sent to Crowborough House with instructions to inquire for Miss Le Breton and deliver his note 
7522-69612-0063	train-other-500	The groom of the chambers misinterpreting the man s queer English and thinking the matter urgent the note was marked immediate had sent him after the ladies to Heribert Street
none	none	 The man was soon feed and dismissed and Miss Le Breton took the letter back to the drawing room So after all he had not failed there on her lap was her daily letter Outside the scanty March sun now just setting was touching the garden with gold Had it also found its way into Julie s eyes Now for his explanation First how and where are you I called in Bruton Street at noon Hutton told me you had just gone to Crowborough House Kind no wise little Duchess 
7522-69612-0064	train-other-500	She honors herself in sheltering you
none	none	 I could not write last night I was too uncertain too anxious All I said might have jarred 
7522-69612-0065	train-other-500	This morning came your note about eleven It was angelic to think so kindly and thoughtfully of a friend angelic to write such a letter at such a time You announced your flight to Crowborough House but did not say when so I crept to Bruton Street
7522-69612-0066	train-other-500	seeing Lady Henry in every lamp post got a few clandestine words with Hutton and knew at least what had happened to you outwardly and visibly Last night did you think me a poltroon to vanish as I did It was the impulse of a moment
7522-69612-0067	train-other-500	mister Montresor had pulled me into a corner of the room away from the rest of the party nominally to look at a picture really that I might answer a confidential question he had just put to me with regard to a disputed incident in the Afridi campaign
7522-69612-0068	train-other-500	We were in the dark and partly behind a screen Then the door opened I confess the sight of Lady Henry paralyzed me A great murderous six foot Afridi that
none	none	 would have been simple enough But a woman old and ill and furious with that Medusa s face no 
7522-69612-0069	train-other-500	My nerves suddenly failed me What right had I in her house after all
none	none	 As she advanced into the room I slipped out behind her General Fergus and M du Bartas joined me in the hall We walked to Bond Street together They were divided between laughter and vexation I should have laughed if I could have forgotten you But what could I have done for you dear lady if I had stayed out the storm I left you with three or four devoted adherents who had moreover the advantage over me 
7522-69612-0070	train-other-500	of either relationship or old acquaintance with Lady Henry Compared to them I could have done nothing to shield you Was it not best to withdraw Yet all the way home I accused myself bitterly Nor did I feel when I reached home
7522-69612-0071	train-other-500	that one who had not grasped your hand under fire had any right to rest or sleep But anxiety for you regrets for myself took care of that I got my deserts
none	none	 After all when the pricks and pains of this great wrench are over shall we not all acknowledge that it is best the crash should have come 
7522-69612-0072	train-other-500	You have suffered and borne too much Now we shall see you expand in a freer and happier life The Duchess has asked me to dinner to morrow the note has just arrived so that I shall soon have the chance of hearing from you some of those details I so much want to know
7522-69612-0073	train-other-500	But before then you will write As for me I am full of alternate hopes and fears
7522-69612-0074	train-other-500	General Fergus as we walked home was rather silent and bearish I could not flatter myself that he had any friendly intentions towards me in his mind But Montresor was more than kind and gave me some fresh opportunities of which I was very glad to avail myself
7522-69612-0075	train-other-500	Well we shall know soon You told me once that if or when this happened you would turn to your pen and that
none	none	 doctor Meredith would find you openings That is not to be regretted I think You have great gifts which will bring you pleasure in the using 
7522-69612-0076	train-other-500	I have got a good deal of pleasure out of my small ones Did you know that once long ago when I was stationed at Gibraltar I wrote a military novel No
none	none	 I don t pity you because you will need to turn your intellect to account You will be free and mistress of your fate That for those who like you and me are the children of their works as the Spaniards say is much 
7522-69612-0077	train-other-500	Dear friend kind persecuted friend I thought of you in the watches of the night I think of you this morning Let me soon have news of you Julie put the letter down upon her knee Her face stiffened
none	none	 Nothing that she had ever received from him yet had rung so false 
7522-69612-0078	train-other-500	Grief Complaint No Just a calm grasp of the game a quick playing of the pieces so long as the game was there to play
none	none	 If he was appointed to this mission in two or three weeks he would be gone to the heart of Africa 
7522-69612-0079	train-other-500	If not Anyway two or three weeks were hers Her mind seemed to settle and steady itself She got up and went once more carefully through the house giving her attention to it
7522-69612-0080	train-other-500	Yes the whole had character and a kind of charm The little place would make no doubt an interesting and distinguished background for the life she meant to put into it She would move in at once in three days at most
7522-69612-0081	train-other-500	Ways and means were for the moment not difficult During her life with Lady Henry she had saved the whole of her own small rentes Three hundred pounds lay ready to her hand in an investment easily realized And she would begin to earn at once
none	none	 Therese 
7522-69612-0082	train-other-500	that should be her room the cheerful blue papered room with the south window Julie felt a strange rush of feeling as she thought of it How curious that these two
none	none	 Leonie and little Therese 
7522-69612-0083	train-other-500	should be thus brought back into her life For she had no doubt whatever that they would accept with eagerness what she had to offer Her foster sister had married a school master in one of the Communal schools of Bruges
none	none	 while Julie was still a girl at the convent Leonie s lame child had been much with her grandmother 
7522-69612-0084	train-other-500	old Madame Le Breton To Julie she had been at first unwelcome and repugnant Then some quality in the frail creature had unlocked the girl s sealed and often sullen heart
none	none	 While she had been living with Lady Henry these two the mother and child had been also in London the mother now a widow earning her bread as an inferior kind of French governess the child boarded out with various persons and generally for long periods of the year in hospital or convalescent home To visit her in her white hospital bed to bring her toys and flowers or merely kisses and chat had been during these years the only work of charity on Julie s part which had been wholly secret disinterested and constant XII It was a somewhat depressed company that found its straggling way into the Duchess s drawing room that evening between tea and dinner Miss Le Breton did not appear at tea The Duchess believed that after her inspection of the house in Heribert Street Julie had gone on to Bloomsbury to find Madame Bornier Jacob Delafield was there not much inclined to talk even as Julie s champion And one by one Lady Henry s oldest habitues the criminals of the night before dropped in doctor Meredith arrived with a portfolio containing what seemed to be proof sheets Miss Le Breton not here he said as he looked round him The Duchess explained that she might be in presently The great man sat down his portfolio carefully placed beside him and drank his tea under what seemed a cloud of preoccupation Then appeared Lord Lackington and Sir Wilfrid Bury Montresor had sent a note from the House to say that if the debate would let him he would dash up to Grosvenor Square for some dinner but could only stay an hour Well here we are again the worst of us said the Duchess presently with a sigh of bravado as she handed Lord Lackington his cup of tea and sank back in her chair to enjoy her own Speak for yourselves please said Sir Wilfrid s soft smiling voice as he daintily relieved his mustache of some of the Duchess s cream Oh that s all very well said the Duchess throwing up a hand in mock annoyance but why weren t you there I knew better The people who keep out of scrapes are not the people one loves was the Duchess s peevish reply Let him alone said Lord Lackington coming for some more tea cake He will get his deserts Next Wednesday he will be tete a tete with Lady Henry Lady Henry is going to Torquay to morrow said Sir Wilfrid quietly Ah There was a general chorus of interrogation amid which the Duchess made herself heard Then you ve seen her To day for twenty minutes all she was able to bear She was ill yesterday She is naturally worse to day As to her state of mind The circle of faces drew eagerly nearer Oh it s war said Sir Wilfrid nodding undoubtedly war upon the Cave if there is a Cave Well poor things we must have something to shelter us cried the Duchess The Cave is being aired to day The interrogating faces turned her way The Duchess explained the situation and drew the house in Heribert Street with its Cyclops eye of a dormer window and its Ionian columns on the tea cloth with her nail Ah said Sir Wilfrid crossing his knees reflectively Ah that makes it serious Julie must have a place to live in said the Duchess stiffly I suppose Lady Henry would reply that there are still a few houses in London which do not belong to her kinsman the Duke of Crowborough Not perhaps to be had for the lending and ready to step into at a day s notice said Lord Lackington with his queer smile like the play of sharp sunbeams through a mist That s the worst of our class The margin between us and calamity is too wide We risk too little Nobody goes to the workhouse Sir Wilfrid looked at him curiously Do I catch your meaning he said dropping his voice is it that if there had been no Duchess and no Heribert Street Miss Le Breton would have managed to put up with Lady Henry Lord Lackington smiled again I think it probable As it is however we are all the gainers We shall now see Miss Julie at her ease and ours You have been for some time acquainted with Miss Le Breton Oh some time I don t exactly remember Lady Henry of course is an old friend of mine as she is of yours Sometimes she is rude to me Then I stay away But I always go back She and I can discuss things and people that nobody else recollects no as far as that s concerned you re not in it Bury Only this winter somehow I have often gone round to see Lady Henry and have found Miss Le Breton instead so attractive Precisely said Sir Wilfrid laughing the whole case in a nutshell What puzzles me continued his companion in a musing voice is how she can be so English as she is with her foreign bringing up She has a most extraordinary instinct for people people in London and their relations I have never known her make a mistake Yet it is only five years since she began to come to England at all and she has lived but three with Lady Henry It was clear I thought that neither she nor Lady Henry wished to be questioned But do you for instance I have no doubt Lady Henry tells you more than she tells me do you know anything of Mademoiselle Julie s antecedents Sir Wilfrid started Through his mind ran the same reflection as that to which the Duke had given expression in the morning she ought to reveal herself Julie Le Breton had no right to leave this old man in his ignorance while those surrounding him were in the secret Thereby she made a spectacle of her mother s father made herself and him the sport of curious eyes For who could help watching them every movement every word There was a kind of indelicacy in it His reply was rather hesitating Yes I happen to know something But I feel sure Miss Le Breton would prefer to tell you herself Ask her While she was with Lady Henry there were reasons for silence But of course I ll ask her said his companion eagerly if you suppose that I may A more hungry curiosity was never raised in a human breast than in mine with regard to this dear lady So charming handsome and well bred and so forlorn That s the paradox of it The personality presupposes a milieu else how produce it And there is no milieu save this little circle she has made for herself through Lady Henry Ah and you think I may ask her I will that s flat I will And the old man gleefully rubbed his hands face and form full of the vivacity of his imperishable youth Choose your time and place said Sir Wilfrid hastily There are very sad and tragic circumstances Lord Lackington looked at him and nodded gayly as much as to say You distrust me with the sex Me who have had the whip hand of them since my cradle Suddenly the Duchess interrupted Sir Wilfrid you have seen Lady Henry which did she mind most the coming in or the coffee Bury returned smiling to the tea table The coming in would have been nothing if it had led quickly to the going out It was the coffee that ruined you I see said the Duchess pouting it meant that it was possible for us to enjoy ourselves without Lady Henry That was the offence Precisely It showed that you were enjoying yourselves Otherwise there would have been no lingering and no coffee I never knew coffee so fatal before sighed the Duchess And now it was evident that she shrank from the answer to her own question she is really irreconcilable Absolutely Let me beg you to take it for granted She won t see any of us not me Sir Wilfrid hesitated Make the Duke your ambassador The Duchess laughed and flushed a little And mister Montresor Ah said Sir Wilfrid in another tone that s not to be lightly spoken of You don t mean How many years has that lasted said Sir Wilfrid meditatively Thirty I think if not more It was Lady Henry who told him of his son s death when his wife daren t do it There was a silence Montresor had lost his only son a subaltern in the Lancers in the action of Alumbagh on the way to the relief of Lucknow Then the Duchess broke out I know that you think in your heart of hearts that Julie has been in fault and that we have all behaved abominably My dear lady said Sir Wilfrid after a moment in Persia we believe in fate I have brought the trick home Yes yes that s it exclaimed Lord Lackington it When Lady Henry wanted a companion and fate brought her Miss Le Breton Last night s coffee was already drunk put in Sir Wilfrid Meredith s voice raised and a trifle harsh made itself heard Why you should dignify an ugly jealousy by fine words I don t know For some women women like our old friend gratitude is hard That is the moral of this tale The only one said Sir Wilfrid not without a mocking twist of the lip The only one that matters Lady Henry had found or might have found a daughter I understand she bargained for a companion Very well Then she stands upon her foolish rights and loses both daughter and companion At seventy life doesn t forgive you a blunder of that kind Sir Wilfrid silently shook his head Meredith threw back his blanched mane of hair his deep eyes kindling under the implied contradiction I am an old comrade of Lady Henry s he said quickly My record you ll find comes next to yours Bury But if Lady Henry is determined to make a quarrel of this she must make it I regret nothing What madness has seized upon all these people thought Bury as he withdrew from the discussion The fire the unwonted fire in Meredith s speech and aspect amazed him From the corner to which he had retreated he studied the face of the journalist It was a face subtly and strongly lined by much living of the intellectual however rather than the physical sort breathing now a studious dignity the effect of the broad sweep of brow under the high peaked lines of grizzled hair and now broken tempestuous scornful changing with the pliancy of an actor The head was sunk a little in the shoulders as though dragged back by its own weight The form which it commanded had the movements of a man no less accustomed to rule in his own sphere than Montresor himself To Sir Wilfrid the famous editor was still personally mysterious after many years of intermittent acquaintance He was apparently unmarried or was there perhaps a wife picked up in a previous state of existence and hidden away with her offspring at Clapham or Hornsey or Peckham Bury could remember years before a dowdy old sister to whom Lady Henry had been on occasion formally polite Otherwise nothing What were the great man s origins and antecedents his family school university Sir Wilfrid did not know he did not believe that any one knew An amazing mastery of the German and it was said the Russian tongues suggested a foreign education but neither on this ground nor any other connected with his personal history did Meredith encourage the inquirer It was often reported that he was of Jewish descent and there were certain traits both of feature and character that lent support to the notion If so the strain was that of Heine or Disraeli not the strain of Commerce At any rate he was one of the most powerful men of his day the owner through The New Rambler of an influence which now for some fifteen years had ranked among the forces to be reckoned with A man in whom politics assumed a tinge of sombre poetry a man of hatreds ideals indignations yet of habitually sober speech As to passions Sir Wilfrid could have sworn that wife or no wife the man who could show that significance of mouth and eye had not gone through life without knowing the stress and shock of them Was he too beguiled by this woman he too For a little behind him beside the Duchess sat Jacob Delafield and during his painful interview that day with Lady Henry Sir Wilfrid had been informed of several things with regard to Jacob Delafield he had not known before So she had refused him this lady who was now the heart of this whirlwind Permanently Lady Henry had poured scorn on the notion She was merely sure of him could keep him in a string to play with as she chose Meanwhile the handsome soldier was metal more attractive Sir Wilfrid reflected with an inward shrug that once let a woman give herself to such a fury as possessed Lady Henry and there did not seem to be much to choose between her imaginings and those of the most vulgar of her sex So Jacob could be played with whistled on and whistled off as Miss Le Breton chose Yet his was not a face that suggested it any more than the face of doctor Meredith The young man s countenance was gradually changing its aspect for Sir Wilfrid in a somewhat singular way as old impressions of his character died away and new ones emerged The face now often recalled to Bury a portrait by some Holbeinesque master which he had seen once in the Basle Museum and never forgotten A large thin lipped mouth that without weakness suggested patience the long chin of a man of will nose bluntly cut at the tip yet in the nostril and bridge most delicate grayish eyes with a veil of reverie drawn as it were momentarily across them and showing behind the veil a kind of stern sweetness fair hair low on the brow which was heavy and made a massive shelter for the eyes So looked the young German who had perhaps heard Melanchthon so in this middle nineteenth century looked Jacob Delafield No anger makes obtuse that no doubt was Lady Henry s case At any rate in Delafield s presence her theory did not commend itself But if Delafield had not echoed them the little Duchess had received Meredith s remarks with enthusiasm Regret No indeed Why should we regret anything except that Julie has been miserable so long She has had a bad time Every day and all day Ah you don t know none of you You haven t seen all the little things as I have The errands and the dogs said Sir William slyly The Duchess threw him a glance half conscious half resentful and went on It has been one small torture after another Even when a person s old you can t bear more than a certain amount can you You oughtn t to No let s be thankful it s all over and Julie our dear delightful Julie who has done everybody in this room all sorts of kindnesses hasn t she An assenting murmur ran round the circle Julie s free Only she s very lonely We must see to that mustn t we Lady Henry can buy another companion to morrow she will She has heaps of money and heaps of friends and she ll tell her own story to them all But Julie has only us If we desert her Desert her said a voice in the distance half amused half electrical Bury thought it was Jacob s Of course we sha n t desert her cried the Duchess We shall rally round her and carry her through If Lady Henry makes herself disagreeable then we ll fight If not we ll let her cool down Oh Julie darling here you are The Duchess sprang up and caught her entering friend by the hand And here are we with a wave round the circle This is your court your saint Germain So you mean me to die in exile said Julie with a quavering smile as she drew off her gloves Then she looked at her friends Oh how good of you all to come Lord Lackington She went up to him impetuously and he taken by surprise yielded his hands which she took in both hers It was foolish I know but you don t think it was so bad do you She gazed up at him wistfully Her lithe form seemed almost to cling to the old man Instinctively Jacob Meredith Sir Wilfrid Bury withdrew their eyes The room held its breath As for Lord Lackington he colored like a girl No no a mistake perhaps for all of us but more ours than yours mademoiselle much more Don t fret Indeed you look as if you hadn t slept and that mustn t be You must think that sooner or later it was bound to come Lady Henry will soften in time and you will know so well how to meet her But now we have your future to think of Only sit down You mustn t look so tired Where have you been wandering And with a stately courtesy her hand still in his he took her to a chair and helped her to remove her heavy cloak My future She shivered as she dropped into her seat How weary and beaten down she looked the heroine of such a turmoil Her eyes travelled from face to face shrinking unconsciously appealing In the dim soft color of the room her white face and hands striking against her black dress were strangely living and significant They spoke command through weakness through sex For that in spite of intellectual distinction was after all her secret She breathed femininity the old common spell upon the blood I don t know why you re all so kind to me she murmured Let me disappear I can go into the country and earn my living there Then I shall be no more trouble Unseen himself Sir Wilfrid surveyed her He thought her a consummate actress and revelled in each new phase The Duchess half laughing half crying began to scold her friend Delafield bent over Julie Le Breton s chair Have you had some tea The smile in his eyes provoked a faint answer in hers While she was declaring that she was in no need whatever of physical sustenance Meredith advanced with his portfolio He looked the editor merely and spoke with a business like brevity I have brought the sheets of the new Shelley book Miss Le Breton It is due for publication on the twenty twod Kindly let me have your review within a week It may run to two columns possibly even two and a half You will find here also the particulars of one or two other things let me know please what you will undertake Julie put out a languid hand for the portfolio I don t think you ought to trust me What do you want of her said Lord Lackington briskly Chatter about Harriet I could write you reams of that myself I once saw Harriet Ah Meredith with whom the Shelley cult was a deep rooted passion started and looked round then sharply repressed the eagerness on his tongue and sat down by Miss Le Breton with whom in a lowered voice he began to discuss the points to be noticed in the sheets handed over to her No stronger proof could he have given of his devotion to her Julie knew it and rousing herself she met him with a soft attention and docility thus tacitly relinquishing as Bury noticed with amusement all talk of disappearance Only with himself he suspected was the fair lady ill at ease And indeed it was so Julie by her pallor her humility had thrown herself as it were into the arms of her friends and each was now vying with the other as to how best to cheer and console her Meanwhile her attention was really bent upon her critic her only critic in this assembly and he discovered various attempts to draw him into conversation And when Lord Lackington discomfited by Meredith had finished discharging his literary recollections upon him Sir Wilfrid became complaisant Julie slipped in and held him Leaning her chin on both hands she bent towards him fixing him with her eyes And in spite of his antagonism he no longer felt himself strong enough to deny that the eyes were beautiful especially with this tragic note in them of fatigue and pain Sir Wilfrid she spoke in low entreaty you must help me to prevent any breach between Lady Henry and mister Montresor He looked at her gayly I fear he said you are too late That point is settled as I understand from herself Surely not so soon There was an exchange of letters this morning Oh but you can prevent it you must She clasped her hands No he said slowly I fear you must accept it Their relation was a matter of old habit Like other things old and frail it bears shock and disturbance badly She sank back in her chair raising her hands and letting them fall with a gesture of despair One little stroke of punishment just one Surely there was no cruelty in that Sir Wilfrid caught the Horatian lines dancing through his head Just oblige me and touch With your wand that minx Chloe But don t hurt her much Yet here was Jacob interposing Jacob who had evidently been watching his mild attempt at castigation no doubt with disapproval Lover or no lover what did the man expect Under his placid exterior Sir Wilfrid s mind was in truth hot with sympathy for the old and helpless Delafield bent over Miss Le Breton You will go and rest Evelyn advises it She rose to her feet and most of the party rose too Good bye good bye said Lord Lackington offering her a cordial hand Rest and forget Everything blows over And at Easter you must come to me in the country Blanche will be with me and my granddaughter Aileen if I can tempt them away from Italy Aileen s a little fairy you d be charmed with her Now mind that s a promise You must certainly come The Duchess had paused in her farewell nothings with Sir Wilfrid to observe her friend Julie with her eyes on the ground murmured thanks and Lord Lackington straight as a dart to night carrying his seventy five years as though they were the merest trifle made a stately and smiling exit Julie looked round upon the faces left In her own heart she read the same judgment as in their eyes The old man must know The Duke came into the drawing room half an hour later in quest of his wife He was about to leave town by a night train for the north and his temper was apparently far from good The Duchess was stretched on the sofa in the firelight her hands behind her head dreaming Whether it was the sight of so much ease that jarred on the Duke s ruffled nerves or no certain it is that he inflicted a thorny good bye He had seen Lady Henry he said and the reality was even worse than he had supposed There was absolutely nothing to be said for Miss Le Breton and he was ashamed of himself to have been so weakly talked over in the matter of the house His word once given of course there was an end of it for six months After that Miss Le Breton must provide for herself Meanwhile Lady Henry refused to receive the Duchess and would be some time before she forgave himself It was all most annoying and he was thankful to be going away for Lady Rose or no Lady Rose he really could not have entertained the lady with civility Oh well never mind Freddie said the Duchess springing up She ll be gone before you come back and I ll look after her The Duke offered a rather sulky embrace walked to the door and came back I really very much dislike this kind of gossip he said stiffly but perhaps I had better say that Lady Henry believes that the affair with Delafield was only one of several She talks of a certain Captain Warkworth Yes said the Duchess nodding I know but he sha n t have Julie Her smile completed the Duke s annoyance What have you to do with it I beg Evelyn I insist that you leave Miss Le Breton s love affairs alone You forget Freddie that she is my friend The little creature fronted him all wilfulness and breathing hard her small hands clasped on her breast With an angry exclamation the Duke departed At half past eight a hansom dashed up to Crowborough House Montresor emerged He found the two ladies and Jacob Delafield just beginning dinner and stayed with them an hour but it was not an hour of pleasure The great man was tired with work and debate depressed also by the quarrel with his old friend Julie did not dare to put questions and guiltily shrank into herself She divined that a great price was being paid on her behalf and must needs bitterly ask whether anything that she could offer or plead was worth it bitterly suspect also that the query had passed through other minds than her own After dinner as Montresor rose with the Duchess to take his leave Julie got a word with him in the corridor You will give me ten minutes talk she said lifting her pale face to him You mustn t mustn t quarrel with Lady Henry because of me He drew himself up perhaps with a touch of haughtiness Lady Henry could end it in a moment Don t I beg of you trouble your head about the matter Even as an old friend one must be allowed one s self respect But mayn t I Nearly ten o clock he cried looking at his watch I must be off this moment So you are going to the house in Heribert Street I remember Lady Mary Leicester perfectly As soon as you are settled tell me and I will present myself Meanwhile he smiled and bent his black head towards her look in to morrow s papers for some interesting news He sprang into his hansom and was gone Julie went slowly up stairs Of course she understood The long intrigue had reached its goal and within twelve hours the Times would announce the appointment of Captain Warkworth D S O to the command of the Mokembe military mission He would have obtained his heart s desire through her How true were those last words perhaps only Julie knew She looked back upon all the manoeuvres and influences she had brought to bear flattery here interest or reciprocity there the lures of Crowborough House the prestige of Lady Henry s drawing room Wheel by wheel she had built up her cunning machine and the machine had worked No doubt the last completing touch had been given the night before Her culminating offence against Lady Henry the occasion of her disgrace and banishment had been to Warkworth the stepping stone of fortune What gossamer girl could have done so much She threw back her head proudly and heard the beating of her heart Lady Henry was fiercely forgotten She opened the drawing room door absorbed in a counting of the hours till she and Warkworth should meet Then amid the lights and shadows of the Duchess s drawing room Jacob Delafield rose and came towards her Her exaltation dropped in a moment Some testing penetrating influence seemed to breathe from this man which filled her with a moral discomfort a curious restlessness Did he guess the nature of her feeling for Warkworth Was he acquainted with the efforts she had been making for the young soldier She could not be sure he had never given her the smallest sign Yet she divined that few things escaped him where the persons who touched his feelings were concerned And Evelyn the dear chatterbox certainly suspected How tired you are he said to her gently What a day it has been for you Evelyn is writing letters Let me bring you the papers and please don t talk She submitted to a sofa to an adjusted light to the papers on her knee Then Delafield withdrew and took up a book She could not rest however visions of the morrow and of Warkworth s triumphant looks kept flashing through her Yet all the while Delafield s presence haunted her she could not forget him and presently she addressed him mister Delafield He heard the low voice and came I have never thanked you for your goodness last night I do thank you now most earnestly You needn t You know very well what I would do to serve you if I could Even when you think me in the wrong said Julie with a little hysterical laugh Her conscience smote her Why provoke this intimate talk wantonly with the man she had made suffer Yet her restlessness which was partly nervous fatigue drove her on Delafield flushed at her words How have I given you cause to say that Oh you are very transparent One sees that you are always troubling yourself about the right and wrong of things All very well for one s self said Delafield trying to laugh I hope I don t seem to you to be setting up as a judge of other people s right and wrong Yes yes you do she said passionately Then as he winced No I don t mean that But you do judge it is in your nature and other people feel it I didn t know I was such a prig said Delafield humbly It is true I am always puzzling over things Julie was silent She was indeed secretly convinced that he no more approved the escapade of the night before than did Sir Wilfrid Bury Through the whole evening she had been conscious of a watchful anxiety and resistance on his part Yet he had stood by her to the end so warmly so faithfully He sat down beside her and Julie felt a fresh pang of remorse perhaps of alarm Why had she called him to her What had they to do with each other But he soon reassured her He began to talk of Meredith and the work before her the important and glorious work as he naively termed it of the writer And presently he turned upon her with sudden feeling You accused me just now of judging what I have no business to judge If you think that I regret the severance of your relation with Lady Henry you are quite quite mistaken It has been the dream of my life this last year to see you free mistress of your own life It it made me mad that you should be ordered about like a child dependent upon another person s will She looked at him curiously I know That revolts you always any form of command Evelyn tells me that you carry it to curious lengths with your servants and laborers He drew back evidently disconcerted Oh I try some experiments They generally break down You try to do without servants Evelyn says as much as possible Well if I do try I don t succeed he said laughing But his eyes kindled isn t it worth while during a bit of one s life to escape if one can from some of the paraphernalia in which we are all smothered Look there What right have I to turn my fellow creatures into bedizened automata like that And he threw out an accusing hand towards the two powdered footmen who were removing the coffee cups and making up the fire in the next room while the magnificent groom of the chambers stood like a statue receiving some orders from the Duchess Julie however showed no sympathy They are only automata in the drawing room Down stairs they are as much alive as you or I Well let us put it that I prefer other kinds of luxury said Delafield However as I appear to have none of the qualities necessary to carry out my notions they don t get very far You would like to shake hands with the butler said Julie musing I knew a case of that kind But the butler gave warning Delafield laughed Perhaps the simpler thing would be to do without the butler I am curious she said smiling very curious Sir Wilfrid for instance talks of going down to stay with you Why not He d come off extremely well There s an ex butler and an ex cook of Chudleigh s settled in the village When I have a visitor they come in and take possession We live like fighting cocks So nobody knows that in general you live like a workman Delafield looked impatient Somebody seems to have been cramming Evelyn with ridiculous tales and she s been spreading them I must have it out with her I expect there is a good deal in them said Julie Then unexpectedly she raised her eyes and gave him a long and rather strange look Why do you dislike having servants and being waited upon so much I wonder Is it you won t be angry that you have such a strong will and you do these things to tame it Delafield made a sudden movement and Julie had no sooner spoken the words than she regretted them So you think I should have made a jolly tyrannical slave owner said Delafield after a moment s pause Julie bent towards him with a charming look of appeal almost of penitence On the contrary I think you would have been as good to your slaves as you are to your friends His eyes met hers quietly Thank you That was kind of you And as to giving orders and getting one s way don t suppose I let Chudleigh s estate go to ruin It s only he hesitated the small personal tyrannies of every day that I d like to minimize They brutalize half the fellows I know You ll come to them said Julie absently Then she colored suddenly remembering the possible dukedom that awaited him His brow contracted a little as though he understood He made no reply Julie with her craving to be approved to say what pleased could not leave it there I wish I understood she said softly after a moment what or who it was that gave you these opinions Getting still no answer she must perforce meet the gray eyes bent upon her more expressively perhaps than their owner knew That you shall understand he said after a minute in a voice which was singularly deep and full whenever you choose to ask Julie shrank and drew back Very well she said trying to speak lightly I ll hold you to that Alack I had forgotten a letter I must write And she pretended to write it while Delafield buried himself in the newspapers XIII Julie s curiosity passing and perfunctory as it was concerning the persons and influences that had worked upon Jacob Delafield since his college days was felt in good earnest by not a few of Delafield s friends For he was a person rich in friends reserved as he generally was and crotchety as most of them thought him The mixture of self evident strength and manliness in his physiognomy with something delicate and evasive some hindering element of reflection or doubt was repeated in his character On the one side he was a robust healthy Etonian who could ride shoot and golf like the rest of his kind who used the terse slangy ways of speech of the ordinary Englishman who loved the land and its creatures and had a natural hatred for a poacher and on another he was a man haunted by dreams and spiritual voices a man for whom as he paced his tired horse homeward after a day s run there would rise on the grays and purples of the winter dusk far shining cities of God and visions of a better life for man He read much poetry and the New Testament spoke to him imperatively though in no orthodox or accustomed way Ruskin and the earlier work of Tolstoy then just beginning to take hold of the English mind had affected his thought and imagination as the generation before him had been affected by Carlyle Emerson and George Sand This present phase of his life however was the outcome of much that was turbulent and shapeless in his first youth He seemed to himself to have passed through Oxford under a kind of eclipse All that he could remember of two thirds of his time there was an immoderate amount of eating drinking and sleeping A heavy animal existence disturbed by moments of unhappiness and remorse or at best lightened by intervals and gleams of friendship with two or three men who tried to prod him out of his lethargy and cherished what appeared to himself in particular a strange and unreasonable liking for him Such to his own thinking had been his Oxford life up to the last year of his residence there Then when he was just making certain of an ignominious failure in the final schools he became more closely acquainted with one of the college tutors whose influence was to be the spark which should at last fire the clay This modest heroic and learned man was a paralyzed invalid owing to an accident in the prime of life He had lost the use of his lower limbs dead from the waist down Yet such was the strength of his moral and intellectual life that he had become since the catastrophe one of the chief forces of his college The invalid chair on which he wheeled himself recumbent from room to room and from which he gave his lectures was in the eyes of Oxford a symbol not of weakness but of touching and triumphant victory He gave himself no airs of resignation or of martyrdom He simply lived his life except during those crises of weakness or pain when his friends were shut out as though it were like any other life save only for what he made appear an insignificant physical limitation Scholarship college business or college sports politics and literature his mind at least was happy strenuous and at home in them all To have pitied him would have been a mere impertinence While in his own heart which never grieved over himself there were treasures of compassion for the weak the tempted and the unsuccessful which spent themselves in secret simple ways unknown to his most intimate friends This man s personality it was which like the branch of healing on bitter waters presently started in Jacob Delafield s nature obscure processes of growth and regeneration The originator of them knew little of what was going on He was Delafield s tutor for Greats in the ordinary college routine Delafield took essays to him and occasionally lingered to talk But they never became exactly intimate A few conversations of pith and moment a warm shake of the hand and a keen look of pleasure in the blue eyes of the recumbent giant when after one year of superhuman but belated effort Delafield succeeded in obtaining a second class a little note of farewell affectionate and regretful when Delafield left the university an occasional message through a common friend Delafield had little more than these to look back upon outside the discussions of historical or philosophical subjects which had entered into their relation as pupil and teacher And now the paralyzed tutor was dead leaving behind him a volume of papers on classical subjects the reputation of an admirable scholar and the fragrance of a dear and honored name His pupils had been many they counted among the most distinguished of England s youth and all of them owed him much Few people thought of Delafield when the list of them was recited and yet in truth Jacob s debt was greater than any for he owed this man nothing less than his soul No doubt the period at Oxford had been rather a period of obscure conflict than of mere idleness and degeneracy as it had seemed to be But it might easily have ended in physical and moral ruin and as it was thanks to Courtenay Delafield went out to the business of life a man singularly master of himself determined to live his own life for his own ends In the first place he was conscious like many other young men of his time of a strong repulsion towards the complexities and artificialities of modern society As in the forties a time of social stir was rising out of a time of stagnation Social settlements were not yet founded but the experiments which led to them were beginning Jacob looked at the life of London the clubs and the country houses the normal life of his class and turned from it in aversion He thought sometimes of emigrating in search of a new heaven and a new earth as men emigrated in the forties But his mother and sister were alone in the world his mother a somewhat helpless being his sister still very young and unmarried He could not reconcile it to his conscience to go very far from them He tried the bar amid an inner revolt that only increased with time And the bar implied London and the dinners and dances of London which for a man of his family the probable heir to the lands and moneys of the Chudleighs were naturally innumerable He was much courted in spite perhaps because of his oddities and it was plain to him that with only a small exercise of those will forces he felt accumulating within him most of the normal objects of ambition were within his grasp The English aristocratic class as we all know is no longer exclusive It mingles freely with the commoner world on apparently equal terms But all the while its personal and family cohesion is perhaps greater than ever The power of mere birth it seemed to Jacob was hardly less in the England newly possessed of household suffrage than in the England of Charles James Fox s youth though it worked through other channels And for the persons in command of this power a certain appareil de vie was necessary taken for granted So much income so many servants such and such habits these things imposed themselves Life became a soft and cushioned business with an infinity of layers between it and any hard reality a round pea in a silky pod And he meanwhile found himself hungry to throw aside these tamed and trite forms of existence and to penetrate to the harsh true simple things behind His imagination and his heart turned towards the primitive indispensable labors on which society rests the life of the husbandman the laborer the smith the woodman the builder he dreamed the old enchanted dream of living with nature of becoming the brother not of the few but of the many He was still reading in chambers however when his first cousin the Duke a melancholy semi invalid a widower with an only son tuberculous almost from his birth arrived from abroad Jacob was brought into new contact with him The Duke liked him and offered him the agency of his Essex property Jacob accepted partly that he might be quit of the law partly that he might be in the country and among the poor partly for reasons or ghosts of reasons unavowed even to himself The one terror that haunted his life was the terror of the dukedom This poor sickly lad the heir with whom he soon made warm friends and the silent morbid Duke with the face of Charles V at saint Just he became in a short time profoundly and pitifully attached to them It pleased him to serve them above all did it please him to do all he could and to incite others to do all they could to keep these two frail persons cheered and alive His own passionate dread lest he should suddenly find himself in their place gave a particular poignancy to the service he was always ready to render them of his best The Duke s confidence in him had increased rapidly Delafield was now about to take over the charge of another of the Duke s estates in the Midlands and much of the business connected with some important London property was also coming into his hands He had made himself a good man of business where another s interests were concerned and his dreams did no harm to the Duke s revenues He gave indeed a liberal direction to the whole policy of the estate and as he had said to Julie the Duke did not forbid experiments As to his own money he gave it away as wisely as he could which is perhaps not saying very much for the schemes and Quixotisms of a young man of eight and twenty At any rate he gave it away to his mother and sister first then to a variety of persons and causes Why should he save a penny of it He had some money of his own besides his income from the Duke It was disgusting that he should have so much and that it should be apparently so very easy for him to have indefinitely more if he wanted it He lived in a small cottage in the simplest plainest way compatible with his work and with the maintenance of two decently furnished rooms for any friend who might chance to visit him He read much and thought much But he was not a man of any commanding speculative or analytic ability It would have been hard for him to give any very clear or logical account of himself and his deepest beliefs Nevertheless with every year that passed he became a more remarkable character his will stronger his heart gentler In the village where he lived they wondered at him a good deal and often laughed at him But if he had left them certainly the children and the old people would have felt as though the sun had gone out In London he showed little or nothing of his peculiar ways and pursuits was in fact as far as anybody knew outside half a dozen friends just the ordinary well disposed young man engaged in a business that every one understood With Lady Henry his relations apart from his sympathy with Julie Le Breton had been for some time rather difficult She made gratitude hard for one of the most grateful of men When the circumstances of the Hubert Delafields had been much straitened after Lord Hubert s death Lady Henry had come to their aid and had in particular spent fifteen hundred pounds on Jacob s school and college education But there are those who can make a gift burn into the bones of those who receive it Jacob had now saved nearly the whole sum and was about to repay her Meanwhile his obligation his relationship and her age made it natural or rather imperative that he should be often in her house but when he was with her the touch of arrogant brutality in her nature especially towards servants and dependants roused him almost to fury She knew it and would often exercise her rough tongue merely for the pleasure of tormenting him No sooner therefore had he come to know the fragile distinguished creature whom Lady Henry had brought back with her one autumn as her companion than his sympathies were instantly excited first by the mere fact that she was Lady Henry s dependant and then by the confidence as to her sad story and strange position which she presently reposed in him and his cousin Evelyn On one or two occasions very early in his acquaintance with her he was a witness of some small tyranny of Lady Henry s towards her He saw the shrinking of the proud nature and the pain thrilled through his own nerves as though the lash had touched himself Presently it became a joy to him whenever he was in town to conspire with Evelyn Crowborough for her pleasure and relief It was the first time he had ever conspired and it gave him sometimes a slight shock to see how readily these two charming women lent themselves on occasion to devices that had the aspect of intrigue and involved a good deal of what in his own case he would have roundly dubbed lying And in truth if he had known they did not find him a convenient ally and he was by no means always in their confidence Once about six months after Julie s arrival in Bruton Street he met her on a spring morning crossing Kensington Gardens with the dogs She looked startlingly white and ill and when he spoke to her with eager sympathy her mouth quivered and her dark eyes clouded with tears The sight produced an extraordinary effect on a man large hearted and simple for whom women still moved in an atmosphere of romance His heart leaped within him as she let herself be talked with and comforted And when her delicate hand rested in his as they said good bye he was conscious of feelings wild tumultuous feelings to which in his walk homeward through the spring glades of the park he gave impetuous course Romantic indeed the position was for romance rests on contrast Jacob who knew Julie Le Breton s secret was thrilled or moved by the contrasts of her existence at every turn Her success and her subjection the place in Lady Henry s circle which Lady Henry had in the first instance herself forced her to take contrasted with the shifts and evasions the poor tortuous ways by which alas she must often escape Lady Henry s later jealousy her intellectual strength and her most feminine weaknesses these things stirred and kept up in Jacob a warm and passionate pity The more clearly he saw the specks in her glory the more vividly did she appear to him a princess in distress bound by physical or moral fetters not of her own making None of the well born well trained damsels who had been freely thrown across his path had so far beguiled him in the least Only this woman of doubtful birth and antecedents lonely sad and enslaved amid what people called her social triumphs stole into his heart beautified by what he chose to consider her misfortunes and made none the less attractive by the fact that as he pursued she retreated as he pressed she grew cold When indeed after their friendship had lasted about a year he proposed to her and she refused him his passion instead of cooling redoubled It never occurred to him to think that she had done a strange thing from the worldly point of view that would have involved an appreciation of himself as a prize in the marriage market he would have loathed to make But he was one of the men for whom resistance enhances the value of what they desire and secretly he said to himself Persevere When he was repelled or puzzled by certain aspects of her character he would say to himself It is because she is alone and miserable Women are not meant to be alone What soft helpless creatures they are even when intellectually they fly far ahead of us If she would but put her hand in mine I would so serve and worship her she would have no need for these strange things she does the doublings and ruses of the persecuted Thus the touches of falsity that repelled Wilfrid Bury were to Delafield s passion merely the stains of rough travel on a fair garment But she refused him and for another year he said no more Then as things got worse and worse for her he spoke again ambiguously a word or two thrown out to sound the waters Her manner of silencing him on this second occasion was not what it had been before His suspicions were aroused and a few days later he divined the Warkworth affair When Sir Wilfrid Bury spoke to him of the young officer s relations to Mademoiselle Le Breton Delafield s stiff defence of Julie s prerogatives in the matter masked the fact that he had just gone through a week of suffering wrestling his heart down in country lanes a week which had brought him to somewhat curious results In the first place as with Sir Wilfrid he stood up stoutly for her rights If she chose to attach herself to this man whose business was it to interfere If he was worthy and loved her Jacob himself would see fair play would be her friend and supporter But the scraps of gossip about Captain Warkworth which the Duchess who had disliked the man at first sight gathered from different quarters and confided to Jacob were often disquieting It was said that at Simla he had entrapped this little heiress and her obviously foolish and incapable mother by devices generally held to be discreditable and it had taken two angry guardians to warn him off What was the state of the case now no one exactly knew though it was shrewdly suspected that the engagement was only dormant The child was known to have been in love with him in two years more she would be of age her fortune was enormous and Warkworth was a poor and ambitious man There was also an ugly tale of a civilian s wife in a hill station referring to a date some years back but Delafield did not think it necessary to believe it As to his origins there again Delafield making cautious inquiries came across some unfavorable details confided to him by a man of Warkworth s own regiment His father had retired from the army immediately after the Mutiny broken in health and much straitened in means Himself belonging to a family of the poorer middle class he had married late a good woman not socially his equal and without fortune They settled in the Isle of Wight on his half pay and harassed by a good many debts Their two children Henry and Isabella were then growing up and the parents hopes were fixed upon their promising and good looking son With difficulty they sent him to Charterhouse and a crammer The boy coveted a crack regiment by dint of mustering all the money and all the interest they could they procured him his heart s desire He got unpardonably into debt the old people s resources were lessening not expanding and ultimately the poor father died broken down by the terror of bankruptcy for himself and disgrace for Henry The mother still survived in very straitened circumstances His sister said Delafield s informant married one of the big London tailors whom she met first on the Ryde pier I happen to know the facts for my father and I have been customers of his for years and one day hearing that I was in Warkworth s regiment he told me some stories of his brother in law in a pretty hostile tone His sister it appears has often financed him of late She must have done How else could he have got through Warkworth may be a fine showy fellow when there s fighting about In private life he s one of the most self indulgent dogs alive And yet he s ashamed of the sister and her husband and turns his back on them whenever he can Oh he s not a person of nice feeling is Warkworth but mark my words he ll be one of the most successful men in the army There was one side On the other was to be set the man s brilliant professional record his fine service in this recent campaign the bull dog defence of an isolated fort which insured the safety of most important communications contempt of danger thirst exposure the rescue of a wounded comrade from the glacis of the fort under a murderous fire facts all of them which had fired the public imagination and brought his name to the front No such acts as these could have been done by any mere self indulgent pretender Delafield reserved his judgment He set himself to watch In his inmost heart there was a strange assumption of the right to watch and if need be to act Julie s instinct had told her truly Delafield the individualist the fanatic for freedom he also had his instinct of tyranny She should not destroy herself the dear weak beloved woman He would prevent it Thus during these hours of transition Delafield thought much of Julie Julie on the other hand had no sooner said good night to him after the conversation described in the last chapter than she drove him from her thoughts one might have said with vehemence The Times of the following morning duly contained the announcement of the appointment of Captain Warkworth D S O of the Queen s Grays to the command of the military mission to Mokembe recently determined on by her Majesty s government The mission would proceed to Mokembe as soon as possible but of two officers who on the ground of especial knowledge would form part of it under Captain Warkworth s command one was at present in Canada and the other at the Cape It would therefore hardly be possible for the mission to start from the coast for the interior before the beginning of May In the same paper certain promotions and distinctions on account of the recent Mahsud campaign were reprinted from the Gazette Captain Henry Warkworth s brevet majority was among them The Times leader on the announcement pointed out that the mission would be concerned with important frontier questions still more with the revival of the prestige of England in regions where a supine government had allowed it to wither unaccountably Other powers had been playing a filching and encroaching game at the expense of the British lion in these parts and it was more than time that he should open his sleepy eyes upon what was going on As to the young officer who was to command the mission the great journal made a few civil though guarded remarks His record in the recent campaign was indeed highly distinguished still it could hardly be said that take it as a whole his history so far gave him a claim to promotion so important as that which he had now obtained Well now he had his chance English soldiers had a way of profiting by such chances The Times courteously gave him the benefit of the doubt prophesying that he would rise to the occasion and justify the choice of his superiors The Duchess looked over Julie s shoulder as she read Schemer she said as she dropped a kiss on the back of Julie s neck I hope you re satisfied The Times doesn t know what to make of it Julie put down the paper with a glowing cheek They ll soon know she said quietly Julie do you believe in him so much What does it matter what I think It is not I who have appointed him Not so sure laughed the Duchess As if he would have had a chance without you Whom did he know last November when you took him up Julie moved to and fro her hands behind her The tremor on her lip the light in her eye showed her sense of triumph What have I done she said laughing but push a few stones out of the way of merit Some of them were heavy said the Duchess making a little face Need I invite Lady Froswick any more Julie threw her arms about her Evelyn what a darling you ve been Now I ll never worry you again Oh for some people I would do ten times as much cried the Duchess But Julie I wish I knew why you think so well of this man I I don t always hear very nice things about him I dare say not said Julie flushing It is easy to hate success No come we re not as mean as that cried the Duchess I vow that all the heroes I ve ever known had a ripping time Julie she kissed her friend impulsively Julie don t like him too much I don t think he s good enough Good enough for what said Julie s bitter voice Make yourself easy about Captain Warkworth Evelyn but please understand anything is good enough for me Don t let your dear head be troubled about my affairs They are never serious and nothing counts except she added recklessly that I get a little amusement by the way Julie cried the Duchess as if Jacob Julie frowned and released herself then she laughed Nothing that one ever says about ordinary mortals applies to mister Delafield He is of course hors concours Julie It is you Evelyn who make me mechante I could be grateful and excellent friends with that young man in my own way The Duchess sighed and held her tongue with difficulty When the successful hero arrived that night for dinner he found a solitary lady in the drawing room Was this indeed Julie Le Breton this soft smiling vision in white He expected to have found a martyr pale and wan from the shock of the catastrophe which had befallen her and even amid the intoxication of his own great day he was not easy as to how she might have taken his behavior on the fatal night But here was some one all joy animation and indulgence a glorified Julie who trod on air Why Because good fortune had befallen her friend His heart smote him He had never seen her so touching so charming Since the incubus of Lady Henry s house and presence had been removed she seemed to have grown years younger A white muslin dress of her youth touched here and there by the Duchess s maid replaced the familiar black satin When Warkworth first saw her he paused unconsciously in surprise Then he advanced to meet her broadly smiling his blue eyes dancing You got my note this morning Yes she said demurely You were much too kind and much much too absurd I have done nothing Oh nothing of course Then after a moment Are you going to tie me to that fiction or am I to be allowed a little decent sincerity You know perfectly well that you have done it all There there give me your hand She gave it shrinking and he kissed it joyously Isn t it jolly he said with a school boy s delight as he released her hand I saw Lord M this morning He named the Prime Minister Very civil indeed Then the Commander in Chief and Montresor gave me half an hour It is all right They are giving me a capital staff Excellent fellows all of them Oh you ll see I shall pull it through I shall pull it through By George it is a chance And he stood radiant rubbing his hands over the blaze The Duchess came in accompanied by an elderly cousin of the Duke s a white haired black gowned spinster Miss Emily Lawrence one of those single women travelled cultivated and good that England produces in such abundance Well so you re going said the Duchess to Warkworth And I hear that we ought to think you a lucky man Indeed you ought and you must he said gayly If only the climate will behave itself The blackwater fever has a way of killing you in twenty four hours if it gets hold of you but short of that Oh you will be quite safe said the Duchess Let me introduce you to Miss Lawrence Emily this is Captain Warkworth The elderly lady gave a sudden start Then she quietly put on her spectacles and studied the young soldier with a pair of intelligent gray eyes Nothing could have been more agreeable than Warkworth at dinner Even the Duchess admitted as much He talked easily but not too much of the task before him told amusing tales of his sporting experience of years back in the same regions which were now to be the scene of his mission discussed the preparations he would have to make at Denga the coast town before starting on his five weeks journey to the interior drew the native porter and the native soldier not to their advantage and let fall by the way not a few wise or vivacious remarks as to the races resources and future of this illimitable and mysterious Africa this cavern of the unknown into which the waves of white invasion one upon another were now pressing fast and ceaselessly towards what goal only the gods knew A few other men were dining among them two officers from the staff of the Commander in Chief Warkworth much their junior treated them with a skilful deference but through the talk that prevailed his military competence and prestige appeared plainly enough even to the women His good opinion of himself was indeed sufficiently evident but there was no crude vainglory At any rate it was a vainglory of youth ability and good looks ratified by these budding honors thus fresh upon him and no one took it amiss When the gentlemen returned to the drawing room Warkworth and Julie once more found themselves together this time in the Duchess s little sitting room at the end of the long suite of rooms When do you go she asked him abruptly Not for about a month He mentioned the causes of delay That will bring you very late into the worst of the heat Her voice had a note of anxiety Oh we shall all be seasoned men And after the first few days we shall get into the uplands What do your home people say she asked him rather shyly She knew in truth little about them My mother Oh she will be greatly pleased I go down to the Isle of Wight for a day or two to see her to morrow But now dear lady that is enough of my wretched self You do you stay on here with the Duchess She told him of the house in Heribert Street He listened with attention Nothing could be better You will have a most distinguished little setting of your own and Lady Henry will repent at leisure You won t be lonely Oh no But her smile was linked with a sigh He came nearer to her You should never be lonely if I could help it he said in a low voice When people are nameless and kinless was her passionate reply in the same undertone as his they must be lonely He looked at her with eagerness She lay back in the firelight her beautiful brow and eyes softly illuminated He felt within him a sudden snapping of restraints Why why refuse what was so clearly within his grasp Love has many manners many entrances and many exits When will you tell me all that I want to know about you he said bending towards her with tender insistence There is so much I have to ask Oh some time she said hurriedly her pulses quickening Mine is not a story to be told on a great day like this He was silent a moment but his face spoke for him Our friendship has been a beautiful thing hasn t it he said at last in a voice of emotion Look here He thrust his hand into his breast pocket and half withdrew it Do you see where I carry your letters You shouldn t they are not worthy How charming you are in that dress in that light I shall always see you as you are to night A silence Excitement mounted in their veins Suddenly he stooped and kissed her hands They looked into each other s eyes and the seconds passed like hours Presently in the nearer drawing room there was a sound of approaching voices and they moved apart Julie Emily Lawrence is going said the Duchess s voice pitched in what seemed to Julie a strange and haughty note Captain Warkworth Miss Lawrence thinks that you and she have common friends Lady Blanche Moffatt and her daughter Captain Warkworth murmured some conventionality and passed into the next drawing room with Miss Lawrence Julie rose to her feet the color dying out of her face her passionate eyes on the Duchess who stood facing her friend guiltily pale and ready to cry XIV On the morning following these events Warkworth went down to the Isle of Wight to see his mother On the journey he thought much of Julie They had parted awkwardly the night before The evening which had promised so well had after all lacked finish and point What on earth had that tiresome Miss Lawrence wanted with him They had talked of Simla and the Moffatts The conversation had gone in spurts she looking at him every now and then with eyes that seemed to say more than her words All that she had actually said was perfectly insignificant and trivial Yet there was something curious in her manner and when the time came for him to take his departure she had bade him a frosty little farewell She had described herself once or twice as a great friend of Lady Blanche Moffatt Was it possible But if Lady Blanche whose habits of sentimental indiscretion were ingrained had gossiped to this lady what then Why should he be frowned on by Miss Lawrence or anybody else That malicious talk at Simla had soon exhausted itself His present appointment was a triumphant answer to it all His slanderers including Aileen s ridiculous guardians could only look foolish if they pursued the matter any further What trap was there what mesalliance A successful soldier was good enough for anybody Look at the first Lord Clyde and scores besides The Duchess too Why had she treated him so well at first and so cavalierly after dinner Her manners were really too uncertain What was the matter and why did she dislike him He pondered over it a good deal and with much soreness of spirit Like many men capable of very selfish or very cruel conduct he was extremely sensitive and took keen notice of the fact that a person liked or disliked him If the Duchess disliked him it could not be merely on account of the Simla story even though the old maid might conceivably have given her a jaundiced account The Duchess knew nothing of Aileen and was little influenced so far as he had observed her by considerations of abstract justice or propriety affecting persons whom she had never seen No she was Julie s friend the little wilful lady and it was for Julie she ruffled her feathers like an angry dove So his thoughts had come back to Julie though indeed it seemed to him that they were never far from her As he looked absently from the train windows on the flying landscape Julie s image hovered between him and it a magic sun flooding soul and senses with warmth How unconsciously how strangely his feelings had changed towards her That coolness of temper and nerve he had been able to preserve towards her for so long was indeed breaking down He recognized the danger and wondered where it would lead him What a fascinating sympathetic creature and by George what she had done for him Aileen Aileen was a little sylph a pretty child angel white winged and innocent who lived in a circle of convent thoughts knowing nothing of the world and had fallen in love with him as the first man who had ever made love to her But this intelligent full blooded woman who could understand at a word or a half word who had a knowledge of affairs which many a high placed man might envy with whom one never had a dull moment this courted distinguished Julie Le Breton his mind swelled with half guilty pride at the thought that for six months he had absorbed all her energies that a word from him could make her smile or sigh that he could force her to look at him with eyes so melting and so troubled as those with which she had given him her hands her slim beautiful hands that night in Grosvenor Square How freedom became her Dependency had dropped from her like a cast off cloak and beside her fresh melancholy charm the airs and graces of a child of fashion and privilege like the little Duchess appeared almost cheap and trivial Poor Julie No doubt some social struggle was before her Lady Henry was strong after all in this London world and the solider and stupider people who get their way in the end were not she thought likely to side with Lady Henry s companion in a quarrel where the facts of the story were unquestionably at first sight damaging to Miss Le Breton Julie would have her hours of bitterness and humiliation and she would conquer by boldness if she conquered at all by originality by determining to live her own life That would preserve for her the small circle if it lost her the large world And the small circle was what she lived for what she ought at any rate to live for It was not likely she would marry Why should she desire it From any blundering tragedy a woman of so acute a brain would of course know how to protect herself But within the limits of her life why should she refuse herself happiness intimacy love His heart beat fast his thoughts were in a whirl But the train was nearing Portsmouth and with an effort he recalled his mind to the meeting with his mother which was then close upon him He spent nearly a week in the little cottage at Sea View and missus Warkworth got far more pleasure than usual poor lady out of his visit She was a thin plain woman not devoid of either ability or character But life had gone hardly with her and since her husband s death what had been reserve had become melancholy She had always been afraid of her only son since they had sent him to Charterhouse and he had become so much finer than his parents She knew that he must consider her a very ignorant and narrow minded person when he was with her she was humiliated in her own eyes though as soon as he was gone she resumed what was in truth a leading place among her own small circle She loved him and was proud of him yet at the bottom of her heart she had never absolved him from his father s death But for his extravagance and the misfortunes he had brought upon them her old general would be alive still pottering about in the spring sunshine spudding the daisies from the turf or smoking his pipe beneath the thickening trees Silently her heart still yearned and hungered for the husband of her youth his son did not replace him Nevertheless when he came down to her with this halo of glory upon him and smoked up and down her small garden through the mild spring days gossiping to her of all the great things that had befallen him repeating to her word for word his conversation with the Prime Minister and his interview with the Commander in Chief or making her read all the letters of congratulation he had received her mother s heart thawed within her as it had not done for long Her ears told her that he was still vain and a boaster her memory held the indelible records of his past selfishness but as he walked beside her his fair hair blown back from his handsome brow and eyes that were so much younger than the rest of the face his figure as spare and boyish now as when he had worn the colors of the Charterhouse eleven she said to herself in that inward and unsuspected colloquy she was always holding with her own heart about him that if his father could have seen him now he would have forgiven him everything According to her secret Evangelical faith God deals with every soul he has created through joy or sorrow through good or evil fortune He had dealt with herself through anguish and loss Henry it seemed was to be moulded through prosperity His good fortune was already making a better man of him Certainly he was more affectionate and thoughtful than before He would have liked to give her money of which he seemed to have an unusual store but she bade him keep what he had for his own needs Her own little bit of money saved from the wreck of their fortunes was enough for her Then he went into Ryde and brought her back a Shetland shawl and a new table cloth for her little sitting room which she accepted with a warmer kiss than she had given him for years He left her on a bright windy morning which flecked the blue Solent with foam and sent the clouds racing to westward She walked back along the sands thinking anxiously of the African climate and the desert hard ships he was going to face And she wondered what significance there might be in the fact that he had written twice during his stay with her to a Miss Le Breton whose name nevertheless he had not mentioned in their conversations Well he would marry soon she supposed and marry well in circles out of her ken With the common prejudice of the English middle class she hoped that if this Miss Le Breton were his choice she might be only French in name and not in blood Meanwhile Warkworth sped up to London in high spirits enjoying the comforts of a good conscience He drove first to his club where a pile of letters awaited him some letters of congratulation others concerned with the business of his mission He enjoyed the first noticing jealously who had and who had not written to him then he applied himself to the second His mind worked vigorously and well he wrote his replies in a manner that satisfied him Then throwing himself into a chair with a cigar he gave himself up to the close and shrewd planning of the preparations necessary for his five weeks march or to the consideration of two or three alternative lines of action which would open before him as soon as he should find himself within the boundaries of Mokembe Some five years before the government of the day had sent a small expedition to this Debatable Land which had failed disastrously both from the diplomatic and the military points of view He went backward and forward to the shelves of the fine Service library which surrounded him taking down the books and reports which concerned this expedition He buried himself in them for an hour then threw them aside with contempt What blunders and short sight everywhere The general public might well talk of the stupidity of English officers And blunders so easily avoided too It was sickening He felt within himself a fulness of energy and intelligence a perspicacity of brain which judged mistakes of this kind unpardonable As he was replacing some of the books he had been using in the shelves the club began to fill up with men coming in to lunch A great many congratulated him and a certain number who of old had hardly professed to know him greeted him with cordiality He found himself caught in a series of short but flattering conversations in which he bore himself well neither over discreet nor too elate I declare that fellow s improved said one man who might certainly have counted as Warkworth s enemy the week before to his companion at table The government s been beastly remiss so far Hope he ll pull it off Ripping chance anyway Though what they gave it to him for goodness knows There were a dozen fellows at least did as well as he in the Mahsud business And the Staff College man had a thousand times more claim Nevertheless Warkworth felt the general opinion friendly a little surprised no doubt but showing that readiness to believe in the man coming to the front which belongs much more to the generous than to the calculating side of the English character Insensibly his mental and moral stature rose He exchanged a few words on his way out with one of the most distinguished members of the club a man of European reputation whom he had seen the week before in the Commander in Chief s room at the War Office The great man spoke to him with marked friendliness and Warkworth walked on air as he went his way Potentially he felt himself the great man s equal the gates of life seemed to be opening before him And with the rise of fortune came a rush of magnanimous resolution No more shady episodes no more mean devices no more gambling and no more debt Major Warkworth s sheet was clean and it should remain so A man of his prospects must run straight He felt himself at peace with all the world By the way just time to jump into a cab and get to Park Crescent in time for his sister s luncheon His last interview with his brother in law had not been agreeable But now he felt for the check book in his pocket he was in a position to repay at least half the last sum of money which Bella had lent him He would go and give it her now and report news of the mother And if the two chicks were there why he had a free hour and he would take them to the Zoo he vowed he would give them something pleasant to remember their uncle by And a couple of hours later a handsome soldierly man might have been seen in the lion house at the Zoo leading a plump little girl by either hand Rose and Katie Mullins enjoyed a golden time and started a wholly new adoration for the uncle who had so far taken small notice of them and was associated in their shrewd childish minds rather with tempests at home than buns abroad But this time buns biscuits hansom drives and elephant rides were showered upon them by an uncle who seemed to make no account of money while his gracious and captivating airs set their little hearts beating in a common devotion Now go home go home little beggars said that golden gentleman as he packed them into a hansom and stood on the step to accept a wet kiss on his mustache from each pink mouth Tell your mother all about it and don t forget your uncle Harry There s a shilling for each of you Don t you spend it on sweets You re quite fat enough already Good bye That s the hardest work I ve done for many a long day he said to himself with a sigh of relief as the hansom drove away I sha n t turn nurse maid when other trades fail But they re nice little kids all the same Now then Cox s and the City he ran over the list of his engagements for the afternoon and by five o clock shall I find my fair lady at home and established Where on earth is Heribert Street He solved the question for a few minutes after five he was on Miss Le Breton s doorstep A quaint little house and a strange parlor maid For the door was opened to him by a large eyed sickly child who looked at him with the bewilderment of one trying to follow out instructions still strange to her Illustration HE ENTERED UPON A MERRY SCENE Yes sir Miss Le Breton is in the drawing room she said in a sweet deliberate voice with a foreign accent and she led the way through the hall Poor little soul what a twisted back and what a limp She looked about fourteen but was probably older Where had Julie discovered her Warkworth looked round him at the little hall with its relics of country house sports and amusements his eye travelled through an open door to the little dining room and the Russell pastels of Lady Mary s parents as children hanging on the wall The character of the little dwelling impressed itself at once Smiling he acknowledged its congruity with Julie Here was a lady who fell on her feet The child leading him opened the door to the left Please walk in sir she said shyly and stood aside As the door opened Warkworth was conscious of a noise of tongues So Julie was not alone He prepared his manner accordingly He entered upon a merry scene Jacob Delafield was standing on a chair hanging a picture while doctor Meredith and Julie on either side directed or criticised the operation Meredith carried picture cord and scissors Julie the hammer and nails Meredith was expressing the profoundest disbelief in Jacob s practical capacities Jacob was defending himself hotly and Julie laughed at both Towards the other end of the room stood the tea table between the fire and an open window Lord Lackington sat beside it smiling to himself and stroking a Persian kitten Through the open window the twinkling buds on the lilacs in the Cureton House garden shone in the still lingering sun A recent shower had left behind it odors of earth and grass Even in this London air they spoke of the spring the spring which already in happier lands was drawing veils of peach and cherry blossom over the red Sienese earth or the green terraces of Como The fire crackled in the grate The pretty old fashioned room was fragrant with hyacinth and narcissus Julie s books lay on the tables Julie s hand and taste were already to be felt everywhere And Lord Lackington with the kitten beside the fire gave the last touch of home and domesticity So I find you established said Warkworth smiling to the lady with the nails while Delafield nodded to him from the top of the steps and Meredith ceased to chatter I haven t a hand I fear said Julie Will you have some tea Ah Leonie tu vas en faire de nouveau n est ce pas pour ce monsieur A little woman in black with a shawl over her shoulders had just glided into the room She had a small wrinkled face bright eyes and a much flattened nose Tout de suite monsieur she said quickly and disappeared with the teapot Warkworth guessed of course that she was Madame Bornier the foster sister the Propriety of this menage Can t I help he said to Julie with a look at Delafield It s just done she said coldly handing a nail to Delafield Just a trifle more to the right Ecco Perfection Oh you spoil him said Meredith And not one word of praise for me What have you done she said laughing Tangled the cord that s all Warkworth turned away His face so radiant as he entered had settled into sharp sudden lines What was the meaning of this voice this manner He remembered that to his three letters he had received no word of reply But he had interpreted that to mean that she was in the throes of moving and could find no time to write As he neared the tea table Lord Lackington looked up He greeted the new comer with the absent stateliness he generally put on when his mind was in a state of confusion as to a person s identity Well so they re sending you to D There ll be a row there before long Wish you joy of the missionaries No not D said Warkworth smiling Nothing so amusing Mokembe s my destination Oh Mokembe said Lord Lackington a little abashed That s where Cecil Ray Lord R s second son was killed last year lion hunting No it was of fever that he died By the way a vile climate In the plains yes said Warkworth seating himself As to the uplands I understand they are to be the Switzerland of Africa Lord Lackington did not appear to listen Are you a homoeopath he said suddenly rising to his full and immense stature and looking down with eagerness on Warkworth No Why Because it s your only chance for those parts If Cecil Ray had had their medicines with him he d be alive now Look here when do you start The speaker took out his note book In rather less than a month I start for Denga All right I ll send you a medicine case from Epps If you re ill take em You re very good Not at all It s my hobby one of the last A broad boyish smile flashed over the handsome old face Look at me I m seventy five and I can tire out my own grandsons at riding and shooting That comes of avoiding all allopathic messes like the devil But the allopaths are such mean fellows they filch all our ideas The old man was off Warkworth submitted to five minutes tirade stealing a glance sometimes at the group of Julie Meredith and Delafield in the farther window at the happy ease and fun that seemed to prevail in it He fiercely felt himself shut out and trampled on Suddenly Lord Lackington pulled up his instinct for declamation qualified by an equally instinctive dread of boring or being bored What did you think of Montresor s statement he said abruptly referring to a batch of army reforms that Montresor the week before had endeavored to recommend to a sceptical House of Commons All very well as far as it goes said Warkworth with a shrug Precisely We English want an army and a navy we don t like it when those fellows on the Continent swagger in our faces and yet we won t pay either for the ships or the men However now that they ve done away with purchase Gad I could fight them in the streets for the way in which they ve done it now that they ve turned the army into an examination shop tempered with jobbery whatever we do we shall go to the deuce So it don t matter You were against the abolition I was sir with Wellington and Raglan and everybody else of any account And as for the violence the disgraceful violence with which it was carried Oh no no said Warkworth laughing It was the Lords who behaved abominably and it ll do a deal of good Lord Lackington s eyes flashed I ve had a long life he said pugnaciously I began as a middy in the American war of eighteen twelve that nobody remembers now Then I left the sea for the army I knocked about the world I commanded a brigade in the Crimea Who doesn t remember that said Warkworth smiling The old man acknowledged the homage by a slight inclination of his handsome head And you may take my word for it that this new system will not give you men worth a tenth part of those fellows who bought and bribed their way in under the old The philosophers may like it or lump it but so it is Warkworth dissented strongly He was a good deal of a politician himself a new man and on the side of new men Lord Lackington warmed to the fight and Warkworth with bitterness in his heart because of that group opposite was nothing loath to meet him But presently he found the talk taking a turn that astonished him He had entered upon a drawing room discussion of a subject which had after all been settled if only by what the Tories were pleased to call the coup d etat of the Royal Warrant and no longer excited the passions of a few years back What he had really drawn upon himself was a hand to hand wrestle with a man who had no sooner provoked contradiction than he resented it with all his force and with a determination to crush the contradictor Warkworth fought well but with a growing amazement at the tone and manner of his opponent The old man s eyes darted war flames under his finely arched brows He regarded the younger with a more and more hostile even malicious air his arguments grew personal offensive his shafts were many and barbed till at last Warkworth felt his face burning and his temper giving way What are you talking about said Julie Le Breton at last rising and coming towards them Lord Lackington broke off suddenly and threw himself into his chair Warkworth rose from his We had better have been handing nails he said but you wouldn t give us any work Then as Meredith and Delafield approached he seized the opportunity of saying in a low voice Am I not to have a word She turned with composure though it seemed to him she was very pale Have you just come back from the Isle of Wight This morning He looked her in the eyes You got my letters Yes but I have had no time for writing I hope you found your mother well Very well thank you You have been hard at work Yes but the Duchess and mister Delafield have made it all easy And so on a few more insignificant questions and answers I must go said Delafield coming up to them unless there is any more work for me to do Good bye Major I congratulate you They have given you a fine piece of work Warkworth made a little bow half ironical Confound the fellow s grave and lordly ways He did not want his congratulations He lingered a little sorely full of rage yet not knowing how to go Lord Lackington s eyes ceased to blaze and the kitten ventured once more to climb upon his knee Meredith too found a comfortable arm chair and presently tried to beguile the kitten from his neighbor Julie sat erect between them very silent her thin white hands on her lap her head drooped a little her eyes carefully restrained from meeting Warkworth s He meanwhile leaned against the mantel piece irresolute Meredith it was clear made himself quite happy and at home in the little drawing room The lame child came in and took a stool beside him He stroked her head and talked nonsense to her in the intervals of holding forth to Julie on the changes necessary in some proofs of his which he had brought back Lord Lackington now quite himself again went back to dreams smiling over them and quite unaware that the kitten had been slyly ravished from him The little woman in black sat knitting in the background It was all curiously intimate and domestic only Warkworth had no part in it Good bye Miss Le Breton he said at last hardly knowing his own voice I am dining out She rose and gave him her hand But it dropped from his like a thing dead and cold He went out in a sudden suffocation of rage and pain and as he walked in a blind haste to Cureton Street he still saw her standing in the old fashioned scented room so coldly graceful with those proud deep eyes When he had gone Julie moved to the window and looked out into the gathering dusk It seemed to her as if those in the room must hear the beating of her miserable heart When she rejoined her companions doctor Meredith had already risen and was stuffing various letters and papers into his pockets with a view to departure Going said Lord Lackington You shall see the last of me too Mademoiselle Julie And he stood up But she flushing looked at him with a wistful smile Won t you stay a few minutes You promised to advise me about Therese s drawings By all means Lord Lackington sat down again The lame child it appeared had some artistic talent which Miss Le Breton wished to cultivate Meredith suddenly found his coat and hat and with a queer look at Julie departed in a hurry Therese darling said Julie will you go up stairs please and fetch me that book from my room that has your little drawings inside it The child limped away on her errand In spite of her lameness she moved with wonderful lightness and swiftness and she was back again quickly with a calf bound book in her hand Leonie said Julie in a low voice to Madame Bornier The little woman looked up startled nodded rolled up her knitting in a moment and was gone Take the book to his lordship Therese she said and then instead of moving with the child she again walked to the window and leaning her head against it looked out The hand hanging against her dress trembled violently What did you want me to look at my dear said Lord Lackington taking the book in his hand and putting on his glasses But the child was puzzled and did not know She gazed at him silently with her sweet docile look Run away Therese and find mother said Julie from the window The child sped away and closed the door behind her Lord Lackington adjusted his glasses and opened the book Two or three slips of paper with drawings upon them fluttered out and fell on the table beneath Suddenly there was a cry Julie turned round her lips parted Lord Lackington walked up to her Tell me what this means he said peremptorily How did you come by it It was a volume of George Sand He pointed trembling to the name and date on the fly leaf Rose Delaney eighteen forty two It is mine she said softly dropping her eyes But how how in God s name did you come by it My mother left it to me with all her other few books and possessions There was a pause Lord Lackington came closer Who was your mother he said huskily The words in answer were hardly audible Julie stood before him like a culprit her beautiful head humbly bowed Lord Lackington dropped the book and stood bewildered Rose s child he said Rose s child Then approaching her he placed his hand on her arm Let me look at you he commanded Julie raised her eyes to him and at the same time dumbly held out to him a miniature she had been keeping hidden in her hand It was one of the miniatures from the locked triptych He took it looked from the pictured to the living face then turning away with a groan he covered his face with his hands and fell again into the chair from which he had risen Julie hurried to him Her own eyes were wet with tears After a moment s hesitation she knelt down beside him I ought to ask your pardon for not having told you before she murmured It was some time before Lord Lackington looked up When at last his hands dropped the face they uncovered was very white and old So you he said almost in a whisper are the child she wrote to me about before she died Julie made a sign of assent How old are you Twenty nine She was thirty two when I saw her last There was a silence Julie lifted one of his hands and kissed it But he took no notice You know that I was going to her that I should have reached her in time the words seemed wrung from him but that I was myself dangerously ill I know I remember it all Did she speak of me Not often She was very reserved you remember But not long before she died she seemed half asleep I heard her say Papa Blanche and she smiled Lord Lackington s face contracted and the slow tears of old age stood in his eyes You are like her in some ways he said brusquely as though to cover his emotion but not very like her She always thought I was like you A cloud came over Lord Lackington s face Julie rose from her knees and sat beside him He lost himself a few moments amid the painful ghosts of memory Then turning to her abruptly he said You have wondered I dare say why I was so hard why for seventeen years I cast her off Yes often You could have come to see us without anybody knowing Mother loved you very much Her voice was low and sad Lord Lackington rose fidgeted restlessly with some of the small ornaments on the mantel piece and at last turned to her She brought dishonor he said in the same stifled voice and the women of our family have always been stainless But that I could have forgiven After a time I should have resumed relations private relations with her But it was your father who stood in the way I was then I am now you saw me with that young fellow just now quarrelsome and hot tempered It is my nature He drew himself up obstinately I can t help it I take great pains to inform myself then I cling to my opinions tenaciously and in argument my temper gets the better of me Your father too was hot tempered He came with my consent once to see me after your mother had left her husband to try and bring about some arrangement between us It was the Chartist time He was a Radical a Socialist of the most extreme views In the course of our conversation something was said that excited him He went off at score I became enraged and met him with equal violence We had a furious argument which ended in each insulting the other past forgiveness We parted enemies for life I never could bring myself to see him afterwards nor to run the risk of seeing him Your mother took his side and espoused his opinions while he lived After his death I suppose she was too proud and sore to write to me I wrote to her once it was not the letter it might have been She did not reply till she felt herself dying That is the explanation of what no doubt must seem strange to you Illustration FOR MY ROSE S CHILD HE SAID GENTLY He turned to her almost pleadingly A deep flush had replaced the pallor of his first emotion as though in the presence of these primal realities of love death and sorrow which she had recalled to him his old quarrel on a political difference cut but a miserable figure No she said sadly not very strange I understood my father my dear father she added with soft deliberate tenderness Lord Lackington was silent a little then he threw her a sudden penetrating look You have been in London three years You ought to have told me before It was Julie s turn to color Lady Henry bound me to secrecy Lady Henry did wrong he said with emphasis Then he asked jealously with a touch of his natural irascibility Who else has been in the secret Four people at most the Duchess first of all I couldn t help it she pleaded I was so unhappy with Lady Henry You should have come to me It was my right But she dropped her head you had made it a condition that I should not trouble you He was silenced and once more he leaned against the mantel piece and hid his face from her till by a secret impulse both moved She rose and approached him he laid his hands on her arms With his persistent instinct for the lovely or romantic he perceived with sudden pleasure the grave poetic beauty of her face and delicate form Emotion had softened away all that was harsh a quivering charm hovered over the features With a strange pride and a sense of mystery he recognized his daughter and his race For my Rose s child he said gently and stooping he kissed her on the brow She broke out into weeping leaning against his shoulder while the old man comforted and soothed her XV After the long conversation between herself and Lord Lackington which followed on the momentous confession of her identity Julie spent a restless and weary evening which passed into a restless and weary night Was she oppressed by this stirring of old sorrows haunted afresh by her parents fate Ah Lord Lackington had no sooner left her than she sank motionless into her chair and with the tears excited by the memories of her mother still in her eyes she gave herself up to a desperate and sombre brooding of which Warkworth s visit of the afternoon was in truth the sole cause the sole subject Why had she received him so She had gone too far much too far But somehow she had not been able to bear it that buoyant confident air that certainty of his welcome No She would show him that she was not his chattel to be taken or left on his own terms The careless good humor of his blue eyes was too much after those days she had passed through He apparently to judge from his letters to her from the Isle of Wight had been conscious of no crisis whatever Yet he must have seen from the little Duchess s manner as she bade farewell to him that night at Crowborough House that something was wrong He must have realized that Miss Lawrence was an intimate friend of the Moffatts and that Or was he really so foolish as to suppose that his quasi engagement to this little heiress and the encouragement given him in defiance of the girl s guardians by her silly and indiscreet mother were still hidden and secret matters that he could still conceal them from the world and deny them to Julie Her whole nature was sore yet from her wrestle with the Duchess on that miserable evening Julie I can t help it I know it s impertinent but Julie darling do listen What business has that man to make love to you as he does when all the time Yes he does make love to you he does Freddie had a most ill natured letter from Lady Henry this morning Of course he had and of course she ll write that kind of letter to as many people as she can And it wouldn t matter a bit if But you see you have been moving heaven and earth for him And now his manner to you while the sudden flush burned her cheek Julie wondered whether by chance the Duchess had seen anything of the yielded hands and the kiss and that ill luck of his being the first to arrive last night at Lady Henry s Oh Julie he s a wretch he is Of course he is in love with you That s natural enough But all the time listen that nice woman told me the whole story he s writing regularly to that little girl She and her mother in spite of the guardians regard it as an engagement signed and sealed and all his friends believe he s quite determined to marry her because of the money You may think me an odious little meddler Julie if you like but I vow I could stab him to the heart with all the pleasure in life And neither the annoyance nor the dignity nor the ridicule of the supposed victim not Julie s angry eyes nor all her mocking words from tremulous lips had availed in the least to silence the tumult of alarmed affection in the Duchess s breast Her Julie had been flouted and trifled with and if she was so blind so infatuated as not to see it she should at least be driven to realize what other people felt about it So she had her say and Julie had been forced willy nilly upon discussion and self defence nay upon a promise also Pale and stiffly erect yet determined all the same to treat it as a laughing matter she had vouchsafed the Duchess some kind of assurance that she would for the future observe a more cautious behavior towards Warkworth He is my friend and whatever any one may say he shall remain so she had said with a smiling stubbornness which hid something before which the little Duchess shrank But of course if I can do anything to please you Evelyn you know I like to please you But she had never meant she had never promised to forswear his society to ban him from the new house In truth she would rather have left home and friends and prospects at one stroke rather than have pledged herself to anything of the sort Evelyn should never bind her to that Then during his days of absence she had passed through wave after wave of feeling while all the time to the outer eye she was occupied with nothing but the settlement into Lady Mary s strange little house She washed dusted placed chairs and tables And meanwhile a wild expectancy of his first letter possessed her Surely there would be some anxiety in it some fear some disclosure of himself and of the struggle in his mind between interest and love Nothing of the kind His first letter was the letter of one sure of his correspondent sure of his reception and of his ground a happy and intimate certainty shone through its phrases it was the letter almost of a lover whose doubts are over The effect of it was to raise a tempest sharp and obscure in Julie s mind The contrast between the pose of the letter and the sly reality behind bred a sudden anguish of jealousy concerned not so much with Warkworth as with this little unknown creature who without any effort any desert by the mere virtue of money and blood sat waiting in arrogant expectancy till what she desired should come to her How was it possible to feel any compunction towards her Julie felt none As to the rest of Miss Lawrence s gossip that Warkworth was supposed to have behaved badly to have led the pretty child to compromise herself with him at Simla in ways which Simla society regarded as inadmissible and bad form that the guardians had angrily intervened and that he was under a promise habitually broken by the connivance of the girl s mother not to see or correspond with the heiress till she was twenty one in other words for the next two years what did these things matter to her Had she ever supposed that Warkworth in regard to money or his career was influenced by any other than the ordinary worldly motives She knew very well that he was neither saint nor ascetic These details or accusations did not properly speaking concern her at all She had divined and accepted his character in all its average human selfishness and faultiness long ago She loved him passionately in spite of it perhaps if the truth were known because of it As for the marrying or rather the courting for money that excited in her no repulsion whatever Julie in her own way was a great romantic but owing to the economic notions of marriage especially the whole conception of the dot prevailing in the French or Belgian minds amid whom she had passed her later girlhood she never dreamed for a moment of blaming Warkworth for placing money foremost in his plans of matrimony She resembled one of the famous amoureuses of the eighteenth century who in writing to the man she loved but could not marry advises him to take a wife to mend his fortunes and proposes to him various tempting morsels une jeune personne sixteen with neither father nor mother only a brother They will give her on her marriage thirteen thousand francs a year and the aunt will be quite content to keep her and look after her for some time And if that won t do I know a man who would be only too happy to have you for a son in law but his daughter is only eleven she is an only child however and she will be very rich You know mon ami I desire your happiness above all things how to procure it there lies the chief interest of my life This notion of things more or less disguised was to Julie customary and familiar and it was no more incompatible in her with the notions and standards of high sentiment such as she might be supposed to have derived from her parents than it is in the Latin races generally No doubt it had been mingled in her especially since her settlement in Lady Henry s house with the more English idea of falling in love the idea which puts personal choice first in marriage and makes the matter of dowry subordinate to that mysterious election and affinity which the Englishman calls love Certainly during the winter Julie had hoped to lead Warkworth to marry her As a poor man of course he must have money But her secret feeling had been that her place in society her influence with important people had a money value and that he would perceive this Well she had been a mere trusting fool and he had deceived her There was his crime not in seeking money and trusting to money He had told her falsehoods and misled her He was doing it still His letter implied that he loved her Possibly It implied to Julie s ear still more plainly that he stood tacitly and resolutely by Aileen Moffatt and her money and that all he was prepared to offer to the dear friend of his heart was a more or less ambiguous relation lasting over two years perhaps till his engagement might be announced A dumb and bitter anger mounted within her She recalled the manner in which he had evaded her first questions and her opinion became very much that of the Duchess She had indeed been mocked and treated like a child So she sent no answer to his first letter and when his second came she forbade herself to open it It lay there on her writing table At night she transferred it to the table beside her bed and early in the spring dawn her groping fingers drew it trembling towards her and slipped it under her pillow By the time the full morning had come she had opened it read and reread it had bathed it indeed with her tears But her anger persisted and when Warkworth appeared on her threshold it flamed into sudden expression She would make him realize her friends her powerful friends above all she would make him realize Delafield Well now it was done She had repelled her lover She had shown herself particularly soft and gracious to Delafield Warkworth now would break with her might perhaps be glad of the chance to return safely and without further risks to his heiress She sat on in the dark thinking over every word every look Presently Therese stole in Mademoiselle le souper sera bientot pret Julie rose wearily and the child slipped a thin hand into hers J aime tant ce vieux monsieur she said softly Je l aime tant Julie started Her thoughts had wandered far indeed from Lord Lackington As she went up stairs to her little room her heart reproached her In their interview the old man had shown great sweetness of feeling a delicate and remorseful tenderness hardly to have been looked for in a being so fantastic and self willed The shock of their conversation had deepened the lines in a face upon which age had at last begun to make those marks which are not another beauty but the end of beauty When she had opened the door for him in the dusk Julie had longed indeed to go with him and soothe his solitary evening His unmarried son William lived with him intermittently but his wife was dead Lady Blanche seldom came to town and for the most part he lived alone in the fine house in saint James s Square of which she had heard her mother talk He liked her had liked her from the first How natural that she should tend and brighten his old age how natural and how impossible He was not the man to brave the difficulties and discomforts inseparable from the sudden appearance of an illegitimate granddaughter in his household and if he had been Julie in her fierce new born independence would have shrunk from such a step But she had been drawn to him her heart had yearned to her kindred No neither love nor kindred were for her As she entered the little bare room over the doorway which she had begun to fill with books and papers and all the signs of the literary trade she miserably bid herself be content with what was easily and certainly within her grasp The world was pleased to say that she had a remarkable social talent Let her give her mind to the fight with Lady Henry and prove whether after all the salon could not be acclimatized on English soil She had the literary instinct and aptitude and she must earn money She looked at her half written article and sighed to her books to save her That evening Therese who adored her watched her with a wistful and stealthy affection Her idol was strangely sad and pale But she asked no questions All she could do was to hover about mademoiselle with soft flattering services till mademoiselle went to bed and then to lie awake herself quietly waiting till all sounds in the room opposite had died away and she might comfort her dumb and timid devotion with the hope that Julie slept Sleep however or no sleep Julie was up early next day Before the post arrived she was already dressed and on the point of descending to the morning coffee which in the old frugal Bruges fashion she and Leonie and the child took in the kitchen together Lady Henry s opinion of her as a soft and luxurious person dependent on dainty living was in truth absurdly far from the mark After those years of rich food and many servants in Lady Henry s household she had resumed the penurious Belgian ways at once without effort indeed with alacrity In the morning she helped Leonie and Therese with the housework Her quick fingers washed and rubbed and dusted In less than a week she knew every glass and cup in Cousin Mary Leicester s well filled china cupboard and she and Therese between them kept the two sitting rooms spotless She who had at once made friends and tools of Lady Henry s servants disdained so it appeared to be served beyond what was absolutely necessary in her own house A charwoman indeed came in the morning for the roughest work but by ten o clock she was gone and Julie Madame Bornier and the child remained in undisputed possession Little flat nosed silent Madame Bornier bought and brought in all they ate She denounced the ways the viands the brigand s prices of English fournisseurs but it seemed to Julie all the same that she handled them with a Napoleonic success She bought as the French poor buy so far as the West End would let her and Julie had soon perceived that their expenditure even in this heart of Mayfair would be incredibly small Whereby she felt herself more and more mistress of her fate By her own unaided hands would she provide for herself and her household Each year there should be a little margin and she would owe no man anything After six months if she could not afford to pay the Duke a fair rent for his house always supposing he allowed her to remain in it she would go elsewhere As she reached the hall clad in an old serge dress which was a survival from Bruges days Therese ran up to her with the letters Julie looked through them turned and went back to her room She had expected the letter which lay on the top and she must brace herself to read it It began abruptly You will hardly wonder that I should write at once to ask if you have no explanation to give me of your manner of this afternoon Again and again I go over what happened but no light comes It was as though you had wiped out all the six months of our friendship as though I had become for you once more the merest acquaintance It is impossible that I can have been mistaken You meant to make me and others clearly understand what That I no longer deserved your kindness that you had broken altogether with the man on whom you had so foolishly bestowed it My friend what have I done How have I sinned Did that sour lady who asked me questions she had small business to ask tell you tales that have set your heart against me But what have incidents and events that happened or may have happened in India got to do with our friendship which grew up for definite reasons and has come to mean so much has it not to both of us I am not a model person Heaven knows very far from it There are scores of things in my life to be ashamed of And please remember that last year I had never seen you if I had much might have gone differently But how can I defend myself I owe you so much Ought not that of itself to make you realize how great is your power to hurt me and how small are my powers of resistance The humiliations you can inflict upon me are infinite and I have no rights no weapons against you I hardly know what I am saying It is very late and I am writing this after a dinner at the club given me by two or three of my brother officers It was a dinner in my honor to congratulate me on my good fortune They are good fellows and it should have been a merry time But my half hour in your room had killed all power of enjoyment for me They found me a wretched companion and we broke up early I came home through the empty streets wishing myself with all my heart away from England facing the desert Let me just say this It is not of good omen that now when I want all my faculties at their best I should suddenly find myself invaded by this distress and despondency You have some responsibility now in my life and career if you would you cannot get rid of it You have not increased the chances of your friend s success in his great task You see how I restrain myself I could write as madly as I feel violently and madly But of set purpose we pitched our relation in a certain key and measure and I try at least to keep the measure if the music and the charm must go But why in God s name should they go Why have you turned against me You have listened to slanderers you have secretly tried me by tests that are not in the bargain and you have judged and condemned me without a hearing without a word I can tell you I am pretty sore I will come and see you no more in company for the present You gave me a footing with you which has its own dignity I ll guard it not even from you will I accept anything else But unless indeed the grove is cut down and the bird flown forever let me come when you are alone Then charge me with what you will I am an earthy creature struggling through life as I best can and till I saw you struggling often no doubt in very earthy ways I am not a philosopher nor an idealist with expectations like Delafield This rough and tumble world is all I know It s good enough for me good enough to love a friend in as I vow to God Julie I have loved you There it s out and you must put up with it I couldn t help it I am too miserable But But I won t write any more I shall stay in my rooms till twelve o clock You owe me promptness Julie put down the letter She looked round her little study with a kind of despair the despair perhaps of the prisoner who had thought himself delivered only to find himself caught in fresh and stronger bonds As for ambition as for literature here across their voices broke this voice of the senses this desire of the moth for the star And she was powerless to resist it Ah why had he not accepted his dismissal quarrelled with her at once and forever She understood the letter perfectly what it offered and what it tacitly refused An intimate and exciting friendship for two years For two years he was ready to fill up such time as he could spare from his clandestine correspondence with her cousin with this romantic interesting but unprofitable affection And then She fell again upon his letter Ah but there was a new note in it a hard strained note which gave her a kind of desperate joy It seemed to her that for months she had been covetously listening for it in vain She was beginning to be necessary to him he had suffered through her Never before could she say that to herself Pleasure she had given him but not pain and it is pain that is the test and consecration of Of what Well now for her answer It was short I am very sorry you thought me rude I was tired with talking and unpacking and with literary work housework too if the truth were known I am no longer a fine lady and must slave for myself The thought also of an interview with Lord Lackington which faced me which I went through as soon as you doctor Meredith and mister Delafield had gone unnerved me You were good to write to me and I am grateful indeed As to your appointment and your career you owe no one anything Everything is in your own hands I rejoice in your good fortune and I beg that you will let no false ideas with regard to me trouble your mind This afternoon at five if you can forgive me you will find me In the early afternoon I shall be in the British Museum for my work s sake She posted her letter and went about her daily housework oppressed the while by a mental and moral nausea As she washed and tidied and dusted a true housewife s love growing up in her for the little house and its charming old world appointments a sort of mute relation between her and it as though it accepted her for mistress and she on her side vowed it a delicate and prudent care she thought how she could have delighted in this life which had opened upon her had it come to her a year ago The tasks set her by Meredith were congenial and within her power Her independence gave her the keenest pleasure The effort and conquests of the intellect she had the mind to love them to desire them and the way to them was unbarred What plucked her back A tear fell upon the old china cup that she was dusting A sort of maternal element had entered into her affection for Warkworth during the winter She had upheld him and fought for him And now like a mother she could not tear the unworthy object from her heart though all the folly of their pseudo friendship and her secret hopes lay bare before her Warkworth came at five He entered in the dusk a little pale with his graceful head thrown back and that half startled timid look in his wide blue eyes that misleading look which made him the boy still when he chose Julie was standing near the window as he came in As she turned and saw him there a flood of tenderness and compunction swept over her He was going away What if she never saw him again She shuddered and came forward rapidly eagerly He read the meaning of her movement her face and wringing her hands with a violence that hurt her he drew a long breath of relief Why why he said under his breath have you made me so unhappy The blood leaped in her veins These indeed were new words in a new tone Don t let us reproach each other she said There is so much to say Sit down To day there were no beguiling spring airs The fire burned merrily in the grate the windows were closed A scent of narcissus the Duchess had filled the tables with flowers floated in the room Amid its old fashioned and distinguished bareness tempered by flowers and a litter of foreign books Julie seemed at last to have found her proper frame In her severe black dress opening on a delicate vest of white she had a muselike grace and the wreath made by her superb black hair round the fine intelligence of her brow had never been more striking Her slender hands busied themselves with Cousin Mary Leicester s tea things and every movement had in Warkworth s eyes a charm to which he had never yet been sensible in this manner to this degree Am I really to say no more of yesterday he said looking at her nervously Her flush her gesture appealed to him Do you know what I had before me that day when you came in she said softly No I cannot guess Ah you said something about Lord Lackington She hesitated Then her color deepened You don t know my story You suppose don t you that I am a Belgian with English connections whom Lady Henry met by chance Isn t that how you explain me Warkworth had pushed aside his cup I thought He paused in embarrassment but there was a sparkle of astonished expectancy in his eyes My mother she looked away into the blaze of the fire and her voice choked a little my mother was Lord Lackington s daughter Lord Lackington s daughter echoed Warkworth in stupefaction A rush of ideas and inferences sped through his mind He thought of Lady Blanche things heard in India and while he stared at her in an agitated silence the truth leaped to light Not not Lady Rose Delaney he said bending forward to her She nodded My father was Marriott Dalrymple You will have heard of him I should be Julie Dalrymple but they could never marry because of Colonel Delaney Her face was still turned away All the details of that famous scandal began to come back to him His companion her history her relations to others to himself began to appear to him in the most astonishing new lights So instead of the mere humble outsider she belonged all the time to the best English blood The society in which he had met her was full of her kindred No doubt the Duchess knew and Montresor He was meshed in a net of thoughts perplexing and confounding of which the total result was perhaps that she appeared to him as she sat there the slender outline so quiet and still more attractive and more desirable than ever The mystery surrounding her in some way glorified her and he dimly perceived that so it must have been for others How did you ever bear the Bruton Street life he said presently in a low voice of wonder Lady Henry knew Oh yes And the Duchess Yes She is a connection of my mother s Warkworth s mind went back to the Moffatts A flush spread slowly over the face of the young officer It was indeed an extraordinary imbroglio in which he found himself How did Lord Lackington take it he asked after a pause He was of course much startled much moved We had a long talk Everything is to remain just the same He wishes to make me an allowance and if he persists I suppose I can t hurt him by refusing But for the present I have refused It is more amusing to earn one s own living She turned to him with a sharp brightness in her black eyes Besides if Lord Lackington gives me money he will want to give me advice And I would rather advise myself Warkworth sat silent a moment Then he took a great resolve I want to speak to you he said suddenly putting out his hand to hers which lay on her knee She turned to him startled I want to have no secrets from you he said drawing his breath quickly I told you lies one day because I thought it was my duty to tell lies Another person was concerned But now I can t Julie you ll let me call you so won t you The name is already he hesitated then the words rushed out part of my life Julie it s quite true there is a kind of understanding between your little cousin Aileen and me At Simla she attracted me enormously I lost my head one day in the woods when she whom we were all courting distinguished me above two or three other men who were there I proposed to her upon a sudden impulse and she accepted me She is a charming soft creature Perhaps I wasn t justified Perhaps she ought to have had more chance of seeing the world Anyway there was a great row Her guardians insisted that I had behaved badly They could not know all the details of the matter and I was not going to tell them Finally I promised to withdraw for two years He paused anxiously studying her face It had grown very white and he thought very cold But she quickly rose and looking down upon him said Nothing of that is news to me Did you think it was And moving to the tea table she began to make provision for a fresh supply of tea Both words and manner astounded him He too rose and followed her How did you first guess he said abruptly Some gossip reached me She looked up with a smile That s what generally happens isn t it There are no secrets nowadays he said sorely And then there was Miss Lawrence Yes there was Miss Lawrence Did you think badly of me Why should I I understand Aileen is very pretty and And will have a large fortune You understand that he said trying to carry it off lightly The fact is well known isn t it He sat down twisting his hat between his hands Then with an exclamation he dashed it on the floor and rising he bent over Julie his hands in his pockets Julie he said in a voice that shook her don t for God s sake give me up I have behaved abominably but don t take your friendship from me I shall soon be gone Our lives will go different ways That was settled alack before we met I am honorably bound to that poor child She cares for me and I can t get loose But these last months have been happy haven t they There are just three weeks left At present the strongest feeling in my heart is He paused for his word and he saw that she was looking through the window to the trees of the garden and that still as she was her lip quivered What shall I say he resumed with emotion It seems to me our case stands all by itself alone in the world We have three weeks give them to me Don t let s play at cross purposes any more I want to be sincere I want to hide nothing from you in these days Let us throw aside convention and trust each other as friends may so that when I go we may say to each other Well it was worth the pain These have been days of gold we shall get no better if we live to be a hundred She turned her face to him in a tremulous amazement and there were tears on her cheek Never had his aspect been so winning What he proposed was in truth a mean thing all the same he proposed it nobly It was in vain that something whispered in her ear This girl to whom he describes himself as honorably bound has a fortune of half a million He is determined to have both her money and my heart Another inward voice tragically generous dashed down the thought and at the moment rightly for as he stood over her breathless and imperious to his own joy to his own exaltation Warkworth was conscious of a new sincerity flowing in a tempestuous and stormy current through all the veins of being With a sombre passion which already marked an epoch in their relation and contained within itself the elements of new and unforeseen developments she gazed silently into his face Then leaning back in her chair she once more held out to him both her hands He gave an exclamation of joy kissed the hands tenderly and sat down beside her Now then all your cares all your thoughts all your griefs are to be mine till fate call us And I have a thousand things to tell you to bless you for to consult you about There is not a thought in my mind that you shall not know bad good and indifferent if you care to turn out the rag bag Shall I begin with the morning my experiences at the club my little nieces at the Zoo He laughed but suddenly grew serious again No your story first you owe it me Let me know all that concerns you Your past your sorrows ambitions everything He bent to her imperiously With a faint broken smile her hands still in his she assented It was difficult to begin then difficult to control the flood of memory and it had long been dark when Madame Bornier coming in to light the lamp and make up the fire disturbed an intimate and searching conversation which had revealed the two natures to each other with an agitating fulness Yet the results of this memorable evening upon Julie Le Breton were ultimately such as few could have foreseen When Warkworth had left her she went to her own room and sat for a long while beside the window gazing at the dark shrubberies of the Cureton House garden at the few twinkling distant lights The vague golden hopes she had cherished through these past months of effort and scheming were gone forever Warkworth would marry Aileen Moffatt and use her money for an ambitious career After these weeks now lying before them weeks of dangerous intimacy dangerous emotion she and he would become as strangers to each other He would be absorbed by his profession and his rich marriage She would be left alone to live her life A sudden terror of her own weakness overcame her No she could not be alone She must place a barrier between herself and this this strange threatening of illimitable ruin that sometimes rose upon her from the dark I have no prejudices she had said to Sir Wilfrid There were many moments when she felt a fierce pride in the element of lawlessness of defiance that seemed to be her inheritance from her parents But to night she was afraid of it Again if love was to go power the satisfaction of ambition remained She threw a quick glance into the future the future beyond these three weeks What could she make of it She knew well that she was not the woman to resign herself to a mere pining obscurity Jacob Delafield Was it after all so impossible For a few minutes she set herself deliberately to think out what it would mean to marry him then suddenly broke down and wept with inarticulate cries and sobs with occasional reminiscences of her old convent s prayers appeals half conscious instinctive to a God only half believed XVI Delafield was walking through the Park towards Victoria Gate A pair of beautiful roans pulled up suddenly beside him and a little figure with a waving hand bent to him from a carriage Jacob where are you off to Let me give you a lift The gentleman addressed took off his hat Much obliged to you but I want some exercise I say where did Freddie get that pair I don t know he doesn t tell me Jacob you must get in I want to speak to you Rather unwillingly Delafield obeyed and away they sped J ai un tas de choses a vous dire she said speaking low and in French so as to protect herself from the servants in front Jacob I m very unhappy about Julie Delafield frowned uncomfortably Why Hadn t you better leave her alone Oh of course I know you think me a chatterbox I don t care You must let me tell you some fresh news about her It isn t gossip and you and I are her best friends Oh Freddie s so disagreeable about her Jacob you ve got to help and advise a little Now do listen It s your duty your downright catechism duty And she poured into his reluctant ear the tale which Miss Emily Lawrence nearly a fortnight before had confided to her Of course she wound up you ll say it s only what we knew or guessed long ago But you see Jacob we didn t know It might have been just gossip And then besides she frowned and dropped her voice till it was only just audible this horrid man hadn t made our Julie so so conspicuous and Lady Henry hadn t turned out such a toad and altogether Jacob I m dreadfully worried Don t be said Jacob dryly And what a creature cried the Duchess unheeding They say that poor Moffatt child will soon have fretted herself ill if the guardians don t give way about the two years What two years The two years that she must wait till she is twenty one Oh Jacob you know that exclaimed the Duchess impatient with him I ve told you scores of times I m not in the least interested in Miss Moffatt s affairs But you ought to be for they concern Julie cried the Duchess Can t you imagine what kind of things people are saying Lady Henry has spread it about that it was all to see him she bribed the Bruton Street servants to let her give the Wednesday party as usual that she had been flirting with him abominably for months and using Lady Henry s name in the most impertinent ways And now suddenly everybody seems to know something about this Indian engagement You may imagine it doesn t look very well for our poor Julie The other night at Chatton House I was furious I made Julie go I wanted her to show herself and keep up her friends Well it was horrid One or two old frights who used to be only too thankful to Julie for reminding Lady Henry to invite them put their noses in the air and behaved odiously And even some of the nicer ones seemed changed I could see Julie felt it Nothing of all that will do her any real harm said Jacob rather contemptuously Well no I know of course that her real friends will never forsake her never never But Jacob the Duchess hesitated her charming little face furrowed with thought if only so much of it weren t true She herself Please Evelyn said Delafield with decision don t tell me anything she may have said to you The Duchess flushed I shouldn t have betrayed any confidence she said proudly And I must consult with some one who cares about her doctor Meredith lunched with me to day and he said a few words to me afterwards He s quite anxious too and unhappy Captain Warkworth s always there always Even I have been hardly able to see her the last few days Last Sunday they took the little lame child and went into the country for the whole day Well what is there to object to in that cried Jacob I didn t say there was anything to object to said the Duchess looking at him with eyes half angry half perplexed Only it s so unlike her She had promised to be at home that afternoon for several old friends and they found her flown without a word And think how sweet Julie is always about such things what delicious notes she writes how she hates to put anybody out or disappoint them And now not a word of excuse to anybody And she looks so ill so white so fixed like a person in a dream which she can t shake off I m just miserable about her And I hate hate that man engaged to her own cousin all the time cried the little Duchess under her breath as she passionately tore some violets at her waist to pieces and flung them out of the carriage Then she turned to Jacob But of course if you don t care twopence about all this Jacob it s no good talking to you Her taunt fell quite unnoticed Jacob turned to her with smiling composure You have forgotten my dear Evelyn all this time that Warkworth goes away to mid Africa in little more than two weeks I wish it was two minutes said the Duchess fuming Delafield made no reply for a while He seemed to be studying the effect of a pale shaft of sunlight which had just come stealing down through layers of thin gray cloud to dance upon the Serpentine Presently as they left the Serpentine behind them he turned to his companion with more apparent sympathy We can t do anything Evelyn and we ve no right whatever to talk of alarm or anxiety to talk of it mind It s it s disloyal Forgive me he added hastily I know you don t gossip But it fills me with rage that other people should be doing it The brusquerie of his manner disconcerted the little lady beside him She recovered herself however and said with a touch of sarcasm tempered by a rather trembling lip Your rage won t prevent their gossiping mister Jacob I thought perhaps your friendship might have done something to stop it to to influence Julie she added uncertainly My friendship as you call it is of no use whatever he said obstinately Warkworth will go away and if you and others do their best to protect Miss Le Breton talk will soon die out Behave as if you had never heard the man s name before stare the people down Why good Heavens you have a thousand arts But of course if the little flame is to be blown into a blaze by a score of so called friends He shrugged his shoulders The Duchess did not take his rebukes kindly not having in truth deserved them You are rude and unkind Jacob she said almost with the tears in her eyes And you don t understand it is because I myself am so anxious For that reason play the part with all your might he said unyieldingly Really even you and I oughtn t to talk of it any more But there is one thing I want very much to know about Miss Le Breton He bent towards her smiling though in truth he was disgusted with himself vexed with her and out of tune with all the world The Duchess made a little face All very well but after such a lecture as you have indulged in I think I prefer not to say any more about Julie Do I m ashamed of myself except that I don t retract one word not one Be kind all the same and tell me if you know has she spoken to Lord Lackington The Duchess still frowned but a few more apologetic expressions on his part restored a temper that had always a natural tendency to peace Indeed Jacob s boutades never went long unpardoned An only child herself he her first cousin had played the part of brother in her life since the days when she first tottered in long frocks and he had never played it in any mincing fashion His words were often blunt She smarted and forgave much more quickly than she forgave her husband But then with him she was in love So she presently vouchsafed to give Jacob the news that Lord Lackington at last knew the secret that he had behaved well had shown much feeling in fact so that poor Julie But Jacob again cut short the sentimentalisms the little touching phrases in which the woman delighted What is he going to do for her he said impatiently Will he make any provision for her Is there any way by which she can live in his house take care of him The Duchess shook her head At seventy five one can t begin to explain a thing as big as that Julie perfectly understands and doesn t wish it But as to money persisted Jacob Julie says nothing about money How odd you are Jacob I thought that was the last thing needful in your eyes Jacob did not reply If he had he would probably have said that what was harmful or useless for men might be needful for women for the weakness of women But he kept silence while the vague intensity of the eyes the pursed and twisted mouth showed that his mind was full of thoughts Suddenly he perceived that the carriage was nearing Victoria Gate He called to the coachman to stop and jumped out Good bye Evelyn Don t bear me malice You re a good friend he said in her ear a real good friend But don t let people talk to you not even elderly ladies with the best intentions I tell you it will be a fight and one of the best weapons is he touched his lips significantly smiled at her and was gone The Duchess passed out of the Park Delafield turned as though in the direction of the Marble Arch but as soon as the carriage was out of sight he paused and quickly retraced his steps towards Kensington Gardens Here in this third week of March some of the thorns and lilacs were already in leaf The grass was springing and the chatter of many sparrows filled the air Faint patches of sun flecked the ground between the trees and blue hazes already redeemed from the dreariness of winter filled the dim planes of distance and mingled with the low silvery clouds He found a quiet spot remote from nursery maids and children and there he wandered to and fro indefinitely his hands behind his back All the anxieties for which he had scolded his cousin possessed him only sharpened tenfold he was in torture and he was helpless However when at last he emerged from his solitude and took a hansom to the Chudleigh estate office in Spring Gardens he resolutely shook off the thoughts which had been weighing upon him He took his usual interest in his work and did it with his usual capacity Towards five o clock in the afternoon Delafield found himself in Cureton Street As he turned down Heribert Street he saw a cab in front of him It stopped at Miss Le Breton s door and Warkworth jumped out The door was quickly opened to him and he went in without having turned his eyes towards the man at the far corner of the street Delafield paused irresolute Finally he walked back to his club in Piccadilly where he dawdled over the newspapers till nearly seven Then he once more betook himself to Heribert Street Is Miss Le Breton at home Therese looked at him with a sudden flickering of her clear eyes I think so sir she said with soft hesitation and she slowly led him across the hall The drawing room door opened Major Warkworth emerged Ah how do you do he said shortly staring in a kind of bewilderment as he saw Delafield Then he hurriedly looked for his hat ran down the stairs and was gone Announce me please said Delafield peremptorily to the little girl Tell Miss Le Breton that I am here And he drew back from the open door of the drawing room Therese slipped in and reappeared Please to walk in sir she said in her shy low voice and Delafield entered From the hall he had caught one involuntary glimpse of Julie standing stiff and straight in the middle of the room her hands clasped to her breast a figure in pain When he went in she was in her usual seat by the fire with her embroidery frame in front of her May I come in It is rather late Oh by all means Do you bring me any news of Evelyn I haven t seen her for three days He seated himself beside her It was hard indeed for him to hide all signs of the tumult within But he held a firm grip upon himself I saw Evelyn this afternoon She complained that you had had no time for her lately Julie bent over her work He saw that her fingers were so unsteady that she could hardly make them obey her There has been a great deal to do even in this little house Evelyn forgets she has an army of servants we have only our hands and our time She looked up smiling He made no reply and the smile died from her face suddenly as though some one had blown out a light She returned to her work or pretended to But her aspect had left him inwardly shaken The eyes disproportionately large and brilliant were of an emphasis almost ghastly the usually clear complexion was flecked and cloudy the mouth dry lipped She looked much older than she had done a fortnight before And the fact was the more noticeable because in her dress she had now wholly discarded the touch of stateliness almost old maidishness which had once seemed appropriate to the position of Lady Henry s companion She was wearing a little gown of her youth a blue cotton which two years before had been put aside as too slight and juvenile Never had the form within it seemed so girlish so appealing But the face was heart rending After a pause he moved a little closer to her Do you know that you are looking quite ill Then my looks are misleading I am very well I am afraid I don t put much faith in that remark When do you mean to take a holiday Oh very soon Leonie my little housekeeper talks of going to Bruges to wind up all her affairs there and bring back some furniture that she has warehoused I may go with her I too have some property stored there I should go and see some old friends the soeurs for instance with whom I went to school In the old days I was a torment to them and they were tyrants to me But they are quite nice to me now they give me patisserie and stroke my hands and spoil me And she rattled on about the friends she might revisit in a hollow perfunctory way which set him on edge I don t see that anything of that kind will do you any good You want rest of mind and body I expect those last scenes with Lady Henry cost you more than you knew There are wounds one does not notice at the time Which afterwards bleed inwardly She laughed No no I am not bleeding for Lady Henry By the way what news of her Sir Wilfrid told me to day that he had had a letter She is at Torquay and she thinks there are too many curates at Torquay She is not at all in a good temper Julie looked up You know that she is trying to punish me A great many people seem to have been written to That will blow over I don t know How confident I was at one time that if there was a breach it would be Lady Henry that would suffer It makes me hot to remember some things I said to Sir Wilfrid in particular I see now that I shall not be troubled with society in this little house It is too early for you to guess anything of that kind Not at all London is pretty full The affair has made a noise Those who meant to stand by me would have called don t you think The quivering bitterness of her face was most pitiful in Jacob s eyes Oh people take their time he said trying to speak lightly She shook her head It s ridiculous that I should care One s self love I suppose that bleeds Evelyn has made me send out cards for a little house warming She said I must She made me go to that smart party at Chatton House the other night It was a great mistake People turned their backs on me And this too will be a mistake and a failure You were kind enough to send me a card Yes and you must come She looked at him with a sudden nervous appeal which made another tug on his self control Of course I shall come Do you remember your own saying that awful evening that I had devoted friends Well we shall soon see That depends only on yourself he replied with gentle deliberation She started threw him a doubtful look If you mean that I must take a great deal of trouble I am afraid I can t I am too tired And she sank back in her chair The sigh that accompanied the words seemed to him involuntary unconscious I didn t mean that altogether he said after a moment She moved restlessly Then really I don t know what you meant I suppose all friendship depends on one s self She drew her embroidery frame towards her again and he was left to wonder at his own audacity Do you know she said presently her eyes apparently busy with her silks that I have told Lord Lackington Yes Evelyn gave me that news How has the old man behaved Oh very well most kindly He has already formed a habit almost of dropping in upon me at all hours I have had to appoint him times and seasons or there would be no work done He sits here and raves about young missus Delaray you know he is painting her portrait for the famous series and draws her profile on the backs of my letters He recites his speeches to me he asks my advice as to his fights with his tenants or his miners In short I m adopted I m almost the real thing She smiled and then again as she turned over her silks he heard her sigh a long breath of weariness It was strange and terrible in his ear the contrast between this unconscious sound drawn as it were from the oppressed heart of pain and her languidly smiling words Has he spoken to you of the Moffatts he asked her presently not looking at her A sharp crimson color rushed over her face Not much He and Lady Blanche are not great friends And I have made him promise to keep my secret from her till I give him leave to tell it It will have to be known to her some time will it not Perhaps she said impatiently Perhaps when I can make up my mind Then she pushed aside her frame and would talk no more about Lord Lackington She gave him somehow the impression of a person suffocating struggling for breath and air And yet her hand was icy and she presently went to the fire complaining of the east wind and as he put on the coal he saw her shiver Shall I force her to tell me everything he thought to himself Did she divine the obscure struggle in his mind At any rate she seemed anxious to cut short their tete a tete She asked him to come and look at some engravings which the Duchess had sent round for the embellishment of the dining room Then she summoned Madame Bornier and asked him a number of questions on Leonie s behalf with reference to some little investment of the ex governess s savings which had been dropping in value Meanwhile as she kept him talking she leaned herself against the lintel of the door forgetting every now and then that any one else was there and letting the true self appear like some drowned thing floating into sight Delafield disposed of Madame Bornier s affairs hardly knowing what he said but showing in truth his usual conscience and kindness Then when Leonie was contented Julie saw the little cripple crossing the hall and called to her Ah ma cherie How is the poor little foot And turning to Delafield she explained volubly that Therese had given herself a slight twist on the stairs that morning pressing the child to her side the while with a tender gesture The child nestled against her Shall maman keep back supper Therese half whispered looking at Delafield No no I must go cried Delafield rousing himself and looking for his hat I would ask you to stay said Julie smiling just to show off Leonie s cooking but there wouldn t be enough for a great big man And you re probably dining with dukes Delafield disclaimed any such intention and they went back to the drawing room to look for his hat and stick Julie still had her arm round Therese and would not let the child go She clearly avoided being left alone with him and yet it seemed even to his modesty that she was loath to see him depart She talked first of her little menage as though proud of their daily economies and contrivances then of her literary work and its prospects then of her debt to Meredith Never before had she thus admitted him to her domestic and private life It was as though she leaned upon his sympathy his advice his mere neighborhood And her pale changed face had never seemed to him so beautiful never in fact truly beautiful till now The dying down of the brilliance and energy of the strongly marked character which had made her the life of the Bruton Street salon into this mildness this despondency this hidden weariness had left her infinitely more lovely in his eyes But how to restrain himself much longer from taking the sad gracious woman in his arms and coercing her into sanity and happiness At last he tore himself away You won t forget Wednesday she said to him as she followed him into the hall No Is there anything else that you wish that I could do No nothing But if there is I will ask Then looking up she shrank from something in his face something accusing passionate profound He wrung her hand Promise that you will ask She murmured something and he turned away She came back alone into the drawing room Oh what a good man she said sighing What a good man And then all in a moment she was thankful that he was gone that she was alone with and mistress of her pain The passion and misery which his visit had interrupted swept back upon her in a rushing swirl blinding and choking every sense Ah what a scene to which his coming had put an end scene of bitterness of recrimination not restrained even by this impending anguish of parting It came as a close to a week during which she and Warkworth had been playing the game which they had chosen to play according to its appointed rules the delicacies and restraints of friendship masking and at the same time inflaming a most unhappy poisonous and growing love And finally there had risen upon them a storm wave of feeling tyrannous tempestuous bursting in reproach and agitation leaving behind it bare and menacing the old ugly facts unaltered and unalterable Warkworth was little less miserable than herself That she knew He loved her as it were to his own anger and surprise And he suffered in deserting her more than he had ever suffered yet through any human affection But his purpose through it all remained stubbornly fixed that also she knew For nearly a year Aileen Moffatt s fortune and Aileen Moffatt s family connections had entered into all his calculations of the future Only a few more years in the army then retirement with ample means a charming wife and a seat in Parliament To jeopardize a plan so manifestly desirable so easy to carry out so far reaching in its favorable effects upon his life for the sake of those hard and doubtful alternatives in which a marriage with Julie would involve him never seriously entered his mind When he suffered he merely said to himself steadily that time would heal the smart for both of them Only one thing would be absolutely fatal for all of us that I should break with Aileen Julie read these obscure processes in Warkworth s mind with perfect clearness She was powerless to change them but that afternoon she had at any rate beaten her wings against the bars and the exhaustion and anguish of her revolt her reproaches were still upon her The spring night had fallen The room was hot and she threw a window open Some thorns in the garden beneath had thickened into leaf They rose in a dark mass beneath the window Overhead beyond the haze of the great city a few stars twinkled and the dim roar of London life beat from all sides upon this quiet corner which still held Lady Mary s old house Julie s eyes strained into the darkness her head swam with weakness and weariness Suddenly she gave a cry she pressed her hands to her heart Upon the darkness outside there rose a face so sharply drawn so life like that it printed itself forever upon the quivering tissues of the brain It was Warkworth s face not as she had seen it last but in some strange extremity of physical ill drawn haggard in a cold sweat the eyes glazed the hair matted the parched lips open as though they cried for help She stood gazing Then the eyes turned and the agony in them looked out upon her Her whole sense was absorbed by the phantom her being hung upon it Then as it faded on the quiet trees she tottered to a chair and hid her face Common sense told her that she was the victim of her own tired nerves and tortured fancy But the memory of Cousin Mary Leicester s second sight of her visions in this very room crept upon her and gripped her heart A ghostly horror seized her of the room the house and her own tempestuous nature She groped her way out in blind and hurrying panic glad of the lamp in the hall glad of the sounds in the house glad above all of Therese s thin hands as they once more stole lovingly round her own XVII The Duchess and Julie were in the large room of Burlington House They had paused before a magnificent Turner of the middle period hitherto unseen by the public and the Duchess was reading from the catalogue in Julie s ear She had found Julie alone in Heribert Street surrounded by books and proofs endeavoring as she reported to finish a piece of work for doctor Meredith Distressed by her friend s pale cheeks the Duchess had insisted on dragging her from the prison house and changing the current of her thoughts Julie laughing hesitating indignant had at last yielded probably in order to avoid another tete a tete and another scene with the little impetuous lady and now the Duchess had her safe and was endeavoring to amuse her But it was not easy Julie generally so instructed and sympathetic so well skilled in the difficult art of seeing pictures with a friend might to day never have turned a phrase upon a Constable or a Romney before She tried indeed to turn them as usual but the Duchess sharply critical and attentive where her beloved Julie was concerned perceived the difference acutely Alack what languor what fatigue Evelyn became more and more conscious of an inward consternation But thank goodness he goes to morrow the villain And when that s over it will be all right Julie meanwhile knew that she was observed divined and pitied Her pride revolted but it could wring from her nothing better than a passive resistance She could prevent Evelyn from expressing her thoughts she could not so command her own bodily frame that the Duchess should not think Days of moral and mental struggle nights of waking combined with the serious and sustained effort of a new profession had left their mark There are moreover certain wounds to self love and self respect which poison the whole being Julie you must have a holiday cried the Duchess presently as they sat down to rest Julie replied that she Madame Bornier and the child were going to Bruges for a week Oh but that won t be comfortable enough I m sure I could arrange something Think of all our tiresome houses eating their heads off Julie firmly refused She was going to renew old friendships at Bruges she would be made much of and the prospect was as pleasant as any one need wish Well of course if you have made up your mind When do you go In three or four days just before the Easter rush And you Oh we go to Scotland to fish We must of course be killing something How long darling will you be away About ten days Julie pressed the Duchess s little hand in acknowledgment of the caressing word and look By the way didn t Lord Lackington invite you Ah there he is And suddenly Lord Lackington examining with fury a picture of his own which some rascally critic had that morning pronounced to be Venetian school and not the divine Giorgione himself lifted an angry countenance to find the Duchess and Julie beside him The start which passed through him betrayed itself He could not yet see Julie with composure But when he had pressed her hand and inquired after her health he went back to his grievance being indeed rejoiced to have secured a pair of listeners Really the insolence of these fellows in the press I shall let the Academy know what I think of it Not a rag of mine shall they ever see here again Ears and little fingers indeed Idiots and owls Julie smiled But it had to be explained to the Duchess that a wise man half Italian half German had lately arisen who proposed to judge the authenticity of a picture by its ears assisted by any peculiarities of treatment in the little fingers What nonsense said the Duchess with a yawn If I were an artist I should always draw them different ways Well not exactly said Lord Lackington who as an artist himself was unfortunately debarred from statements of this simplicity But the ludicrous way in which these fools overdo their little discoveries And he walked on fuming till the open and unmeasured admiration of the two ladies for his great Rembrandt the gem of his collection now occupying the place of honor in the large room of the Academy restored him to himself Ah even the biggest ass among them holds his tongue about that he said exultantly But hallo What does that call itself He looked at a picture in front of him then at the catalogue then at the Duchess That picture is ours said the Duchess Isn t it a dear It s a Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo fiddlesticks cried Lord Lackington Leonardo indeed What absurdity Really Duchess you should tell Crowborough to be more careful about his things We mustn t give handles to these fellows What do you mean said the Duchess offended If it isn t a Leonardo pray what is it Why a bad school copy of course said Lord Lackington hotly Look at the eyes he took out a pencil and pointed look at the neck look at the fingers The Duchess pouted Oh she said Then there is something in fingers Lord Lackington s face suddenly relaxed He broke into a shout of laughter bon enfant that he was and the Duchess laughed too but under cover of their merriment she mindful of quite other things drew him a little farther away from Julie I thought you had asked her to Nonpareil for Easter she said in his ear with a motion of her pretty head towards Julie in the distance Yes but my dear lady Blanche won t come home She and Aileen put it off and put it off Now she says they mean to spend May in Switzerland may perhaps be away the whole summer I had counted on them for Easter I am dependent on Blanche for hostess It is really too bad of her Everything has broken down and William and I he named his youngest son are going to the Uredales for a fortnight Lord Uredale his eldest son a sportsman and farmer troubled by none of his father s originalities reigned over the second family place in Herefordshire beside the Wye Has Aileen any love affairs yet said the Duchess abruptly raising her face to his Lord Lackington looked surprised Not that I know of However I dare say they wouldn t tell me I m a sieve I know Have you heard of any Tell me He stooped to her with roguish eagerness I like to steal a march on Blanche So he knew nothing while half their world was talking It was very characteristic however Except for his own hobbies artistic medical or military Lord Lackington had walked through life as a Johnny Head in Air from his youth till now His children had not trusted him with their secrets and he had never discovered them for himself Is there any likeness between Julie and Aileen whispered the Duchess Lord Lackington started Both turned their eyes towards Julie as she stood some ten yards away from them in front of a refined and mysterious profile of the cinque cento some lady perhaps of the d Este or Sforza families attributed to Ambrogio da Predis In her soft black dress delicately folded and draped to hide her excessive thinness her small toque fitting closely over her wealth of hair her only ornaments a long and slender chain set with uncut jewels which Lord Lackington had brought her the day before and a bunch of violets which the Duchess had just slipped into her belt she was as rare and delicate as the picture But she turned her face towards them and Lord Lackington made a sudden exclamation No Good Heavens no Aileen was a dancing sprite when I saw her last and this poor girl Duchess why does she look like that So sad so bloodless He turned upon her impetuously his face frowning and disturbed The Duchess sighed You and I have just got to do all we can for her she said relieved to see that Julie had wandered farther away as though it pleased her to be left to herself But I would do anything everything cried Lord Lackington Of course none of us can undo the past But I offered yesterday to make full provision for her She has refused She has the most Quixotic notions poor child No let her earn her own living yet awhile It will do her good But shall I tell you secrets The Duchess looked at him knitting her small brows Tell me what I ought to know no more he said gravely with a dignity contrasting oddly with his school boy curiosity in the matter of little Aileen s lover The Duchess hesitated Just in front of her was a picture of the Venetian school representing saint George Princess Saba and the dragon The princess a long and slender victim with bowed head and fettered hands reminded her of Julie The dragon perfidious encroaching wretch he was easy enough of interpretation But from the blue distance thank Heaven spurs the champion Oh ye heavenly powers give him wings and strength saint George saint George to the rescue Well she said slowly I can tell you of some one who is very devoted to Julie some one worthy of her Come with me And she took him away into the next room still talking in his ear When they returned Lord Lackington was radiant With a new eagerness he looked for Julie s distant figure amid the groups scattered about the central room The Duchess had sworn him to secrecy indeed and he meant to be discretion itself But Jacob Delafield Yes that indeed would be a solution His pride was acutely pleased his affection of which he already began to feel no small store for this charming woman of his own blood this poor granddaughter de la main gauche was strengthened and stimulated She was sad now and out of spirits poor thing because no doubt of this horrid business with Lady Henry to whom by the way he had written his mind But time would see to that time gently and discreetly assisted by himself and the Duchess It was impossible that she should finally hold out against such a good fellow impossible and most unreasonable No Rose s daughter would be brought back safely to her mother s world and class and poor Rose s tragedy would at last work itself out for good How strange romantic and providential In such a mood did he now devote himself to Julie He chattered about the pictures he gossiped about their owners he excused himself for the absence of that gad about Blanche he made her promise him a Whitsuntide visit instead and whispered in her ear You shall have her room he paid her the most handsome and gallant attentions natural to the man of fashion par excellence mingled with something intimate brusque capricious which marked her his own and of the family Seventy five with that step that carriage of the shoulders that vivacity Ridiculous And Julie could not but respond Something stole into her heart that had never yet lodged there She must love the old man she did When he left her for the Duchess her eyes followed him her dark rimmed wistful eyes I must be off said Lord Lackington presently buttoning up his coat This ladies has been dalliance I now go to my duties Read me in the Times to morrow I shall make a rattling speech You see I shall rub it in Montresor said the Duchess Lord Lackington nodded That afternoon he proposed to strew the floor of the House of Lords with the debris of Montresor s farcical reforms Suddenly he pulled himself up Duchess look round you at those two in the doorway Isn t it by George it is Chudleigh and his boy Yes yes it is said the Duchess in some excitement Don t recognize them Don t speak to him Jacob implored me not And she hurried her companions along till they were well out of the track of the new comers then on the threshold of another room she paused and touching Julie on the arm said in a whisper Now look back That s Jacob s Duke and his poor poor boy Julie threw a hurried glance towards the two figures but that glance impressed forever upon her memory a most tragic sight A man of middle height sallow and careworn with jet black hair and beard supported a sickly lad apparently about seventeen who clung to his arm and coughed at intervals The father moved as though in a dream He looked at the pictures with unseeing lustreless eyes except when the boy asked him a question Then he would smile stoop his head and answer only to resume again immediately his melancholy passivity The boy meanwhile his lips gently parted over his white teeth his blue eyes wide open and intent upon the pictures his emaciated cheeks deeply flushed wore an aspect of patient suffering of docile dependence peculiarly touching It was evident the father and son thought of none but each other From time to time the man would make the boy rest on one of the seats in the middle of the room and the boy would look up and chatter to his companion standing before him Then again they would resume their walk the boy leaning on his father Clearly the poor lad was marked for death clearly also he was the desire of his father s heart The possessor and the heir of perhaps the finest houses and the most magnificent estates in England said Lord Lackington with a shrug of pity And Chudleigh would gladly give them all to keep that boy alive Julie turned away Strange thoughts had been passing and repassing through her brain Then with angry loathing she flung her thoughts from her What did the Chudleigh inheritance matter to her That night she said good bye to the man she loved These three miserable burning weeks were done Her heart her life would go with Warkworth to Africa and the desert If at the beginning of this period of passion so short in prospect and to look back upon an eternity she had ever supposed that power or wealth could make her amends for the loss of her lover she was in no mood to calculate such compensations to day Parting was too near the anguish in her veins too sharp Jacob takes them to Paris to morrow said the Duchess to Lord Lackington The Duke has heard of some new doctor An hour or two later Sir Wilfrid Bury in the smoking room of his club took out a letter which he had that morning received from Lady Henry Delafield and gave it a second reading So I hear that mademoiselle s social prospects are not after all so triumphant as both she and I imagined I gave the world credit for more fools than it seems actually to possess and she well I own I am a little puzzled Has she taken leave of her senses I am told that she is constantly seen with this man that in spite of all denials there can be no doubt of his engagement to the Moffatt girl and that en somme she has done herself no good by the whole affair But after all poor soul she is disinterested She stands to gain nothing as I understand and she risks a good deal From this comfortable distance I really find something touching in her behavior She gives her first Wednesday I understand to morrow Mademoiselle Le Breton at home I confess I am curious By all means go and send me a full report mister Montresor and his wife will certainly be there He and I have been corresponding of course He wishes to persuade me that he feels himself in some way responsible for mademoiselle s position and for my dismissal of her that I ought to allow him in consequence full freedom of action I cannot see matters in the same light But as I tell him the change will be all to his advantage He exchanges a fractious old woman always ready to tell him unpleasant truths for one who has made flattery her metier If he wants quantity she will give it him Quality he can dispense with as I have seen for some time past Lord Lackington has written me an impertinent letter It seems she has revealed herself and il s en prend a moi because I kept the secret from him and because I have now dared to dismiss his granddaughter I am in the midst of a reply which amuses me He is to cast off his belongings as he pleases but when a lady of the Chantrey blood no matter how she came by it condescends to enter a paid employment legitimate or illegitimate she must be treated en reine or Lord L will know the reason why Here is one hundred pounds a year and let me hear no more of you he says to her at sixteen Thirteen years later I take her in respect his wishes and keep the secret She misbehaves herself and I dismiss her Where is the grievance He himself made her a lectrice and now complains that she is expected to do her duty in that line of life He himself banished her from the family and now grumbles that I did not at once foist her upon him He would like to escape the odium of his former action by blaming me but I am not meek and I shall make him regret his letter As for Jacob Delafield don t trouble yourself to write me any further news of him He has insulted me lately in a way I shall not soon forgive nothing to do however with the lady who says she refused him Whether her report be veracious or no matters nothing to me any more than his chances of succeeding to the Captain s place He is one of the ingenious fools who despise the old ways of ruining themselves and in the end achieve it as well as the commoner sort He owes me a good deal and at one time it pleased me to imagine that he was capable both of affection and gratitude That is the worst of being a woman we pass from one illusion to another love is only the beginning there are a dozen to come after You will scold me for a bitter tongue Well my dear Wilfrid I am not gay here There are too many women too many church services and I see too much of my doctor I pine for London and I don t see why I should have been driven out of it by an intrigante Write to me my dear Wilfrid I am not quite so bad as I paint myself say to yourself she has arthritis she is sixty five and her new companion reads aloud with a twang then you will only wonder at my moderation Sir Wilfrid returned the letter to his pocket That day at luncheon with Lady Hubert he had had the curiosity to question Susan Delafield Jacob s fair haired sister as to the reasons for her brother s quarrel with Lady Henry It appeared that being now in receipt of what seemed to himself at any rate a large salary as his cousin s agent he had thought it his duty to save up and repay the sums which Lady Henry had formerly spent upon his education His letter enclosing the money had reached that lady during the first week of her stay at Torquay It was no doubt couched in terms less cordial or more formal than would have been the case before Miss Le Breton s expulsion Not that he defends her altogether said Susan Delafield who was herself inclined to side with Lady Henry but as Lady Henry has refused to see him since it was not much good being friendly was it Anyway the letter and its enclosure had completed a breach already begun Lady Henry had taken furious offence the check had been insultingly returned and had now gone to swell the finances of a London hospital Sir Wilfrid was just reflecting that Jacob s honesty had better have waited for a more propitious season when looking up he saw the War Minister beside him in the act of searching for a newspaper Released said Bury with a smile Yes thank Heaven Lackington is I believe still pounding at me in the House of Lords But that amuses him and doesn t hurt me You ll carry your resolutions Oh dear yes with no trouble at all said the Minister almost with sulkiness as he threw himself into a chair and looked with distaste at the newspaper he had taken up Sir Wilfrid surveyed him We meet to night he said presently You mean in Heribert Street I suppose so said Montresor without cordiality I have just got a letter from her ladyship Well I hope it is more agreeable than those she writes to me A more unreasonable old woman The tired Minister took up Punch looked at a page and flung it down again Then he said Are you going I don t know Lady Henry gives me leave which makes me feel myself a kind of spy Oh never mind Come along Mademoiselle Julie will want all our support I don t hear her as kindly spoken of just now as I should wish No Lady Henry has more personal hold than we thought And Mademoiselle Julie less tact Why in the name of goodness does she go and get herself talked about with the particular man who is engaged to her little cousin You know by the way that the story of her parentage is leaking out fast Most people seem to know something about it Well that was bound to come Will it do her good or harm Harm for the present A few people are straitlaced and a good many feel they have been taken in But anyway this flirtation is a mistake Nobody really knows whether the man is engaged to the Moffatt girl or no The guardians have forbidden it At any rate everybody is kind enough to say so It s a blunder on Mademoiselle Julie s part As to the man himself of course there is nothing to say He is a very clever fellow Montresor looked at his companion with a sudden stiffness as though defying contradiction He will do this piece of work that we have given him to do extremely well The Mokembe mission Montresor nodded He had very considerable claims and was appointed entirely on his military record All the tales as to Mademoiselle s influence with me for instance that Lady Henry has been putting into circulation are either absurd fiction or have only the very smallest foundation in fact Sir Wilfrid smiled amicably and diverted the conversation Warkworth starts at once He goes to Paris to morrow I recommended him to see Pattison the Military Secretary there who was in the expedition of five years back This hasn t gone as well as it ought said doctor Meredith in the ear of the Duchess They were standing inside the door of Julie s little drawing room The Duchess in a dazzling frock of white and silver which placed Clarisse among the divinities of her craft looked round her with a look of worry What s the matter with the tiresome creatures Why is everybody going so early And there are not half the people here who ought to be here Meredith shrugged his shoulders I saw you at Chatton House the other night he said in the same tone Well said the Duchess sharply It seemed to me there was something of a demonstration Against Julie Let them try it said the little lady with evasive defiance We shall be too strong for them Lady Henry is putting her back into it I confess I never thought she would be either so venomous or so successful Julie will come out all right She would triumphantly if The Duchess glanced at him uneasily I believe you are overworking her She looks skin and bone doctor Meredith shook his head On the contrary I have been holding her back But it seems she wants to earn a good deal of money That s so absurd cried the Duchess when there are people only pining to give her some of theirs No no said the journalist brusquely She is quite right there Oh it would be all right if she were herself She would make short work of Lady Henry But Mademoiselle Julie for she glided past them and he raised his voice sit down and rest yourself Don t take so much trouble She flung them a smile Lord Lackington is going and she hurried on Lord Lackington was standing in a group which contained Sir Wilfrid Bury and mister Montresor Well good bye good bye he said as she came up to him I must go I m nearly asleep Tired with abusing me said Montresor nonchalantly turning round upon him No only with trying to make head or tail of you said Lackington gayly Then he stooped over Julie Take care of yourself Come back rosier and fatter I m perfectly well Let me come with you No don t trouble yourself For she had followed him into the hall and found his coat for him All the arrangements for her little evening had been of the simplest That had been a point of pride with her Madame Bornier and Therese dispensing tea and coffee in the dining room one hired parlor maid and she herself active and busy everywhere Certain French models were in her head and memories of her mother s bare little salon in Bruges with its good talk and its thinnest of thin refreshments a few cups of weak tea or glasses of eau sucree with a plate of patisserie The hired parlor maid was whistling for a cab in the service of some other departing guest so Julie herself put Lord Lackington into his coat much to his discomfort I don t think you ought to have come she said to him with soft reproach Why did you have that fainting fit before dinner I say Who s been telling tales Sir Wilfrid Bury met your son mister Chantrey at dinner Bill can never hold his tongue Oh it was nothing not with the proper treatment mind you Of course if the allopaths were to get their knives into me but thank God I m out of that galere Well in a fortnight isn t it We shall both be in town again I don t like saying good bye And he took both her hands in his It all seems so strange to me still so strange he murmured Next week I shall see mamma s grave said Julie under her breath Shall I put some flowers there for you The fine blue eyes above her wavered He bent to her Yes And write to me Come back soon Oh you ll see Things will all come right perfectly right in spite of Lady Henry Confidence encouragement a charming raillery an enthusiastic tenderness all these beamed upon her from the old man s tone and gesture She was puzzled But with another pressure of the hand he was gone She stood looking after him And as the carriage drove away the sound of the wheels hurt her It was the withdrawal of something protecting something more her own when all was said than anything else which remained to her As she returned to the drawing room doctor Meredith intercepted her You want me to send you some work to take abroad he said in a low voice I shall do nothing of the kind Why Because you ought to have a complete holiday Very well Then I sha n t be able to pay my way she said with a tired smile Remember the doctor s bills if you fall ill Ill I am never ill she said with scorn Then she looked round the room deliberately and her gaze returned to her companion I am not likely to be fatigued with society am I she added in a voice that did not attempt to disguise the bitterness within My dear lady you are hardly installed I have been here a month the critical month Now was the moment to stand by me or throw me over n est ce pas This is my first party my house warming I gave a fortnight s notice I asked about sixty people whom I knew well Some did not answer at all Of the rest half declined rather curtly in many instances And of those who accepted not all are here And oh how it dragged Meredith looked at her rather guiltily not knowing what to say It was true the evening had dragged In both their minds there rose the memory of Lady Henry s Wednesdays the beautiful rooms the varied and brilliant company the power and consideration which had attended Lady Henry s companion I suppose said Julie shrugging her shoulders I had been thinking of the French maitresses de salon like a fool of Mademoiselle de l Espinasse or Madame Mohl imagining that people would come to me for a cup of tea and an agreeable hour But in England it seems people must be paid to talk Talk is a business affair you give it for a consideration No no You ll build it up said Meredith In his heart of hearts he said to himself that she had not been herself that night Her wonderful social instincts her memory her adroitness had somehow failed her And from a hostess strained conscious and only artificially gay the little gathering had taken its note You have the old guard anyway added the journalist with a smile as he looked round the room The Duchess Delafield Montresor and his wife General McGill and three or four other old habitues of the Bruton Street evenings were scattered about the little drawing room General Fergus too was there had arrived early and was staying late His frank soldier s face the accent cheerful homely careless with which he threw off talk full of marrow talk only possible for all its simplicity to a man whose life had been already closely mingled with the fortunes of his country had done something to bind Julie s poor little party together Her eye rested on him with gratitude Then she replied to Meredith mister Montresor will scarcely come again What do you mean Ungrateful lady Montresor who has already sacrificed Lady Henry and the habits of thirty years to your beaux yeux That is what he will never forgive me said Julie sadly He has satisfied his pride and I have lost a friend Pessimist missus Montresor seemed to me most friendly Julie laughed She of course is enchanted Her husband has never been her own till now She married him subject to Lady Henry s rights But all that she will soon forget and my existence with it I won t argue It only makes you more stubborn said Meredith Ah still they come For the door opened to admit the tall figure of Major Warkworth Am I very late he said with a surprised look as he glanced at the thinly scattered room Julie greeted him and he excused himself on the ground of a dinner which had begun just an hour late owing to the tardiness of a cabinet minister Meredith observed the young man with some attention from the dark corner in which Julie had left him The gossip of the moment had reached him also but he had not paid much heed to it It seemed to him that no one knew anything first hand of the Moffatt affair And for himself he found it difficult to believe that Julie Le Breton was any man s dupe She must marry poor thing Of course she must marry Since it had been plain to him that she would never listen to his own suit this great hearted and clear brained man had done his best to stifle in himself all small or grasping impulses But this fellow with his inferior temper and morale alack why are the clever women such fools If only she had confided in him her old and tried friend he thought he could have put things before her so as to influence without offending her But he suffered had always suffered from the jealous reserve which underlay her charm her inborn tendency to secretiveness and intrigue Now as he watched her few words with Warkworth it seemed to him that he saw the signs of some hidden relation How flushed she was suddenly and her eyes so bright He was not allowed much time or scope however for observation Warkworth took a turn round the room chatted a little with this person and that then on the plea that he was off to Paris early on the following morning approached his hostess again to take his leave Ah yes you start to morrow said Montresor rising Well good luck to you good luck to you General Fergus too advanced The whole room indeed awoke to the situation and all the remaining guests grouped themselves round the young soldier Even the Duchess was thawed a little by this actual moment of departure After all the man was going on his country s service No child s play this mission I can assure you General McGill had said to her Warkworth will want all the powers he has of mind or body The slim young fellow so boyishly elegant in his well cut evening dress received the ovation offered to him with an evident pleasure which tried to hide itself in the usual English ways He had been very pale when he came in But his cheek reddened as Montresor grasped him by the hand as the two generals bade him a cordial godspeed as Sir Wilfrid gave him a jesting message for the British representative in Egypt and as the ladies present accorded him those flattering and admiring looks that woman keeps for valor Julie counted for little in these farewells She stood apart and rather silent They have had their good bye thought the Duchess with a thrill she could not help Three days in Paris said Sir Wilfrid A fortnight to Denga and then how long before you start for the interior Oh three weeks for collecting porters and supplies They re drilling the escort already We should be off by the middle of May A bad month said General Fergus shrugging his shoulders Unfortunately affairs won t wait But I am already stiff with quinine laughed Warkworth or I shall be by the time I get to Denga Good bye good bye And in another moment he was gone Miss Le Breton had given him her hand and wished him Bon voyage like everybody else The party broke up The Duchess kissed her Julie with peculiar tenderness Delafield pressed her hand and his deep kind eyes gave her a lingering look of which however she was quite unconscious Meredith renewed his half irritable half affectionate counsels of rest and recreation missus Montresor was conventionally effusive Montresor alone bade the mistress of the house a somewhat cold and perfunctory farewell Even Sir Wilfrid was a little touched he knew not why he vowed to himself that his report to Lady Henry on the morrow should contain no food for malice and inwardly he forgave Mademoiselle Julie the old romancings XVIII It was twenty minutes since the last carriage had driven away Julie was still waiting in the little hall pacing its squares of black and white marble slowly backward and forward There was a low knock on the door She opened it Warkworth appeared on the threshold and the high moon behind him threw a bright ray into the dim hall where all but one faint light had been extinguished She pointed to the drawing room I will come directly Let me just go and ask Leonie to sit up Warkworth went into the drawing room Julie opened the dining room door Madame Bornier was engaged in washing and putting away the china and glass which had been used for Julie s modest refreshments Leonie you won t go to bed Major Warkworth is here Madame Bornier did not raise her head How long will he be Perhaps half an hour It is already past midnight Leonie he goes to morrow Tres bien Mais sais tu ma chere ce n est pas convenable ce que tu fais la And the older woman straightening herself looked her foster sister full in the face A kind of watch dog anxiety a sulky protesting affection breathed from her rugged features Julie went up to her not angrily but rather with a pleading humility The two women held a rapid colloquy in low tones Madame Bornier remonstrating Julie softly getting her way Then Madame Bornier returned to her work and Julie went to the drawing room Warkworth sprang up as she entered Both paused and wavered Then he went up to her and roughly irresistibly drew her into his arms She held back a moment but finally yielded and clasping her hands round his neck she buried her face on his breast They stood so for some minutes absolutely silent save for her hurried breathing his head bowed upon hers Julie how can we say good bye he whispered at last She disengaged herself and seeing his face she tried for composure Come and sit down She led him to the window which he had thrown open as he entered the room and they sat beside it hand in hand A mild April night shone outside Gusts of moist air floated in upon them There were dim lights and shadows in the garden and on the shuttered facade of the great house Is it forever said Julie in a low stifled voice Good bye forever She felt his hand tremble but she did not look at him She seemed to be reciting words long since spoken in the mind You will be away perhaps a year Then you go back to India and then She paused Warkworth was physically conscious as it were of a letter he carried in his coat pocket a letter from Lady Blanche Moffatt which had reached him that morning the letter of a grande dame reduced to undignified remonstrance by sheer maternal terror terror for the health and life of a child as fragile and ethereal as a wild rose in May Reports had reached her but no they could not be true She bade him be thankful that not a breath of suspicion had yet touched Aileen As for herself let him write and reassure her at once Otherwise And the latter part of the letter conveyed a veiled menace that Warkworth perfectly understood No in that direction no escape his own past actions closed him in And henceforth it was clear he must walk more warily But how blame himself for these feelings of which he was now conscious towards Julie Le Breton the strongest probably that a man not built for passion would ever know His relation towards her had grown upon him unawares and now their own hands were about to cut it at the root What blame to either of them Fate had been at work and he felt himself glorified by a situation so tragically sincere and by emotions of which a month before he would have secretly held himself incapable Resolutely in this last meeting with Julie he gave these emotions play He possessed himself of her cold hands as she put her desolate question And then and kissed them fervently Julie if you and I had met a year ago what happened in India would never have happened You know that Do I But it only hurts me to think it away like that There it is it has happened She turned upon him suddenly Have you any picture of her He hesitated Yes he said at last Have you got it here Why do you ask dear one This one evening is ours And again he tried to draw her to him But she persisted I feel sure you have it Show it me Julie you and you only are in my thoughts Then do what I ask She bent to him with a wild entreating air her lips almost touched his cheek Unwillingly he drew out a letter case from his breast pocket and took from it a little photograph which he handed to her She looked at it with eager eyes A face framed as it were out of snow and fire lay in her hand a thing most delicate most frail yet steeped in feeling and significance a child s face with its soft curls of brown hair and the upper lip raised above the white small teeth as though in a young wonder yet behind its sweetness what suggestions of a poetic or tragic sensibility The slender neck carried the little head with girlish dignity the clear timid eyes seemed at once to shrink from and trust the spectator Julie returned the little picture and hid her face with her hands Warkworth watched her uncomfortably and at last drew her hands away What are you thinking of he said almost with violence Don t shut me out I am not jealous now she said looking at him piteously I don t hate her And if she knew all she couldn t hate me No one could hate her She is an angel But she is not my Julie he said vehemently and he thrust the little picture into his pocket again Tell me she said after a pause laying her hand on his knee when did you begin to think of me differently All the winter when we used to meet you never you never loved me then How placed as I was could I let myself think of love I only knew that I wanted to see you to talk to you to write to you that the day when we did not meet was a lost day Don t be so proud He tried to laugh at her You didn t think of me in any special way either You were much too busy making bishops or judges or academicians Oh Julie I was so afraid of you in those early days The first night we met she said passionately I found a carnation you had worn in your button hole I put it under my pillow and felt for it in the dark like a talisman You had stood between me and Lady Henry twice You had smiled at me and pressed my hand not as others did but as though you understood me myself as though at least you wished to understand Then came the joy of joys that I could help you that I could do something for you Ah how it altered life for me I never turned the corner of a street that I did not count on the chance of seeing you beyond suddenly on my path I never heard your voice that it did not thrill me from head to foot I never made a new friend or acquaintance that I did not ask myself first how I could thereby serve you I never saw you come into the room that my heart did not leap I never slept but you were in my dreams I loathed London when you were out of it It was paradise when you were there Straining back from him as he still held her hands her whole face and form shook with the energy of her confession Her wonderful hair loosened from the thin gold bands in which it had been confined during the evening fell in a glossy confusion about her brow and slender neck its black masses the melting brilliance of the eyes the tragic freedom of the attitude gave both to form and face a wild and poignant beauty Warkworth beside her was conscious first of amazement then of a kind of repulsion a kind of fear till all else was lost in a hurry of joy and gratitude The tears stood on his cheek Julie you shame me you trample me into the earth He tried to gather her in his arms but she resisted Caresses were not what those eyes demanded eyes feverishly bright with the memory of her own past dreams Presently indeed she withdrew herself from him She rose and closed the window she put the lamp in another place she brought her rebellious hair into order We must not be so mad she said with a quivering smile as she again seated herself but at some distance from him You see for me the great question is her voice became low and rapid What am I going to do with the future For you it is all plain We part to night You have your career your marriage I withdraw from your life absolutely But for me She paused It was the manner of one trying to see her way in the dark Your social gifts said Warkworth in agitation your friends Julie these will occupy your mind Then of course you will you must marry Oh you ll soon forget me Julie I pray you may My social gifts she repeated disregarding the rest of his speech I have told you already they have broken down Society sides with Lady Henry I am to be made to know my place I do know it The Duchess will fight for you She laughed The Duke won t let her nor shall I You ll marry he repeated with emotion You ll find some one worthy of you some one who will give you the great position for which you were born I could have it at any moment she said looking him quietly in the eyes Warkworth drew back conscious of a disagreeable shock He had been talking in generalities giving away the future with that fluent prodigality that easy prophecy which costs so little What did she mean Delafield he cried And he waited for her reply which lingered in a tense and growing eagerness The notion had crossed his mind once or twice during the winter only to be dismissed as ridiculous Then on the occasion of their first quarrel when Julie had snubbed him in Delafield s presence and to Delafield s advantage he had been conscious of a momentary alarm But Julie who on that one and only occasion had paraded her intimacy with Delafield thenceforward said not a word of him and Warkworth s jealousy had died for lack of fuel In relation to Julie Delafield had been surely the mere shadow and agent of his little cousin the Duchess a friendly knight errant sort of person with a liking for the distressed What the heir presumptive of Chudleigh Abbey and one of the most famous of English dukedoms when even he the struggling penurious officer would never have dreamed of such a match Julie meanwhile heard only jealousy in his exclamation and it caressed her ear her heart She was tempted once more woman like to dwell upon the other lover and again something compelling and delicate in her feeling towards Delafield forbade No you mustn t make me tell you any more she said putting the name aside with a proud gesture It would be poor and mean But it s true I have only to put out my hand for what you call a great position I have refused to put it out Sometimes of course it has dazzled me To night it seems to me dust and ashes No when we two have said good bye I shall begin life again And this time I shall live it in my own way for my own ends I m very tired Henceforth I ll walk where my own nature would be leading it vexes me to choose another guide And as she spoke the words of one of the chainless souls of history in a voice passionately full and rich she sprang to her feet and drawing her slender form to its full height she locked her hands behind her and began to pace the room with a wild free step Every nerve in Warkworth s frame was tingling He was carried out of himself first by the rebellion of her look and manner then by this fact so new so astounding which her very evasion had confirmed During her whole contest with Lady Henry and now in her present ambiguous position she had Delafield and through Delafield the English great world in the hollow of her hand This nameless woman no longer in her first youth And she had refused He watched her in a speechless wonder and incredulity The thought leaped And this sublime folly this madness was for me It stirred and intoxicated him Yet she was not thereby raised in his eyes Nay the contrary With the passion which was rapidly mounting in his veins there mingled poor Julie a curious diminution of respect Julie He held out his hand to her peremptorily Come to me again You are so wonderful to night in that white dress like a wild muse I shall always see you so Come She obeyed and gave him her hands standing beside his chair But her face was still absorbed To be free she said under her breath free like my parents from all these petty struggles and conventions Then she felt his kisses on her hands and her expression changed How we cheat ourselves with words she whispered trembling and withdrawing one hand she smoothed back the light brown curls from his brow with that protecting tenderness which had always entered into her love for him To night we are here together this one last night And to morrow at this time you ll be in Paris perhaps you ll be looking out at the lights and the crowds on the Boulevard and the chestnut trees They ll just be in their first leaf I know so well and the little thin leaves will be shining so green under the lamps and I shall be here and it will be all over and done with forever What will it matter whether I am free or not free I shall be alone That s all a woman knows Her voice died away Warkworth rose He put his arms round her and she did not resist Julie he said in her ear why should you be alone A silence fell between them I I don t understand she said at last Julie listen I shall be three days in Paris but my business can be perfectly done in one What if you met me there after to morrow What harm would it be We are not babes we two We understand life And who would have any right to blame or to meddle Julie I know a little inn in the valley of the Bievre quite near Paris but all wood and field No English tourists ever go there Sometimes an artist or two but this is not the time of year Julie why shouldn t we spend our last two days there together away from all the world before we say good bye You ve been afraid here of prying people of the Duchess even of Madame Bornier how she scowls at me sometimes Why shouldn t we sweep all that away and be happy Nobody should ever nobody could ever know His voice dropped became still more hurried and soft We might go as brother and sister that would be quite simple You are practically French I speak French well Who is to have an idea a suspicion of our identity The spring there is mild and warm The Bois de Verrieres close by is full of flowers When my father was alive and I was a child we went once to economize for a year to a village a mile or two away But I knew this place quite well A lovely green quiet spot With your poetical ideas Julie you would delight in it Two days wandering in the woods together Then I put you into the train for Brussels and I go my way But to all eternity Julie those days will have been ours At the first words almost Julie had disengaged herself Pushing him from her with both hands she listened to him in a dumb amazement The color first deserted her face then returned in a flood So you despise me she said catching her breath No I adore you She fell upon a chair and hid her eyes He first knelt beside her arguing and soothing then he paced up and down before her talking very fast and low defending and developing the scheme till it stood before them complete and tempting in all its details Julie did not look up nor did she speak At last Warkworth full of tears and stifled with his own emotions threw open the window again in a craving for air and coolness A scent of fresh leaves and moistened earth floated up from the shrubbery beneath the window The scent the branching trees the wide mild spaces of air brought relief He leaned out bathing his brow in the night A tumult of voices seemed to be echoing through his mind dominated by one which held the rest defiantly in check Is she a mere girl to be led astray A moment of happiness what harm for either of us Then he returned to Julie Julie He touched her shoulder trembling Had she banished him forever It seemed to him that in these minutes he had passed through an infinity of experience Was he not the nobler the more truly man Let the moralists talk Julie he repeated in an anguish She raised her head and he saw that she had been crying But there was in her face a light a wildness a yearning that reassured him She put her arm round him and pressed her cheek to his He divined that she too had lived and felt a thousand hours in one With a glow of ecstatic joy he began to talk to her again her head resting on his shoulder her slender hands crushed in his And Julie meanwhile was saying to herself Either I go to him as he asks or in a few minutes I must send him away forever And then as she clung to him so warm and near her strength failed her Nothing in the world mattered to her at that moment but this handsome curly head bowed upon her own this voice that called her all the names of love this transformation of the man s earlier prudence or ambition or duplicity into this eager tenderness this anguish in separation Listen dear He whispered to her All my business can be got through the day before you come I have two men to see A day will be ample I dine at the Embassy to morrow night that is arranged the day after I lunch with the Military Secretary then a thousand regrets but I must hurry on to meet some friends in Italy So I turn my back on Paris and for two days I belong to Julie and she to me Say yes Julie my Julie He bent over her his hands framing her face Say yes he urged and put off for both of us that word alone His low voice sank into her heart He waited till his strained sense caught the murmured words which conveyed to him the madness and the astonishment of victory Leonie had shut up the house in a grim silence and had taken her way up stairs to bed Julie too was in her room She sat on the edge of her bed her head drooped her hands clasped before her absently like Hope still listening for the last sounds of the harp of life The candle beside her showed her in the big mirror opposite her grace the white confusion of her dress She had expected reaction but it did not come She was still borne on a warm tide of will and energy All that she was about to do seemed to her still perfectly natural and right Petty scruples conventional hesitations the refusal of life s great moments these are what are wrong these are what disgrace Romance beckoned to her and many a secret tendency towards the lawless paths of conduct infused into her by the associations and affections of her childhood The horror naturalis which protects the great majority of women from the wilder ways of passion was in her weakened or dormant She was the illegitimate child of a mother who had defied law for love and of that fact she had been conscious all her life A sharp contempt indeed arose within her for the interpretation that the common mind would be sure to place upon her action What matter I am my own mistress responsible to no one I choose for myself I dare for myself And when at last she rose first loosening and then twisting the black masses of her hair it seemed to her that the form in the glass was that of another woman treading another earth She trampled cowardice under foot she freed herself from was uns alle baendigt das Gemeine Then as she stood before the oval mirror in a classical frame which adorned the mantel piece of what had once been Lady Mary Leicester s room her eye was vaguely caught by the little family pictures and texts which hung on either side of it Lady Mary and her sister as children their plain faces emerging timidly from their white high waisted frocks Lady Mary s mother an old lady in a white coif and kerchief wearing a look austerely kind on the other side a clergyman perhaps the brother of the old lady with a similar type of face though gentler a face nourished on the Christian Year and above and below them two or three card board texts carefully illuminated by Lady Mary Leicester herself Thou Lord knowest my down sitting and my uprising Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow Fear not little flock It is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom Julie observed these fragments absently at first then with repulsion This Anglican pietism so well fed so narrowly sheltered which measured the universe with its foot rule seemed to her quasi Catholic eye merely fatuous and hypocritical It is not by such forces she thought that the true world of men and women is governed As she turned away she noticed two little Catholic pictures such as she had been accustomed in her convent days to carry in her books of devotion carefully propped up beneath the texts Ah Therese she said to herself with a sudden feeling of pain Is the child asleep She listened A little cough sounded from the neighboring room Julie crossed the landing Therese tu ne dors pas encore A voice said softly in the darkness Je t attendais mademoiselle Julie went to the child s bed put down her candle and stooped to kiss her The child s thin hand caressed her cheek Ah it will be good to be in Bruges with mademoiselle Julie drew herself away I sha n t be there to morrow dear Not there Oh mademoiselle The child s voice was pitiful I shall join you there But I find I must go to Paris first I I have some business there But maman said Yes I have only just made up my mind I shall tell maman to morrow morning You go alone mademoiselle Why not dear goose Vous etes fatiguee I would like to come with you and carry your cloak and the umbrellas You indeed said Julie It would end wouldn t it in my carrying you besides the cloak and the umbrellas Then she knelt down beside the child and took her in her arms Do you love me Therese The child drew a long breath With her little twisted hands she stroked the beautiful hair so close to her Do you Therese A kiss fell on Julie s cheek Ce soir j ai beaucoup prie la Sainte Vierge pour vous she said in a timid and hurried whisper Julie made no immediate reply She rose from her knees her hand still clasped in that of the crippled girl Did you put those pictures on my mantel piece Therese Yes Why The child hesitated It does one good to look at them n est ce pas when one is sad Why do you suppose I am sad Therese was silent a moment then she flung her little skeleton arms round Julie and Julie felt her crying Well I won t be sad any more said Julie comforting her When we re all in Bruges together you ll see And smiling at the child she tucked her into her white bed and left her Then from this exquisite and innocent affection she passed back into the tumult of her own thoughts and plans Through the restless night her parents were often in her mind She was the child of revolt and as she thought of the meeting before her she seemed to be but entering upon a heritage inevitable from the beginning A sense of enfranchisement of passionate enlargement upheld her as of a life coming to its fruit Creil A flashing vision of a station and its lights and the Paris train rushed on through cold showers of sleet and driving wind a return of winter in the heart of spring On they sped through the half hour which still divided them from the Gare du Nord Julie in her thick veil sat motionless in her corner She was not conscious of any particular agitation Her mind was strained not to forget any of Warkworth s directions She was to drive across immediately to the Gare de Sceaux in the Place Denfert Rochereau where he would meet her They were to dine at an obscure inn near the station and go down by the last train to the little town in the wooded valley of the Bievre where they were to stay She had her luggage with her in the carriage There would be no custom house delays Ah the lights of Paris beginning She peered into the rain conscious of a sort of home coming joy She loved the French world and the French sights and sounds these tall dingy houses of the banlieue the dregs of a great architecture the advertisements the look of the streets The train slackened into the Nord Station The blue frocked porters crowded into the carriages C est tout madame Vous n avez pas de grands bagages No nothing Find me a cab at once There was a great crowd outside She hurried on as quickly as she could revolving what was to be said if any acquaintance were to accost her By great good luck and by travelling second class both in the train and on the boat she had avoided meeting anybody she knew But the Nord Station was crowded with English people and she pushed her way through in a nervous terror Miss Le Breton She turned abruptly In the white glare of the electric lights she did not at first recognize the man who had spoken to her Then she drew back Her heart beat wildly For she had distinguished the face of Jacob Delafield He came forward to meet her as she passed the barrier at the end of the platform his aspect full of what seemed to her an extraordinary animation significance as though she were expected Miss Le Breton What an astonishing what a fortunate meeting I have a message for you from Evelyn From Evelyn She echoed the words mechanically as she shook hands Wait a moment he said leading her aside towards the waiting room while the crowd that was going to the douane passed them by Then he turned to Julie s porter Attendez un instant The man sulkily shook his head dropped Julie s bag at their feet and hurried off in search of a more lucrative job I am going back to night added Delafield hurriedly How strange that I should have met you for I have very sad news for you Lord Lackington had an attack this morning from which he cannot recover The doctors give him perhaps forty eight hours He has asked for you urgently The Duchess tells me so in a long telegram I had from her to day But she supposed you to be in Bruges She has wired there You will go back will you not Go back said Julie staring at him helplessly Go back to night The evening train starts in little more than an hour You would be just in time I think to see the old man alive She still looked at him in bewilderment at the blue eyes under the heavily moulded brows and the mouth with its imperative and yet eager or tremulous expression She perceived that he hung upon her answer She drew her hand piteously across her eyes as though to shut out the crowds the station and the urgency of this personality beside her Despair was in her heart How to consent How to refuse But my friends she stammered the friends with whom I was going to stay they will be alarmed Could you not telegraph to them They would understand surely The office is close by She let herself be hurried along not knowing what to do Delafield walked beside her If she had been able to observe him she must have been struck afresh by the pale intensity the controlled agitation of his face Is it really so serious she asked pausing a moment as though in resistance It is the end Of that there can be no question You have touched his heart very deeply He longs to see her Evelyn says And his daughter and granddaughter are still abroad Miss Moffatt indeed is ill at Florence with a touch of diphtheria He is alone with his two sons You will go Even in her confusion the strangeness of it all was borne in upon her his insistence the extraordinary chance of their meeting his grave commanding manner How could you know I was here she said in bewilderment I didn t know he said slowly But thank God I have met you I dread to think of your fatigue but you will be glad just to see him again just to give him his last wish won t you he said pleadingly Here is the telegraph office Shall I do it for you No thank you I I must think how to word it Please wait She went in alone As she took the pencil into her hands a low groan burst from her lips The man writing in the next compartment turned round in astonishment She controlled herself and began to write There was no escape She must submit and all was over She telegraphed to Warkworth care of the Chef de Gare at the Sceaux Station and also to the country inn Have met mister Delafield by chance at Nord Station Lord Lackington dying Must return to night Where shall I write Good bye When it was done she could hardly totter out of the office Delafield made her take his arm You must have some food Then I will go and get a sleeping car for you to Calais There will be no crowd to night At Calais I will look after you if you will allow me You are crossing to night she said vaguely Her lips framed the words with difficulty Yes I came over with my cousins yesterday She asked nothing more It did not occur to her to notice that he had no luggage no bag no rug none of the paraphernalia of travel In her despairing fatigue and misery she let him guide her as he would He made her take some soup then some coffee all that she could make herself swallow There was a dismal period of waiting during which she was hardly conscious of where she was or of what was going on round her Then she found herself in the sleeping car in a reserved compartment alone Once more the train moved through the night The miles flew by the miles that forever parted her from Warkworth XIX The train was speeding through the forest country of Chantilly A pale moon had risen and beneath its light the straight forest roads interminably long stretched into the distance the vaporous masses of young and budding trees hurried past the eye of the traveller so also the white hamlets already dark and silent the stations with their lights and figures the great wood piles beside the line Delafield in his second class carriage sat sleepless and erect The night was bitterly cold He wore the light overcoat in which he had left the Hotel du Rhin that afternoon for a stroll before dinner and had no other wrap or covering But he felt nothing was conscious of nothing but the rushing current of his own thoughts The events of the two preceding days the meaning of them the significance of his own action and its consequences it was with these materials that his mind dealt perpetually combining interpreting deducing now in one way now in another His mood contained both excitement and dread But with a main temper of calmness courage invincible determination these elements did not at all interfere The day before he had left London with his cousins the Duke of Chudleigh and young Lord Elmira the invalid boy They were bound to Paris to consult a new doctor and Jacob had offered to convey them there In spite of all the apparatus of servants and couriers with which they were surrounded they always seemed to him on their journeys a singularly lonely and hapless pair and he knew that they leaned upon him and prized his company On the way to Paris at the Calais buffet he had noticed Henry Warkworth and had given him a passing nod It had been understood the night before in Heribert Street that they would both be crossing on the morrow On the following day the day of Julie s journey Delafield who was anxiously awaiting the return of his two companions from their interview with the great physician they were consulting was strolling up the Rue de la Paix just before luncheon when outside the Hotel Mirabeau he ran into a man whom he immediately perceived to be Warkworth Politeness involved the exchange of a few sentences although a secret antagonism between the two men had revealed itself from the first day of their meeting in Lady Henry s drawing room Each word of their short conversation rang clearly through Delafield s memory You are at the Rhin said Warkworth Yes for a couple more days Shall we meet at the Embassy to morrow No I dined there last night My business here is done I start for Rome to night Lucky man They have put on a new fast train haven t they Yes You leave the Gare de Lyon at seven point fifteen and you are at Rome the second morning in good time Magnificent Why don t we all rush south Well good bye again and good luck They touched hands perfunctorily and parted This happened about mid day While Delafield and his cousins were lunching a telegram from the Duchess of Crowborough was handed to Jacob He had wired to her early in the morning to ask for the address in Paris of an old friend of his who was also a cousin of hers The telegram contained Thirty six Avenue Friedland Lord Lackington heart attack this morning Dying Has asked urgently for Julie Blanche Moffatt detained Florence by daughter s illness All circumstances most sad Woman Heribert Street gave me Bruges address Have wired Julie there The message set vibrating in Delafield s mind the tender memory which already existed there of his last talk with Julie of her strange dependence and gentleness her haunting and pleading personality He hoped with all his heart she might reach the old man in time that his two sons Uredale and William would treat her kindly and that it would be found when the end came that he had made due provision for her as his granddaughter But he had small leisure to give to thoughts of this kind The physician s report in the morning had not been encouraging and his two travelling companions demanded all the sympathy and support he could give them He went out with them in the afternoon to the Hotel de la Terrasse at saint Germain The Duke a nervous hypochondriac could not sleep in the noise of Paris and was accustomed to a certain apartment in this well known hotel which was often reserved for him Jacob left them about six o clock to return to Paris He was to meet one of the Embassy attaches an old Oxford friend at the Cafe Gaillard for dinner He dressed at the Rhin put on an overcoat and set out to walk to the Rue Gaillard about half past seven As he approached the Mirabeau he saw a cab with luggage standing at the door A man came out with the hotel concierge To his astonishment Delafield recognized Warkworth The young officer seemed in a hurry and out of temper At any rate he jumped into the cab without taking any notice of the two sommeliers and the concierge who stood round expectant of francs and when the concierge in his stiffest manner asked where the man was to drive Warkworth put his head out of the window and said hastily to the cocher D abord a la Gare de Sceaux Puis je vous dirai Mais depechez vous The cab rolled away and Delafield walked on Half past seven striking from all the Paris towers And Warkworth s intention in the morning was to leave the Gare de Lyon at seven point fifteen But it seemed he was now bound at seven point thirty for the Gare de Sceaux from which point of departure it was clear that no reasonable man would think of starting for the Eternal City D abord a la Gare de Sceaux Then he was not catching a train at any rate immediately He had some other business first and was perhaps going to the station to deposit his luggage Suddenly a thought a suspicion flashed through Delafield s mind which set his heart thumping in his breast In after days he was often puzzled to account for its origin still more for the extraordinary force with which it at once took possession of all his energies In his more mystical moments of later life he rose to the secret belief that God had spoken to him At any rate he at once hailed a cab and thinking no more of his dinner engagement he drove post haste to the Nord Station In those days the Calais train arrived at eight He reached the station a few minutes before it appeared When at last it drew up amid the crowd on the platform it took him only a few seconds to distinguish the dark and elegant head of Julie Le Breton A pang shot through him that pierced to the very centre of life He was conscious of a prayer for help and a clear mind But on his way to the station he had rapidly thought out a plan on which to act should this mad notion in his brain turn out to have any support in reality It had so much support that Julie Le Breton was there in Paris and not at Bruges as she had led the Duchess to suppose And when she turned her startled face upon him his wild fancy became for himself a certainty Amiens Cinq minutes d arret Delafield got out and walked up and down the platform He passed the closed and darkened windows of the sleeping car and it seemed to his abnormally quickened sense that he was beside her bending over her and that he said to her Courage You are saved Let us thank God A boy from the refreshment room came along wheeling a barrow on which were tea and coffee Delafield eagerly drank a cup of tea and put his hand into his pocket to pay for it He found there three francs and his ticket After paying for the tea he examined his purse That contained an English half crown So he had had with him just enough to get his own second class ticket her first class and a sleeping car That was good fortune seeing that the bulk of his money with his return ticket was reposing in his dressing case at the Hotel du Rhin En voiture En voiture s il vous plait He settled himself once more in his corner and the train rushed on This time it was the strange hour at the Gare du Nord which he lived through again her white face opposite to him in the refreshment room the bewilderment and misery she had been so little able to conceal her spasmodic attempts at conversation a few vague words about Lord Lackington or the Duchess and then pauses when her great eyes haggard and weary stared into vacancy and he knew well enough that her thoughts were with Warkworth and that she was in fierce rebellion against his presence there and this action into which he had forced her As for him he perfectly understood the dilemma in which she stood Either she must accept the duty of returning to the death bed of the old man her mother s father or she must confess her appointment with Warkworth Yet suppose he had been mistaken Well the telegram from the Duchess covered his whole action Lord Lackington was dying and apart from all question of feeling Julie Le Breton s friends must naturally desire that he should see her acknowledge her before his two sons and with their consent provide for her before his death But ah he had not been mistaken He remembered her hurried refusal when he had asked her if he should telegraph for her to her Paris friends how in a sudden shame he had turned away that he might not see the beloved false face as she spoke might not seem to watch or suspect her He had just had time to send off a messenger first to his friend at the Cafe Gaillard and then to the Hotel du Rhin before escorting her to the sleeping car Ah how piteous had been that dull bewilderment with which she had turned to him But my ticket Here they are Oh never mind we will settle in town Try to sleep You must be very tired And then it seemed to him that her lips trembled like those of a miserable child and surely surely she must hear that mad beating of his pulse Boulogne was gone in a flash Here was the Somme stretched in a pale silver flood beneath the moon a land of dunes and stunted pines of wide sea marshes over which came the roar of the Channel Then again the sea was left behind and the rich Picard country rolled away to right and left Lights here and there in cottage or villa the lights perhaps of birth or death companions of hope or despair Calais The train moved slowly up to the boat side Delafield jumped out The sleeping car was yielding up its passengers He soon made out the small black hat and veil the slender form in the dark travelling dress Was she fainting For she seemed to him to waver as he approached her and the porter who had taken her rugs and bag was looking at her in astonishment In an instant he had drawn her arm within his and was supporting her as he best could The car was very hot and I am so tired I only want some air They reached the deck You will go down stairs No no some air she murmured and he saw that she could hardly keep her feet But in a few moments they had reached the shelter on the upper deck usually so well filled with chairs and passengers on a day crossing Now it was entirely deserted The boat was not full the night was cold and stormy and the stream of passengers had poured down into the shelter of the lower deck Julie sank into a chair Delafield hurriedly loosened the shawl she carried with her from its attendant bag and umbrella and wrapped it round her It will be a rough crossing he said in her ear Can you stand it on deck I am a good sailor Let me stay here Her eyes closed He stooped over her in an anguish One of the boat officials approached him Madame ferait mieux de descendre monsieur La traversee ne sera pas bonne Delafield explained that the lady must have air and was a good sailor Then he pressed into the man s hand his three francs and sent him for brandy and an extra covering of some kind The man went unwillingly During the whole bustle of departure Delafield saw nothing but Julie s helpless and motionless form he heard nothing but the faint words by which once or twice she tried to convey to him that she was not unconscious The brandy came The man who brought it again objected to Julie s presence on deck Delafield took no heed He was absorbed in making Julie swallow some of the brandy At last they were off The vessel glided slowly out of the old harbor and they were immediately in rough water Delafield was roused by a peremptory voice at his elbow This lady ought not to stay here sir There is plenty of room in the ladies cabin Delafield looked up and recognized the captain of the boat the same man who thirty six hours before had shown special civilities to the Duke of Chudleigh and his party Ah you are Captain Whittaker he said The shrewd stout man who had accosted him raised his eyebrows in astonishment Delafield drew him aside a moment After a short conversation the captain lifted his cap and departed with a few words to the subordinate officer who had drawn his attention to the matter Henceforward they were unmolested and presently the officer brought a pillow and striped blanket saying they might be useful to the lady Julie was soon comfortably placed lying down on the seat under the wooden shelter Delicacy seemed to suggest that her companion should leave her to herself Jacob walked up and down briskly trying to shake off the cold which benumbed him Every now and then he paused to look at the lights on the receding French coast at its gray phantom line sweeping southward under the stormy moon or disappearing to the north in clouds of rain There was a roar of waves and a dashing of spray The boat not a large one was pitching heavily and the few male passengers who had at first haunted the deck soon disappeared Delafield hung over the surging water in a strange exaltation half physical half moral The wild salt strength and savor of the sea breathed something akin to that passionate force of will which had impelled him to the enterprise in which he stood No mere man of the world could have dared it most men of the world as he was well aware would have condemned or ridiculed it But for one who saw life and conduct sub specie aeternitatis it had seemed natural enough The wind blew fierce and cold He made his way back to Julie s side To his surprise she had raised herself and was sitting propped up against the corner of the seat her veil thrown back You are better he said stooping to her so as to be heard against the boom of the waves This rough weather does not affect you She made a negative sign He drew his camp stool beside her Suddenly she asked him what time it was The haggard nobleness of her pale face amid the folds of black veil the absent passion of the eye thrilled to his heart Where were her thoughts Nearly four o clock He drew out his watch You see it is beginning to lighten And he pointed to the sky in which that indefinable lifting of the darkness which precedes the dawn was taking place and to the far distances of sea where a sort of livid clarity was beginning to absorb and vanquish that stormy play of alternate dark and moonlight which had prevailed when they left the French shore He had hardly spoken when he felt that her eyes were fixed upon him To look at his watch he had thrown open his long Newmarket coat forgetting that in so doing he disclosed the evening dress in which he had robed himself at the Hotel du Rhin for his friend s dinner at the Cafe Gaillard He hastily rebuttoned his coat and turned his face seaward once more But he heard her voice and was obliged to come close to her that he might catch the words You have given me your wraps she said with difficulty You will suffer Not at all You have your own rug and one that the captain provided I keep myself quite warm with moving about There was a pause His mind began to fill with alarm He was not of the men who act a part with ease but having got through so far he had calculated on preserving his secret Flight was best and he was just turning away when a gesture of hers arrested him Again he stooped till their faces were near enough to let her voice reach him Why are you in evening dress I had intended to dine with a friend There was not time to change Then you did not mean to cross to night He delayed a moment trying to collect his thoughts Not when I dressed for dinner but some sudden news decided me Her head fell back wearily against the support behind it The eyes closed and he thinking she would perhaps sleep was about to rise from his seat when the pressure of her hand upon his arm detained him He sat still and the hand was withdrawn There was a lessening of the roar in their ears Under the lee of the English shore the wind was milder the terror music of the sea less triumphant And over everything was stealing the first discriminating touch of the coming light Her face was clear now and Delafield at last venturing to look at her saw that her eyes were open again and trembled at their expression There was in them a wild suspicion Secretly steadily he nerved himself to meet the blow that he foresaw mister Delafield have you told me all the truth She sat up as she spoke deadly pale but rigid With an impatient hand she threw off the wraps which had covered her Her face commanded an answer Certainly I have told you the truth Was it the whole truth It seems it seems to me that you were not prepared yourself for this journey that there is some mystery which I do not understand which I resent But what mystery When I saw you I of course thought of Evelyn s telegram I should like to see that telegram He hesitated If he had been more skilled in the little falsehoods of every day he would simply have said that he had left it at the hotel But he lost his chance Nor at the moment did he clearly perceive what harm it would do to show it to her The telegram was in his pocket and he handed it to her There was a dim oil lamp in the shelter With difficulty she held the fluttering paper up and just divined the words Then the wind carried it away and blew it overboard He rose and leaned against the edge of the shelter looking down upon her There was in his mind a sense of something solemn approaching round which this sudden lull of blast and wave seemed to draw a wind warm space closing them in Why did you come with me she persisted in an agitation she could now scarcely control It is evident you had not meant to travel You have no luggage and you are in evening dress And I remember now you sent two letters from the station I wished to be your escort Her gesture was almost one of scorn at the evasion Why were you at the station at all Evelyn had told you I was at Bruges And you were dining out I I can t understand She spoke with a frowning intensity a strange queenliness in which was neither guilt nor confusion A voice spoke in Delafield s heart Tell her it said He bent nearer to her Miss Le Breton with what friends were you going to stay in Paris She breathed quick I am not a school girl I think that I should be asked questions of that kind But on your answer depends mine She looked at him in amazement His gentle kindness had disappeared She saw instead that Jacob Delafield whom her instinct had divined from the beginning behind the modest and courteous outer man the Jacob Delafield of whom she had told the Duchess she was afraid But her passion swept every other thought out of its way With dim agony and rage she began to perceive that she had been duped mister Delafield she tried for calm I don t understand your attitude but so far as I do understand it I find it intolerable If you have deceived me I have not deceived you Lord Lackington is dying But that is not why you were at the station she repeated passionately Why did you meet the English train Her eyes clear now in the cold light shone upon him imperiously Again the inner voice said Speak get away from conventionalities Speak soul to soul He sat down once more beside her His gaze sought the ground Then with sharp suddenness he looked her in the face Miss Le Breton you were going to Paris to meet Major Warkworth She drew back And if I was she said with a wild defiance I had to prevent it that was all His tone was calm and resolution itself Who who gave you authority over me One may save even by violence You were too precious to be allowed to destroy yourself His look so sad and strong the look of a deep compassion fastened itself upon her He felt himself indeed possessed by a force not his own that same force which in its supreme degree made of saint Francis the great tamer of souls Who asked you to be our judge Neither I nor Major Warkworth owe you anything No But I owed you help as a man as your friend The truth was somehow borne in upon me You were risking your honor I threw myself in the way Every word seemed to madden her What what could you know of the circumstances cried her choked laboring voice It is unpardonable an outrage You know nothing either of him or of me She clasped her hands to her breast in a piteous magnificent gesture as though she were defending her lover and her love I know that you have suffered much he said dropping his eyes before her but you would suffer infinitely more if If you had not interfered Her veil had fallen over her face again She flung it back in impatient despair mister Delafield I can do without your anxieties But not he spoke slowly without your own self respect Julie s face trembled She hid it in her hands Go she said Go He went to the farther end of the ship and stood there motionless looking towards the land but seeing nothing On all sides the darkness was lifting and in the distance there gleamed already the whiteness that was Dover His whole being was shaken with that experience which comes so rarely to cumbered and superficial men the intimate wrestle of one personality with another It seemed to him he was not worthy of it After some little time when only a quarter of an hour lay between the ship and Dover pier he went back to Julie She was sitting perfectly still her hands clasped in front of her her veil drawn down May I say one word to you he said gently She did not speak It is this What I have confessed to you to night is of course buried between us It is as though it had never been said I have given you pain I ask your pardon from the bottom of my heart and at the same time his voice trembled I thank God that I had the courage to do it She threw him a glance that showed her a quivering lip and the pallor of intense emotion I know you think you were right she said in a voice dull and strained but henceforth we can only be enemies You have tyrannized over me in the name of standards that you revere and I reject I can only beg you to let my life alone for the future He said nothing She rose dizzily to her feet They were rapidly approaching the pier Illustration HER HANDS CLASPED IN FRONT OF HER With the cold aloofness of one who feels it more dignified to submit than to struggle she allowed him to assist her in landing He put her into the Victoria train travelling himself in another carriage As he walked beside her down the platform of Victoria Station she said to him I shall be obliged if you will tell Evelyn that I have returned I go to her at once She suddenly paused and he saw that she was looking helplessly at one of the newspaper placards of the night before First among its items appeared Critical state of Lord Lackington He hardly knew how far she would allow him to have any further communication with her but her pale exhaustion made it impossible not to offer to serve her It would be early to go for news now he said gently It would disturb the house But in a couple of hours from now the station clock pointed to six point fifteen if you will allow me I will leave the morning bulletin at your door She hesitated You must rest or you will have no strength for nursing he continued in the same studiously guarded tone But if you would prefer another messenger I have none and she raised her hand to her brow in mute unconscious confession of an utter weakness and bewilderment Then let me go he said softly It seemed to him that she was so physically weary as to be incapable either of assent or resistance He put her into her cab and gave the driver his directions She looked at him uncertainly But he did not offer his hand From those blue eyes of his there shot out upon her one piercing glance manly entreating sad He lifted his hat and was gone XX Jacob what brings you back so soon The Duchess ran into the room a trim little figure in her morning dress of blue and white cloth with her small spitz leaping beside her Delafield advanced I came to tell you that I got your telegram yesterday and that in the evening by an extraordinary and fortunate chance I met Miss Le Breton in Paris You met Julie in Paris echoed the Duchess in astonishment She had come to spend a couple of days with some friends there before going on to Bruges I gave her the news of Lord Lackington s illness and she at once turned back She was much fatigued and distressed and the night was stormy I put her into the sleeping car and came back myself to see if I could be any assistance to her And at Calais I was of some use The crossing was very rough Julie was in Paris repeated the Duchess as though she had heard nothing else of what he had been saying Her eyes so blue and large in her small irregular face sought those of her cousin and endeavored to read them It seems to have been a rapid change of plan And it was a great stroke of luck my meeting her But how and where Oh there is no time for going into that said Delafield impatiently But I knew you would like to know that she was here after your message yesterday We arrived a little after six this morning About nine I went for news to saint James s Square There is a slight rally Did you see Lord Uredale Did you say anything about Julie asked the Duchess eagerly I merely asked at the door and took the bulletin to Miss Le Breton Will you see Uredale and arrange it I gather you saw him yesterday By all means said the Duchess musing Oh it was so curious yesterday Lord Lackington had just told them You should have seen those two men The sons The Duchess nodded They don t like it They were as stiff as pokers But they will do absolutely the right thing They see at once that she must be provided for And when he asked for her they told me to telegraph if I could find out where she was Well of all the extraordinary chances She looked at him again oddly a spot of red on either small cheek Delafield took no notice He was pacing up and down apparently in thought Suppose you take her there he said pausing abruptly before her To saint James s Square What did you tell her That he was a trifle better and that you would come to her Yes it would be hard for her to go alone said the Duchess reflectively She looked at her watch Only a little after eleven Ring please Jacob The carriage was ordered Meanwhile the little lady inquired eagerly after her Julie Had she been exhausted by the double journey Was she alone in Paris or was Madame Bornier with her Jacob had understood that Madame Bornier and the little girl had gone straight to Bruges The Duchess looked down and then looked up Did did you come across Major Warkworth Yes I saw him for a moment in the Rue de la Paix He was starting for Rome The Duchess turned away as though ashamed of her question and gave her orders for the carriage Then her attention was suddenly drawn to her cousin How pale you look Jacob she said approaching him Won t you have something some wine Delafield refused declaring that all he wanted was an hour or two s sleep I go back to Paris to morrow he said as he prepared to take his leave Will you be here to night if I look in Alack we go to Scotland to night It was just a piece of luck that you found me this morning Freddie is fuming to get away Delafield paused a moment Then he abruptly shook hands and went He wants news of what happens at saint James s Square thought the Duchess suddenly and she ran after him to the top of the stairs Jacob If you don t mind a horrid mess to night Freddie and I shall be dining alone of course we must have something to eat Somewhere about eight Do look in There ll be a cutlet on a trunk anyway Delafield laughed hesitated and finally accepted The Duchess went back to the drawing room not a little puzzled and excited It s very very odd she said to herself And what is the matter with Jacob Half an hour later she drove to the splendid house in saint James s Square where Lord Lackington lay dying She asked for Lord Uredale the eldest son and waited in the library till he came He was a tall squarely built man with fair hair already gray and somewhat absent and impassive manners At sight of him the Duchess s eyes filled with tears She hurried to him her soft nature dissolved in sympathy How is your father A trifle easier though the doctors say there is no real improvement But he is quite conscious knows us all I have just been reading him the debate You told me yesterday he had asked for Miss Le Breton said the Duchess raising herself on tiptoe as though to bring her low tones closer to his ear She s here in town I mean She came back from Paris last night Lord Uredale showed no emotion of any kind Emotion was not in his line Then my father would like to see her he said in a dry ordinary voice which jarred upon the sentimental Duchess When shall I bring her He is now comfortable and resting If you are free The Duchess replied that she would go to Heribert Street at once As Lord Uredale took her to her carriage a young man ran down the steps hastily raised his hat and disappeared Lord Uredale explained that he was the husband of the famous young beauty missus Delaray whose portrait Lord Lackington had been engaged upon at the time of his seizure Having been all his life a skilful artist a man of fashion and a harmless haunter of lovely women Lord Lackington as the Duchess knew had all but completed a gallery of a hundred portraits representing the beauty of the reign missus Delaray s would have been the hundredth in a series of which missus Norton was the first He has been making arrangements with the husband to get it finished said Lord Uredale it has been on his mind The Duchess shivered a little He knows he won t finish it Quite well And he still thinks of those things Yes or politics said Lord Uredale smiling faintly I have written to mister Montresor There are two or three points my father wants to discuss with him And he is not depressed or troubled about himself Not in the least He will be grateful if you will bring him Miss Le Breton Julie my darling are you fit to come with me The Duchess held her friend in her arms soothing and caressing her How forlorn was the little house under its dust sheets on this rainy spring morning And Julie amid the dismantled drawing room stood spectrally white and still listening with scarcely a word in reply to the affection or the pity or the news which the Duchess poured out upon her Shall we go now I am quite ready And she withdrew herself from the loving grasp which held her and put on her hat and gloves You ought to be in bed said the Duchess Those night journeys are too abominable Even Jacob looks a wreck But what an extraordinary chance Julie that Jacob should have found you How did you come across each other At the Nord Station said Julie as she pinned her veil before the glass over the mantel piece Some instinct silenced the Duchess She asked no more questions and they started for saint James s Square You won t mind if I don t talk said Julie leaning back and closing her eyes I seem still to have the sea in my ears The Duchess looked at her tenderly clasping her hand close and the carriage rolled along But just before they reached saint James s Square Julie hastily raised the fingers which held her own and kissed them Oh Julie said the Duchess reproachfully I don t like you to do that She flushed and frowned It was she who ought to pay such acts of homage not Julie Father Miss Le Breton is here Let her come in Jack and the Duchess too Lord Uredale went back to the door Two figures came noiselessly into the room the Duchess in front with Julie s hand in hers Lord Lackington was propped up in bed and breathing fast But he smiled as they approached him This is good bye dear Duchess he said in a whisper as she bent over him Then with a spark of his old gayety in the eyes I should be a cur to grumble Life has been very agreeable Ah Julie Julie dropped gently on her knees beside him and laid her cheek against his arm At the mention of her name the old man s face had clouded as though the thoughts she called up had suddenly rebuked his words to the Duchess He feebly moved his hands towards hers and there was silence in the room for a few moments Uredale Yes father This is Rose s daughter His eyes lifted themselves to those of his son I know father If Miss Le Breton will allow us we will do what we can to be of service to her Bill Chantrey the younger brother gravely nodded assent They were both men of middle age the younger over forty They did not resemble their father nor was there any trace in either of them of his wayward fascination They were a pair of well set up well bred Englishmen surprised at nothing and quite incapable of showing any emotion in public yet just and kindly men As Julie entered the house they had both solemnly shaken hands with her in a manner which showed at once their determination as far as they were concerned to avoid anything sentimental or in the nature of a scene and their readiness to do what could be rightly demanded of them Julie hardly listened to Lord Uredale s little speech She had eyes and ears only for her grandfather As she knelt beside him her face bowed upon his hand the ice within her was breaking up that dumb and straitening anguish in which she had lived since that moment at the Nord Station in which she had grasped the meaning and the implications of Delafield s hurried words Was everything to be swept away from her at once her lover and now this dear old man to whom her heart crushed and bleeding as it was yearned with all its strength Lord Lackington supposed that she was weeping Don t grieve my dear he murmured It must come to an end some time cette charmante promenade a travers la realite And he smiled at her agreeably vain to the last of that French accent and that French memory which so his look implied they two could appreciate each in the other Then he turned to the Duchess Duchess you knew this secret before me But I forgive you and thank you You have been very good to Rose s child Julie has told me and I have observed Oh dear Lord Lackington Evelyn bent over him Trust her to me she said with a lovely yearning to comfort and cheer him breathing from her little face He smiled To you and He did not finish the sentence After a pause he made a little gesture of farewell which the Duchess understood She kissed his hand and turned away weeping Nurse where is nurse said Lord Lackington Both the nurse and the doctor who had withdrawn a little distance from the family group came forward Doctor give me some strength said the laboring voice not without its old wilfulness of accent He moved his arm towards the young homoeopath who injected strychnine Then he looked at the nurse Brandy and lift me All was done as he desired Now go please he said to his sons I wish to be left with Julie For some moments that seemed interminable to Julie Lord Lackington lay silent A feverish flush a revival of life in the black eyes had followed on the administration of the two stimulants He seemed to be gathering all his forces At last he laid his hand on her arm You shouldn t be alone he said abruptly His expression had grown anxious even imperious She felt a vague pang of dread as she tried to assure him that she had kind friends and that her work would be her resource Lord Lackington frowned That won t do he said almost vehemently You have great talents but you are weak you are a woman you must marry Julie stared at him whiter even than when she had entered his room helpless to avert what she began to foresee Jacob Delafield is devoted to you You should marry him dear you should marry him The room seemed to swim around her But his face was still plain the purpled lips and cheeks the urgency in the eyes as of one pursued by an overtaking force the magnificent brow the crown of white hair She summoned all her powers and told him hurriedly that he was mistaken entirely mistaken mister Delafield had indeed proposed to her but apart from her own unwillingness she had reason to know that his feelings towards her were now entirely changed He neither loved her nor thought well of her Lord Lackington lay there obstinate patient incredulous At last he interrupted her You make yourself believe these things But they are not true Delafield is attached to you I know it He nodded to her with his masterful affectionate look And before she could find words again he had resumed He could give you a great position Don t despise it We English big wigs have a good time A ghostly humorous ray shot out upon her then he felt for her hand Dear Julie why won t you If you were to ask him she cried in despair he would tell you as I do And across her miserable thoughts there flashed two mingled images Warkworth waiting waiting for her at the Sceaux Station and that look of agonized reproach in Delafield s haggard face as he had parted from her in the dawn of this strange this incredible day And here beside her with the tyranny of the dying this dear babbler wandered on in broken words with painful breath pleading scolding counselling She felt that he was exhausting himself She begged him to let her recall nurse and doctor He shook his head and when he could no longer speak he clung to her hand his gaze solemnly insistently fixed upon her Her spirit writhed and rebelled But she was helpless in the presence of this mortal weakness this affection half earthly half beautiful on its knees before her A thought struck her Why not content him Whatever pledges she gave would die with him What did it matter It was cruelty to deny him the words the mere empty words he asked of her I I would do anything to please you she said with a sudden burst of uncontrollable tears as she laid her head down beside him on the pillow If he were to ask me again of course for your sake I would consider it once more Dear dear friend won t that satisfy you Lord Lackington was silent a few moments then he smiled That s a promise She raised herself and looked at him conscious of a sick movement of terror What was there in his mind still so quick fertile ingenious under the very shadow of death He waited for her answer feebly pressing her hand Yes she said faintly and once more hid her face beside him Then for some little time the dying man neither stirred nor spoke At last Julie heard I used to be afraid of death that was in middle life Every night it was a torment But now for many years I have not been afraid at all Byron Lord Byron said to me once he would not change anything in his life but he would have preferred not to have lived at all I could not say that I have enjoyed it all being an Englishman and an English peer pictures politics society everything Perhaps it wasn t fair There are so many poor devils Julie pressed his hand to her lips But in her thoughts there rose the sudden sharp memory of her mother s death of that bitter stoicism and abandonment in which the younger life had closed in comparison with this peace this complacency Yet it was a complacency rich in sweetness His next words were to assure her tenderly that he had made provision for her Uredale and Bill will see to it They re good fellows Often they ve thought me a pretty fool But they ve been kind to me always Then after another interval he lifted himself in bed with more strength than she had supposed he could exert looked at her earnestly and asked her in the same painful whisper whether she believed in another life Yes said Julie But her shrinking perfunctory manner evidently distressed him He resumed with a furrowed brow You ought It is good for us to believe it I must hope at any rate that I shall see you again and mamma she said smiling on him through her tears I wonder what it will be like he replied after a pause His tone and look implied a freakish a whimsical curiosity yet full of charm Then motioning to her to come nearer and speaking into her ear Your poor mother Julie was never happy never There must be laws you see and churches and religious customs It s because we re made of such wretched stuff My wife when she died made me promise to continue going to church and praying And without it I should have been a bad man Though I ve had plenty of sceptical thoughts plenty Your poor parents rebelled against all that They suffered they suffered But you ll make up you re a noble woman you ll make up He laid his hand on her head She offered no reply but through the inner mind there rushed the incidents passions revolts of the preceding days But for that strange chance of Delafield s appearance in her path a chance no more intelligible to her now after the pondering of several feverish hours than it had been at the moment of her first suspicion where and what would she be now A dishonored woman perhaps with a life secret to keep cut off as her mother had been from the straight living law abiding world The touch of the old man s hand upon her hair roused in her a first recoil a first shattering doubt of the impulse which had carried her to Paris Since Delafield left her in the early dawn she had been pouring out a broken passionate heart in a letter to Warkworth No misgivings while she was writing it as to the all sufficing legitimacy of love But here in this cold neighborhood of the grave brought back to gaze in spirit on her mother s tragedy she shrank she trembled Her proud intelligence denied the stain and bade her hate and despise her rescuer And meanwhile things also inherited and inborn the fruit of a remoter ancestry rising from the dimmest and deepest caverns of personality silenced the clamor of the naturalist mind One moment she felt herself seized with terror lest anything should break down the veil between her real self and this unsuspecting tenderness of the dying man the next she rose in revolt against her own fear Was she to find herself after all a mere weak penitent meanly grateful to Jacob Delafield Her heart cried out to Warkworth in a protesting anguish So absorbed in thought was she that she did not notice how long the silence had lasted He seems to be sleeping said a low voice beside her She looked up to see the doctor with Lord Uredale Gently releasing herself she kissed Lord Lackington s forehead and rose to her feet Suddenly the patient opened his eyes and as he seemed to become aware of the figures beside him he again lifted himself in bed and a gleam most animated most vivacious passed over his features Brougham s not asked he said with a little chuckle of amusement Isn t it a joke The two men beside him looked at each other Lord Uredale approached the bed Not asked to what father he said gently Why to the Queen s fancy ball of course said Lord Lackington still smiling Such a to do All the elderly sticks practising minuets for their lives A voluble flow of talk followed hardly intelligible The words Melbourne and Lady Holland emerged the fragment apparently of a dispute with the latter in which Allen intervened the names of Palmerston and that dear chap Villiers Lord Uredale sighed The young doctor looked at him interrogatively He is thinking of his old friends said the son That was the Queen s ball I imagine of forty two I have often heard him describe my mother s dress But while he was speaking the fitful energy died away The old man ceased to talk his eyelids fell But the smile still lingered about his mouth and as he settled himself on his pillows like one who rests the spectators were struck by the urbane and distinguished beauty of his aspect The purple flush had died again into mortal pallor Illness had masked or refined the weakness of mouth and chin the beautiful head and countenance with their characteristic notes of youth impetuosity a kind of gay detachment had never been more beautiful The young doctor looked stealthily from the recumbent figure to the tall and slender woman standing absorbed and grief stricken beside the bed The likeness was as evident to him as it had been in the winter to Sir Wilfrid Bury As he was escorting her down stairs Lord Uredale said to his companion Foster thinks he may still live twenty four hours If he asks for me again said Julie now shrouded once more behind a thick black veil you will send He gravely assented It is a great pity he said with a certain stiffness did it unconsciously mark the difference between her and his legitimate kindred that my sister Lady Blanche and her daughter cannot be with us They are in Italy At Florence My niece has had an attack of diphtheria She could neither travel nor could her mother leave her Then pausing in the hall he added in a low voice and with some embarrassment My father has told you I believe of the addition he has made to his will Julie drew back I neither asked for it nor desired it she said in her coldest and clearest voice That I quite understand said Lord Uredale But you cannot hurt him by refusing She hesitated No But afterwards I must be free to follow my own judgment We cannot take what does not belong to us he said with some sharpness My brother and I are named as your trustees Believe me we will do our best Meanwhile the younger brother had come out of the library to bid her farewell She felt that she was under critical observation though both pairs of gray eyes refrained from any appearance of scrutiny Her pride came to her aid and she did not shrink from the short conversation which the two brothers evidently desired When it was over and the brothers returned to the hall after putting her into the Duchess s carriage the younger said to the elder She can behave herself Johnnie They looked at each other with their hands in their pockets A little nod passed between them an augur like acceptance of this new and irregular member of the family Yes she has excellent manners said Uredale And really after the tales Lady Henry has been spreading that s something Oh I always thought Lady Henry an old cat said Bill tranquilly That don t matter The Chantrey brothers had not been among Lady Henry s habitues In her eyes they were the dull sons of an agreeable father They were humorously aware of it and bore her little malice No said Uredale raising his eyebrows but the affaire Warkworth If there s any truth in what one hears that s deuced unpleasant Bill Chantrey whistled It s hard luck on that poor child Aileen that it should be her own cousin interfering with her preserves By the way he stooped to look at the letters on the hall table do you see there s a letter for father from Blanche And in a letter I got from her by the same post she says that she has told him the whole story According to her Aileen s too ill to be thwarted and she wants the governor to see the guardians I say Johnnie he looked at his brother we ll not trouble the father with it now Certainly not said Uredale with a sigh I saw one of the trustees Jack Underwood yesterday He told me Blanche and the child were more infatuated than ever Very likely what one hears is a pack of lies If not I hope this woman will have the good taste to drop it Father has charged me to write to Blanche and tell her the whole story of poor Rose and of this girl s revealing herself Blanche it appears is just as much in the dark as we were If this gossip has got round to her her feelings will be mixed Oh well I ve great faith in the money said Bill Chantrey carelessly as they began to mount the stairs again It sounds disgusting but if the child wants him I suppose she must have him And anyway the man s off to Africa for a twelvemonth at least Miss Le Breton will have time to forget him One can t say that either he or she has behaved with delicacy unless indeed she knew nothing of Aileen which is quite probable Well don t ask me to tackle her said Uredale She has the ways of an empress Bill Chantrey shrugged his shoulders And by George she looks as if she could fall in love he said slowly Magnificent eyes Johnnie I propose to make a study of our new niece Lord Uredale said a voice on the stairs The young doctor descended rapidly to meet them His lordship is asking for some one he said He seems excited But I cannot catch the name Lord Uredale ran up stairs Later in the day a man emerged from Lackington House and walked rapidly towards the Mall It was Jacob Delafield He passed across the Mall and into saint James s Park There he threw himself on the first seat he saw in an absorption so deep that it excited the wondering notice of more than one passer by After about half an hour he roused himself and walked still in the same brown study to his lodgings in Jermyn Street There he found a letter which he eagerly opened DEAR JACOB Julie came back this morning about one o clock I waited for her and at first she seemed quite calm and composed But suddenly as I was sitting beside her talking she fainted away in her chair and I was terribly alarmed We sent for a doctor at once He shakes his head over her and says there are all the signs of a severe strain of body and mind No wonder indeed our poor Julie Oh how I loathe some people Well there she is in bed Madame Bornier away and everybody I simply can t go to Scotland But Freddie is just mad Do Jacob there s a dear go and dine with him to night and cheer him up He vows he won t go north without me Perhaps I ll come to morrow I could no more leave Julie to night than fly She ll be ill for weeks What I ought to do is to take her abroad She s very dear and good but oh Jacob as she lies there I feel her heart s broken And it s not Lord Lackington Oh no though I m sure she loved him Do go to Freddie there s a dear No that I won t said Delafield with a laugh that choked him as he threw the letter down He tried to write an answer but could not achieve even the simplest note Then he began a pacing of his room which lasted till he dropped into his chair worn out with the sheer physical exhaustion of the night and day When his servant came in he found his master in a heavy sleep And at Crowborough House the Duke dined and fumed alone XXI Why does any one stay in England who can make the trip to Paradise said the Duchess as she leaned lazily back in the corner of the boat and trailed her fingers in the waters of Como It was a balmy April afternoon and she and Julie were floating through a scene enchanted incomparable When spring descends upon the shores of the Lago di Como she brings with her all the graces all the beauties all the fine delicate and temperate delights of which earth and sky are capable and she pours them forth upon a land of perfect loveliness Around the shores of other lakes Maggiore Lugano Garda blue mountains rise and the vineyards spread their green and dazzling terraces to the sun Only Como can show in unmatched union a main composition incomparably grand and harmonious combined with every jewelled or glowing or exquisite detail Nowhere do the mountains lean towards each other in such an ordered splendor as that which bends round the northern shores of Como Nowhere do buttressed masses rise behind each other to right and left of a blue water way in lines statelier or more noble than those kept by the mountains of the Lecco Lake as they marshal themselves on either hand along the approaches to Lombardy and Venetia bearing aloft as though on the purple pillars of some majestic gateway the great curtain of dazzling cloud which on a sunny day hangs over the Brescian plain a glorious drop scene interposed between the dwellers on the Como Mountains and those marble towns Brescia Verona Padua which thread the way to Venice And within this divine frame work between the glistening snows which still in April crown and glorify the heights and those reflections of them which lie encalmed in the deep bosom of the lake there s not a foot of pasture not a shelf of vineyard not a slope of forest where the spring is not at work dyeing the turf with gentians starring it with narcissuses or drawing across it the first golden net work of the chestnut leaves where the mere emerald of the grass is not in itself a thing to refresh the very springs of being where the peach blossom and the wild cherry and the olive are not perpetually weaving patterns on the blue which ravish the very heart out of your breast And already the roses are beginning to pour over the walls the wistaria is climbing up the cypresses a pomp of camellias and azaleas is in all the gardens while in the grassy bays that run up into the hills the primrose banks still keep their sweet austerity and the triumph of spring over the just banished winter is still sharp and new And in the heart and sense of Julie Le Breton as she sat beside the Duchess listening absently to the talk of the old boatman who with his oars resting idly in his hands was chattering to the ladies a renewing force akin to that of the spring was also at its healing and life giving work She had still the delicate tremulous look of one recovering from a sore wrestle with physical ill but in her aspect there were suggestions more intimate more moving than this Those who have lain down and risen up with pain those who have been face to face with passion and folly and self judgment those who have been forced to seek with eagerness for some answer to those questions which the majority of us never ask Whither is my life leading me and what is it worth to me or to any other living soul these are the men and women who now and then touch or startle us with the eyes and the voice of Julie if at least we have the capacity that responds Sir Wilfrid Bury for instance prince of self governed and reasonable men was not to be touched by Julie For him in spite of her keen intelligence she was the type passionne from which he instinctively recoiled the Duke of Crowborough the same Such men feel towards such women as Julie Le Breton hostility or satire for what they ask above all of the women of their world is a kind of simplicity a kind of lightness which makes life easier for men But for natures like Evelyn Crowborough or Meredith or Jacob Delafield the Julie type has perennial attractions For these are all children of feeling allied in this however different in intelligence or philosophy They are attracted by the storm tossed temperament in itself by mere sensibility by that which in the technical language of Catholicism suggests or possesses the gift of tears At any rate pity and love for her poor Julie however foolish however faulty lay warm in Evelyn Crowborough s breast they had brought her to Como they kept her now battling on the one hand with her husband s angry letters and on the other with the melancholy of her most perplexing most appealing friend I had often heard wrote the sore tried Duke of the ravages wrought in family life by these absurd and unreasonable female friendships but I never thought that it would be you Evelyn who would bring them home to me I won t repeat the arguments I have used a hundred times in vain But once again I implore and demand that you should find some kind responsible person to look after Miss Le Breton I don t care what you pay and that you yourself should come home to me and the children and the thousand and one duties you are neglecting As for the spring month in Scotland which I generally enjoy so much that has been already entirely ruined And now the season is apparently to be ruined also On the Shropshire property there is an important election coming on as I am sure you know and the Premier said to me only yesterday that he hoped you were already up and doing The Grand Duke of C will be in London within the next fortnight I particularly want to show him some civility But what can I do without you and how on earth am I to explain your absence Once more Evelyn I beg and I demand that you should come home To which the Duchess had rushed off a reply without a post s delay Oh Freddie you are such a wooden headed darling As if I hadn t explained till I m black in the face I m glad anyway you didn t say command that would really have made difficulties As for the election I m sure if I was at home I should think it very good fun Out here I am extremely doubtful whether we ought to do such things as you and Lord M suggest A duke shouldn t interfere in elections Anyway I m sure it s good for my character to consider it a little though I quite admit you may lose the election The Grand Duke is a horrid wretch and if he wasn t a grand duke you d be the first to cut him I had to spend a whole dinner time last year in teaching him his proper place It was very humiliating and not at all amusing You can have a men s dinner for him That s all he s fit for And as for the babies missus Robson sends me a telegram every morning I can t make out that they have had a finger ache since I went away and I am sure mothers are entirely superfluous All the same I think about them a great deal especially at night Last night I tried to think about their education if only I wasn t such a sleepy creature But at any rate I never in my life tried to think about it at home So that s so much to the good Indeed I ll come back to you soon you poor forsaken old thing But Julie has no one in the world and I feel like a Newfoundland dog who has pulled some one out of the water The water was deep and the life s only just coming back and the dog s not much good But he sits there for company till the doctor comes and that s just what I m doing I know you don t approve of the notions I have in my head now But that s because you don t understand Why don t you come out and join us Then you d like Julie as much as I do everything would be quite simple and I shouldn t be in the least jealous doctor Meredith is coming here probably to night and Jacob should arrive to morrow on his way to Venice where poor Chudleigh and his boy are The breva or fair weather wind from the north was blowing freshly yet softly down the lake The afternoon sun was burning on Bellaggio on the long terrace of the Melzi villa on the white mist of fruit blossom that lay lightly on the green slopes above San Giovanni Suddenly the Duchess and the boatman left the common topics of every day by which the Duchess was trying to improve her Italian such as the proposed enlargement of the Bellevue Hotel the new villas that were springing up the gardens of the Villa Carlotta and so forth Evelyn had carelessly asked the old man whether he had been in any of the fighting of fifty nine and in an instant under her eyes he became another being Out rolled a torrent of speech the oars lay idly on the water and through the man s gnarled and wrinkled face there blazed a high and illumining passion Novara and its beaten king in forty nine the ten years of waiting when a whole people bode its time in a gay grim silence the grudging victory of Magenta the fivefold struggle that wrenched the hills of San Martino from the Austrians the humiliations and the rage of Villafranca of all these had this wasted graybeard made a part And he talked of them with the Latin eloquence and facility as no veteran of the north could have talked he was in a moment the equal of these great affairs in which he had mingled so that one felt in him the son of a race which had been rolled and polished a pebble as it were from rocks which had made the primeval frame work of the world in the main course and stream of history Then from the campaign of fifty nine he fell back on the Five Days of Milan in forty eight the immortal days when a populace drove out an army and what began almost in jest ended in a delirium a stupefaction of victory His language was hot broken confused like the street fighting it chronicled Afterwards a further sharpening and blanching of the old face and he had carried them deep into the black years of Italy s patience and Austria s revenge Throwing out a thin arm he pointed towards town after town on the lake shores now in the brilliance of sunset now in the shadow of the northern slope Gravedona Varenna Argegno towns which had each of them given their sons to the Austrian bullet and the Austrian lash for the ransom of Italy He ran through the sacred names Stazzonelli Riccini Crescieri Ronchetti Ceresa Previtali young men almost all of them shot for the possession of a gun or a knife for helping their comrades in the Austrian army to desert for insulting conduct towards an Austrian soldier or officer Of one of these executions which he had himself witnessed at Varese the shooting of a young fellow of six and twenty his own friend and kinsman he gave an account which blanched the Duchess s cheeks and brought the big tears into her eyes Then when he saw the effect he had produced the old man trembled Ah eccellenza he cried but it had to be The Italians had to show they knew how to die then God let them live Ecco eccellenza And he drew from his breast pocket with shaking hands an old envelope tied round with string When he had untied it a piece of paper emerged brown with age and worn with much reading It was a rudely printed broadsheet containing an account of the last words and sufferings of the martyrs of Mantua those conspirators of eighteen fifty two from whose graves and dungeons sprang tenfold renewed the regenerating and liberating forces which but a few years later drove out the Austrian with the Bourbon together See here eccellenza he said as he tenderly spread out its tattered folds and gave it into the Duchess s hand Have the goodness to look where is that black mark There you will find the last words of Don Enrico Tazzoli the half brother of my father He was a priest eccellenza Ah it was not then as it is now The priests were then for Italy They hanged three of them at Mantua alone As for Don Enrico first they stripped him of his priesthood and then they hanged him And those were his last words and the last words of Scarsellini also who suffered with him Veda eccellenza As for me I know them from a boy And while the Duchess read the old man repeated tags and fragments under his breath as he once more resumed the oars and drove the boat gently towards Menaggio The multitude of victims has not robbed us of courage in the past nor will it so rob us in the future till victory dawns The cause of the people is like the cause of religion it triumphs only through its martyrs You who survive will conquer and in your victory we the dead shall live Take no thought for us the blood of the forerunners is like the seed which the wise husbandman scatters on the fertile ground Teach our young men how to adore and how to suffer for a great idea Work incessantly at that so shall our country come to birth and grieve not for us Yes Italy shall be one To that all things point WORK There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome no opposition that cannot be destroyed The HOW and the WHEN only remain to be solved You more fortunate than we will find the clew to the riddle when all things are accomplished and the times are ripe Hope my parents and my brothers hope always waste no time in weeping The Duchess read aloud the Italian and Julie stooped over her shoulder to follow the words Marvellous said Julie in a low voice as she sank back into her place A youth of twenty seven with the rope round his neck and he comforts himself with Italy What s Italy to him or he to Italy Not even an immediate paradise Is there anybody capable of it now Her face and attitude had lost their languor As the Duchess returned his treasure to the old man she looked at Julie with joy Not since her illness had there been any such sign of warmth and energy And indeed as they floated on past the glow of Bellaggio towards the broad gold and azure of the farther lake the world defying passion that breathed from these words of dead and murdered Italians played as a bracing and renewing power on Julie s still feeble being It was akin to the high snows on those far Alps that closed in the lake to the pure wind that blew from them to the gleam the shadow and the peace supreme amid which their little boat pressed on towards the shore What matter cried the intelligence but as though through sobs what matter the individual struggle and misery These can be lived down The heart can be silenced nerves steadied strength restored Will and idea remain the eternal spectacle of the world and the eternal thirst of man to see to know to feel to realize himself if not in one passion then in another If not in love then in patriotism art thought The Duchess and Julie landed presently beneath the villa of which they were the passing tenants The Duchess mounted the double staircase where the banksia already hung in a golden curtain over the marble balustrade Her face was thoughtful She had to write her daily letter to the absent and reproachful Duke Julie parted from her with a caress and paused awhile to watch the small figure till it mounted out of sight Her friend had become very dear to her A new humility a new gratitude filled her heart Evelyn should not sacrifice herself much longer When she had insisted on carrying her patient abroad Julie had neither mind nor will wherewith to resist But now the Duke should soon come to his own again She herself turned inland for that short walk by which each day she tested her returning strength She climbed the winding road to Criante the lovely village above Cadenabbia then turning to the left she mounted a path that led to the woods which overhang the famous gardens of the Villa Carlotta Such a path To the left hand and as it seemed steeply beneath her feet all earth and heaven the wide lake the purple mountains the glories of a flaming sky On the calm spaces of water lay a shimmer of crimson and gold repeating the noble splendor of the clouds the midgelike boats crept from shore to shore and midway between Bellaggio and Cadenabbia the steam boat a white speck drew a silver furrow To her right a green hill side each blade of grass each flower each tuft of heath enskied transfigured by the broad light that poured across it from the hidden west And on the very hill top a few scattered olives peaches and wild cherries scrawled upon the blue their bare leaning stems their pearly whites their golden pinks and feathery grays all in a glory of sunset that made of them things enchanted aerial fantastical like a dance of Botticelli angels on the height And presently a sheltered bank in a green hollow where Julie sat down to rest But nature in this tranquil spot had still new pageants new sorceries wherewith to play upon the nerves of wonder Across the hollow a great crag clothed in still leafless chestnut trees reared itself against the lake The innumerable lines of stem and branch warm brown or steely gray were drawn sharp on silver air while at the very summit of the rock one superb tree with branching limbs touched with intense black sprang high above the rest the proud plume or ensign of the wood Through the trunks the blaze of distant snow and the purples of craggy mountains in front the glistening spray of peach or cherry blossom breaking the still wintry beauty of that majestic grove And in all the air dropping from the heaven spread on the hills or shimmering on the lake a diffusion of purest rose and deepest blue lake and cloud and mountain each melting into the other as though heaven and earth conspired merely to give value and relief to the year s new birth to this near sparkle of young leaf and blossom which shone like points of fire on the deep breast of the distance On the green ledge which ran round the hollow were children tugging at a goat Opposite was a contadino s house of gray stone A water wheel turned beside it and a stream brought down from the hills ran chattering past a white and dancing thread of water Everything was very still and soft The children and the river made their voices heard and there were nightingales singing in the woods below Otherwise all was quiet With a tranquil and stealthy joy the spring was taking possession Nay the Angelus It swung over the lake and rolled from village to village The tears were in Julie s eyes Such beauty as this was apt now to crush and break her All her being was still sore and this appeal of nature was sometimes more than she could bear Only a few short weeks since Warkworth had gone out of her life since Delafield at a stroke had saved her from ruin since Lord Lackington had passed away One letter had reached her from Warkworth a wild and incoherent letter written at night in a little room of a squalid hotel near the Gare de Sceaux Her telegram had reached him and for him as for her all was over But the letter was by no means a mere cry of baffled passion There was in it a new note of moral anguish as fresh and startling in her ear coming from him as the cry of passion itself In the language of religion it was the utterance of a man convicted of sin How long is it since that man gave me your telegram I was pacing up and down the departure platform working myself into an agony of nervousness and anxiety as the time went by wondering what on earth had happened to you when the chef de gare came up Monsieur attend une depeche There were some stupid formalities at last I got it It seemed to me I had already guessed what it contained So it was Delafield who met you Delafield who turned you back I saw him outside the hotel yesterday and we exchanged a few words I have always disliked his long pale face and his high and mighty ways at any rate towards plain fellows who don t belong to the classes like me Yesterday I was more than usually anxious to get rid of him So he guessed It can t have been chance In some way he guessed And you have been torn from me My God If I could only reach him if I could fling his contempt in his face And yet I have been walking up and down this room all night The longing for you has been the sharpest suffering I suppose that I have ever known For I am not one of the many people who enjoy pain I have kept as free of it as I could This time it caught and gripped me Yet that isn t all There has been something else What strange patched creatures we are Do you know Julie that by the time the dawn came I was on my knees thanking God that we were parted that you were on your way home safe out of my reach Was I mad or what I can t explain it I only know that one moment I hated Delafield as a mortal enemy whether he was conscious of what he had done or no and the next I found myself blessing him I understand now what people mean when they talk of conversion It seems to me that in the hours I have just passed through things have come to light in me that I myself never suspected I came of an Evangelical stock I was brought up in a religious household I suppose that one can t after all get away from the blood and the life that one inherits My poor old father I was a bad son and I know I hastened his death was a sort of Puritan saint with very stern ideas I seem to have been talking with him this night and shrinking under his condemnation I could see his old face as he put before me the thoughts I had dared to entertain the risks I had been ready to take towards the woman I loved the woman to whom I owed a deep debt of eternal gratitude Julie it is strange how this appointment affects me Last night I saw several people at the Embassy good fellows who seemed anxious to do all they could for me Such men never took so much notice of me before It is plain to me that this task will make or mar me I may fail I may die But if I succeed England will owe me something and these men at the top of the tree Good God how can I go on writing this to you It s because I came back to the hotel and tossed about half the night brooding over the difference between what these men these honorable distinguished fellows were prepared to think of me and the blackguard I knew myself to be What take everything from a woman s hand and then turn and try and drag her in the mire propose to her what one would shoot a man for proposing to one s sister Thief and cur Julie kind beloved Julie forget it all For God s sake let s cast it all behind us As long as I live your name your memory will live in my heart We shall not meet probably for many years You ll marry and be happy yet Just now I know you re suffering I seem to see you in the train on the steamer your pale face that has lighted up life for me your dear slender hands that folded so easily into one of mine You are in pain my darling Your nature is wrenched from its natural supports And you gave me all your fine clear mind and all your heart I ought to be damned to the deepest hell Then again I say to myself if only she were here If only I had her here with her arms round my neck surely I might have found the courage and the mere manliness to extricate both herself and me from these entanglements Aileen might have released and forgiven one No no It s all over I ll go and do my task You set it me You sha n t be ashamed of me there Good bye Julie my love good bye forever These were portions of that strange document composed through the intervals of a long night which showed in Warkworth s mind the survival of a moral code inherited from generations of scrupulous and God fearing ancestors overlaid by selfish living and now revived under the stress the purification partly of deepening passion partly of a high responsibility The letter was incoherent illogical it showed now the meaner now the nobler elements of character but it was human it came from the warm depths of life and it had exerted in the end a composing and appeasing force upon the woman to whom it was addressed He had loved her if only at the moment of parting he had loved her At the last there had been feeling sincerity anguish and to these all things may be forgiven And indeed what in her eyes there was to forgive Julie had long forgiven Was it his fault if when they met first he was already pledged for social and practical reasons which her mind perfectly recognized and understood to Aileen Moffatt Was it his fault if the relations between herself and him had ripened into a friendship which in its turn could only maintain itself by passing into love No It was she whose hidden insistent passion nourished indeed upon a tragic ignorance had transformed what originally he had a perfect right to offer and to feel So she defended him for in so doing she justified herself And as to the Paris proposal he had a right to treat her as a woman capable of deciding for herself how far love should carry her he had a right to assume that her antecedents her training and her circumstances were not those of the ordinary sheltered girl and that for her love might naturally wear a bolder and wilder aspect than for others He blamed himself too severely too passionately but for this very blame her heart remembered him the more tenderly For it meant that his mind was torn and in travail for her that his thoughts clung to her in a passionate remorse and again she felt herself loved and forgave with all her heart All the same he was gone out of her life and through the strain and the unconscious progress to other planes and phases of being wrought by sickness and convalescence her own passion for him even was now a changed and blunted thing Was she ashamed of the wild impulse which had carried her to Paris It is difficult to say She was often seized with the shuddering consciousness of an abyss escaped with wonder that she was still in the normal accepted world that Evelyn might still be her companion that Therese still adored her more fervently than any saint in the calendar Perhaps if the truth were known she was more abased in her own eyes by the self abandonment which had preceded the assignation with Warkworth She had much intellectual arrogance and before her acquaintance with Warkworth she had been accustomed to say and to feel that love was but one passion among many and to despise those who gave it too great a place And here she had flung herself into it like any dull or foolish girl for whom a love affair represents the only stirring in the pool of life that she is ever likely to know Well she must recapture herself and remake her life As she sat there in the still Italian evening she thought of the old boatman and those social and intellectual passions to which his burst of patriotism had recalled her thoughts Society literature friends and the ambitions to which these lead let her go back to them and build her days afresh doctor Meredith was coming In his talk and companionship she would once more dip and temper the tools of mind and taste No more vain self arraignment no more useless regrets She looked back with bitterness upon a moment of weakness when in the first stage of convalescence in mortal weariness and loneliness she had slipped one evening into the Farm Street church and unburdened her heart in confession As she had told the Duchess the Catholicism instilled into her youth by the Bruges nuns still laid upon her at times its ghostly and compelling hand Now in her renewed strength she was inclined to look upon it as an element of weakness and disintegration in her nature She resolved in future to free herself more entirely from a useless Aberglaube But Meredith was not the only visitor expected at the villa in the next few days She was already schooling herself to face the arrival of Jacob Delafield It was curious how the mere thought of Delafield produced an agitation a shock of feeling which seemed to spread through all the activities of being The faint renascent glamour which had begun to attach to literature and social life disappeared She fell into a kind of brooding the sombre restlessness of one who feels in the dark the recurrent presence of an attacking and pursuing power and is in a tremulous uncertainty where or how to meet it The obscure tumult within her represented in fact a collision between the pagan and Christian conceptions of life In self dependence in personal pride in her desire to refer all things to the arbitrament of reason Julie whatever her practice was theoretically a stoic and a pagan But Delafield s personality embodied another must another ought of a totally different kind And it was a must which in a great crisis of her life she also had been forced to obey There was the thought which stung and humiliated And the fact was irreparable nor did she see how she was ever to escape from the strange silent penetrating relation it had established between her and the man who loved her and had saved her against her will During her convalescence at Crowborough House Delafield had been often admitted It would have been impossible to exclude him unless she had confided the whole story of the Paris journey to the Duchess And whatever Evelyn might tremblingly guess from Julie s own mouth she knew nothing So Delafield had come and gone bringing Lord Lackington s last words and the account of his funeral or acting as intermediary in business matters between Julie and the Chantrey brothers Julie could not remember that she had ever asked him for these services They fell to him as it were by common consent and she had been too weak to resist At first whenever he entered the room whenever he approached her her sense of anger and resentment had been almost unbearable But little by little his courtesy tact and coolness had restored a relation between them which if not the old one had still many of the outward characters of intimacy Not a word not the remotest allusion reminded her of what had happened The man who had stood before her transfigured on the deck of the steamer stammering out I thank God I had the courage to do it it was often hard for her to believe as she stole a look at Delafield chatting or writing in the Duchess s drawing room that such a scene had ever taken place The evening stole on How was it that whenever she allowed the thought of Delafield to obtain a real lodgment in the mind even the memory of Warkworth was for the time effaced Silently irresistibly a wild heat of opposition would develop within her These men round whom as it were there breathes an air of the heights in whom one feels the secret guard that religion keeps over thoughts and words and acts her passionate yet critical nature flung out against them How are they better than others after all What right have they over the wills of others Nevertheless as the rose of evening burned on the craggy mountain face beyond Bellaggio retreating upward step by step till the last glorious summit had died into the cool and already starlit blues of night Julie held as it were by a reluctant and half jealous fascination sat dreaming on the hill side not now of Warkworth not of the ambitions of the mind or society but simply of the goings and comings the aspects and sayings of a man in whose eyes she had once read the deepest and sternest things of the soul a condemnation and an anguish above and beyond himself doctor Meredith arrived in due time a jaded Londoner athirst for idleness and fresh air The Duchess and Julie carried him hither and thither about the lake in the four oar boat which had been hired for the Duchess s pleasure Here enthroned between the two ladies he passed luxurious hours and his talk of politics persons and books brought just that stimulus to Julie s intelligence and spirits for which the Duchess had been secretly longing A first faint color returned to Julie s cheeks She began to talk again to resume certain correspondences to show herself once more at any rate intermittently the affectionate sympathetic and beguiling friend As for Meredith he knew little but he suspected a good deal There were certain features in her illness and convalescence which suggested to him a mental cause and if there were such a cause it must of course spring from her relations to Warkworth The name of that young officer was never mentioned Once or twice Meredith was tempted to introduce it It rankled in his mind that Julie had never been frank with him freely as he had poured his affection at her feet But a moment of languor or of pallor disarmed him She is better he said to the Duchess one day abruptly Her mind is full of activity But why at times does she still look so miserable like a person without hope or future The Duchess looked pensive They were sitting in the corner of one of the villa s terraced walks amid a scented wilderness of flowers Above them was a canopy of purple and yellow rose and wistaria while through the arches of the pergola which ran along the walk gleamed all those various blues which make the spell of Como the blue and white of the clouds the purple of the mountains the azure of the lake Well she was in love with him I suppose it takes a little time said the Duchess sighing Why was she in love with him said Meredith impatiently As to the Moffatt engagement naturally she was kept in the dark At first said the Duchess hesitating And when she knew poor dear it was too late Too late for what Well when one falls in love one doesn t all at once shake it off because the man deceives you One should said Meredith with energy Men are not worth all that women spend upon them Oh that s true cried the Duchess so dreadfully true But what s the good of preaching We shall go on spending it to the end of time Well at any rate don t choose the dummies and the frauds Ah there you talk sense said the Duchess And if only we had the French system in England If only one could say to Julie Now look here there s your husband It s all settled down to plate and linen and you ve got to marry him how happy we should all be doctor Meredith stared You have the man in your eye he said The Duchess hesitated Suppose you come a little walk with me in the wood she said at last gathering up her white skirts Meredith obeyed her They were away for half an hour and when they returned the journalist s face flushed and furrowed with thought was not very easy to read Nor was his temper in good condition It required a climb to the very top of Monte Crocione to send him back more or less appeased a consenting player in the Duchess s game For if there are men who are flirts and egotists who ought to be yet never are divined by the sensible woman at a glance so also there are men too well equipped for this wicked world too good too well born too desirable It was in this somewhat flinty and carping mood that Meredith prepared himself for the advent of Jacob Delafield But when Delafield appeared Meredith s secret antagonisms were soon dissipated There was certainly no challenging air of prosperity about the young man At first sight indeed he was his old cheerful self always ready for a walk or a row on easy terms at once with the Italian servants or boatmen But soon other facts emerged stealthily as it were from the concealment in which a strong man was trying to keep them That young man s youth is over said Meredith abruptly to the Duchess one evening He pointed to the figure of Delafield who was pacing alone with his pipe up and down one of the lower terraces of the garden The Duchess showed a teased expression It s like something wearing through she said slowly I suppose it was always there but it didn t show Name your it I can t But she gave a little shudder which made Meredith look at her with curiosity You feel something ghostly unearthly She nodded assent crying out however immediately afterwards as though in compunction that he was one of the dearest and best of fellows Of course he is said Meredith It is only the mystic in him coming out He is one of the men who have the sixth sense Well all I know is he has the oddest power over people said Evelyn with another shiver If Freddie had it my life wouldn t be worth living Thank goodness he hasn t a vestige At bottom it s the power of the priest said Meredith And you women are far too susceptible towards it Nine times out of ten it plays the mischief The Duchess was silent a moment Then she bent towards her companion finger on lip her charming eyes glancing significantly towards the lower terrace The figures on it were now two Julie and Delafield paced together But this is the tenth she said in an eager whisper Meredith smiled at her then flung her a dubious Chi sa and changed the subject Delafield who was a fine oar had soon taken command of the lake expeditions and by the help of two stalwart youths from Tremezzo the four oar was in use from morning till night Through the broad lake which lies between Menaggio and Varenna it sped northward to Gravedona or beneath the shadowy cliffs of the Villa Serbelloni it slipped over deep waters haunted and dark into the sunny spaces of Lecco or it coasted along the steep sides of Monte Primo so that the travellers in it might catch the blue stain of the gentians on the turf where it sloped into the lucent wave below or watch the fishermen on the rocks spearing their prey in the green or golden shallows The weather was glorious a summer before its time The wild cherries shook down their snow upon the grass but the pears were now in bridal white and a warmer glory of apple blossom was just beginning to break upon the blue The nights were calm and moonlit the dawns were visions of mysterious and incredible beauty wherein mountain and forest and lake were but the garments diaphanous impalpable of some delicate indwelling light and fire spirit which breathed and pulsed through the solidity of rock no less visibly than through the crystal leagues of air or the sunlit spaces of water Yet presently as it were a hush of waiting of tension fell upon their little party Nature offered her best but there was only an apparent acceptance of her bounties Through the outward flow of talk and amusement of wanderings on lake or hill ugly hidden forces of pain and strife regret misery resistance made themselves rarely yet piercingly felt Julie drooped again Her cheeks were paler even than when Meredith arrived Delafield too began to be more silent more absent He was helpful and courteous as ever but it began to be seen that his gayety was an effort and now and then there were sharp or bitter notes in voice or manner which jarred and were not soon forgotten Presently Meredith and the Duchess found themselves looking on breathless and astonished at the struggle of two personalities the wrestle between two wills They little knew that it was a renewed struggle second wrestle But silently by a kind of tacit agreement they drew away from Delafield and Julie They dimly understood that he pursued and she resisted and that for him life was becoming gradually absorbed into the two facts of her presence and her resistance On ne s appuie que sur ce qui resiste For both of them these words were true Fundamentally and beyond all passing causes of grief and anger each was fascinated by the full strength of nature in the other Neither could ever forget the other The hours grew electric and every tiny incident became charged with spiritual meaning Often for hours together Julie would try to absorb herself in talk with Meredith But the poor fellow got little joy from it Presently at a word or look of Delafield s she would let herself be recaptured as though with a proud reluctance they wandered away together and once more Meredith and the Duchess became the merest by standers The Duchess shrugged her shoulders over it and though she laughed sometimes the tears were in her eyes She felt the hovering of passion but it was no passion known to her own blithe nature And if only this strange state of things might end one way or other and set her free to throw her arms round her Duke s neck and beg his pardon for all these weeks of desertion She said to herself ruefully that her babies would indeed have forgotten her Yet she stood stoutly to her post and the weeks passed quickly by It was the dramatic energy of the situation so much more dramatic in truth than either she or Meredith suspected that made it such a strain upon the onlookers One evening they had left the boat at Tremezzo that they might walk back along that most winning of paths that skirts the lake between the last houses of Tremezzo and the inn at Cadenabbia The sunset was nearly over but the air was still suffused with its rose and pearl and fragrant with the scent of flowering laurels Each mountain face each white village either couched on the water s edge or grouped about its slender campanile on some shoulder of the hills each house and tree and figure seemed still penetrated with light the glorified creatures of some just revealed and already fading world The echoes of the evening bell were floating on the lake and from a boat in front full of peasant folk there rose a sound of singing some litany of saint or virgin which stole in harmonies rudely true across the water They have been to the pilgrimage church above Lenno said Julie pointing to the boat and in order to listen to the singing she found a seat on a low wall above the lake There was no reply and looking round her she saw with a start that only Delafield was beside her that the Duchess and Meredith had already rounded the corner of the Villa Carlotta and were out of sight Delafield s gaze was fixed upon her He was very pale and suddenly Julie s breath seemed to fail her I don t think I can bear it any longer he said as he came close to her Bear what That you should look as you do now Julie made no reply Her eyes very sad and bitter searched the blue dimness of the lake in silence Delafield sat down on the wall beside her Not a soul was in sight At the Cadenabbia Hotel the table d hote had gathered in the visitors a few boats passed and repassed in the distance but on land all was still Suddenly he took her hand with a firm grasp Are you never going to forgive me he said in a low voice I suppose I ought to bless you Her face seemed to him to express the tremulous misery of a heart deeply perhaps irrevocably wounded Emotion rose in a tide but he crushed it down He bent over her speaking with deliberate tenderness Julie do you remember what you promised Lord Lackington when he was dying Oh cried Julie She sprang to her feet speechless and suffocated Her eyes expressed a mingled pride and terror He paused confronting her with a pale resolution You didn t know that I had seen him Know She turned away fiercely choking with sobs she could hardly control as the memory of that by gone moment returned upon her I thought as much said Delafield in a low voice You hoped never to hear of your promise again She made no answer but she sank again upon the seat beside the lake and supporting herself on one delicate hand which clung to the coping of the wall she turned her pale and tear stained face to the lake and the evening sky There was in her gesture an unconscious yearning a mute and anguished appeal as though from the oppressions of human character to the broad strength of nature that was not lost on Delafield His mind became the centre of a swift and fierce debate One voice said Why are you persecuting her Respect her weakness and her grief And another replied It is because she is weak that she must yield must allow herself to be guided and adored He came close to her again Any passer by might have supposed that they were both looking at the distant boat and listening to the pilgrimage chant Do you think I don t understand why you made that promise he said very gently and the mere self control of his voice and manner carried a spell with it for the woman beside him It was wrung out of you by kindness for a dying man You thought I should never know or I should never claim it Well I am selfish I take advantage I do claim it I saw Lord Lackington only a few hours before his death She mustn t be alone he said to me several times And then almost at the last Ask her again She ll consider it she promised Julie turned impetuously Neither of us is bound by that neither of us Delafield smiled Does that mean that I am asking you now because he bade me A pause Julie must needs raise her eyes to his She flushed red and withdrew them No he said with a long breath you don t mean that and you don t think it As for you yes you are bound Julie once more I bring you my plea and you must consider it How can I be your wife she said her breast heaving You know all that has happened It would be monstrous Not at all was his quiet reply It would be natural and right Julie it is strange that I should be talking to you like this You re so much cleverer than I in some ways so much stronger And yet in others you ll let me say it won t you I could help you I could protect you It s all I care for in the world How can I be your wife she repeated passionately wringing her hands Be what you will at home My friend comrade housemate I ask nothing more nothing His voice dropped and there was a pause Then he resumed But in the eyes of the world make me your servant and your husband I can t condemn you to such a fate she cried You know where my heart is Delafield did not waver I know where your heart was he said with firmness You will banish that man from your thoughts in time He has no right to be there I take all the risks all Well at least for you I am no hypocrite she said with a quivering lip You know what I am Yes I know and I am at your feet The tears dropped from Julie s eyes She turned away and hid her face against one of the piers of the wall Delafield attempted no caress He quietly set himself to draw the life that he had to offer her the comradeship that he proposed to her Not a word of what the world called his prospects entered in She knew very well that he could not bring himself to speak of them Rather a sort of ascetic and mystical note made itself heard in all he said of the future a note that before now had fascinated and controlled a woman whose ambition was always strangely tempered with high poetical imagination Yet ambitious she was and her mind inevitably supplied what his voice left unsaid He will have to fill his place whether he wishes it or no she said to herself And if in truth he desires my help Then she shrank from her own wavering Look where she would into her life it seemed to her that all was monstrous and out of joint You don t realize what you ask she said at last in despair I am not what you call a good woman you know it too well I don t measure things by your standards I am capable of such a journey as you found me on I can t find in my own mind that I repent it at all I can tell a lie you can t I can have the meanest and most sordid thoughts you can t Lady Henry thought me an intriguer I am one It is in my blood And I don t know whether in the end I could understand your language and your life And if I don t I shall make you miserable She looked up her slender frame straightening under what was in truth a noble defiance Delafield bent over her and took both her hands forcibly in his own If all that were true I would rather risk it a thousand times over than go out of your life again a stranger Julie you have done mad things for love you should know what love is Look in my face there your eyes in mine Give way The dead ask it of you and it is God s will And as drawn by the last low spoken words Julie looked up into his face she felt herself enveloped by a mystical and passionate tenderness that paralyzed her resistance A force superhuman laid its grasp upon her will With a burst of tears half in despair half in revolt she submitted XXII In the first week of May Julie Le Breton married Jacob Delafield in the English Church at Florence The Duchess was there So was the Duke a sulky and ill resigned spectator of something which he believed to be the peculiar and mischievous achievement of his wife At the church door Julie and Delafield left for Camaldoli Well if you imagine that I intend to congratulate you or anybody else upon that performance you are very much mistaken said the Duke as he and his wife drove back to the Grand Bretagne together I don t deny it s risky said the Duchess her hands on her lap her eyes dreamily following the streets Risky repeated the Duke shrugging his shoulders Well I don t want to speak harshly of your friends Evelyn but Miss Le Breton missus Delafield said the Duchess missus Delafield then the name was evidently a difficult mouthful seems to me a most undisciplined and unmanageable woman Why does she look like a tragedy queen at her marriage Jacob is twice too good for her and she ll lead him a life And how you can reconcile it to your conscience to have misled me so completely as you have in this matter I really can t imagine Misled you said Evelyn Her innocence was really a little hard to bear and not even the beauty of her blue eyes now happily restored to him could appease the mentor at her side You led me plainly to believe he repeated with emphasis that if I helped her through the crisis of leaving Lady Henry she would relinquish her designs on Delafield Did I said the Duchess And putting her hands over her face she laughed rather hysterically But that wasn t why you lent her the house Freddie You coaxed me into it of course said the Duke No it was Julie herself got the better of you said Evelyn triumphantly You felt her spell just as we all do and wanted to do something for her Nothing of the sort said the Duke determined to admit no recollection to his disadvantage It was your doing entirely The Duchess thought it discreet to let him at least have the triumph of her silence smiling and a little sarcastic though it were And of all the undeserved good fortune he resumed feeling in his irritable disapproval that the moral order of the universe had been somehow trifled with In the first place she is the daughter of people who flagrantly misconducted themselves that apparently does her no harm Then she enters the service of Lady Henry in a confidential position and uses it to work havoc in Lady Henry s social relations That I am glad to say has done her a little harm although not nearly as much as she deserves And finally she has a most discreditable flirtation with a man already engaged to her own cousin please observe and pulls wires for him all over the place in the most objectionable and unwomanly manner As if everybody didn t do that cried the Duchess You know Freddie that your own mother always used to boast that she had made six bishops and saved the Establishment The Duke took no notice And yet there she is Lord Lackington has left her a fortune a competence anyway She marries Jacob Delafield rather a fool I consider but all the same one of the best fellows in the world And at any time to judge from what one hears of the health both of Chudleigh and his boy she may find herself Duchess of Chudleigh The Duke threw himself back in the carriage with the air of one who waits for Providence to reply Oh well you see you can t make the world into a moral tale to please you said the Duchess absently Then after a pause she asked Are you still going to let them have the house Freddie I imagine that if Jacob Delafield applies to me to let it to him that I shall not refuse him said the Duke stiffly The Duchess smiled behind her fan Yet her tender heart was not in reality very happy about her Julie She knew well enough that it was a strange marriage of which they had just been witnesses a marriage containing the seeds of many untoward things only too likely to develop unless fate were kinder than rash mortals have any right to expect I wish to goodness Delafield weren t so religious murmured the Duchess fervently pursuing her own thoughts Evelyn Well you see Julie isn t at all she added hastily You need not have troubled yourself to tell me that was the Duke s indignant reply After a fortnight at Camaldoli and Vallombrosa the Delafields turned towards Switzerland Julie who was a lover of Rousseau and Obermann had been also busy with the letters of Byron She wished to see with her own eyes saint Gingolphe and Chillon Bevay and Glion So one day at the end of May they found themselves at Montreux But Montreux was already hot and crowded and Julie s eyes turned in longing to the heights They found an old inn at Charnex whereof the garden commanded the whole head of the lake and there they settled themselves for a fortnight till business in fact should recall Delafield to England The Duke of Chudleigh had shown all possible kindness and cordiality with regard to the marriage and the letter in which he welcomed his cousin s new wife had both touched Julie s feelings and satisfied her pride You are marrying one of the best of men wrote this melancholy father of a dying son My boy and I owe him more than can be written I can only tell you that for those he loves he grudges nothing no labor no sacrifice of himself There are no half measures in his affections He has spent himself too long on sick and sorry creatures like ourselves It is time he had a little happiness on his own account You will give it him and Mervyn and I will be most grateful to you If joy and health can never be ours I am not yet so vile as to grudge them to others God bless you Jacob will tell you that my house is not a gay one but if you and he will sometimes visit it you will do something to lighten its gloom Julie wondered as she wrote her very graceful reply how much the Duke might know about herself Jacob had told his cousin as she knew the story of her parentage and of Lord Lackington s recognition of his granddaughter But as soon as the marriage was announced it was not likely that Lady Henry had been able to hold her tongue A good many interesting tales of his cousin s bride had indeed reached the melancholy Duke Lady Henry had done all that she conceived it her duty to do filling many pages of note paper with what the Duke regarded as most unnecessary information At any rate he had brushed it all aside with the impatience of one for whom nothing on earth had now any savor or value beyond one or two indispensable affections What s good enough for Jacob is good for me he wrote to Lady Henry and if I may offer you some advice it is that you should not quarrel with Jacob about a matter so vital as his marriage Into the rights and wrongs of the story you tell me I really cannot enter but rather than break with Jacob I would welcome anybody he chose to present to me And in this case I understand the lady is very clever distinguished and of good blood on both sides Have you had no trouble in your life my dear Flora that you can make quarrels with a light heart If so I envy you but I have neither the energy nor the good spirits wherewith to imitate you Julie of course knew nothing of this correspondence though from the Duke s letters to Jacob she divined that something of the kind had taken place But it was made quite plain to her that she was to be spared all the friction and all the difficulty which may often attend the entrance of a person like herself within the circle of a rich and important family like the Delafields With Lady Henry indeed the fight had still to be fought But Jacob s mother influenced on one side by her son and on the other by the head of the family accepted her daughter in law with the facile kindliness and good temper that were natural to her while his sister the fair haired and admirable Susan owed her brother too much and loved him too well to be other than friendly to his wife No on the worldly side all was smooth The marriage had been carried through with ease and quietness The Duke in spite of Jacob s remonstrances had largely increased his cousin s salary and Julie was already enjoying the income left her by Lord Lackington She had only to reappear in London as Jacob s wife to resume far more than her old social ascendency The winning cards had all passed into her hands and if now there was to be a struggle with Lady Henry Lady Henry would be worsted All this was or should have been agreeable to the sensitive nerves of a woman who knew the worth of social advantages It had no effect however on the mortal depression which was constantly Julie s portion during the early weeks of her marriage As for Delafield he had entered upon this determining experiment of his life a marriage which was merely a legalized comradeship with the woman he adored in the mind of one resolved to pay the price of what he had done This graceful and stately woman with her high intelligence and her social gifts was now his own property She was to be the companion of his days and the mistress of his house But although he knew well that he had a certain strong hold upon her she did not love him and none of the fusion of true marriage had taken place or could take place So be it He set himself to build up a relation between them which should justify the violence offered to natural and spiritual law His own delicacy of feeling and perception combined with the strength of his passion to make every action of their common day a symbol and sacrament That her heart regretted Warkworth that bitterness and longing an unspent and baffled love must be constantly overshadowing her these things he not only knew he was forever reminding himself of them driving them as it were into consciousness as the ascetic drives the spikes into his flesh His task was to comfort her to make her forget to bring her back to common peace and cheerfulness of mind To this end he began with appealing as much as possible to her intelligence He warmly encouraged her work for Meredith From the first days of their marriage he became her listener scholar and critic Himself interested mainly in social economical or religious discussion he humbly put himself to school in matters of belles lettres His object was to enrich Julie s daily life with new ambitions and new pleasures which might replace the broodings of her illness and convalescence and then to make her feel that she had at hand in the companion of that life one who felt a natural interest in all her efforts a natural pride in all her successes Alack the calculation was too simple and too visible It took too little account of the complexities of Julie s nature of the ravages and the shock of passion Julie herself might be ready enough to return to the things of the mind but they were no sooner offered to her as it were in exchange for the perilous delights of love than she grew dumbly restive She felt herself also too much observed too much thought over made too often if the truth were known the subject of religious or mystical emotion More and more also was she conscious of strangeness and eccentricity in the man she had married It often seemed to that keen and practical sense which in her mingled so oddly with the capacity for passion that as they grew older and her mind recovered tone and balance she would probably love the world disastrously more and he disastrously less And if so the gulf between them instead of closing could but widen One day a showery day in early June she was left alone for an hour while Delafield went down to Montreux to change some circular notes Julie took a book from the table and strolled out along the lovely road that slopes gently downward from Charnex to the old field embowered village of Brent The rain was just over It had been a cold rain and the snow had crept downward on the heights and had even powdered the pines of the Cubly The clouds were sweeping low in the west Towards Geneva the lake was mere wide and featureless space a cold and misty water melting into the fringes of the rain clouds But to the east above the Rhone valley the sky was lifting and as Julie sat down upon a midway seat and turned herself eastward she was met by the full and unveiled glory of the higher Alps the Rochers de Naye the Velan the Dent du Midi On the jagged peaks of the latter a bright shaft of sun was playing and the great white or rock ribbed mass raised itself above the mists of the lower world once more unstained and triumphant But the cold bise was still blowing and Julie shivering drew her wrap closer round her Her heart pined for Como and the south perhaps for the little Duchess who spoiled and petted her in the common womanish ways The spring a second spring was all about her but in this chilly northern form it spoke to her with none of the ravishment of Italy In the steep fields above her the narcissuses were bent and bowed with rain the red browns of the walnuts glistened in the wet gleams of sun the fading apple blossom beside her wore a melancholy beauty only in the rich pushing grass with its wealth of flowers and its branching cow parsley was there the stubborn life and prophecy of summer Suddenly Julie caught up the book that lay beside her and opened it with a hasty hand It was one of that set of Saint Simon which had belonged to her mother and had already played a part in her own destiny She turned to the famous character of the Dauphin of that model prince in whose death Saint Simon and Fenelon and France herself saw the eclipse of all great hopes A prince affable gentle humane patient modest full of compunctions and as much as his position allowed sometimes beyond it humble and severe towards himself Was it not to the life Affable doux humain patient modeste humble et austere pour soi beyond what was expected beyond almost what was becoming She read on to the mention of the Dauphine terrified in her human weakness of so perfect a husband and trying to beguile or tempt him from the heights to the picture of Louis Quatorze the grandfather shamed in his worldly old age by the presence beside him of this saintly and high minded youth of the Court looking forward with dismay to the time when it should find itself under the rule of a man who despised and condemned both its follies and its passions until she reached that final rapture where in a mingled anguish and adoration Saint Simon bids eternal farewell to a character and a heart of which France was not worthy The lines passed before her and she was conscious guiltily conscious of reading them with a double mind Then she closed the book held by the thought of her husband in a somewhat melancholy reverie There is a Catholic word with which in her convent youth she had been very familiar the word recueilli recollected At no time had it sounded kindly in her ears for it implied fetters and self suppressions of the voluntary and spiritual sort wholly unwelcome to and unvalued by her own temperament But who that knew him well could avoid applying it to Delafield A man of recollection living in the eye of the Eternal keeping a guard over himself in the smallest matters of thought and action mystically possessed by the passion of a spiritual ideal in love with charity purity simplicity of life She bowed her head upon her hands in dreariness of spirit Ultimately what could such a man want with her What had she to give him In what way could she ever be necessary to him And a woman even in friendship must feel herself that to be happy Already this daily state in which she found herself of owing everything and giving nothing produced in her a secret irritation and repulsion how would it be in the years to come He never saw me as I am she thought to herself looking fretfully back to their past acquaintance I am neither as weak as he thinks me nor as clever And how strange it is this tension in which he lives And as she sat there idly plucking at the wet grass her mind was overrun with a motley host of memories some absurd some sweet some of an austerity that chilled her to the core She thought of the difficulty she had in persuading Delafield to allow himself even necessary comforts and conveniences a laugh involuntary and not without tenderness crossed her face as she recalled a tale he had told her at Camaldoli of the contempt excited in a young footman of a smart house by the mediocrity and exiguity of his garments and personal appointments generally I felt I possessed nothing that he would have taken as a gift said Delafield with a grin It was chastening Yet though he laughed he held to it and Julie was already so much of the wife as to be planning how to coax him presently out of a portmanteau and a top hat that were in truth a disgrace to their species And all the time she must have the best of everything a maid luxurious travelling dainty food They had had one or two wrestles on the subject already Why are you to have all the high thinking and plain living to yourself she had asked him angrily only to be met by the plea Dear get strong first then you shall do what you like But it was at La Verna the mountain height overshadowed by the memories of saint Francis that she seemed to have come nearest to the ascetic and mystical tendency in Delafield He went about the mountain paths a transformed being like one long spiritually athirst who has found the springs and sources of life Julie felt a secret terror Her impression was much the same as Meredith s as of something wearing through to the light of day Looking back she saw that this temperament now so plain to view had been always there but in the young and capable agent of the Chudleigh property in the Duchess s cousin or Lady Henry s nephew it had passed for the most part unsuspected How remarkably it had developed whither would it carry them both in the future When thinking about it she was apt to find herself seized with a sudden craving for Mayfair little dinners and good talk What a pity you weren t born a Catholic you might have been a religious she said to him one night at La Verna when he had been reading her some of the Fioretti with occasional comments of his own But he had shaken his head with a smile You see I have no creed or next to none The answer startled her And in the depths of his blue eyes there seemed to her to be hovering a swarm of thoughts that would not let themselves loose in her presence but were none the less the true companions of his mind She saw herself a moment as Elsa and her husband as a modern Lohengrin coming spiritually she knew not whence bound on some quest mysterious and unthinkable What will you do she said suddenly when the dukedom comes to you Delafield s aspect darkened in an instant If he could have shown anger to her anger there would have been That is a subject I never think of or discuss if I can help it he said abruptly and rising to his feet he pointed out that the sun was declining fast towards the plain of the Casentino and they were far from their hotel Inhuman unreasonable was the cry of the critical sense in her as she followed him in silence Innumerable memories of this kind beat on Julie s mind as she sat dreamily on her bench among the Swiss meadows How natural that in the end they should sweep her by reaction into imaginations wholly indifferent of a drum and trumpet history in the actual fighting world Far far in the African desert she followed the march of Warkworth s little troop Ah the blinding light the African scrub and sand the long single line the native porters with their loads the handful of English officers with that slender figure at their head the endless waterless path with its palms and mangoes and mimosas the scene rushed upon the inward eye and held it She felt the heat the thirst the weariness of bone and brain all the spell and mystery of the unmapped unconquered land Did he think of her sometimes at night under the stars or in the blaze and mirage of noon Yes yes he thought of her Each to the other their thoughts must travel while they lived In Delafield s eyes she knew his love for her had been mere outrage and offence Ah well he at least had needed her He had desired only very simple earthy things money position success things it was possible for a woman to give him or get for him and at the last though it were only as a traitor to his word and his fiancee he had asked for love asked commonly hungrily recklessly because he could not help it and then for pardon And those are things the memory of which lies deep deep in the pulsing throbbing heart At this point she hurriedly checked and scourged herself as she did a hundred times a day No no no It was all over and she and Jacob would still make a fine thing of their life together Why not And all the time there were burning hot tears in her eyes and as the leaves of Saint Simon passed idly through her fingers the tears blotted out the meadows and the flowers and blurred the figure of a young girl who was slowly mounting the long slope of road that led from the village of Brent towards the seat on which Julie was sitting Gradually the figure approached The mist cleared from Julie s eyes Suddenly she found herself giving a close and passionate attention to the girl upon the road Her form was slight and small under her shady hat there was a gleam of fair hair arranged in smooth shining masses about her neck and temples As she approached Julie she raised her eyes absently and Julie saw a face of singular and delicate beauty marred however by the suggestion of physical fragility even sickliness which is carried with it One might have thought it a face blanched by a tropical climate and for the moment touched into faint color by the keen Alpine air The eyes indeed were full of life they were no sooner seen but they defined and enforced a personality Eager intent a little fretful they expressed a nervous energy out of all proportion to their owner s slender physique In this other bodily signs concurred As she perceived Julie on the bench for instance the girl s slight habitual frown sharply deepened she looked at the stranger with keen observation both glance and gesture betraying a quick and restless sensibility As for Julie she half rose as the girl neared her Her cheeks were flushed her lips parted she had the air of one about to speak The girl looked at her in a little surprise and passed on She carried a book under her arm into which were thrust a few just opened letters She had scarcely passed the bench when an envelope fell out of the book and lay unnoticed on the road Julie drew a long breath She picked up the envelope It lay in her hand and the name she had expected to see was written upon it For a moment she hesitated Then she ran after the owner of the letter You dropped this on the road The girl turned hastily Thank you very much I am sorry to have given you the trouble Then she paused arrested evidently by the manner in which Julie stood regarding her Did did you wish to speak to me she said uncertainly You are Miss Moffatt Yes That is my name But excuse me I am afraid I don t remember you The words were spoken with a charming sweetness and timidity I am missus Delafield The girl started violently Are you I I beg your pardon She stood in a flushed bewilderment staring at the lady who had addressed her a troubled consciousness possessing itself of her face and manner more and more plainly with every moment Julie asked herself hurriedly How much does she know What has she heard But aloud she gently said I thought you must have heard of me Lord Uredale told me he had written his father wished it to Lady Blanche Your mother and mine were sisters The girl shyly withdrew her eyes Yes mother told me There was a moment s silence The mingled fear and recklessness which had accompanied Julie s action disappeared from her mind In the girl s manner there was neither jealousy nor hatred only a young shrinking and reserve May I walk with you a little Please do Are you staying at Montreux No we are at Charnex and you We came up two days ago to a little pension at Brent I wanted to be among the fields now the narcissuses are out If it were warm weather we should stay but mother is afraid of the cold for me I have been ill I heard that said Julie in a voice gravely kind and winning That was why your mother could not come home The girl s eyes suddenly filled with tears No poor mother I wanted her to go we had a good nurse but she would not leave me though she was devoted to my grandfather She She is always anxious about you Yes My health has been a trouble lately and since father died She has only you They walked on a few paces in silence Then the girl looked up eagerly You saw grandfather at the last Do tell me about it please My uncles write so little Julie obeyed with difficulty She had not realized how hard it would be for her to talk of Lord Lackington But she described the old man s gallant dying as best she could while Aileen Moffatt listened with that manner at once timid and rich in feeling which seemed to be her characteristic As they neared the top of the hill where the road begins to incline towards Charnex Julie noticed signs of fatigue in her companion You have been an invalid she said You ought not to go farther May I take you home Would your mother dislike to see me The girl paused perceptibly Ah there she is They had turned towards Brent and Julie saw coming towards them with somewhat rapid steps a small elderly lady gray haired her features partly hidden by her country hat A thrill passed through Julie This was the sister whose name her mother had mentioned in her last hour It was as though something of her mother something that must throw light upon that mother s life and being were approaching her along this Swiss road But the lady in question as she neared them looked with surprise not unmingled with hauteur upon her daughter and the stranger beside her Aileen why did you go so far You promised me only to be a quarter of an hour I am not tired mother Mother this is missus Delafield You remember Uncle Uredale wrote Lady Blanche Moffatt stood still Once more a fear swept through Julie s mind and this time it stayed After an evident hesitation a hand was coldly extended How do you do I heard from my brothers of your marriage but they said you were in Italy We have just come from there And your husband He has gone down to Montreux but he should be home very soon now We are only a few steps from our little inn Would you not rest there Miss Moffatt looks very tired There was a pause Lady Blanche was considering her daughter Julie saw the trembling of her wide irregular mouth of which the lips were slightly turned outward Finally she drew her daughter s hand into her arm and bent anxiously towards her scrutinizing her face Thank you We will rest a quarter of an hour Can we get a carriage at Charnex Yes I think so if you will wait a little on our balcony They walked on towards Charnex Lady Blanche began to talk resolutely of the weather which was indeed atrocious She spoke as she would have done to the merest acquaintance There was not a word of her father not a word either of her brother s letter or of Julie s relationship to herself Julie accepted the situation with perfect composure and the three kept up some sort of a conversation till they reached the paved street of Charnex and the old inn at its lower end Julie guided her companions through its dark passages till they reached an outer terrace where there were a few scattered seats and among them a deck chair with cushions Please said Julie as she kindly drew the girl towards it Aileen smiled and yielded Julie placed her among the cushions then brought out a shawl and covered her warmly from the sharp damp air Aileen thanked her and lightly touched her hand A secret sympathy seemed to have suddenly sprung up between them Lady Blanche sat stiffly beside her daughter watching her face The warm touch of friendliness in Aileen s manner towards missus Delafield seemed only to increase the distance and embarrassment of her own Julie appeared to be quite unconscious She ordered tea and made no further allusion of any kind to the kindred they had in common She and Lady Blanche talked as strangers Julie said to herself that she understood She remembered the evening at Crowborough House the spinster lady who had been the Moffatts friend her own talk with Evelyn In that way or in some other the current gossip about herself and Warkworth gossip they had been too mad and miserable to take much account of had reached Lady Blanche Lady Blanche probably abhorred her though because of her marriage there was to be an outer civility Meanwhile no sign whatever of any angry or resentful knowledge betrayed itself in the girl s manner Clearly the mother had shielded her Julie felt the flutter of an exquisite relief She stole many a look at Aileen comparing the reality with that old ugly notion her jealousy had found so welcome of the silly or insolent little creature possessing all that her betters desired by the mere brute force of money or birth And all the time the reality was this so soft suppliant ethereal Here indeed was the child of Warkworth s picture the innocent unknowing child whom their passion had sacrificed and betrayed She could see the face now as it lay piteous in Warkworth s hand Then she raised her eyes to the original And as it looked at her with timidity and nascent love her own heart beat wildly now in remorse now in a reviving jealousy Secretly behind this mask of convention were they both thinking of him A girl s thoughts are never far from her lover and Julie was conscious this afternoon of a strange and mysterious preoccupation whereof Warkworth was the centre Gradually the great mountains at the head of the lake freed themselves from the last wandering cloud wreaths On the rock faces of the Rochers de Naye the hanging pine woods brushed with snow came into sight The white walls of Glion shone faintly out and a pearly gold which was but a pallid reflection of the Italian glory diffused itself over mountain and lake The sun was grudging there was no caress in the air Aileen shivered a little in her shawls and when Julie spoke of Italy the girl s enthusiasm and longing sprang as it were to meet her and both were conscious of another slight link between them Suddenly a sound of steps came to them from below My husband said Julie rising and going to the balustrade she waved to Delafield who had come up from Montreux by one of the steep vineyard paths I will tell him you are here she added with what might have been taken for the shyness of the young wife She ran down the steps leading from the terrace to the lower garden Aileen looked at her mother Isn t she wonderful she said in an ardent whisper I could watch her forever She is the most graceful person I ever saw Mother is she like Aunt Rose Lady Blanche shook her head Not in the least she said shortly She has too much manner for me Oh mother And the girl caught her mother s hand in caressing remonstrance as though to say Dear little mother you must like her because I do and you mustn t think of Aunt Rose and all those terrible things except for pity Hush said Lady Blanche smiling at her a little excitedly Hush they re coming Delafield and Julie emerged from the iron staircase Lady Blanche turned and looked at the tall distinguished pair her ugly lower lip hardening ungraciously But she and Delafield had a slight previous acquaintance and she noticed instantly the charming and solicitous kindness with which he greeted her daughter Julie tells me Miss Moffatt is still far from strong he said returning to the mother Lady Blanche only sighed for answer He drew a chair beside her and they fell into the natural talk of people who belong to the same social world and are travelling in the same scenes Meanwhile Julie was sitting beside the heiress Not much was said but each was conscious of a lively interest in the other and every now and then Julie would put out a careful hand and draw the shawls closer about the girl s frail form The strain of guilty compunction that entered into Julie s feeling did but make it the more sensitive She said to herself in a vague haste that now she would make amends If only Lady Blanche were willing But she should be willing Julie felt the stirrings of the old self confidence the old trust in a social ingenuity which had in truth rarely failed her Her intriguing managing instinct made itself felt the mood of Lady Henry s companion Presently as they were talking Aileen caught sight of an English newspaper which Delafield had brought up from Montreux It lay still unopened on one of the tables of the terrace Please give it me said the girl stretching out an eager hand It will have Tiny s marriage mamma A cousin of mine she explained to Julie who rose to hand it to her A very favorite cousin Oh thank you She opened the paper Julie turned away that she might relieve Lady Blanche of her teacup Suddenly a cry rang out a cry of mortal anguish Two ladies who had just stepped out upon the terrace from the hotel drawing room turned in terror the gardener who was watering the flower boxes at the farther end stood arrested Aileen shrieked Lady Blanche running to her What what is it The paper had dropped to the floor but the child still pointed to it gasping Mother mother Some intuition woke in Julie She stood dead white and dumb while Lady Blanche threw herself on her daughter Aileen darling what is it The girl in her agony threw her arms frantically round her mother and dragged herself to her feet She stood tottering her hand over her eyes He s dead mother He s dead The last word sank into a sound more horrible even than the first cry Then she swayed out of her mother s arms It was Julie who caught her who laid her once more on the deck chair a broken shrunken form in whom all the threads and connections of life had suddenly as it were fallen to ruin Lady Blanche hung over her pushing Julie away gathering the unconscious girl madly in her arms Delafield rushed for water and brandy Julie snatched the paper and looked at the telegrams High up in the first column was the one she sought CAIRO June twelve Great regret is felt here at the sudden and tragic news of Major Warkworth s death from fever which seems to have occurred at a spot some three weeks distance from the coast on or about May twenty five Letters from the officer who has succeeded him in the command of the Mokembe expedition have now reached Denga A fortnight after leaving the coast Major Warkworth was attacked with fever he made a brave struggle against it but it was of a deadly type and in less than a week he succumbed The messenger brought also his private papers and diaries which have been forwarded to his representatives in England Major Warkworth was a most promising and able officer and his loss will be keenly felt Julie fell on her knees beside her swooning cousin Lady Blanche meanwhile was loosening her daughter s dress chafing her icy hands or moaning over her in a delirium of terror My darling my darling Oh my God Why did I allow it Why did I ever let him come near her It was my fault my fault And it s killed her And clinging to her child s irresponsive hands she looked down upon her in a convulsion of grief which included not a shadow of regret not a gleam of pity for anything or any one else in the world but this bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh which lay stricken there But Julie s mind had ceased to be conscious of the tragedy beside her It had passed for the second time into the grasp of an illusion which possessed itself of the whole being and all its perceptive powers Before her wide terror stricken gaze there rose once more the same piteous vision which had tortured her in the crisis of her love for Warkworth Against the eternal snows which close in the lake the phantom hovered in a ghastly relief emaciated with matted hair and purpled cheeks and eyes not to be borne expressing the dumb anger of a man still young who parts unwillingly from life in a last lonely spasm of uncomforted pain XXIII It was midnight in the little inn at Charnex The rain which for so many nights in this miserable June had been beating down upon the village had at last passed away The night was clear and still a night when the voice of mountain torrents far distant might reach the ear suddenly sharply pure from the very depths of silence Julie was in bed She had been scarcely aware of her maid s help in undressing The ordinary life was as it were suspended Two scenes floated alternately before her one the creation of memory the other of imagination and the second was if possible the more vivid the more real of the two Now she saw herself in Lady Henry s drawing room Sir Wilfrid Bury and a white haired general were beside her The door opened and Warkworth entered young handsome soldierly with that boyish conquering air which some admired and others disliked His eyes met hers and a glow of happiness passed through her Then at a stroke the London drawing room melted away She was in a low bell tent The sun burned through its sides the air was stifling She stood with two other men and the doctor beside the low camp bed her heart was wrung by every movement every sound she heard the clicking of the fan in the doctor s hands she saw the flies on the poor damp brow And still she had no tears Only existence seemed to have ended in a gulf of horror where youth and courage repentance and high resolve love and pleasure were all buried and annihilated together That poor girl up stairs It had not been possible to take her home She was there with nurse and doctor her mother hanging upon every difficult breath The attack of diphtheria had left a weakened heart and nervous system the shock had been cruel and the doctor could promise nothing for the future Mother mother Dead The cry echoed in Julie s ears It seemed to fill the old low ceiled room in which she lay Her fancy preternaturally alive heard it thrown back from the mountains outside returned to her in wailing from the infinite depths of the lake She was conscious of the vast forms and abysses of nature there in the darkness beyond the walls of her room as something hostile implacable And while he lay there dead under the tropical sand she was still living and breathing here in this old Swiss inn Jacob Delafield s wife at least in name There was a knock at her door At first she did not answer it It seemed to be only one of the many dream sounds which tormented her nerves Then it was repeated Mechanically she said Come in The door opened and Delafield carrying a light which he shaded with his hand stood on the threshold May I come and talk to you he said in a low voice I know you are not sleeping It was the first time he had entered his wife s room Through all her misery Julie felt a strange thrill as her husband s face was thus revealed to her brightly illumined in the loneliness of the night Then the thrill passed into pain the pain of a new and sharp perception Delafield in truth was some two or three years younger than Warkworth But the sudden impression on Julie s mind as she saw him thus was of a man worn and prematurely aged markedly older and graver even since their marriage since that memorable evening by the side of Como when by that moral power of which he seemed often to be the mere channel and organ he had overcome her own will and linked her life with his She looked at him in a kind of terror Why was he so pale an embodied grief Warkworth s death was not a mortal stroke for him He came closer and still Julie s eyes held him Was it her fault this this shadowed countenance these suggestions of a dumb strain and conflict which not even his strong youth could bear without betrayal Her heart cried out first in a tragic impatience then it melted within her strangely she knew not how She sat up in bed and held out her hands He thought of that evening in Heribert Street after Warkworth had left her when she had been so sad and yet so docile The same yearning the same piteous agitation was in her attitude now He knelt down beside the bed and put his arms round her She clasped her hands about his neck and hid her face on his shoulder There ran through her the first long shudder of weeping He was so young he heard her say through sobs So young He raised his hand and touched her hair tenderly He died serving his country he said commanding his voice with difficulty And you grieve for him like this I can t pity him so much You thought ill of him I know you did She spoke between deep sobbing breaths But he wasn t he wasn t a bad man She fell back on her pillow and the tears rained down her cheeks Delafield kissed her hand in silence Some day I ll tell you she said brokenly Yes you shall tell me It would help us both I ll prove to you he wasn t vile When when he proposed that to me he was distracted So was I How could he break off his engagement Now you see how she loved him But we couldn t part we couldn t say good bye It had all come on us unawares We wanted to belong to each other just for two days and then part forever Oh I ll tell you You shall tell me all here he said firmly crushing her delicate hands in his own against his breast so that she felt the beating of his heart Give me my hand I ll show you his letter his last letter to me And trembling she drew from under her pillow that last scrawled letter written from the squalid hotel near the Gare de Sceaux No sooner however had she placed it in Delafield s hands than she was conscious of new forces of feeling in herself which robbed the act of its simplicity She had meant to plead her lover s cause and her own with the friend who was nominally her husband Her action had been a cry for sympathy as from one soul to another But as Delafield took the letter and began to read her pulses began to flutter strangely She recalled the phrases of passion which the letter contained She became conscious of new fears new compunctions For Delafield too the moment was one of almost intolerable complexity This tender intimacy of night the natural intimacy of husband and wife this sense which would not be denied however sternly he might hold it in check of her dear form beside him the little refinements and self revelations of a woman s room his half rights towards her appealing at once to love and to the memory of that solemn pledge by which he had won her what man who deserved the name but must be conscious tempestuously conscious of such thoughts and facts And then wrestling with these smarts these impulses belonging to the natural physical life the powers of the moral being compassion self mastery generosity while strengthening and directing all the man of faith was poignantly aware of the austere and tender voices of religion Amid this play of influences he read the letter still kneeling beside her and holding her fingers clasped in his She had closed her eyes and lay still save for the occasional tremulous movement of her free hand which dried the tears on her cheek Thank you he said at last with a voice that wavered as he put the letter down Thank you It was good of you to let me see it It changes all my thoughts of him henceforward If he had lived But he s dead He s dead cried Julie in a sudden agony wrenching her hand from his and burying her face in the pillow Just when he wanted to live Oh my God my God No there s no God nothing that cares that takes any notice She was shaken by deep convulsive weeping Delafield soothed her as best he could And presently she stretched out her hand with a quick piteous gesture and touched his face You too What have I done to you How you looked just now I bring a curse Why did you want to marry me I can t tear this out of my heart I can t And again she hid herself from him Delafield bent over her Do you imagine that I should be poor souled enough to ask you Suddenly a wild feeling of revolt ran through Julie s mind The loftiness of his mood chilled her An attitude more weakly passionately human a more selfish pity for himself would in truth have served him better Had the pain of the living man escaped his control avenging itself on the supremacy that death had now given to the lover Delafield might have found another Julie in his arms As it was her husband seemed to her perhaps less than man in being more she admired unwillingly and her stormy heart withdrew itself And when at last she controlled her weeping and it became evident to him that she wished once more to be alone his sensitiveness perfectly divined the secret reaction in her He rose from his place beside her with a deep involuntary sigh She heard it but only to shrink away You will sleep a little he said looking down upon her I will try mon ami If you don t sleep and would like me to read to you call me I am in the next room She thanked him faintly and he went away At the door he paused and came back again To night he hesitated while the doctors were here I ran down to Montreux by the short path and telegraphed The consul at Zanzibar is an old friend of mine I asked him for more particulars at once by wire But the letters can t be here for a fortnight I know You re very very good Hour after hour Delafield sat motionless in his room till high in the Valais depths profound he saw the morning break There was a little balcony at his command and as he noiselessly stepped out upon it between three and four o clock he felt himself the solitary comrade of the mist veiled lake of those high rosy mountains on the eastern verge the first throne and harbor of the light of the lower forest covered hills that took the morning one by one in a glorious and golden succession All was fresh austere and vast the spaces of the lake the distant hollows of high glaciers filled with purple shadow the precipices of the Rochers de Naye where the new snow was sparkling in the sun the cool wind that blew towards him from the gates of Italy down the winding recesses of that superb valley which has been a thoroughfare of nations from the beginning of time Not a boat on the wide reaches of the lake not a voice or other sound of human toil either from the vineyards below or the meadows above Meanwhile some instinct perhaps also some faint movements in her room told him that Julie was no less wakeful than himself And was not that a low voice in the room above him the trained voice and footsteps of a nurse Ah poor little heiress she too watched with sorrow A curious feeling of shame of self depreciation crept into his heart Surely he himself of late had been lying down with fear and rising up with bitterness Never a day had passed since they had reached Switzerland but he a man of strong natural passions had bade himself face the probable truth that by a kind of violence he had married a woman who would never love him had taken irrevocably a false step only too likely to be fatal to himself intolerable to her Nevertheless steeped as he had been in sadness in foreboding and during this by gone night in passionate envy of the dead yet beloved Warkworth he had never been altogether unhappy That mysterious It that other divine self of the mystic God the enwrapping sheltering force had been with him always It was with him now it spoke from the mysterious color and light of the dawn How then could he ever equal Julie in experience in the true and poignant feeling of any grief whatever His mind was in a strange double state It was like one who feels himself unfairly protected by a magic armor he would almost throw it aside in a remorseful eagerness to be with his brethren and as his brethren in the sore weakness and darkness of the human combat and then he thinks of the hand that gave the shield and his heart melts in awe Friend of my soul and of the world make me thy tool thy instrument Thou art Love Speak through me Draw her heart to mine At last knowing that there was no sleep in him and realizing that he had brooded enough he made his way out of the hotel and up through the fresh and dew drenched meadows where the haymakers were just appearing to the Les Avants stream A plunge into one of its cool basins retempered the whole man He walked back through the scented field paths resolutely restraining his mind from the thoughts of the night hammering out indeed in his head a scheme for the establishment of small holdings on certain derelict land in Wiltshire belonging to his cousin As he was descending on Charnex he met the postman and took his letters One among them from the Duke of Chudleigh contained a most lamentable account of Lord Elmira The father and son had returned to England and an angry inclement May had brought a touch of pneumonia to add to all the lad s other woes In itself it was not much was indeed passing away But it has used up most of his strength said the Duke and you know whether he had any to waste Don t forget him He constantly thinks and talks of you Delafield restlessly wondered when he could get home But he realized that Julie would now feel herself tragically linked to the Moffatts and how could he leave her He piteously told himself that here and now was his chance with her As he bore himself now towards her in this hour of her grief for Warkworth so perhaps would their future be Yet the claims of kindred were strong He suffered much inward distress as he thought of the father and son and their old touching dependence upon him Chudleigh as Jacob knew well was himself incurably ill Could he long survive his poor boy And so that other thought which Jacob spent so much ingenuity in avoiding rushed upon him unawares The near inevitable expectation of the famous dukedom which in the case of almost any other man in England must at least have quickened the blood with a natural excitement produced in Delafield s mind a mere dull sense of approaching torment Perhaps there was something non sane in his repulsion something that linked itself with his father s queerness or the bigotry and fanaticism of his grandmother the Evangelical Duchess with her swarm of parsons as Sir Wilfrid remembered her The oddity which had been violent or brutal in earlier generations showed itself in him one might have said in a radical transposition of values a singularity of criterion which the ordinary robust Englishman might very well dismiss with impatience as folly or cant Yet it was neither and the feeling had in truth its own logic and history He had lived from his youth up among the pageants of rank and possession They had no glamour for him he realized their burdens their ineffectiveness for all the more precious kinds of happiness how could he not with these two forlorn figures of Chudleigh and his boy always before him As for imagination and poetry Delafield with a mind that was either positive or mystical the mind one might say of the land agent or the saint failed to see where they came in Family tradition no doubt carries a thrill But what thrill is there in the mere possession of a vast number of acres of land of more houses new and old than any human being can possibly live in of more money than any reasonable man can ever spend and more responsibilities than he can ever meet Such things often seemed to Delafield pure calamity mere burdens upon life and breath That he could and must be forced some time by law and custom to take them up was nothing but a social barbarity Mingled with all which of course was his passionate sense of spiritual democracy To be throned apart like a divine being surrounded by the bought homage of one s fellows and possessed of more power than a man can decently use was a condition which excited in Delafield the same kind of contemptuous revolt that it would have excited in saint Francis Be not ye called master a Christian even of his transcendental and heterodox sort if he were a Christian must surely hold these words in awe at least so far as concerned any mastery of the external or secular kind To masteries of another order the saint has never been disinclined As he once more struck the village street this familiar whirl of thoughts was buzzing in Delafield s mind pierced however by one sharper and newer Julie Did he know had he ever dared to find out how she regarded this future which was overtaking them She had tried to sound him she had never revealed herself In Lady Henry s house he had often noticed in Julie that she had an imaginative tenderness for rank or great fortune At first it had seemed to him a woman s natural romanticism then he explained it to himself as closely connected with her efforts to serve Warkworth But suppose he were made to feel that there after all lay her compensation She had submitted to a loveless marriage and lost her lover but the dukedom was to make amends He knew well that it would be so with nine women out of ten But the bare thought that it might be so with Julie maddened him He then was to be for her in the future the mere symbol of the vulgarer pleasures and opportunities while Warkworth held her heart Nay He stood still strengthening in himself the glad and sufficient answer She had refused him twice knowing all his circumstances At this moment he adored her doubly for those old rebuffs Within twenty four hours Delafield had received a telegram from his friend at Zanzibar For the most part it recapitulated the news already sent to Cairo and thence transmitted to the English papers But it added the information that Warkworth had been buried in the neighborhood of a certain village on the caravan route to Mokembe and that special pains had been taken to mark the spot And the message concluded Fine fellow Hard luck Everybody awfully sorry here These words brought Delafield a sudden look of passionate gratitude from Julie s dark and sunken eyes She rested her face against his sleeve and pressed his hand Lady Blanche also wept over the telegram exclaiming that she had always believed in Henry Warkworth and now perhaps those busybodies who at Simla had been pleased to concern themselves with her affairs and Aileen s would see cause to be ashamed of themselves To Delafield s discomfort indeed she poured out upon him a stream of confidences he would have gladly avoided He had brought the telegram to her sitting room In the room adjoining it was Aileen still according to her mother s account very ill and almost speechless Under the shadow of such a tragedy it seemed to him amazing that a mother could find words in which to tell her daughter s story to a comparative stranger Lady Blanche appeared to him an ill balanced and foolish woman a prey on the one hand to various obscure jealousies and antagonisms and on the other to a romantic and sentimental temper which once roused gloried in despising the world by which she generally meant a very ordinary degree of prudence She was in chronic disagreement it seemed with her daughter s guardians and had been so from the first moment of her widowhood the truth being that she was jealous of their legal powers over Aileen s fortune and destiny and determined notwithstanding to have her own way with her own child The wilfulness and caprice of the father which had taken such strange and desperate forms in Rose Delaney appeared shorn of all its attraction and romance in the smaller more conventional and meaner egotisms of Lady Blanche And yet in her own way she was full of heart She lost her head over a love affair She could deny Aileen nothing That was what her casual Indian acquaintances meant by calling her sweet When Warkworth s attentions pushed with an ardor which would have driven any prudent mother to an instant departure from India had made a timid and charming child of eighteen the talk of Simla Lady Blanche excited and dishevelled was it her personal untidiness which accounted for the other epithet of quaint which had floated to the Duchess s ear and been by her reported to Julie refused to break her daughter s heart Warkworth indeed had begun long before by flattering the mother s vanity and sense of possession and she now threw herself hotly into his cause as against Aileen s odious trustees They of course always believed the worst of everybody As for her all she wanted for the child was a good husband Was it not better in a world of fortune hunters that Aileen with her half million should marry early Of money she had one would think enough It was only the greed of certain persons which could possibly desire more Birth The young man was honorably born good looking well mannered What did you want more She accepted a democratic age and the obstacles thrown by Aileen s guardians in the way of an immediate engagement between the young people appeared to her so she declared either vulgar or ridiculous Well poor lady she had suffered for her whims First of all her levity had perceived with surprise and terror the hold that passion was taking on the delicate and sensitive nature of Aileen This young girl so innocent and spotless in thought so virginally sweet in manner so guileless in action developed a power of loving an absorption of the whole being in the beloved such as our modern world but rarely sees She lived she breathed for Warkworth Her health always frail suffered from their separation She became a thin and frail vision a gossamer girl indeed The ordinary life of travel and society lost all hold upon her she passed through it in a mood of weariness and distaste that was in itself a danger to vital force The mother became desperately alarmed and made a number of flurried concessions Letters at any rate should be allowed in spite of the guardians and without their knowledge Yet each letter caused emotions which ran like a storm wind through the child s fragile being and seemed to exhaust the young life at its source Then came the diphtheria acting with poisonous effect on a nervous system already overstrained And in the midst of the mother s anxieties there burst upon her the sudden incredible tale that Warkworth to whom she herself was writing regularly and to whom Aileen from her bed was sending little pencilled notes sweetly meant to comfort a sighing lover had been entangling himself in London with another a Miss Le Breton positively a nobody as far as birth and position were concerned the paid companion of Lady Henry Delafield and yet as it appeared a handsome intriguing unscrupulous hussy just the kind of hawk to snatch a morsel from a dove s mouth a woman in fact with whom a little bread and butter girl like Aileen might very well have no chance Emily Lawrence s letter in the tone of the candid friend written after her evening at Crowborough House had roused a mingled anguish and fury in the mother s breast She lifted her eyes from it to look at Aileen propped up in bed her head thrown back against the pillow and her little hands closed happily over Warkworth s letters and she went straight from that vision to write to the traitor The traitor defended and excused himself by return of post He implored her to pay no attention to the calumnious distortion of a friendship which had already served Aileen s interests no less than his own It was largely to Miss Le Breton s influence that he owed the appointment which was to advance him so materially in his career At the same time he thought it would be wise if Lady Blanche kept not only the silly gossip that was going about but even this true and innocent fact from Aileen s knowledge One never knew how a girl would take such things and he would rather explain it himself at his own time Lady Blanche had to be content And meanwhile the glory of the Mokembe appointment was a strong factor in Aileen s recovery She exulted over it by day and night and she wrote the letters of an angel The mother watched her writing them with mixed feelings As to Warkworth s replies which she was sometimes allowed to see Lady Blanche who had been a susceptible girl and the heroine of several affairs was secretly and strongly of opinion that men s love letters at any rate were poor things nowadays compared with what they had been But Aileen was more than satisfied with them How busy he must be and with such important business Poor harassed darling how good of him to write her a word to give her a thought And now Lady Blanche beheld her child crushed and broken a nervous wreck before her life had truly begun The agonies which the mother endured were very real and should have been touching But she was not a touching person All her personal traits her red rimmed eyes her straggling hair the slight disagreeable twist in her nose and mouth combined with her signal lack of dignity and reticence to stir the impatience rather than the sympathy of the by stander And mamma was so fond of her Julie would say to herself sometimes in wonder proudly contrasting the wild grace and originality of her disgraced mother with the awkward slipshod ways of the sister who had remained a great lady Meanwhile Lady Blanche was indeed perpetually conscious of her strange niece perpetually thinking of the story her brothers had told her perpetually trying to recall the sister she had lost so young and then turning from all such things to brood angrily over the Lawrence letter and the various other rumors which had reached her of Warkworth s relations to Miss Le Breton What was in the woman s mind now She looked pale and tragic enough But what right had she to grieve or if she did grieve to be pitied Jacob Delafield had been fool enough to marry her and fate would make her a duchess So true it is that they who have no business to flourish do flourish like green bay trees As to poor Rose sometimes there would rise on Lady Blanche s mind the sudden picture of herself and the lost dark eyed sister scampering on their ponies through the country lanes of their childhood of her lessons with Rose her worship of Rose and then of that black curtain of mystery and reprobation which for the younger child of sixteen had suddenly descended upon Rose and all that concerned her But Rose s daughter All one could say was that she had turned out as the child of such proceedings might be expected to turn out a minx The aunt s conviction as to that stood firm And while Rose s face and fate had sunk into the shadows of the past even for her sister Aileen was here struggling for her delicate threatened life her hand always in the hand of this woman who had tried to steal her lover from her her soft hopeless eyes so tragically unconscious bent upon the bold intriguer What possessed the child Warkworth s letters Julie s company those seemed to be all she desired And at last in the June beauty and brilliance when a triumphant summer had banished the pitiful spring when the meadows were all perfume and color and the clear mountains in a clear sky upheld the ever new and never ending pomp of dawn and noon and night the little wasted creature looked up into Julie s face and without tears gasped out her story These are his letters Some day I ll I ll read you some of them and this is his picture I know you saw him at Lady Henry s He mentioned your name Will you please tell me everything all the times you saw him and what he talked of You see I am much stronger I can bear it all now Meanwhile for Delafield this fortnight of waiting waiting for the African letters waiting for the revival of life in Aileen was a period of extraordinary tension when all the powers of nerve and brain seemed to be tested and tried to the utmost He himself was absorbed in watching Julie and in dealing with her In the first place as he saw she could give no free course to grief The tragic yearning the agonized tenderness and pity which consumed her must be crushed out of sight as far as possible They would have been an offence to Lady Blanche a bewilderment to Aileen And it was on her relation to her new found cousin that as Delafield perceived her moral life for the moment turned This frail girl was on the brink of perishing because death had taken Warkworth from her And Julie knew well that Warkworth had neither loved her nor deserved her that he had gone to Africa and to death with another image in his heart There was a perpetual and irreparable cruelty in the situation And from the remorse of it Julie could not escape Day by day she was more profoundly touched by the clinging tender creature more sharply scourged by the knowledge that the affection developing between them could never be without its barrier and its mystery that something must always remain undisclosed lest Aileen cast her off in horror It was a new moral suffering in one whose life had been based hitherto on intellect or passion In a sense it held at bay even her grief for Warkworth her intolerable compassion for his fate In sheer dread lest the girl should find her out and hate her she lost insensibly the first poignancy of sorrow These secrets of feeling left her constantly pale and silent Yet her grace had never been more evident All the inmates of the little pension the landlord s family the servants the visitors as the days passed felt the romance and thrill of her presence Lady Blanche evoked impatience of ennui She was inconsiderate she was meddlesome she soon ceased even to be pathetic But for Julie every foot ran every eye smiled Then when the day was over Delafield s opportunity began Julie could not sleep He gradually established the right to read with her and talk with her It was a relation very singular and very intimate She would admit him at his knock and he would find her on her sofa very sad often in tears her black hair loose upon her shoulders Outwardly there was often much ceremony even distance between them inwardly each was exploring the other and Julie s attitude towards Delafield was becoming more uncertain more touched with emotion What was perhaps most noticeable in it was a new timidity a touch of anxious respect towards him In the old days what with her literary cultivation and her social success she had always been the flattered and admired one of their little group Delafield felt himself clumsy and tongue tied beside her It was a superiority on her part very natural and never ungraceful and it was his chief delight to bring it forward to insist upon it to take it for granted But the relation between them had silently shifted You judge you are always judging she had said once impatiently to Delafield And now it was round these judgments these inward verdicts of his on life or character that she was perpetually hovering She was infinitely curious about them She would wrench them from him and then would often shiver away from him in resentment He meanwhile as he advanced further in the knowledge of her strange nature was more and more bewildered by her her perversities and caprices her brilliancies and powers her utter lack of any standard or scheme of life She had been for a long time as it seemed to him the creature of her exquisite social instincts then the creature of passion But what a woman through it all and how adorable with those poetic gestures and looks those melancholy gracious airs that ravished him perpetually And now this new attitude as of a child leaning wistfully looking in your face asking to be led to be wrestled and reasoned with The days as they passed produced in him a secret and mounting intoxication Then perhaps for a day or two there would be a reaction both foreseeing that a kind of spiritual tyranny might arise from their relation and both recoiling from it One night she was very restless and silent There seemed to be no means of approach to her true mind Suddenly he took her hand it was some days since they had spoken of Warkworth and almost roughly reminded her of her promise to tell him all She rebelled But his look and manner held her and the inner misery sought an outlet Submissively she began to speak in her low murmuring voice she went back over the past the winter in Bruton Street the first news of the Moffatt engagement her efforts for Warkworth s promotion the history of the evening party which had led to her banishment the struggle in her own mind and Warkworth s the sudden mad schemes of their last interview the rush of the Paris journey The mingled exaltation and anguish the comparative absence of regret with which she told the story produced an astonishing effect on Delafield And in both minds as the story proceeded there emerged ever more clearly the consciousness of that imperious act by which he had saved her Suddenly she stopped I know you can find no excuse for it all she said in excitement Yes for all but for one thing was his low reply She shrank her eyes on his face That poor child he said under his breath She looked at him piteously Did you ever realize what you were doing he asked her raising her hand to his lips No no How could I I thought of some one so different I had never seen her She paused her wide seeking gaze fixed upon him through tears as though she pleaded with him to find explanations palliatives But he gently shook his head Suddenly shaken with weeping she bowed her face upon the hands that held her own It was like one who relinquishes all pleading all defence and throws herself on the mercy of the judge He tenderly asked her pardon if he had wounded her But he shrank from offering any caress The outward signs of life s most poignant and most beautiful moments are generally very simple and austere XXIV You have had a disquieting letter The voice was Julie s Delafield was standing apparently in thought at the farther corner of the little raised terrace of the hotel She approached him with an affectionate anxiety of which he was instantly conscious I am afraid I may have to leave you to night he said turning towards her and holding out the letter in his hand It contained a few agitated lines from the Duke of Chudleigh They tell me my lad can t get over this He s made a gallant fight but this beats us A week or two no more Ask missus Delafield to let you come She will I know She wrote to me very kindly Mervyn keeps talking of you You d come if you heard him It s ghastly the cruelty of it all Whether I can live without him that s the point You ll go of course said Julie returning it To night if you allow it Of course You ought I hate leaving you alone with this trouble on your hands said Jacob in some agitation What are your plans I could follow you next week Aileen comes down to day And I should like to wait here for the mail In five days about it should be here said Delafield There was a silence She dropped into a chair beside the balustrade of the terrace which was wreathed in wistaria and looked out upon the vast landscape of the lake His thought was How can the mail matter to her She cannot suppose that he had written Aloud he said in some embarrassment You expect letters yourself I expect nothing she said after a pause But Aileen is living on the chance of letters There may be nothing for her except indeed her letters to him poor child She knows that But the hope keeps her alive And you thought Delafield with an inward groan as he looked down upon her pale profile He had a moment s hateful vision of himself as the elder brother in the parable Was Julie s mind to be the home of an eternal antithesis between the living husband and the dead lover in which the latter had forever the beau role Then impatiently Jacob wrenched himself from mean thoughts It was as though he bared his head remorse fully before the dead man I will go to the Foreign Office he said in her ear as I pass through town They will have letters All the information I can get you shall have at once Thank you mon ami she said almost inaudibly Then she looked up and he was startled by her eyes Where he had expected grief he saw a shrinking animation Write to me often she said imperiously Of course But don t trouble to answer much Your hands are so full here She frowned Trouble Why do you spoil me so Demand insist that I should write Very well he said smiling I demand I insist She drew a long breath and went slowly away from him into the house Certainly the antagonism of her secret thoughts though it persisted was no longer merely cold or critical For it concerned one who was not only the master of his own life but threatened unexpectedly to become the master of hers She had begun indeed to please her imagination with the idea of a relation between them which while it ignored the ordinary relations of marriage should yet include many of the intimacies and refinements of love More and more did the surprises of his character arrest and occupy her mind She found indeed no plaster saint Her cool intelligence soon detected the traces of a peevish or stubborn temper and of a natural inertia perpetually combated however by the spiritual energy of a new and other self exfoliating from the old a self whose acts and ways she watched sometimes with the held breath of fascination sometimes with a return of shrinking or fear That a man should not only appear but be so good was still in her eyes a little absurd Perhaps her feeling was at bottom the common feeling of the sceptical nature We should listen to the higher voices but in such a way that if another hypothesis were true we should not have been too completely duped She was ready also to convict him of certain prejudices and superstitions which roused in her an intellectual impatience But when all was said Delafield unconsciously was drawing her towards him as the fowler draws a fluttering bird It was the exquisite refinement of those spiritual insights and powers he possessed which constantly appealed not only to her heart but a very important matter in Julie s case to her taste to her own carefully tempered instinct for the rare and beautiful He was the master then she admitted of a certain vein of spiritual genius Well here should he lead and even if he pleased command her She would sit at his feet and he should open to her ranges of feeling delights and subtleties of moral sensation hitherto unknown to her Thus the feeling of ennui and reaction which had marked the first weeks of her married life had now wholly disappeared Delafield was no longer dull or pedantic in her eyes She passed alternately from moments of intolerable smart and pity for the dead to moments of agitation and expectancy connected with her husband She thought over their meeting of the night before she looked forward to similar hours to come Meanwhile his relation towards her in many matters was still naively ignorant and humble determined by the simplicity of a man of some real greatness who never dreamed of claiming tastes or knowledge he did not possess whether in small things or large This phase however only gave the more value to one which frequently succeeded it For suddenly the conversation would enter regions where he felt himself peculiarly at home and with the same unconsciousness on his part she would be made to feel the dignity and authority which surrounded his ethical and spiritual life And these contrasts this weakness and this strength combined with the man and woman element which is always present in any situation of the kind gave rise to a very varied and gradually intensifying play of feeling between them Feeling only possible no doubt for the raffines of this world but for them full of strange charm and even of excitement Delafield left the little inn for Montreux Lausanne and London that afternoon He bent to kiss his wife at the moment of his departure in the bare sitting room that had been improvised for them on the ground floor of the hotel and as she let her face linger ever so little against his she felt strong arms flung round her and was crushed against his breast in a hungry embrace When he released her with a flush and a murmured word of apology she shook her head smiling sadly but saying nothing The door closed on him and at the sound she made a hasty step forward Jacob Take me with you But her voice died in the rattle and bustle of the diligence outside and she was left trembling from head to foot under a conflict of emotions that seemed now to exalt now to degrade her Half an hour after Delafield s departure there appeared on the terrace of the hotel a tottering emaciated form Aileen Moffatt in a black dress and hat clinging to her mother s arm But she refused the deck chair which they had spread with cushions and shawls No let me sit up And she took an ordinary chair looking round upon the lake and the little flowery terrace with a slow absorbed look like one trying to remember Suddenly she bowed her head on her hands Aileen cried Lady Blanche in an agony But the girl motioned her away Don t mummy I m all right And restraining any further emotion she laid her arms on the balustrade and gazed long and calmly into the purple depths and gleaming snows of the Rhone valley Her hat oppressed her and she took it off revealing the abundance of her delicately golden hair which in its lack of lustre and spring seemed to share in the physical distress and loss of the whole personality The face was that of a doomed creature incapable now of making any successful struggle for the right to live What had been sensibility had become melancholy the slight chronic frown was deeper the pale lips more pinched Yet intermittently there was still great sweetness the last effort of a beautiful soul meant for happiness and withered before its time As Julie stood beside her while Lady Blanche had gone to fetch a book from the salon the poor child put out her hand and grasped that of Julie It is quite possible I may get the letter to night she said in a hurried whisper My maid went down to Montreux there is a clever man at the post office who tried to make it out for us He thinks it ll be to night Don t be too disappointed if nothing comes said Julie caressing the hand Its thinness its icy and lifeless touch dismayed her Ah how easily might this physical wreck have been her doing The bells of Montreux struck half past six A restless and agonized expectation began to show itself in all the movements of the invalid She left her chair and began to pace the little terrace on Julie s arm Her dragging step the mournful black of her dress the struggle between youth and death in her sharpened face made her a tragic presence Julie could hardly bear it while all the time she too was secretly and breathlessly waiting for Warkworth s last words Lady Blanche returned and Julie hurried away She passed through the hotel and walked down the Montreux road The post had already reached the first houses of the village and the postman who knew her willingly gave her the letters Yes a packet for Aileen addressed in an unknown hand to a London address and forwarded thence It bore the Denga postmark And another for herself readdressed from London by Madame Bornier She tore off the outer envelope beneath was a letter of which the address was feebly written in Warkworth s hand Mademoiselle Le Breton three Heribert Street London She had the strength to carry her own letter to her room to call Aileen s maid and send her with the other packet to Lady Blanche Then she locked herself in Oh the poor crumpled page and the labored hand writing Julie I am dying They are such good fellows but they can t save me It s horrible I saw the news of your engagement in a paper the day before I left Denga You re right He ll make you happy Tell him I said so Oh my God I shall never trouble you again I bless you for the letter you wrote me Here it is No I can t can t read it Drowsy No pain And here the pen had dropped from his hand Searching for something more she drew from the envelope the wild and passionate letter she had written him at Heribert Street in the early morning after her return from Paris while she was waiting for Delafield to bring her the news of Lord Lackington s state The small table d hote of the Hotel Michel was still further diminished that night Lady Blanche was with her daughter and missus Delafield did not appear But the moon was hanging in glory over the lake when Julie unable to bear her room and her thoughts any longer threw a lace scarf about her head and neck and went blindly climbing through the upward paths leading to Les Avants The roads were silver in the moonlight so was the lake save where the great mountain shadows lay across the eastern end And suddenly white through pine trees Jaman delicately tall The air cooled her brow and from the deep enveloping night her torn heart drew balm and a first soothing of the pulse of pain Every now and then as she sat down to rest a waking dream overshadowed her She seemed to be supporting Warkworth in her arms his dying head lay upon her breast and she murmured courage and love into his ear But not as Julie Le Breton Through all the anguish of what was almost an illusion of the senses she still felt herself Delafield s wife And in that flood of silent speech she poured out on Warkworth it was as though she offered him also Jacob s compassion Jacob s homage mingled with her own Once she found herself sitting at the edge of a meadow environed by the heavy scents of flowers Some apple trees with whitened trunks rose between her and the lake a thousand feet below The walls of Chillon the houses of Montreux caught the light opposite the deep forests of Bouveret and saint Gingolphe lay black upon the lake above them rode the moon And to the east the high Alps their pure lines a little effaced and withdrawn as when a light veil hangs over a sanctuary Julie looked out upon a vast freedom of space and by a natural connection she seemed to be also surveying her own world of life and feeling her past and her future She thought of her childhood and her parents of her harsh combative youth of the years with Lady Henry of Warkworth of her husband and the life into which his strong hand had so suddenly and rashly drawn her Her thoughts took none of the religious paths so familiar to his And yet her reverie was so far religious that her mind seemed to herself to be quivering under the onset of affections emotions awes till now unknown and that looking back she was conscious of a groping sense of significance of purpose in all that had befallen her Yet to this sense she could put no words Only in the end through the constant action of her visualizing imagination it connected itself with Delafield s face and with the memory of many of his recent acts and sayings It was one of those hours which determine the history of a man or woman And the august Alpine beauty entered in so that Julie in this sad and thrilling act of self probing felt herself in the presence of powers and dominations divine Her face stained with tears took gradually some of the calm the loftiness of the night Yet the close shut brooding mouth would slip sometimes into a smile exquisitely soft and gentle as though the heart remembered something which seemed to the intelligence at once folly and sweetness What was going on within her was to her own consciousness a strange thing It appeared to her as a kind of simplification a return to childhood or rather was it the emergence in the grown mind tired with the clamor of its own egotistical or passionate life of some instincts natural to the child which she nevertheless as a child had never known instincts of trust of self abandonment steeped perhaps in those tears which are themselves only another happiness But hush What are our poor words in the presence of these nobler secrets of the wrestling and mounting spirit On the way down she saw another figure emerge from the dark Lady Blanche Lady Blanche stood still The hotel was stifling she said in a voice that vainly tried for steadiness Julie perceived that she had been weeping Aileen is asleep Perhaps They have given her something to make her sleep They walked on towards the hotel Julie hesitated She was not disappointed she said at last in a low voice No said the mother sharply But one knew of course there must be letters for her Thank God she can feel that his very last thought was for her The letters which have reached her are dated the day before the fatal attack began giving a complete account of his march most interesting showing how he trusted her already though she is such a child It will tranquillize her to feel how completely she possessed his heart poor fellow Julie said nothing and Lady Blanche with bitter satisfaction felt rather than saw what seemed to her the just humiliation expressed in the drooping and black veiled figure beside her Next day there was once more a tinge of color on Aileen s cheeks Her beautiful hair fell round her once more in a soft life and confusion and the roses which her mother had placed beside her on the bed were not in too pitiful contrast with her frail loveliness Read it please she said as soon as she found herself alone with Julie pushing her letter tenderly towards her He tells me everything everything All he was doing and hoping consults me in everything Isn t it an honor when I m so ignorant and childish I ll try to be brave try to be worthy And while her whole frame was shaken with deep silent sobs she greedily watched Julie read the letter Oughtn t I to try and live she said dashing away her tears as Julie returned it when he loved me so Julie kissed her with a passionate and guilty pity The letter might have been written to any friend to any charming child for whom a much older man had a kindness It gave a business like account of their march dilated on one or two points of policy drew some humorous sketches of his companions and concluded with a few affectionate and playful sentences But when the wrestle with death began Warkworth wrote but one last letter uttered but one cry of the heart and it lay now in Julie s bosom A few days passed Delafield s letters were short and full of sadness Elmira still lived but any day or hour might see the end As for the father But the subject was too tragic to be written of even to her Not to feel not to realize there lay the only chance of keeping one s own courage and so of being any help whatever to two of the most miserable of human beings At last rather more than a week after Delafield s departure came two telegrams One was from Delafield Mervyn died this morning Duke s condition causes great anxiety The other from Evelyn Crowborough Elmira died this morning Going down to Shropshire to help Jacob Julie threw down the telegrams A rush of proud tears came to her eyes She swept to the door of her room opened it and called her maid The maid came and when she saw the sparkling looks and strained bearing of her mistress wondered what crime she was to be rebuked for Julie merely bade her pack at once as it was her intention to catch the eight o clock through train at Lausanne that night for England Twenty hours later the train carrying Julie to London entered Victoria Station On the platform stood the little Duchess impatiently expectant Julie was clasped in her arms and had no time to wonder at the pallor and distraction of her friend before she was hurried into the brougham waiting beyond the train Oh Julie cried the Duchess catching the traveller s hands as they drove away Julie darling Julie turned to her in amazement The blue eyes fixed upon her had no tears but in them and in the Duchess s whole aspect was expressed a vivid horror and agitation which struck at Julie s heart What is it she said catching her breath What is it Julie I was going to Faircourt this morning First your telegram stopped me I thought I d wait and go with you Then came another from Delafield The Duke The poor Duke Julie s attitude changed unconsciously instantly Yes tell me It s in all the papers to night on the placards don t look out And the Duchess lifted her hand and drew down the blinds of the brougham He was in a most anxious state yesterday but they thought him calmer at night and he insisted on being left alone The doctors still kept a watch but he managed in some mysterious way to evade them all and this morning he was missed After two hours they found him in the river that runs below the house There was a silence And Jacob said Julie hoarsely That s what I m so anxious about exclaimed the Duchess Oh I am thankful you ve come You know how Jacob s always felt about the Duke and Mervyn how he s hated the notion of succeeding And Susan who went down yesterday telegraphed to me last night before this horror that he was terribly strained and overwrought Succeeding said Julie vaguely Mechanically she had drawn up the blind again and her eyes followed the dingy lines of the Vauxhall Bridge Road till suddenly they turned away from the placards outside a small stationer s shop which announced Tragic death of the Duke of Chudleigh and his son The Duchess looked at her curiously without replying Julie seemed to be grappling with some idea which escaped her or rather was presently expelled by one more urgent Is Jacob ill she said abruptly looking her companion full in the face I only know what I ve told you Susan says strained and overwrought Oh it ll be all right when he gets you Julie made no reply She sat motionless and the Duchess stealing another glance at her must needs even in this tragic turmoil allow herself the reflection that she was a more delicate study in black and white a more refined and accented personality than ever You won t mind said Evelyn timidly after a pause but Lady Henry is staying with me and also Sir Wilfrid Bury who had such a bad cold in his lodgings that I went down there a week ago got the doctor s leave and carried him off there and then And mister Montresor s coming in He particularly wanted he said just to press your hand But they sha n t bother you if you re tired Our train goes at ten point ten and Freddie has got the express stopped for us at Westonport about three in the morning The carriage rolled into Grosvenor Square and presently stopped before Crowborough House Julie alighted looked round her at the July green of the square at the brightness of the window boxes and then at the groom of the chambers who was taking her wraps from her the same man who in the old days used to feed Lady Henry s dogs with sweet biscuit It struck her that he was showing her a very particular and eager attention Meanwhile in the Duchess s drawing room a little knot of people was gathered Lady Henry Sir Wilfrid Bury and doctor Meredith Their demeanor illustrated both the subduing and the exciting influence of great events Lady Henry was more talkative than usual Sir Wilfrid more silent Lady Henry seemed to have profited by her stay at Torquay As she sat upright in a stiff chair her hands resting on her stick she presented her characteristic aspect of English solidity crossed by a certain free and foreign animation She had been already wrangling with Sir Wilfrid and giving her opinion freely on the socialistic views on rank and property attributed to Jacob Delafield If he can t digest the cake that doesn t mean it isn t good had been her last impatient remark when Sir Wilfrid interrupted her Only a few minutes more he said looking at his watch Now then what line do we take How much is our friend likely to know Unless she has lost her eyesight which Evelyn has not reported she will know most of what matters before she has gone a hundred yards from the station said Lady Henry dryly Oh the streets Yes but persons are often curiously dazed by such a gallop of events Not Julie Le Breton I should like to be informed as to the part you are about to play said Sir Wilfrid in a lower voice that I may play up to it Where are you Both looked at Meredith who had walked to a distant window and was standing there looking out upon the square Lady Henry was well aware that he had not forgiven her and to tell the truth was rather anxious that he should So she too dropped her voice I bow to the institutions of my country she said a little sparkle in the strong gray eye In other words you forgive a duchess I acknowledge the head of the family and the greater carries the less Suppose Jacob should be unforgiving He hasn t the spirit And she Her conscience will be on my side I thought it was your theory that she had none Jacob let us hope will have developed some He has a good deal to spare Sir Wilfrid laughed So it is you who will do the pardoning I shall offer an armed and honorable peace The Duchess of Chudleigh may intrigue and tell lies if she pleases I am not giving her a hundred a year There was a pause Why if I may ask said Sir Wilfrid at the end of it did you quarrel with Jacob I understand there was a separate cause Lady Henry hesitated He paid me a debt she said at last and a sudden flush rose in her old blanched cheek And that annoyed you You have the oddest code Lady Henry bit her lip One does not like one s money thrown in one s face Most unreasonable of women Never mind Wilfrid We all have our feelings Precisely Well no doubt Jacob will make peace As for Ah here comes Montresor A visible tremor passed through Lady Henry The door was thrown open and the footman announced the Minister for War Her grace sir is not yet returned Montresor stumbled into the room and even with his eye glasses carefully adjusted did not at once perceive who was in it Sir Wilfrid went towards him Ah Bury Convalescent I hope Quite The Duchess has gone to meet missus Delafield missus Montresor s mouth opened But of course you know Oh yes I know But one s tongue has to get oiled You see Lady Henry Montresor started I am glad to see Lady Henry he replied stiffly Lady Henry slowly rose and advanced two steps She quietly held out her hand to him and smiling looked him in the face Take it There is no longer any cause of quarrel between us I raise the embargo The Minister took the hand and shook his head Ah but you had no right to impose it he said with energy Oh for goodness sake meet me half way cried Lady Henry or I shall never hold out Sir Wilfrid whose half embarrassed gaze was bent on the ground looked up and was certain that he saw a gleam of moisture in those wrinkled eyes Why have you held out so long What does it matter to me whether Miss Julie be a duchess or no That doesn t make up to me for all the months you ve shut your door on me And I was always given to understand by the way that it wouldn t matter to you I ve had three months at Torquay said Lady Henry raising her shoulders I hope it was dull to distraction It was And my doctor tells me the more I fret the more gout I may expect So all this is not generosity but health Kiss my hand sir and have done with it You are all avenged At Torquay I had four companions in seven weeks More power to them said Montresor Meredith come here Shall we accept the pleas Meredith came slowly from the window his hands behind his back Lady Henry commands and we obey he said slowly But to day begins a new world founded in ruin like the rest of them He raised his fine eyes in which there was no laughter rather a dreamy intensity Lady Henry shrank If you re thinking of Chudleigh she said uncertainly be glad for him It was release As for Henry Warkworth Ah poor fellow said Montresor perfunctorily Poor fellow He had dropped Lady Henry s hand but he now recaptured it enclosing the thin jewelled fingers in his own Well well then it s peace with all my heart He stooped and lightly kissed the fingers And now when do you expect our friend At any moment said Lady Henry She seated herself and Montresor beside her I am told said Montresor that this horror will not only affect Delafield personally but that he will regard the dukedom as a calamity Hm and you believe it said Lady Henry I try to was the Minister s laughing reply Ah surely here they are Meredith turned from the window to which he had gone back The carriage has just arrived he announced and he stood fidgeting standing first on one foot then on the other and running his hand through his mane of gray hair His large features were pale and any close observer would have detected the quiver of emotion A sound of voices from the anteroom the Duchess s light tones floating to the top At the same time a door on the other side of the drawing room opened and the Duke of Crowborough appeared I think I hear my wife he said as he greeted Montresor and hurriedly crossed the room There was a rustle of quick steps and the little Duchess entered Freddie here is Julie Behind appeared a tall figure in black Everybody in the room advanced including Lady Henry who however after a few steps stood still behind the others leaning on her stick Julie looked round the little circle then at the Duke of Crowborough who had gravely given her his hand The suppressed excitement already in the room clearly communicated itself to her She did not lose her self command for an instant but her face pleaded Is it really true Perhaps there is some mistake I fear there can be none said the Duke sadly Poor Chudleigh had been long dead when they found him Freddie said the Duchess interrupting I have told Greswell we shall want the carriage at half past nine for Euston Will that do Perfectly Greswell the handsome groom of the chambers approached Julie Your grace s maid wishes to know whether it is your grace s wish that she should go round to Heribert Street before taking the luggage to Euston Julie looked at the man bewildered Then a stormy color rushed into her cheeks Does he mean my maid she said to the Duke piteously Certainly Will you give your orders She gave them and then turning again to the Duke she covered her eyes with her hands a moment What does it all mean she said faltering It seems as though we were all mad You understand of course that Jacob succeeds said the Duke not without coldness and he stood still an instant gazing at this woman who must now he supposed feel herself at the very summit of her ambitions Julie drew a long breath Then she perceived Lady Henry Instantly impetuously she crossed the room But as she reached that composed and formidable figure the old timidity the old fear seized her She paused abruptly but she held out her hand Lady Henry took it The two women stood regarding each other while the other persons in the room instinctively turned away from their meeting Lady Henry s first look was one of curiosity Then before the indefinable ennobling change in Julie s face now full of the pale agitation of memory the eyes of the older woman wavered and dropped But she soon recovered herself We meet again under very strange circumstances she said quietly though I have long foreseen them As for our former experience we were in a false relation and it made fools of us both You and Jacob are now the heads of the family And if you like to make friends with me on this new footing I am ready As to my behavior I think it was natural but if it rankles in your mind I apologize The personal pride of the owner curbed in its turn by the pride of tradition and family spoke strangely from these words Julie stood trembling her chest heaving I too regret and apologize she said in a low voice Then we begin again But now you must let Evelyn take you to rest for an hour or two I am sorry you have this hurried journey to night Julie pressed her hands to her breast with one of those dramatic movements that were natural to her Oh I must see Jacob she said under her breath I must see Jacob And she turned away looking vaguely round her Meredith approached Comfort yourself he said very gently pressing her hand in both of his It has been a great shock but when you get there he ll be all right Jacob Her expression the piteous note in her voice awoke in him an answering sense of pain He wondered how it might be between the husband and wife Yet it was borne in upon him as upon Lady Henry that her marriage however interpreted had brought with it profound and intimate transformation A different woman stood before him And when after a few more words the Duchess swept down upon them insisting that Julie must rest awhile Meredith stood looking after the retreating figures filled with the old bitter sense of human separateness and the fragmentariness of all human affections Then he made his farewells to the Duke and Lady Henry and slipped away He had turned a page in the book of life and as he walked through Grosvenor Square he applied his mind resolutely to one of the political causes with which as a powerful and fighting journalist he was at that moment occupied Lady Henry too watched Julie s exit from the room So now she supposes herself in love with Jacob she thought with amusement as she resumed her seat What if Delafield refuses to be made a duke said Sir Wilfrid in her ear It would be a situation new to the Constitution said Lady Henry composedly I advise you however to wait till it occurs The northern express rushed onward through the night Rugby Stafford Crewe had been left behind The Yorkshire valleys and moors began to show themselves in pale ridges and folds under the moon Julie wakeful in her corner opposite the little sleeping Duchess was conscious of an interminable rush of images through a brain that longed for a few unconscious and forgetful moments She thought of the deferential station master at Euston of the fuss attending their arrival on the platform of the arrangements made for stopping the express at the Yorkshire Station where they were to alight Faircourt Was it the great Early Georgian house of which she had heard Jacob speak the vast pile half barrack half palace in which according to him no human being could be either happy or at home And this was now his and hers Again the whirl of thoughts swept and danced round her A wild hill country In the valleys the blackness of thick trees the gleam of rivers the huge lifeless factories and beyond the high silver edges the sharp shadows of the moors The train slackened and the little Duchess woke at once Ten minutes to three Oh Julie here we are The dawn was just coldly showing as they alighted Carriages and servants were waiting and various persons whose identity and function it was not easy to grasp One of them however at once approached Julie with a privileged air and she perceived that he was a doctor I am very glad that your grace has come he said as he raised his hat The trouble with the Duke is shock and want of sleep Julie looked at him still bewildered How long has my husband been ill He walked on beside her describing in as few words as possible the harrowing days preceding the death of the boy Delafield s attempts to soothe and control the father the stratagem by which the poor Duke had outwitted them all and the weary hours of search through the night under a drizzling rain which had resulted about dawn in the discovery of the Duke s body in one of the deeper holes of the river When the procession returned to the house your husband the speaker framed the words uncertainly had a long fainting fit It was probably caused by the exhaustion of the search many hours without food and many sleepless nights We kept him in his room all day But towards evening he insisted on getting up The restlessness he shows is itself a sign of shock I trust now you are here you may be able to persuade him to spare himself Otherwise the consequences might be grave The drive to the house lay mainly through a vast park dotted with stiff and melancholy woods The morning was cloudy even the wild roses in the hedges and the daisies in the grass had neither gayety nor color Soon the house appeared an immense pile of stone with a pillared centre and wings to east and west built in a hollow gray and sunless The mournful blinds drawn closely down made of it rather a mausoleum for the dead than a home for the living At the approach of the carriage however doors were thrown open servants appeared and on the steps trembling and heavy eyed stood Susan Delafield She looked timidly at Julie and then as they passed into the great central hall the two kissed each other with tears He is in his room waiting for you The doctors persuaded him not to come down But he is dressed and reading and writing We don t believe he has slept at all for a week Through there said Susan Delafield stepping back That is the door Illustration SHE FOUND HERSELF KNEELING BESIDE HIM Julie softly opened it and closed it behind her Delafield had heard her approach and was standing by the table supporting himself upon it His aspect filled Julie with horror She ran to him and threw her arms round him He sank back into his chair and she found herself kneeling beside him murmuring to him while his head rested upon her shoulder Jacob I am here Oh I ought to have been here all through It s terrible terrible But Jacob you won t suffer so now I m here now we re together now I love you Jacob Her voice broke in tears She put back the hair from his brow kissing him with a tenderness in which there was a yearning and lovely humility Then she drew a little away waiting for him to speak in an agony But for a time he seemed unable to speak He feebly released himself as though he could not bear the emotion she offered him and his eyes closed Jacob come and lie down she said in terror Let me call the doctors He shook his head and a faint pressure from his hand bade her sit beside him I shall be better soon Give me time I ll tell you Then silence again She sat holding his hand her eyes fixed upon him Time passed she knew not how Susan came into the room a small sitting room in the east wing to tell her that the neighboring bedroom had been prepared for herself Julie only looked up for an instant with a dumb sign of refusal A doctor came in and Delafield made a painful effort to take the few spoonfuls of food and stimulant pressed upon him Then he buried his face in the side of the arm chair Please let us be alone he said with a touch of his old peremptoriness and both Susan and the doctor obeyed But it was long before he could collect energy enough to talk When he did he made an effort to tell her the story of the boy s death and the father s self destruction He told it leaning forward in his chair his eyes on the ground his hands loosely joined his voice broken and labored Julie listened gathering from his report an impression of horror tragic and irremediable similar to that which had shaken the balance of his own mind And when he suddenly looked up with the words And now I am expected to take their place to profit by their deaths What rightful law of God or man binds me to accept a life and a responsibility that I loathe Julie drew back as though he had struck her His face his tone were not his own there was a violence a threat in them addressed as it were specially to her If it were not for you his eyes seemed to say I could refuse this thing which will destroy me soul and body She was silent her pulses fluttering and he resumed speaking like one groping his way I could have done the work of course I have done it for five years I could have looked after the estate and the people But the money the paraphernalia the hordes of servants the mummery of the life Why Julie should we be forced into it What happiness I ask you what happiness can it bring to either of us And again he looked up and again it seemed to Julie that his expression was one of animated hostility and antagonism antagonism to her as embodying for the moment all the arguments of advantage custom law he was in his own mind fighting and denying With a failing heart she felt herself very far from him Was there not also something in his attitude unconsciously of that old primal antagonism of the man to the woman of the stronger to the weaker the more spiritual to the more earthy You think no doubt he said after a pause that it is my duty to take this thing even if I could lay it down I don t know what I think she said hurriedly It is very strange of course what you say We ought to discuss it thoroughly Let me have a little time He gave an impatient sigh then suddenly rose Will you come and look at them She too rose and put her hand in his Take me where you will It is not horrible he said shading his eyes a moment They are at peace With a feeble step leaning on her arm he guided her through the great darkened house Julie was dimly aware of wide staircases of galleries and high halls of the pictures of past Delafields looking down upon them The morning was now far advanced Many persons were at work in the house but Julie was conscious of them only as distant figures that vanished at their approach They walked alone guarded from all intrusion by the awe and sympathy of the unseen human beings around them Delafield opened the closed door The father and son lay together side by side the boy s face in a very winning repose which at first sight concealed the traces of his long suffering the father s also closed eyes and sternly shut mouth suggesting not the despair which had driven him to his death but rather as in sombre triumph the all forgetting all effacing sleep which he had won from death They stood a moment till Delafield fell on his knees Julie knelt beside him She prayed for a while then she wearied being indeed worn out with her journey But Delafield was motionless and it seemed to Julie that he hardly breathed She rose to her feet and found her eyes for the first time flooded with tears Never for many weeks had she felt so lonely or so utterly unhappy She would have given anything to forget herself in comforting Jacob But he seemed to have no need of her no thought of her As she vaguely looked round her she saw that beside the dead man was a table holding some violets the only flowers in the room some photographs and a few well worn books Softly she took up one It was a copy of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius much noted and underlined It would have seemed to her sacrilege to look too close but she presently perceived a letter between its pages and in the morning light which now came strongly into the room through a window looking on the garden she saw plainly that it was written on thin foreign paper that it was closed and addressed to her husband Jacob She touched him softly on the shoulder alarmed by his long immobility He looked up and it appeared to Julie as though he were shaking off with difficulty some abnormal and trancelike state But he rose looking at her strangely Jacob this is yours He took the book abruptly almost as if she had no right to be holding it Then as he saw the letter the color rushed into his face He took it and after a moment s hesitation walked to the window and opened it She saw him waver and ran to his support But he put out a hand which checked her It was the last thing he wrote he said and then uncertainly and without reading any but the first words of the letter he put it into his pocket Julie drew back humiliated His gesture said that to a secret so intimate and sacred he did not propose to admit his wife They went back silently to the room from which they had come Sentence after sentence came to Julie s lips but it seemed useless to say them and once more but in a totally new way she was afraid of the man beside her She left him shortly after by his own wish I will lie down and you must rest he said with decision So she bathed and dressed and presently she allowed the kind fair haired Susan to give her food and pour out her own history of the death week which she and Jacob had passed through But in all that was said Julie noticed that Susan spoke of her brother very little and of his inheritance and present position not at all And once or twice she noticed a wondering or meditative expression in the girl s charming eyes as they rested on herself and realized that the sense of mystery of hushed expectancy was not confined to her own mind When Susan left her at nine o clock it was to give a number of necessary orders in the house The inquest was to be held in the morning and the whole day would be filled with arrangements for the double funeral The house would be thronged with officials of all sorts Poor Jacob said the sister sighing as she went away But the tragic tumult had not yet begun The house was still quiet and Julie was for the first time alone She drew up the blinds and stood gazing out upon the park now flooded with light at the famous Italian garden beneath the windows with its fountains and statues at the wide lake which filled the middle distance and the hills beyond it with the plantations and avenues which showed the extension of the park as far as the eye could see Julie knew very well what it all implied Her years with Lady Henry in connection with her own hidden sense of birth and family had shown her with sufficient plainness the conditions under which the English noble lives She was actually at that moment Duchess of Chudleigh her strong intelligence faced and appreciated the fact the social scope and power implied in those three words were all the more vivid to her imagination because of her history and up bringing She had not grown to maturity inside like Delafield but as an exile from a life which was yet naturally hers an exile full sometimes of envy and the passions of envy It had no terrors for her quite the contrary this high social state Rather there were moments when her whole nature reached out to it in a proud and confident ambition Nor had she any mystical demurrer to make The originality which in some ways she richly possessed was not concerned in the least with the upsetting of class distinctions and as a Catholic she had been taught loyally to accept them The minutes passed away Julie sank deeper and deeper into reverie her head leaning against the side of the window her hands clasped before her on her black dress Once or twice she found the tears dropping from her eyes and once or twice she smiled She was not thinking of the tragic circumstances amid which she stood From that short trance of feeling even the piteous figures of the dead father and son faded away Warkworth entered into it but already invested with the passionless and sexless beauty of a world where whether it be to us poetry or reality they neither marry nor are given in marriage Her warm and living thoughts spent themselves on one theme only the redressing of a spiritual balance She was no longer a beggar to her husband she had the wherewithal to give She had been the mere recipient burdened with debts beyond her paying now And then it was that her smiles came tremluous fugitive exultant A bell rang in the long corridor and the slight sound recalled her to life and action She walked towards the door which separated her from the sitting room where she had left her husband and opened it without knocking Delafield was sitting at a writing table in the window He had apparently been writing but she found him in a moment of pause playing absently with the pen he still held As she entered he looked up and it seemed to her that his aspect and his mood had changed Her sudden and indefinable sense of this made it easier for her to hasten to him and to hold out her hands to him Jacob you asked me a question just now and I begged you to give me time But I am here to answer it If it would be to your happiness to refuse the dukedom refuse it I will not stand in your way and I will never reproach you I suppose she made herself smile upon him there are ways of doing such a strange thing You will be much criticised perhaps much blamed But if it seems to you right do it I ll just stand by you and help you Whatever makes you happy shall make me happy if only Delafield had risen impetuously and held her by both hands His breast heaved and the hurrying of her own breath would now hardly let her speak If only what he said hoarsely She raised her eyes If only mon ami she disengaged one hand and laid it gently on his shoulder you will give me your trust and her voice dropped your love They gazed at each other Between them around them hovered thoughts of the past of Warkworth of the gray Channel waves of the spiritual relation which had grown up between them in Switzerland mingled with the consciousness of this new incalculable present and of the growth and change in themselves You d give it all up said Delafield gently still holding her at arm s length Yes she nodded to him with a smile For me For my sake She smiled again He drew a long breath and turning to the table behind him took up a letter which was lying there I want you to read that he said holding it out to her She drew back with a little involuntary frown He understood Dearest he cried pressing her hand passionately I have been in the grip of all the powers of death Read it be good to me Standing beside him with his arm round her she read the melancholy Duke s last words My Dear Jacob I leave you a heavy task which I know well is in your eyes a mere burden But for my sake accept it The man who runs away has small right to counsel courage But you know what my struggle has been You ll judge me mercifully if no one else does There is in you too the little bitter drop that spoils us all but you won t be alone You have your wife and you love her Take my place here care for our people speak of us sometimes to your children and pray for us I bless you dear fellow The only moments of comfort I have ever known this last year have come from you I would live on if I could but I must must have sleep Julie dropped the paper She turned to look at her husband Since I read that he said in a low voice I have been sitting here alone or rather it is my belief that I have not been alone But he hesitated it is very difficult for me to speak of that even to you At any rate I have felt the touch of discipline of command My poor cousin deserted I it seems he drew a long and painful breath must keep to the ranks Let us discuss it said Julie and sitting down hand in hand they talked quietly and gravely Suddenly Delafield turned to her with renewed emotion I feel already the energy the honorable ambition you will bring to it But still you d have given it up Julie You d have given it up Julie chose her words Yes But now that we are to keep it will you hate me if some day when we are less sad I get pleasure from it I sha n t be able to help it When we were at La Verna I felt that you ought to have been born in the thirteenth century that you were really meant to wed poverty and follow saint Francis But now you have got to be horribly hopelessly rich And I all the time am a worldling and a modern What you ll suffer from I shall perhaps enjoy The word fell harshly on the darkened room Delafield shivered as though he felt the overshadowing dead Julie impetuously took his hand It will be my part to be a worldling for your sake she said her breath wavering Their eyes met From her face shone a revelation a beauty that
