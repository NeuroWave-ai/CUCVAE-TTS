THE PICTURES IN OUR HEADS CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND THE PICTURES IN OUR HEADS There is an island in the ocean where in nineteen fourteen a few Englishmen Frenchmen and Germans lived No cable reaches that island and the British mail steamer comes but once in sixty days In September it had not yet come and the islanders were still talking about the latest newspaper which told about the approaching trial of Madame Caillaux for the shooting of Gaston Calmette It was therefore with more than usual eagerness that the whole colony assembled at the quay on a day in mid September to hear from the captain what the verdict had been They learned that for over six weeks now those of them who were English and those of them who were French had been fighting in behalf of the sanctity of treaties against those of them who were Germans For six strange weeks they had acted as if they were friends when in fact they were enemies But their plight was not so different from that of most of the population of Europe They had been mistaken for six weeks on the continent the interval may have been only six days or six hours There was an interval There was a moment when the picture of Europe on which men were conducting their business as usual did not in any way correspond to the Europe which was about to make a jumble of their lives There was a time for each man when he was still adjusted to an environment that no longer existed All over the world as late as July twenty fifth men were making goods that they would not be able to ship buying goods they would not be able to import careers were being planned enterprises contemplated hopes and expectations entertained all in the belief that the world as known was the world as it was Men were writing books describing that world They trusted the picture in their heads And then over four years later on a Thursday morning came the news of an armistice and people gave vent to their unutterable relief that the slaughter was over Yet in the five days before the real armistice came though the end of the war had been celebrated several thousand young men died on the battlefields Looking back we can see how indirectly we know the environment in which nevertheless we live We can see that the news of it comes to us now fast now slowly but that whatever we believe to be a true picture we treat as if it were the environment itself It is harder to remember that about the beliefs upon which we are now acting but in respect to other peoples and other ages we flatter ourselves that it is easy to see when they were in deadly earnest about ludicrous pictures of the world We insist because of our superior hindsight that the world as they needed to know it and the world as they did know it were often two quite contradictory things We can see too that while they governed and fought traded and reformed in the world as they imagined it to be they produced results or failed to produce any in the world as it was They started for the Indies and found America They diagnosed evil and hanged old women They thought they could grow rich by always selling and never buying A caliph obeying what he conceived to be the Will of Allah burned the library at Alexandria Writing about the year three hundred eighty nine saint Ambrose stated the case for the prisoner in Plato s cave who resolutely declines to turn his head To discuss the nature and position of the earth does not help us in our hope of the life to come It is enough to know what Scripture states That He hung up the earth upon nothing Job xxvi seven Why then argue whether He hung it up in air or upon the water and raise a controversy as to how the thin air could sustain the earth or why if upon the waters the earth does not go crashing down to the bottom Not because the earth is in the middle as if suspended on even balance but because the majesty of God constrains it by the law of His will does it endure stable upon the unstable and the void Footnote Hexaemeron i cap six quoted in The Mediaeval Mind by Henry Osborn Taylor Vol i p seventy three It does not help us in our hope of the life to come It is enough to know what Scripture states Why then argue But a century and a half after saint Ambrose opinion was still troubled on this occasion by the problem of the antipodes A monk named Cosmas famous for his scientific attainments was therefore deputed to write a Christian Topography or Christian Opinion concerning the World Footnote Lecky Rationalism in Europe Vol I pp two hundred seventy six eight It is clear that he knew exactly what was expected of him for he based all his conclusions on the Scriptures as he read them It appears then that the world is a flat parallelogram twice as broad from east to west as it is long from north to south In the center is the earth surrounded by ocean which is in turn surrounded by another earth where men lived before the deluge This other earth was Noah s port of embarkation In the north is a high conical mountain around which revolve the sun and moon When the sun is behind the mountain it is night The sky is glued to the edges of the outer earth It consists of four high walls which meet in a concave roof so that the earth is the floor of the universe There is an ocean on the other side of the sky constituting the waters that are above the firmament The space between the celestial ocean and the ultimate roof of the universe belongs to the blest The space between the earth and sky is inhabited by the angels Finally since saint Paul said that all men are made to live upon the face of the earth how could they live on the back where the Antipodes are supposed to be With such a passage before his eyes a Christian we are told should not even speak of the Antipodes Footnote Id Far less should he go to the Antipodes nor should any Christian prince give him a ship to try nor would any pious mariner wish to try For Cosmas there was nothing in the least absurd about his map Only by remembering his absolute conviction that this was the map of the universe can we begin to understand how he would have dreaded Magellan or Peary or the aviator who risked a collision with the angels and the vault of heaven by flying seven miles up in the air In the same way we can best understand the furies of war and politics by remembering that almost the whole of each party believes absolutely in its picture of the opposition that it takes as fact not what is but what it supposes to be the fact And that therefore like Hamlet it will stab Polonius behind the rustling curtain thinking him the king and perhaps like Hamlet add Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell I took thee for thy better take thy fortune two Great men even during their lifetime are usually known to the public only through a fictitious personality Hence the modicum of truth in the old saying that no man is a hero to his valet There is only a modicum of truth for the valet and the private secretary are often immersed in the fiction themselves Royal personages are of course constructed personalities Whether they themselves believe in their public character or whether they merely permit the chamberlain to stage manage it there are at least two distinct selves the public and regal self the private and human The biographies of great people fall more or less readily into the histories of these two selves The official biographer reproduces the public life the revealing memoir the other The Charnwood Lincoln for example is a noble portrait not of an actual human being but of an epic figure replete with significance who moves on much the same level of reality as Aeneas or saint George Oliver s Hamilton is a majestic abstraction the sculpture of an idea an essay as mister Oliver himself calls it on American union It is a formal monument to the state craft of federalism hardly the biography of a person Sometimes people create their own facade when they think they are revealing the interior scene The Repington diaries and Margot Asquith s are a species of self portraiture in which the intimate detail is most revealing as an index of how the authors like to think about themselves But the most interesting kind of portraiture is that which arises spontaneously in people s minds When Victoria came to the throne says mister Strachey Footnote Lytton Strachey Queen Victoria p seventy two among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm Sentiment and romance were coming into fashion and the spectacle of the little girl queen innocent modest with fair hair and pink cheeks driving through her capital filled the hearts of the beholders with raptures of affectionate loyalty What above all struck everybody with overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and her uncles The nasty old men debauched and selfish pigheaded and ridiculous with their perpetual burden of debts confusions and disreputabilities they had vanished like the snows of winter and here at last crowned and radiant was the spring M Jean de Pierrefeu Footnote Jean de Pierrefeu G Q G Trois ans au Grand Quartier General pp ninety four ninety five saw hero worship at first hand for he was an officer on Joffre s staff at the moment of that soldier s greatest fame For two years the entire world paid an almost divine homage to the victor of the Maine The baggage master literally bent under the weight of the boxes of the packages and letters which unknown people sent him with a frantic testimonial of their admiration I think that outside of General Joffre no commander in the war has been able to realize a comparable idea of what glory is They sent him boxes of candy from all the great confectioners of the world boxes of champagne fine wines of every vintage fruits game ornaments and utensils clothes smoking materials inkstands paperweights Every territory sent its specialty The painter sent his picture the sculptor his statuette the dear old lady a comforter or socks the shepherd in his hut carved a pipe for his sake All the manufacturers of the world who were hostile to Germany shipped their products Havana its cigars Portugal its port wine I have known a hairdresser who had nothing better to do than to make a portrait of the General out of hair belonging to persons who were dear to him a professional penman had the same idea but the features were composed of thousands of little phrases in tiny characters which sang the praise of the General As to letters he had them in all scripts from all countries written in every dialect affectionate letters grateful overflowing with love filled with adoration They called him Savior of the World Father of his Country Agent of God Benefactor of Humanity et cetera And not only Frenchmen but Americans Argentinians Australians et cetera et cetera Thousands of little children without their parents knowledge took pen in hand and wrote to tell him their love most of them called him Our Father And there was poignancy about their effusions their adoration these sighs of deliverance that escaped from thousands of hearts at the defeat of barbarism To all these naif little souls Joffre seemed like saint George crushing the dragon Certainly he incarnated for the conscience of mankind the victory of good over evil of light over darkness Lunatics simpletons the half crazy and the crazy turned their darkened brains toward him as toward reason itself I have read the letter of a person living in Sydney who begged the General to save him from his enemies another a New Zealander requested him to send some soldiers to the house of a gentleman who owed him ten pounds and would not pay Finally some hundreds of young girls overcoming the timidity of their sex asked for engagements their families not to know about it others wished only to serve him This ideal Joffre was compounded out of the victory won by him his staff and his troops the despair of the war the personal sorrows and the hope of future victory But beside hero worship there is the exorcism of devils By the same mechanism through which heroes are incarnated devils are made If everything good was to come from Joffre Foch Wilson or Roosevelt everything evil originated in the Kaiser Wilhelm Lenin and Trotsky They were as omnipotent for evil as the heroes were omnipotent for good To many simple and frightened minds there was no political reverse no strike no obstruction no mysterious death or mysterious conflagration anywhere in the world of which the causes did not wind back to these personal sources of evil three Worldwide concentration of this kind on a symbolic personality is rare enough to be clearly remarkable and every author has a weakness for the striking and irrefutable example The vivisection of war reveals such examples but it does not make them out of nothing In a more normal public life symbolic pictures are no less governant of behavior but each symbol is far less inclusive because there are so many competing ones Not only is each symbol charged with less feeling because at most it represents only a part of the population but even within that part there is infinitely less suppression of individual difference The symbols of public opinion in times of moderate security are subject to check and comparison and argument They come and go coalesce and are forgotten never organizing perfectly the emotion of the whole group There is after all just one human activity left in which whole populations accomplish the union sacree It occurs in those middle phases of a war when fear pugnacity and hatred have secured complete dominion of the spirit either to crush every other instinct or to enlist it and before weariness is felt At almost all other times and even in war when it is deadlocked a sufficiently greater range of feelings is aroused to establish conflict choice hesitation and compromise The symbolism of public opinion usually bears as we shall see Footnote Part V the marks of this balancing of interest Think for example of how rapidly after the armistice the precarious and by no means successfully established symbol of Allied Unity disappeared how it was followed almost immediately by the breakdown of each nation s symbolic picture of the other Britain the Defender of Public Law France watching at the Frontier of Freedom America the Crusader And think then of how within each nation the symbolic picture of itself frayed out as party and class conflict and personal ambition began to stir postponed issues And then of how the symbolic pictures of the leaders gave way as one by one Wilson Clemenceau Lloyd George ceased to be the incarnation of human hope and became merely the negotiators and administrators for a disillusioned world Whether we regret this as one of the soft evils of peace or applaud it as a return to sanity is obviously no matter here Our first concern with fictions and symbols is to forget their value to the existing social order and to think of them simply as an important part of the machinery of human communication Now in any society that is not completely self contained in its interests and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp Miss Sherwin of Gopher Prairie Footnote See Sinclair Lewis Main Street is aware that a war is raging in France and tries to conceive it She has never been to France and certainly she has never been along what is now the battlefront Pictures of French and German soldiers she has seen but it is impossible for her to imagine three million men No one in fact can imagine them and the professionals do not try They think of them as say two hundred divisions But Miss Sherwin has no access to the order of battle maps and so if she is to think about the war she fastens upon Joffre and the Kaiser as if they were engaged in a personal duel Perhaps if you could see what she sees with her mind s eye the image in its composition might be not unlike an Eighteenth Century engraving of a great soldier He stands there boldly unruffled and more than life size with a shadowy army of tiny little figures winding off into the landscape behind Nor it seems are great men oblivious to these expectations M de Pierrefeu tells of a photographer s visit to Joffre The General was in his middle class office before the worktable without papers where he sat down to write his signature Suddenly it was noticed that there were no maps on the walls But since according to popular ideas it is not possible to think of a general without maps a few were placed in position for the picture and removed soon afterwards Footnote Op cit p ninety nine The only feeling that anyone can have about an event he does not experience is the feeling aroused by his mental image of that event That is why until we know what others think they know we cannot truly understand their acts I have seen a young girl brought up in a Pennsylvania mining town plunged suddenly from entire cheerfulness into a paroxysm of grief when a gust of wind cracked the kitchen window pane For hours she was inconsolable and to me incomprehensible But when she was able to talk it transpired that if a window pane broke it meant that a close relative had died She was therefore mourning for her father who had frightened her into running away from home The father was of course quite thoroughly alive as a telegraphic inquiry soon proved But until the telegram came the cracked glass was an authentic message to that girl Why it was authentic only a prolonged investigation by a skilled psychiatrist could show But even the most casual observer could see that the girl enormously upset by her family troubles had hallucinated a complete fiction out of one external fact a remembered superstition and a turmoil of remorse and fear and love for her father Abnormality in these instances is only a matter of degree When an Attorney General who has been frightened by a bomb exploded on his doorstep convinces himself by the reading of revolutionary literature that a revolution is to happen on the first of May nineteen twenty we recognize that much the same mechanism is at work The war of course furnished many examples of this pattern the casual fact the creative imagination the will to believe and out of these three elements a counterfeit of reality to which there was a violent instinctive response For it is clear enough that under certain conditions men respond as powerfully to fictions as they do to realities and that in many cases they help to create the very fictions to which they respond Let him cast the first stone who did not believe in the Russian army that passed through England in August nineteen fourteen did not accept any tale of atrocities without direct proof and never saw a plot a traitor or a spy where there was none Let him cast a stone who never passed on as the real inside truth what he had heard someone say who knew no more than he did In all these instances we must note particularly one common factor It is the insertion between man and his environment of a pseudo environment To that pseudo environment his behavior is a response But because it is behavior the consequences if they are acts operate not in the pseudo environment where the behavior is stimulated but in the real environment where action eventuates If the behavior is not a practical act but what we call roughly thought and emotion it may be a long time before there is any noticeable break in the texture of the fictitious world But when the stimulus of the pseudo fact results in action on things or other people contradiction soon develops Then comes the sensation of butting one s head against a stone wall of learning by experience and witnessing Herbert Spencer s tragedy of the murder of a Beautiful Theory by a Gang of Brutal Facts the discomfort in short of a maladjustment For certainly at the level of social life what is called the adjustment of man to his environment takes place through the medium of fictions By fictions I do not mean lies I mean a representation of the environment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man himself The range of fiction extends all the way from complete hallucination to the scientists perfectly self conscious use of a schematic model or his decision that for his particular problem accuracy beyond a certain number of decimal places is not important A work of fiction may have almost any degree of fidelity and so long as the degree of fidelity can be taken into account fiction is not misleading In fact human culture is very largely the selection the rearrangement the tracing of patterns upon and the stylizing of what William James called the random irradiations and resettlements of our ideas Footnote James Principles of Psychology Vol II p six hundred thirty eight The alternative to the use of fictions is direct exposure to the ebb and flow of sensation That is not a real alternative for however refreshing it is to see at times with a perfectly innocent eye innocence itself is not wisdom though a source and corrective of wisdom For the real environment is altogether too big too complex and too fleeting for direct acquaintance We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety so much variety so many permutations and combinations And although we have to act in that environment we have to reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage with it To traverse the world men must have maps of the world Their persistent difficulty is to secure maps on which their own need or someone else s need has not sketched in the coast of Bohemia four The analyst of public opinion must begin then by recognizing the triangular relationship between the scene of action the human picture of that scene and the human response to that picture working itself out upon the scene of action It is like a play suggested to the actors by their own experience in which the plot is transacted in the real lives of the actors and not merely in their stage parts The moving picture often emphasizes with great skill this double drama of interior motive and external behavior Two men are quarreling ostensibly about some money but their passion is inexplicable Then the picture fades out and what one or the other of the two men sees with his mind s eye is reenacted Across the table they were quarreling about money In memory they are back in their youth when the girl jilted him for the other man The exterior drama is explained the hero is not greedy the hero is in love A scene not so different was played in the United States Senate At breakfast on the morning of September twenty nine nineteen nineteen some of the Senators read a news dispatch in the Washington Post about the landing of American marines on the Dalmatian coast The newspaper said FACTS NOW ESTABLISHED The following important facts appear already established The orders to Rear Admiral Andrews commanding the American naval forces in the Adriatic came from the British Admiralty via the War Council and Rear Admiral Knapps in London The approval or disapproval of the American Navy Department was not asked WITHOUT DANIELS KNOWLEDGE mister Daniels was admittedly placed in a peculiar position when cables reached here stating that the forces over which he is presumed to have exclusive control were carrying on what amounted to naval warfare without his knowledge It was fully realized that the British Admiralty might desire to issue orders to Rear Admiral Andrews to act on behalf of Great Britain and her Allies because the situation required sacrifice on the part of some nation if D Annunzio s followers were to be held in check It was further realized that under the new league of nations plan foreigners would be in a position to direct American Naval forces in emergencies with or without the consent of the American Navy Department et cetera Italics mine The first Senator to comment is mister Knox of Pennsylvania Indignantly he demands investigation In mister Brandegee of Connecticut who spoke next indignation has already stimulated credulity Where mister Knox indignantly wishes to know if the report is true mister Brandegee a half a minute later would like to know what would have happened if marines had been killed mister Knox interested in the question forgets that he asked for an inquiry and replies If American marines had been killed it would be war The mood of the debate is still conditional Debate proceeds mister McCormick of Illinois reminds the Senate that the Wilson administration is prone to the waging of small unauthorized wars He repeats Theodore Roosevelt s quip about waging peace More debate mister Brandegee notes that the marines acted under orders of a Supreme Council sitting somewhere but he cannot recall who represents the United States on that body The Supreme Council is unknown to the Constitution of the United States Therefore mister New of Indiana submits a resolution calling for the facts So far the Senators still recognize vaguely that they are discussing a rumor Being lawyers they still remember some of the forms of evidence But as red blooded men they already experience all the indignation which is appropriate to the fact that American marines have been ordered into war by a foreign government and without the consent of Congress Emotionally they want to believe it because they are Republicans fighting the League of Nations This arouses the Democratic leader mister Hitchcock of Nebraska He defends the Supreme Council it was acting under the war powers Peace has not yet been concluded because the Republicans are delaying it Therefore the action was necessary and legal Both sides now assume that the report is true and the conclusions they draw are the conclusions of their partisanship Yet this extraordinary assumption is in a debate over a resolution to investigate the truth of the assumption It reveals how difficult it is even for trained lawyers to suspend response until the returns are in The response is instantaneous The fiction is taken for truth because the fiction is badly needed A few days later an official report showed that the marines were not landed by order of the British Government or of the Supreme Council They had not been fighting the Italians They had been landed at the request of the Italian Government to protect Italians and the American commander had been officially thanked by the Italian authorities The marines were not at war with Italy They had acted according to an established international practice which had nothing to do with the League of Nations The scene of action was the Adriatic The picture of that scene in the Senators heads at Washington was furnished in this case probably with intent to deceive by a man who cared nothing about the Adriatic but much about defeating the League To this picture the Senate responded by a strengthening of its partisan differences over the League five Whether in this particular case the Senate was above or below its normal standard it is not necessary to decide Nor whether the Senate compares favorably with the House or with other parliaments At the moment I should like to think only about the world wide spectacle of men acting upon their environment moved by stimuli from their pseudo environments For when full allowance has been made for deliberate fraud political science has still to account for such facts as two nations attacking one another each convinced that it is acting in self defense or two classes at war each certain that it speaks for the common interest They live we are likely to say in different worlds More accurately they live in the same world but they think and feel in different ones It is to these special worlds it is to these private or group or class or provincial or occupational or national or sectarian artifacts that the political adjustment of mankind in the Great Society takes place Their variety and complication are impossible to describe Yet these fictions determine a very great part of men s political behavior We must think of perhaps fifty sovereign parliaments consisting of at least a hundred legislative bodies With them belong at least fifty hierarchies of provincial and municipal assemblies which with their executive administrative and legislative organs constitute formal authority on earth But that does not begin to reveal the complexity of political life For in each of these innumerable centers of authority there are parties and these parties are themselves hierarchies with their roots in classes sections cliques and clans and within these are the individual politicians each the personal center of a web of connection and memory and fear and hope Somehow or other for reasons often necessarily obscure as the result of domination or compromise or a logroll there emerge from these political bodies commands which set armies in motion or make peace conscript life tax exile imprison protect property or confiscate it encourage one kind of enterprise and discourage another facilitate immigration or obstruct it improve communication or censor it establish schools build navies proclaim policies and destiny raise economic barriers make property or unmake it bring one people under the rule of another or favor one class as against another For each of these decisions some view of the facts is taken to be conclusive some view of the circumstances is accepted as the basis of inference and as the stimulus of feeling What view of the facts and why that one And yet even this does not begin to exhaust the real complexity The formal political structure exists in a social environment where there are innumerable large and small corporations and institutions voluntary and semi voluntary associations national provincial urban and neighborhood groupings which often as not make the decision that the political body registers On what are these decisions based Modern society says mister Chesterton is intrinsically insecure because it is based on the notion that all men will do the same thing for different reasons And as within the head of any convict may be the hell of a quite solitary crime so in the house or under the hat of any suburban clerk may be the limbo of a quite separate philosophy The first man may be a complete Materialist and feel his own body as a horrible machine manufacturing his own mind He may listen to his thoughts as to the dull ticking of a clock The man next door may be a Christian Scientist and regard his own body as somehow rather less substantial than his own shadow He may come almost to regard his own arms and legs as delusions like moving serpents in the dream of delirium tremens The third man in the street may not be a Christian Scientist but on the contrary a Christian He may live in a fairy tale as his neighbors would say a secret but solid fairy tale full of the faces and presences of unearthly friends The fourth man may be a theosophist and only too probably a vegetarian and I do not see why I should not gratify myself with the fancy that the fifth man is a devil worshiper Now whether or not this sort of variety is valuable this sort of unity is shaky To expect that all men for all time will go on thinking different things and yet doing the same things is a doubtful speculation It is not founding society on a communion or even on a convention but rather on a coincidence Four men may meet under the same lamp post one to paint it pea green as part of a great municipal reform one to read his breviary in the light of it one to embrace it with accidental ardour in a fit of alcoholic enthusiasm and the last merely because the pea green post is a conspicuous point of rendezvous with his young lady But to expect this to happen night after night is unwise Footnote G K Chesterton The Mad Hatter and the Sane Householder Vanity Fair January nineteen twenty one p fifty four For the four men at the lamp post substitute the governments the parties the corporations the societies the social sets the trades and professions universities sects and nationalities of the world Think of the legislator voting a statute that will affect distant peoples a statesman coming to a decision Think of the Peace Conference reconstituting the frontiers of Europe an ambassador in a foreign country trying to discern the intentions of his own government and of the foreign government a promoter working a concession in a backward country an editor demanding a war a clergyman calling on the police to regulate amusement a club lounging room making up its mind about a strike a sewing circle preparing to regulate the schools nine judges deciding whether a legislature in Oregon may fix the working hours of women a cabinet meeting to decide on the recognition of a government a party convention choosing a candidate and writing a platform twenty seven million voters casting their ballots an Irishman in Cork thinking about an Irishman in Belfast a Third International planning to reconstruct the whole of human society a board of directors confronted with a set of their employees demands a boy choosing a career a merchant estimating supply and demand for the coming season a speculator predicting the course of the market a banker deciding whether to put credit behind a new enterprise the advertiser the reader of advertisments Think of the different sorts of Americans thinking about their notions of The British Empire or France or Russia or Mexico It is not so different from mister Chesterton s four men at the pea green lamp post six And so before we involve ourselves in the jungle of obscurities about the innate differences of men we shall do well to fix our attention upon the extraordinary differences in what men know of the world Footnote Cf Wallas Our Social Heritage pp seventy seven et seq I do not doubt that there are important biological differences Since man is an animal it would be strange if there were not But as rational beings it is worse than shallow to generalize at all about comparative behavior until there is a measurable similarity between the environments to which behavior is a response The pragmatic value of this idea is that it introduces a much needed refinement into the ancient controversy about nature and nurture innate quality and environment For the pseudo environment is a hybrid compounded of human nature and conditions To my mind it shows the uselessness of pontificating about what man is and always will be from what we observe man to be doing or about what are the necessary conditions of society For we do not know how men would behave in response to the facts of the Great Society All that we really know is how they behave in response to what can fairly be called a most inadequate picture of the Great Society No conclusion about man or the Great Society can honestly be made on evidence like that This then will be the clue to our inquiry We shall assume that what each man does is based not on direct and certain knowledge but on pictures made by himself or given to him If his atlas tells him that the world is flat he will not sail near what he believes to be the edge of our planet for fear of falling off If his maps include a fountain of eternal youth a Ponce de Leon will go in quest of it If someone digs up yellow dirt that looks like gold he will for a time act exactly as if he had found gold The way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do It does not determine what they will achieve It determines their effort their feelings their hopes not their accomplishments and results The very men who most loudly proclaim their materialism and their contempt for ideologues the Marxian communists place their entire hope on what On the formation by propaganda of a class conscious group But what is propaganda if not the effort to alter the picture to which men respond to substitute one social pattern for another What is class consciousness but a way of realizing the world National consciousness but another way And Professor Giddings consciousness of kind but a process of believing that we recognize among the multitude certain ones marked as our kind Try to explain social life as the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain You will soon be saying that the hedonist begs the question for even supposing that man does pursue these ends the crucial problem of why he thinks one course rather than another likely to produce pleasure is untouched Does the guidance of man s conscience explain How then does he happen to have the particular conscience which he has The theory of economic self interest But how do men come to conceive their interest in one way rather than another The desire for security or prestige or domination or what is vaguely called self realization How do men conceive their security what do they consider prestige how do they figure out the means of domination or what is the notion of self which they wish to realize Pleasure pain conscience acquisition protection enhancement mastery are undoubtedly names for some of the ways people act There may be instinctive dispositions which work toward such ends But no statement of the end or any description of the tendencies to seek it can explain the behavior which results The very fact that men theorize at all is proof that their pseudo environments their interior representations of the world are a determining element in thought feeling and action For if the connection between reality and human response were direct and immediate rather than indirect and inferred indecision and failure would be unknown and if each of us fitted as snugly into the world as the child in the womb mister Bernard Shaw would not have been able to say that except for the first nine months of its existence no human being manages its affairs as well as a plant The chief difficulty in adapting the psychoanalytic scheme to political thought arises in this connection The Freudians are concerned with the maladjustment of distinct individuals to other individuals and to concrete circumstances They have assumed that if internal derangements could be straightened out there would be little or no confusion about what is the obviously normal relationship But public opinion deals with indirect unseen and puzzling facts and there is nothing obvious about them The situations to which public opinions refer are known only as opinions The psychoanalyst on the other hand almost always assumes that the environment is knowable and if not knowable then at least bearable to any unclouded intelligence This assumption of his is the problem of public opinion Instead of taking for granted an environment that is readily known the social analyst is most concerned in studying how the larger political environment is conceived and how it can be conceived more successfully The psychoanalyst examines the adjustment to an X called by him the environment the social analyst examines the X called by him the pseudo environment He is of course permanently and constantly in debt to the new psychology not only because when rightly applied it so greatly helps people to stand on their own feet come what may but because the study of dreams fantasy and rationalization has thrown light on how the pseudo environment is put together But he cannot assume as his criterion either what is called a normal biological career Footnote Edward J Kempf Psychopathology p one hundred sixteen within the existing social order or a career freed from religious suppression and dogmatic conventions outside Footnote Id p one hundred fifty one What for a sociologist is a normal social career Or one freed from suppressions and conventions Conservative critics do to be sure assume the first and romantic ones the second But in assuming them they are taking the whole world for granted They are saying in effect either that society is the sort of thing which corresponds to their idea of what is normal or the sort of thing which corresponds to their idea of what is free Both ideas are merely public opinions and while the psychoanalyst as physician may perhaps assume them the sociologist may not take the products of existing public opinion as criteria by which to study public opinion seven The world that we have to deal with politically is out of reach out of sight out of mind It has to be explored reported and imagined Man is no Aristotelian god contemplating all existence at one glance He is the creature of an evolution who can just about span a sufficient portion of reality to manage his survival and snatch what on the scale of time are but a few moments of insight and happiness Yet this same creature has invented ways of seeing what no naked eye could see of hearing what no ear could hear of weighing immense masses and infinitesimal ones of counting and separating more items than he can individually remember He is learning to see with his mind vast portions of the world that he could never see touch smell hear or remember Gradually he makes for himself a trustworthy picture inside his head of the world beyond his reach Those features of the world outside which have to do with the behavior of other human beings in so far as that behavior crosses ours is dependent upon us or is interesting to us we call roughly public affairs The pictures inside the heads of these human beings the pictures of themselves of others of their needs purposes and relationship are their public opinions Those pictures which are acted upon by groups of people or by individuals acting in the name of groups are Public Opinion with capital letters And so in the chapters which follow we shall inquire first into some of the reasons why the picture inside so often misleads men in their dealings with the world outside Under this heading we shall consider first the chief factors which limit their access to the facts They are the artificial censorships the limitations of social contact the comparatively meager time available in each day for paying attention to public affairs the distortion arising because events have to be compressed into very short messages the difficulty of making a small vocabulary express a complicated world and finally the fear of facing those facts which would seem to threaten the established routine of men s lives The analysis then turns from these more or less external limitations to the question of how this trickle of messages from the outside is affected by the stored up images the preconceptions and prejudices which interpret fill them out and in their turn powerfully direct the play of our attention and our vision itself From this it proceeds to examine how in the individual person the limited messages from outside formed into a pattern of stereotypes are identified with his own interests as he feels and conceives them In the succeeding sections it examines how opinions are crystallized into what is called Public Opinion how a National Will a Group Mind a Social Purpose or whatever you choose to call it is formed The first five parts constitute the descriptive section of the book There follows an analysis of the traditional democratic theory of public opinion The substance of the argument is that democracy in its original form never seriously faced the problem which arises because the pictures inside people s heads do not automatically correspond with the world outside And then because the democratic theory is under criticism by socialist thinkers there follows an examination of the most advanced and coherent of these criticisms as made by the English Guild Socialists My purpose here is to find out whether these reformers take into account the main difficulties of public opinion My conclusion is that they ignore the difficulties as completely as did the original democrats because they too assume and in a much more complicated civilization that somehow mysteriously there exists in the hearts of men a knowledge of the world beyond their reach I argue that representative government either in what is ordinarily called politics or in industry cannot be worked successfully no matter what the basis of election unless there is an independent expert organization for making the unseen facts intelligible to those who have to make the decisions I attempt therefore to argue that the serious acceptance of the principle that personal representation must be supplemented by representation of the unseen facts would alone permit a satisfactory decentralization and allow us to escape from the intolerable and unworkable fiction that each of us must acquire a competent opinion about all public affairs It is argued that the problem of the press is confused because the critics and the apologists expect the press to realize this fiction expect it to make up for all that was not foreseen in the theory of democracy and that the readers expect this miracle to be performed at no cost or trouble to themselves The newspapers are regarded by democrats as a panacea for their own defects whereas analysis of the nature of news and of the economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers necessarily and inevitably reflect and therefore in greater or lesser measure intensify the defective organization of public opinion My conclusion is that public opinions must be organized for the press if they are to be sound not by the press as is the case today This organization I conceive to be in the first instance the task of a political science that has won its proper place as formulator in advance of real decision instead of apologist critic or reporter after the decision has been made I try to indicate that the perplexities of government and industry are conspiring to give political science this enormous opportunity to enrich itself and to serve the public And of course I hope that these pages will help a few people to realize that opportunity more vividly and therefore to pursue it more consciously PART II APPROACHES TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE CHAPTER two CENSORSHIP AND PRIVACY three CONTACT AND OPPORTUNITY four TIME AND ATTENTION five SPEED WORDS AND CLEARNESS CHAPTER II CENSORSHIP AND PRIVACY one The picture of a general presiding over an editorial conference at the most terrible hour of one of the great battles of history seems more like a scene from The Chocolate Soldier than a page from life Yet we know at first hand from the officer who edited the French communiques that these conferences were a regular part of the business of war that in the worst moment of Verdun General Joffre and his cabinet met and argued over the nouns adjectives and verbs that were to be printed in the newspapers the next morning The evening communique of the twenty third February nineteen sixteen says M de Pierrefeu Footnote G Q G pp one hundred twenty six one hundred twenty nine was edited in a dramatic atmosphere M Berthelot of the Prime Minister s office had just telephoned by order of the minister asking General Pelle to strengthen the report and to emphasize the proportions of the enemy s attack It was necessary to prepare the public for the worst outcome in case the affair turned into a catastrophe This anxiety showed clearly that neither at G H Q nor at the Ministry of War had the Government found reason for confidence As M Berthelot spoke General Pelle made notes He handed me the paper on which he had written the Government s wishes together with the order of the day issued by General von Deimling and found on some prisoners in which it was stated that this attack was the supreme offensive to secure peace Skilfully used all this was to demonstrate that Germany was letting loose a gigantic effort an effort without precedent and that from its success she hoped for the end of the war The logic of this was that nobody need be surprised at our withdrawal When a half hour later I went down with my manuscript I found gathered together in Colonel Claudel s office he being away the major general General Janin Colonel Dupont and Lieutenant Colonel Renouard Fearing that I would not succeed in giving the desired impression General Pelle had himself prepared a proposed communique I read what I had just done It was found to be too moderate General Pelle s on the other hand seemed too alarming I had purposely omitted von Deimling s order of the day To put it into the communique would be to break with the formula to which the public was accustomed would be to transform it into a kind of pleading It would seem to say How do you suppose we can resist There was reason to fear that the public would be distracted by this change of tone and would believe that everything was lost I explained my reasons and suggested giving Deimling s text to the newspapers in the form of a separate note Opinion being divided General Pelle went to ask General de Castelnau to come and decide finally The General arrived smiling quiet and good humored said a few pleasant words about this new kind of literary council of war and looked at the texts He chose the simpler one gave more weight to the first phrase inserted the words as had been anticipated which supply a reassuring quality and was flatly against inserting von Deimling s order but was for transmitting it to the press in a special note General Joffre that evening read the communique carefully and approved it Within a few hours those two or three hundred words would be read all over the world They would paint a picture in men s minds of what was happening on the slopes of Verdun and in front of that picture people would take heart or despair The shopkeeper in Brest the peasant in Lorraine the deputy in the Palais Bourbon the editor in Amsterdam or Minneapolis had to be kept in hope and yet prepared to accept possible defeat without yielding to panic They are told therefore that the loss of ground is no surprise to the French Command They are taught to regard the affair as serious but not strange Now as a matter of fact the French General Staff was not fully prepared for the German offensive Supporting trenches had not been dug alternative roads had not been built barbed wire was lacking But to confess that would have aroused images in the heads of civilians that might well have turned a reverse into a disaster The High Command could be disappointed and yet pull itself together the people at home and abroad full of uncertainties and with none of the professional man s singleness of purpose might on the basis of a complete story have lost sight of the war in a melee of faction and counter faction about the competence of the officers Instead therefore of letting the public act on all the facts which the generals knew the authorities presented only certain facts and these only in such a way as would be most likely to steady the people In this case the men who arranged the pseudo environment knew what the real one was But a few days later an incident occurred about which the French Staff did not know the truth The Germans announced Footnote On February twenty six nineteen sixteen Pierrefeu G Q G pp one hundred thirty three et seq that on the previous afternoon they had taken Fort Douaumont by assault At French headquarters in Chantilly no one could understand this news For on the morning of the twenty fifth after the engagement of the XXth corps the battle had taken a turn for the better Reports from the front said nothing about Douaumont But inquiry showed that the German report was true though no one as yet knew how the fort had been taken In the meantime the German communique was being flashed around the world and the French had to say something So headquarters explained In the midst of total ignorance at Chantilly about the way the attack had taken place we imagined in the evening communique of the twenty sixth a plan of the attack which certainly had a thousand to one chance of being true The communique of this imaginary battle read A bitter struggle is taking place around Fort de Douaumont which is an advanced post of the old defensive organization of Verdun The position taken this morning by the enemy after several unsuccessful assaults that cost him very heavy losses has been reached again and passed by our troops whom the enemy has not been able to drive back Footnote This is my own translation the English translation from London published in the New York Times of Sunday Feb twenty seven is as follows London Feb twenty six nineteen sixteen A furious struggle has been in progress around Fort de Douaumont which is an advance element of the old defensive organization of Verdun fortresses The position captured this morning by the enemy after several fruitless assaults which cost him extremely heavy losses Footnote The French text says pertes tres elevees Thus the English translation exaggerates the original text was reached again and gone beyond by our troops which all the attempts of the enemy have not been able to push back What had actually happened differed from both the French and German accounts While changing troops in the line the position had somehow been forgotten in a confusion of orders Only a battery commander and a few men remained in the fort Some German soldiers seeing the door open had crawled into the fort and taken everyone inside prisoner A little later the French who were on the slopes of the hill were horrified at being shot at from the fort There had been no battle at Douaumont and no losses Nor had the French troops advanced beyond it as the communiques seemed to say They were beyond it on either side to be sure but the fort was in enemy hands Yet from the communique everyone believed that the fort was half surrounded The words did not explicitly say so but the press as usual forced the pace Military writers concluded that the Germans would soon have to surrender In a few days they began to ask themselves why the garrison since it lacked food had not yet surrendered It was necessary through the press bureau to request them to drop the encirclement theme Footnote Pierrefeu op cit pp one hundred thirty four five two The editor of the French communique tells us that as the battle dragged out his colleagues and he set out to neutralize the pertinacity of the Germans by continual insistence on their terrible losses It is necessary to remember that at this time and in fact until late in nineteen seventeen the orthodox view of the war for all the Allied peoples was that it would be decided by attrition Nobody believed in a war of movement It was insisted that strategy did not count or diplomacy It was simply a matter of killing Germans The general public more or less believed the dogma but it had constantly to be reminded of it in face of spectacular German successes Almost no day passed but the communique ascribed to the Germans with some appearance of justice heavy losses extremely heavy spoke of bloody sacrifices heaps of corpses hecatombs Likewise the wireless constantly used the statistics of the intelligence bureau at Verdun whose chief Major Cointet had invented a method of calculating German losses which obviously produced marvelous results Every fortnight the figures increased a hundred thousand or so These three hundred thousand four hundred thousand five hundred thousand casualties put out divided into daily weekly monthly losses repeated in all sorts of ways produced a striking effect Our formulae varied little according to prisoners the German losses in the course of the attack have been considerable it is proved that the losses the enemy exhausted by his losses has not renewed the attack Certain formulae later abandoned because they had been overworked were used each day under our artillery and machine gun fire mowed down by our artillery and machine gun fire Constant repetition impressed the neutrals and Germany itself and helped to create a bloody background in spite of the denials from Nauen the German wireless which tried vainly to destroy the bad effect of this perpetual repetition Footnote Op cit pp one hundred thirty eight one hundred thirty nine The thesis of the French Command which it wished to establish publicly by these reports was formulated as follows for the guidance of the censors This offensive engages the active forces of our opponent whose manpower is declining We have learned that the class of nineteen sixteen is already at the front There will remain the nineteen seventeen class already being called up and the resources of the third category men above forty five or convalescents In a few weeks the German forces exhausted by this effort will find themselves confronted with all the forces of the coalition ten millions against seven millions Footnote Op cit p one hundred forty seven According to M de Pierrefeu the French command had converted itself to this belief By an extraordinary aberration of mind only the attrition of the enemy was seen it appeared that our forces were not subject to attrition General Nivelle shared these ideas We saw the result in nineteen seventeen We have learned to call this propaganda A group of men who can prevent independent access to the event arrange the news of it to suit their purpose That the purpose was in this case patriotic does not affect the argument at all They used their power to make the Allied publics see affairs as they desired them to be seen The casualty figures of Major Cointet which were spread about the world are of the same order They were intended to provoke a particular kind of inference namely that the war of attrition was going in favor of the French But the inference is not drawn in the form of argument It results almost automatically from the creation of a mental picture of endless Germans slaughtered on the hills about Verdun By putting the dead Germans in the focus of the picture and by omitting to mention the French dead a very special view of the battle was built up It was a view designed to neutralize the effects of German territorial advances and the impression of power which the persistence of the offensive was making It was also a view that tended to make the public acquiesce in the demoralizing defensive strategy imposed upon the Allied armies For the public accustomed to the idea that war consists of great strategic movements flank attacks encirclements and dramatic surrenders had gradually to forget that picture in favor of the terrible idea that by matching lives the war would be won Through its control over all news from the front the General Staff substituted a view of the facts that comported with this strategy The General Staff of an army in the field is so placed that within wide limits it can control what the public will perceive It controls the selection of correspondents who go to the front controls their movements at the front reads and censors their messages from the front and operates the wires The Government behind the army by its command of cables and passports mails and custom houses and blockades increases the control It emphasizes it by legal power over publishers over public meetings and by its secret service But in the case of an army the control is far from perfect There is always the enemy s communique which in these days of wireless cannot be kept away from neutrals Above all there is the talk of the soldiers which blows back from the front and is spread about when they are on leave Footnote For weeks prior to the American attack at saint Mihiel and in the Argonne Meuse everybody in France told everybody else the deep secret An army is an unwieldy thing And that is why the naval and diplomatic censorship is almost always much more complete Fewer people know what is going on and their acts are more easily supervised three Without some form of censorship propaganda in the strict sense of the word is impossible In order to conduct a propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event Access to the real environment must be limited before anyone can create a pseudo environment that he thinks wise or desirable For while people who have direct access can misconceive what they see no one else can decide how they shall misconceive it unless he can decide where they shall look and at what The military censorship is the simplest form of barrier but by no means the most important because it is known to exist and is therefore in certain measure agreed to and discounted At different times and for different subjects some men impose and other men accept a particular standard of secrecy The frontier between what is concealed because publication is not as we say compatible with the public interest fades gradually into what is concealed because it is believed to be none of the public s business The notion of what constitutes a person s private affairs is elastic Thus the amount of a man s fortune is considered a private affair and careful provision is made in the income tax law to keep it as private as possible The sale of a piece of land is not private but the price may be Salaries are generally treated as more private than wages incomes as more private than inheritances A person s credit rating is given only a limited circulation The profits of big corporations are more public than those of small firms Certain kinds of conversation between man and wife lawyer and client doctor and patient priest and communicant are privileged Directors meetings are generally private So are many political conferences Most of what is said at a cabinet meeting or by an ambassador to the Secretary of State or at private interviews or dinner tables is private Many people regard the contract between employer and employee as private There was a time when the affairs of all corporations were held to be as private as a man s theology is to day There was a time before that when his theology was held to be as public a matter as the color of his eyes But infectious diseases on the other hand were once as private as the processes of a man s digestion The history of the notion of privacy would be an entertaining tale Sometimes the notions violently conflict as they did when the bolsheviks published the secret treaties or when mister Hughes investigated the life insurance companies or when somebody s scandal exudes from the pages of Town Topics to the front pages of mister Hearst s newspapers Whether the reasons for privacy are good or bad the barriers exist Privacy is insisted upon at all kinds of places in the area of what is called public affairs It is often very illuminating therefore to ask yourself how you got at the facts on which you base your opinion Who actually saw heard felt counted named the thing about which you have an opinion Was it the man who told you or the man who told him or someone still further removed And how much was he permitted to see When he informs you that France thinks this and that what part of France did he watch How was he able to watch it Where was he when he watched it What Frenchmen was he permitted to talk to what newspapers did he read and where did they learn what they say You can ask yourself these questions but you can rarely answer them They will remind you however of the distance which often separates your public opinion from the event with which it deals And the reminder is itself a protection CHAPTER III CONTACT AND OPPORTUNITY one While censorship and privacy intercept much information at its source a very much larger body of fact never reaches the whole public at all or only very slowly For there are very distinct limits upon the circulation of ideas A rough estimate of the effort it takes to reach everybody can be had by considering the Government s propaganda during the war Remembering that the war had run over two years and a half before America entered it that millions upon millions of printed pages had been circulated and untold speeches had been delivered let us turn to mister Creel s account of his fight for the minds of men for the conquest of their convictions in order that the gospel of Americanism might be carried to every corner of the globe Footnote George Creel How We Advertised America mister Creel had to assemble machinery which included a Division of News that issued he tells us more than six thousand releases had to enlist seventy five thousand Four Minute Men who delivered at least seven hundred and fifty five thousand one hundred and ninety speeches to an aggregate of over three hundred million people Boy scouts delivered annotated copies of President Wilson s addresses to the householders of America Fortnightly periodicals were sent to six hundred thousand teachers Two hundred thousand lantern slides were furnished for illustrated lectures Fourteen hundred and thirty eight different designs were turned out for posters window cards newspaper advertisements cartoons seals and buttons The chambers of commerce the churches fraternal societies schools were used as channels of distribution Yet mister Creel s effort to which I have not begun to do justice did not include mister McAdoo s stupendous organization for the Liberty Loans nor mister Hoover s far reaching propaganda about food nor the campaigns of the Red Cross the Y M C A Salvation Army Knights of Columbus Jewish Welfare Board not to mention the independent work of patriotic societies like the League to Enforce Peace the League of Free Nations Association the National Security League nor the activity of the publicity bureaus of the Allies and of the submerged nationalities Probably this is the largest and the most intensive effort to carry quickly a fairly uniform set of ideas to all the people of a nation The older proselyting worked more slowly perhaps more surely but never so inclusively Now if it required such extreme measures to reach everybody in time of crisis how open are the more normal channels to men s minds The Administration was trying and while the war continued it very largely succeeded I believe in creating something that might almost be called one public opinion all over America But think of the dogged work the complicated ingenuity the money and the personnel that were required Nothing like that exists in time of peace and as a corollary there are whole sections there are vast groups ghettoes enclaves and classes that hear only vaguely about much that is going on They live in grooves are shut in among their own affairs barred out of larger affairs meet few people not of their own sort read little Travel and trade the mails the wires and radio railroads highways ships motor cars and in the coming generation aeroplanes are of course of the utmost influence on the circulation of ideas Each of these affects the supply and the quality of information and opinion in a most intricate way Each is itself affected by technical by economic by political conditions Every time a government relaxes the passport ceremonies or the customs inspection every time a new railway or a new port is opened a new shipping line established every time rates go up or down the mails move faster or more slowly the cables are uncensored and made less expensive highways built or widened or improved the circulation of ideas is influenced Tariff schedules and subsidies affect the direction of commercial enterprise and therefore the nature of human contracts And so it may well happen as it did for example in the case of Salem Massachusetts that a change in the art of shipbuilding will reduce a whole city from a center where international influences converge to a genteel provincial town All the immediate effects of more rapid transit are not necessarily good It would be difficult to say for example that the railroad system of France so highly centralized upon Paris has been an unmixed blessing to the French people It is certainly true that problems arising out of the means of communication are of the utmost importance and one of the most constructive features of the program of the League of Nations has been the study given to railroad transit and access to the sea The monopolizing of cables Footnote Hence the wisdom of taking Yap seriously of ports fuel stations mountain passes canals straits river courses terminals market places means a good deal more than the enrichment of a group of business men or the prestige of a government It means a barrier upon the exchange of news and opinion But monopoly is not the only barrier Cost and available supply are even greater ones for if the cost of travelling or trading is prohibitive if the demand for facilities exceeds the supply the barriers exist even without monopoly two The size of a man s income has considerable effect on his access to the world beyond his neighborhood With money he can overcome almost every tangible obstacle of communication he can travel buy books and periodicals and bring within the range of his attention almost any known fact of the world The income of the individual and the income of the community determine the amount of communication that is possible But men s ideas determine how that income shall be spent and that in turn affects in the long run the amount of income they will have Thus also there are limitations none the less real because they are often self imposed and self indulgent There are portions of the sovereign people who spend most of their spare time and spare money on motoring and comparing motor cars on bridge whist and post mortems on moving pictures and potboilers talking always to the same people with minute variations on the same old themes They cannot really be said to suffer from censorship or secrecy the high cost or the difficulty of communication They suffer from anemia from lack of appetite and curiosity for the human scene Theirs is no problem of access to the world outside Worlds of interest are waiting for them to explore and they do not enter They move as if on a leash within a fixed radius of acquaintances according to the law and the gospel of their social set Among men the circle of talk in business and at the club and in the smoking car is wider than the set to which they belong Among women the social set and the circle of talk are frequently almost identical It is in the social set that ideas derived from reading and lectures and from the circle of talk converge are sorted out accepted rejected judged and sanctioned There it is finally decided in each phase of a discussion which authorities and which sources of information are admissible and which not Our social set consists of those who figure as people in the phrase people are saying they are the people whose approval matters most intimately to us In big cities among men and women of wide interests and with the means for moving about the social set is not so rigidly defined But even in big cities there are quarters and nests of villages containing self sufficing social sets In smaller communities there may exist a freer circulation a more genuine fellowship from after breakfast to before dinner But few people do not know nevertheless which set they really belong to and which not Usually the distinguishing mark of a social set is the presumption that the children may intermarry To marry outside the set involves at the very least a moment of doubt before the engagement can be approved Each social set has a fairly clear picture of its relative position in the hierarchy of social sets Between sets at the same level association is easy individuals are quickly accepted hospitality is normal and unembarrassed But in contact between sets that are higher or lower there is always reciprocal hesitation a faint malaise and a consciousness of difference To be sure in a society like that of the United States individuals move somewhat freely out of one set into another especially where there is no racial barrier and where economic position changes so rapidly Economic position however is not measured by the amount of income For in the first generation at least it is not income that determines social standing but the character of a man s work and it may take a generation or two before this fades out of the family tradition Thus banking law medicine public utilities newspapers the church large retailing brokerage manufacture are rated at a different social value from salesmanship superintendence expert technical work nursing school teaching shop keeping and those in turn are rated as differently from plumbing being a chauffeur dressmaking subcontracting or stenography as these are from being a butler lady s maid a moving picture operator or a locomotive engineer And yet the financial return does not necessarily coincide with these gradations three Whatever the tests of admission the social set when formed is not a mere economic class but something which more nearly resembles a biological clan Membership is intimately connected with love marriage and children or to speak more exactly with the attitudes and desires that are involved In the social set therefore opinions encounter the canons of Family Tradition Respectability Propriety Dignity Taste and Form which make up the social set s picture of itself a picture assiduously implanted in the children In this picture a large space is tacitly given to an authorized version of what each set is called upon inwardly to accept as the social standing of the others The more vulgar press for an outward expression of the deference due the others are decently and sensitively silent about their own knowledge that such deference invisibly exists But that knowledge becoming overt when there is a marriage a war or a social upheaval is the nexus of a large bundle of dispositions classified by Trotter Footnote W Trotter Instincts of the Herd in War and Peace under the general term instinct of the herd Within each social set there are augurs like the van der Luydens and missus Manson Mingott in The Age of Innocence Footnote Edith Wharton The Age of Innocence who are recognized as the custodians and the interpreters of its social pattern You are made they say if the van der Luydens take you up The invitations to their functions are the high sign of arrival and status The elections to college societies carefully graded and the gradations universally accepted determine who is who in college The social leaders weighted with the ultimate eugenic responsibility are peculiarly sensitive Not only must they be watchfully aware of what makes for the integrity of their set but they have to cultivate a special gift for knowing what other social sets are doing They act as a kind of ministry of foreign affairs Where most of the members of a set live complacently within the set regarding it for all practical purposes as the world the social leaders must combine an intimate knowledge of the anatomy of their own set with a persistent sense of its place in the hierarchy of sets The hierarchy in fact is bound together by the social leaders At any one level there is something which might almost be called a social set of the social leaders But vertically the actual binding together of society in so far as it is bound together at all by social contact is accomplished by those exceptional people frequently suspect who like Julius Beaufort and Ellen Olenska in The Age of Innocence move in and out Thus there come to be established personal channels from one set to another through which Tarde s laws of imitation operate But for large sections of the population there are no such channels For them the patented accounts of society and the moving pictures of high life have to serve They may develop a social hierarchy of their own almost unnoticed as have the Negroes and the foreign element but among that assimilated mass which always considers itself the nation there is in spite of the great separateness of sets a variety of personal contacts through which a circulation of standards takes place Some of the sets are so placed that they become what Professor Ross has called radiant points of conventionality Footnote Ross Social Psychology Ch IX X XI Thus the social superior is likely to be imitated by the social inferior the holder of power is imitated by subordinates the more successful by the less successful the rich by the poor the city by the country But imitation does not stop at frontiers The powerful socially superior successful rich urban social set is fundamentally international throughout the western hemisphere and in many ways London is its center It counts among its membership the most influential people in the world containing as it does the diplomatic set high finance the upper circles of the army and the navy some princes of the church a few great newspaper proprietors their wives and mothers and daughters who wield the scepter of invitation It is at once a great circle of talk and a real social set But its importance comes from the fact that here at last the distinction between public and private affairs practically disappears The private affairs of this set are public matters and public matters are its private often its family affairs The confinements of Margot Asquith like the confinements of royalty are as the philosophers say in much the same universe of discourse as a tariff bill or a parliamentary debate There are large areas of governments in which this social set is not interested and in America at least it has exercised only a fluctuating control over the national government But its power in foreign affairs is always very great and in war time its prestige is enormously enhanced That is natural enough because these cosmopolitans have a contact with the outer world that most people do not possess They have dined with each other in the capitals and their sense of national honor is no mere abstraction it is a concrete experience of being snubbed or approved by their friends To doctor Kennicott of Gopher Prairie it matters mighty little what Winston thinks and a great deal what Ezra Stowbody thinks but to missus Mingott with a daughter married to the Earl of Swithin it matters a lot when she visits her daughter or entertains Winston himself doctor Kennicott and missus Mingott are both socially sensitive but missus Mingott is sensitive to a social set that governs the world while doctor Kennicott s social set governs only in Gopher Prairie But in matters that effect the larger relationships of the Great Society doctor Kennicott will often be found holding what he thinks is purely his own opinion though as a matter of fact it has trickled down to Gopher Prairie from High Society transmuted on its passage through the provincial social sets four It is no part of our inquiry to attempt an account of the social tissue We need only fix in mind how big is the part played by the social set in our spiritual contact with the world how it tends to fix what is admissible and to determine how it shall be judged Affairs within its immediate competence each set more or less determines for itself Above all it determines the detailed administration of the judgment But the judgment itself is formed on patterns Footnote Cf Part III that may be inherited from the past transmitted or imitated from other social sets The highest social set consists of those who embody the leadership of the Great Society As against almost every other social set where the bulk of the opinions are first hand only about local affairs in this Highest Society the big decisions of war and peace of social strategy and the ultimate distribution of political power are intimate experiences within a circle of what potentially at least are personal acquaintances Since position and contact play so big a part in determining what can be seen heard read and experienced as well as what it is permissible to see hear read and know it is no wonder that moral judgment is so much more common than constructive thought Yet in truly effective thinking the prime necessity is to liquidate judgments regain an innocent eye disentangle feelings be curious and open hearted Man s history being what it is political opinion on the scale of the Great Society requires an amount of selfless equanimity rarely attainable by any one for any length of time We are concerned in public affairs but immersed in our private ones The time and attention are limited that we can spare for the labor of not taking opinions for granted and we are subject to constant interruption CHAPTER IV TIME AND ATTENTION NATURALLY it is possible to make a rough estimate only of the amount of attention people give each day to informing themselves about public affairs Yet it is interesting that three estimates that I have examined agree tolerably well though they were made at different times in different places and by different methods Footnote July nineteen hundred D F Wilcox The American Newspaper A Study in Social Psychology Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science vol xvi p fifty six The

of National Advertisers Inc fifteen East twenty sixth Street New York City A questionnaire was sent by Hotchkiss and Franken to seventeen sixty one men and women college students in New York City and answers came from all but a few Scott used a questionnaire on four thousand prominent business and professional men in Chicago and received replies from twenty three hundred Between seventy and seventy five percent of all those who replied to either inquiry thought they spent a quarter of an hour a day reading newspapers Only four percent of the Chicago group guessed at less than this and twenty five percent guessed at more Among the New Yorkers a little over eight percent figured their newspaper reading at less than fifteen minutes and seventeen and a half at more Very few people have an accurate idea of fifteen minutes so the figures are not to be taken literally Moreover business men professional people and college students are most of them liable to a curious little bias against appearing to spend too much time over the newspapers and perhaps also to a faint suspicion of a desire to be known as rapid readers All that the figures can justly be taken to mean is that over three quarters of those in the selected groups rate rather low the attention they give to printed news of the outer world These time estimates are fairly well confirmed by a test which is less subjective Scott asked his Chicagoans how many papers they read each day and was told that fourteen percent read but one paper forty six two papers twenty one three papers ten four papers three five papers two six papers three all the papers eight at the time of this inquiry The two and three paper readers are sixty seven percent which comes fairly close to the seventy one percent in Scott s group who rate themselves at fifteen minutes a day The omnivorous readers of from four to eight papers coincide roughly with the twenty five percent who rated themselves at more than fifteen minutes two It is still more difficult to guess how the time is distributed The college students were asked to name the five features which interest you most Just under twenty percent voted for general news just under fifteen for editorials just under twelve for politics a little over eight for finance not two years after the armistice a little over six for foreign news three and a half for local nearly three for business and a quarter of one percent for news about labor A scattering said they were most interested in sports special articles the theatre advertisements cartoons book reviews accuracy music ethical tone society brevity art stories shipping school news current news print Disregarding these about sixty seven and a half percent picked as the most interesting features news and opinion that dealt with public affairs This was a mixed college group The girls professed greater interest than the boys in general news foreign news local news politics editorials the theatre music art stories cartoons advertisements and ethical tone The boys on the other hand were more absorbed in finance sports business page accuracy and brevity These discriminations correspond a little too closely with the ideals of what is cultured and moral manly and decisive not to make one suspect the utter objectivity of the replies Yet they agree fairly well with the replies of Scott s Chicago business and professional men They were asked not what features interested them most but why they preferred one newspaper to another Nearly seventy one percent based their conscious preference on local news seventeen point eight or political fifteen point eight or financial eleven point three or foreign nine point five or general seven point two or editorials nine The other thirty percent decided on grounds not connected with public affairs They ranged from not quite seven who decided for ethical tone down to one twentieth of one percent who cared most about humor How do these preferences correspond with the space given by newspapers to various subjects Unfortunately there are no data collected on this point for the newspapers read by the Chicago and New York groups at the time the questionnaires were made But there is an interesting analysis made over twenty years ago by Wilcox He studied one hundred and ten newspapers in fourteen large cities and classified the subject matter of over nine thousand columns Averaged for the whole country the various newspaper matter was found to fill over Later Repressed Wishes Over opposed by the resistance of the Adolescent Repressed Wishes environment Behavior Over Preadolescent Repressed Wishes They permit us to suppose though I have not seen the notion formulated that the repression or control of cravings is fixed not in relation to the whole person all the time but more or less in respect to his various selves There are things he will not do as a patriot that he will do when he is not thinking of himself as a patriot No doubt there are impulses more or less incipient in childhood that are never exercised again in the whole of a man s life except as they enter obscurely and indirectly into combination with other impulses But even that is not certain since repression is not irretrievable For just as psychoanalysis can bring to the surface a buried impulse so can social situations Footnote Cf the very interesting book of Everett Dean Martin The Behavior of Crowds Also Hobbes Leviathan Part II Ch twenty five For the passions of men which asunder are moderate as the heat of one brand in an assembly are like many brands that inflame one another especially when they blow one another with orations LeBon The Crowd elaborates this observation of Hobbes s It is only when our surroundings remain normal and placid when what is expected of us by those we meet is consistent that we live without knowledge of many of our dispositions When the unexpected occurs we learn much about ourselves that we did not know The selves which we construct with the help of all who influence us prescribe which impulses how emphasized how directed are appropriate to certain typical situations for which we have learned prepared attitudes For a recognizable type of experience there is a character which controls the outward manifestations of our whole being Murderous hate is for example controlled in civil life Though you choke with rage you must not display it as a parent child employer politician You would not wish to display a personality that exudes murderous hate You frown upon it and the people around you also frown But if a war breaks out the chances are that everybody you admire will begin to feel the justification of killing and hating At first the vent for these feelings is very narrow The selves which come to the front are those which are attuned to a real love of country the kind of feeling that you find in Rupert Brooke and in Sir Edward Grey s speech on August thirty one thousand nine hundred fourteen and in President Wilson s address to Congress on April two nineteen seventeen The reality of war is still abhorred and what war actually means is learned but gradually For previous wars are only transfigured memories In that honeymoon phase the realists of war rightly insist that the nation is not yet awake and reassure each other by saying Wait for the casualty lists Gradually the impulse to kill becomes the main business and all those characters which might modify it disintegrate The impulse becomes central is sanctified and gradually turns unmanageable It seeks a vent not alone on the idea of the enemy which is all the enemy most people actually see during the war but upon all the persons and objects and ideas that have always been hateful Hatred of the enemy is legitimate These other hatreds have themselves legitimized by the crudest analogy and by what once having cooled off we recognize as the most far fetched analogy It takes a long time to subdue so powerful an impulse once it goes loose And therefore when the war is over in fact it takes time and struggle to regain self control and to deal with the problems of peace in civilian character Modern war as mister Herbert Croly has said is inherent in the political structure of modern society but outlawed by its ideals For the civilian population there exists no ideal code of conduct in war such as the soldier still possesses and chivalry once prescribed The civilians are without standards except those that the best of them manage to improvise The only standards they possess make war an accursed thing Yet though the war may be a necessary one no moral training has prepared them for it Only their higher selves have a code and patterns and when they have to act in what the higher regards as a lower character profound disturbance results The preparation of characters for all the situations in which men may find themselves is one function of a moral education Clearly then it depends for its success upon the sincerity and knowledge with which the environment has been explored For in a world falsely conceived our own characters are falsely conceived and we misbehave So the moralist must choose either he must offer a pattern of conduct for every phase of life however distasteful some of its phases may be or he must guarantee that his pupils will never be confronted by the situations he disapproves Either he must abolish war or teach people how to wage it with the greatest psychic economy either he must abolish the economic life of man and feed him with stardust and dew or he must investigate all the perplexities of economic life and offer patterns of conduct which are applicable in a world where no man is self supporting But that is just what the prevailing moral culture so generally refuses to do In its best aspects it is diffident at the awful complication of the modern world In its worst it is just cowardly Now whether the moralists study economics and politics and psychology or whether the social scientists educate the moralists is no great matter Each generation will go unprepared into the modern world unless it has been taught to conceive the kind of personality it will have to be among the issues it will most likely meet four Most of this the naive view of self interest leaves out of account It forgets that self and interest are both conceived somehow and that for the most part they are conventionally conceived The ordinary doctrine of self interest usually omits altogether the cognitive function So insistent is it on the fact that human beings finally refer all things to themselves that it does not stop to notice that men s ideas of all things and of themselves are not instinctive They are acquired Thus it may be true enough as James Madison wrote in the tenth paper of the Federalist that a landed interest a manufacturing interest a mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes actuated by different sentiments and views But if you examine the context of Madison s paper you discover something which I think throws light upon that view of instinctive fatalism called sometimes the economic interpretation of history Madison was arguing for the federal constitution and among the numerous advantages of the union he set forth its tendency to break and control the violence of faction Faction was what worried Madison And the causes of faction he traced to the nature of man where latent dispositions are brought into different degrees of activity according to the different circumstances of civil society A zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning government and many other points as well of speculation as of practice an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for preeminence and power or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions have in turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to cooperate for their common good So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property Madison s theory therefore is that the propensity to faction may be kindled by religious or political opinions by leaders but most commonly by the distribution of property Yet note that Madison claims only that men are divided by their relation to property He does not say that their property and their opinions are cause and effect but that differences of property are the causes of differences of opinion The pivotal word in Madison s argument is different From the existence of differing economic situations you can tentatively infer a probable difference of opinions but you cannot infer what those opinions will necessarily be This reservation cuts radically into the claims of the theory as that theory is usually held That the reservation is necessary the enormous contradiction between dogma and practice among orthodox socialists bears witness They argue that the next stage in social evolution is the inevitable result of the present stage But in order to produce that inevitable next stage they organize and agitate to produce class consciousness Why one asks does not the economic situation produce consciousness of class in everybody It just doesn t that is all And therefore the proud claim will not stand that the socialist philosophy rests on prophetic insight into destiny It rests on an hypothesis about human nature Footnote Cf Thorstein Veblen The Socialist Economics of Karl Marx and His Followers in The Place of Science in Modern Civilization esp pp four hundred thirteen four hundred eighteen The socialist practice is based on a belief that if men are economically situated in different ways they can then be induced to hold certain views Undoubtedly they often come to believe or can be induced to believe different things as they are for example landlords or tenants employees or employers skilled or unskilled laborers wageworkers or salaried men buyers or sellers farmers or middle men exporters or importers creditors or debtors Differences of income make a profound difference in contact and opportunity Men who work at machines will tend as mister Thorstein Veblen has so brilliantly demonstrated Footnote The Theory of Business Enterprise to interpret experience differently from handicraftsmen or traders If this were all that the materialistic conception of politics asserted the theory would be an immensely valuable hypothesis that every interpreter of opinion would have to use But he would often have to abandon the theory and he would always have to be on guard For in trying to explain a certain public opinion it is rarely obvious which of a man s many social relations is effecting a particular opinion Does Smith s opinion arise from his problems as a landlord an importer an owner of railway shares or an employer Does Jones s opinion Jones being a weaver in a textile mill come from the attitude of his boss the competition of new immigrants his wife s grocery bills or the ever present contract with the firm which is selling him a Ford car and a house and lot on the instalment plan Without special inquiry you cannot tell The economic determinist cannot tell A man s various economic contacts limit or enlarge the range of his opinions But which of the contacts in what guise on what theory the materialistic conception of politics cannot predict It can predict with a high degree of probability that if a man owns a factory his ownership will figure in those opinions which seem to have some bearing on that factory But how the function of being an owner will figure no economic determinist as such can tell you There is no fixed set of opinions on any question that go with being the owner of a factory no views on labor on property on management let alone views on less immediate matters The determinist can predict that in ninety nine cases out of a hundred the owner will resist attempts to deprive him of ownership or that he will favor legislation which he thinks will increase his profits But since there is no magic in ownership which enables a business man to know what laws will make him prosper there is no chain of cause and effect described in economic materialism which enables anyone to prophesy whether the owner will take a long view or a short one a competitive or a cooperative Did the theory have the validity which is so often claimed for it it would enable us to prophesy We could analyze the economic interests of a people and deduce what the people was bound to do Marx tried that and after a good guess about the trusts went wholly wrong The first socialist experiment came not as he predicted out of the culmination of capitalist development in the West but out of the collapse of a pre capitalist system in the East Why did he go wrong Why did his greatest disciple Lenin go wrong Because the Marxians thought that men s economic position would irresistibly produce a clear conception of their economic interests They thought they themselves possessed that clear conception and that what they knew the rest of mankind would learn The event has shown not only that a clear conception of interest does not arise automatically in everyone but that it did not arise even in Marx and Lenin themselves After all that Marx and Lenin have written the social behavior of mankind is still obscure It ought not to be if economic position alone determined public opinion Position ought if their theory were correct not only to divide mankind into classes but to supply each class with a view of its interest and a coherent policy for obtaining it Yet nothing is more certain than that all classes of men are in constant perplexity as to what their interests are Footnote As a matter of fact when it came to the test Lenin completely abandoned the materialistic interpretation of politics Had he held sincerely to the Marxian formula when he seized power in nineteen seventeen he would have said to himself according to the teachings of Marx socialism will develop out of a mature capitalism here am I in control of a nation that is only entering upon a capitalist development it is true that I am a socialist but I am a scientific socialist it follows that for the present all idea of a socialist republic is out of the question we must advance capitalism in order that the evolution which Marx predicted may take place But Lenin did nothing of the sort Instead of waiting for evolution to evolve he tried by will force and education to defy the historical process which his philosophy assumed Since this was written Lenin has abandoned communism on the ground that Russia does not possess the necessary basis in a mature capitalism He now says that Russia must create capitalism which will create a proletariat which will some day create communism This is at least consistent with Marxist dogma But it shows how little determinism there is in the opinions of a determinist This dissolves the impact of economic determinism For if our economic interests are made up of our variable concepts of those interests then as the master key to social processes the theory fails That theory assumes that men are capable of adopting only one version of their interest and that having adopted it they move fatally to realize it It assumes the existence of a specific class interest That assumption is false A class interest can be conceived largely or narrowly selfishly or unselfishly in the light of no facts some facts many facts truth and error And so collapses the Marxian remedy for class conflicts That remedy assumes that if all property could be held in common class differences would disappear The assumption is false Property might well be held in common and yet not be conceived as a whole The moment any group of people failed to see communism in a communist manner they would divide into classes on the basis of what they saw In respect to the existing social order Marxian socialism emphasizes property conflict as the maker of opinion in respect to the loosely defined working class it ignores property conflict as the basis of agitation in respect to the future it imagines a society without property conflict and therefore without conflict of opinion Now in the existing social order there may be more instances where one man must lose if another is to gain than there would be under socialism but for every case where one must lose for another to gain there are endless cases where men simply imagine the conflict because they are uneducated And under socialism though you removed every instance of absolute conflict the partial access of each man to the whole range of facts would nevertheless create conflict A socialist state will not be able to dispense with education morality or liberal science though on strict materialistic grounds the communal ownership of properties ought to make them superfluous The communists in Russia would not propagate their faith with such unflagging zeal if economic determinism were alone determining the opinion of the Russian people five The socialist theory of human nature is like the hedonistic calculus an example of false determinism Both assume that the unlearned dispositions fatally but intelligently produce a certain type of behavior The socialist believes that the dispositions pursue the economic interest of a class the hedonist believes that they pursue pleasure and avoid pain Both theories rest on a naive view of instinct a view defined by James Footnote Principles of Psychology Vol II p three hundred eighty three though radically qualified by him as the faculty of acting in such a way as to produce certain ends without foresight of the ends and without previous education in the performance It is doubtful whether instinctive action of this sort figures at all in the social life of mankind For as James pointed out Footnote Op cit Vol II p three hundred ninety every instinctive act in an animal with memory must cease to be blind after being once repeated Whatever the equipment at birth the innate dispositions are from earliest infancy immersed in experience which determines what shall excite them as stimulus They become capable as mister McDougall says Footnote Introduction to Social Psychology Fourth Edition pp thirty one thirty two of being initiated not only by the perception of objects of the kind which directly excite the innate disposition the natural or native excitants of the instinct but also by ideas of such objects and by perceptions and by ideas of objects of other kinds Footnote Most definitions of instincts and instinctive actions take account only of their conative aspects and it is a common mistake to ignore the cognitive and affective aspects of the instinctive mental process Footnote op cit p twenty nine It is only the central part of the disposition Footnote p thirty four says mister McDougall further that retains its specific character and remains common to all individuals and all situations in which the instinct is excited The cognitive processes and the actual bodily movements by which the instinct achieves its end may be indefinitely complicated In other words man has an instinct of fear but what he will fear and how he will try to escape is determined not from birth but by experience If it were not for this variability it would be difficult to conceive the inordinate variety of human nature But when you consider that all the important tendencies of the creature his appetites his loves his hates his curiosity his sexual cravings his fears and pugnacity are freely attachable to all sorts of objects as stimulus and to all kinds of objects as gratification the complexity of human nature is not so inconceivable And when you think that each new generation is the casual victim of the way a previous generation was conditioned as well as the inheritor of the environment that resulted the possible combinations and permutations are enormous There is no prima facie case then for supposing that because persons crave some particular thing or behave in some particular way human nature is fatally constituted to crave that and act thus The craving and the action are both learned and in another generation might be learned differently Analytic psychology and social history unite in supporting this conclusion Psychology indicates how essentially casual is the nexus between the particular stimulus and the particular response Anthropology in the widest sense reinforces the view by demonstrating that the things which have excited men s passions and the means which they have used to realize them differ endlessly from age to age and from place to place Men pursue their interest But how they shall pursue it is not fatally determined and therefore within whatever limits of time this planet will continue to support human life man can set no term upon the creative energies of men He can issue no doom of automatism He can say if he must that for his life there will be no changes which he can recognize as good But in saying that he will be confining his life to what he can see with his eye rejecting what he might see with his mind he will be taking as the measure of good a measure which is only the one he happens to possess He can find no ground for abandoning his highest hopes and relaxing his conscious effort unless he chooses to regard the unknown as the unknowable unless he elects to believe that what no one knows no one will know and that what someone has not yet learned no one will ever be able to teach PART V THE MAKING OF A COMMON WILL CHAPTER thirteen THE TRANSFER OF INTEREST fourteen YES OR NO fifteen LEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE CHAPTER XIII THE TRANSFER OF INTEREST This goes to show that there are many variables in each man s impressions of the invisible world The points of contact vary the stereotyped expectations vary the interest enlisted varies most subtly of all The living impressions of a large number of people are to an immeasurable degree personal in each of them and unmanageably complex in the mass How then is any practical relationship established between what is in people s heads and what is out there beyond their ken in the environment How in the language of democratic theory do great numbers of people feeling each so privately about so abstract a picture develop any common will How does a simple and constant idea emerge from this complex of variables How are those things known as the Will of the People or the National Purpose or Public Opinion crystallized out of such fleeting and casual imagery That there is a real difficulty here was shown by an angry tilt in the spring of nineteen twenty one between the American Ambassador to England and a very large number of other Americans mister Harvey speaking at a British dinner table had assured the world without the least sign of hesitancy what were the motives of Americans in nineteen seventeen Footnote New York Times May twenty nineteen twenty one As he described them they were not the motives which President Wilson had insisted upon when he enunciated the American mind Now of course neither mister Harvey nor mister Wilson nor the critics and friends of either nor any one else can know quantitatively and qualitatively what went on in thirty or forty million adult minds But what everybody knows is that a war was fought and won by a multitude of efforts stimulated no one knows in what proportion by the motives of Wilson and the motives of Harvey and all kinds of hybrids of the two People enlisted and fought worked paid taxes sacrificed to a common end and yet no one can begin to say exactly what moved each person to do each thing that he did It is no use then mister Harvey telling a soldier who thought this was a war to end war that the soldier did not think any such thing The soldier who thought that thought that And mister Harvey who thought something else thought something else In the same speech mister Harvey formulated with equal clarity what the voters of nineteen twenty had in their minds That is a rash thing to do and if you simply assume that all who voted your ticket voted as you did then it is a disingenuous thing to do The count shows that sixteen millions voted Republican and nine millions Democratic They voted says mister Harvey for and against the League of Nations and in support of this claim he can point to mister Wilson s request for a referendum and to the undeniable fact that the Democratic party and mister Cox insisted that the League was the issue But then saying that the League was the issue did not make the League the issue and by counting the votes on election day you do not know the real division of opinion about the League There were for example nine million Democrats Are you entitled to believe that all of them are staunch supporters of the League Certainly you are not For your knowledge of American politics tells you that many of the millions voted as they always do to maintain the existing social system in the South and that whatever their views on the League they did not vote to express their views Those who wanted the League were no doubt pleased that the Democratic party wanted it too Those who disliked the League may have held their noses as they voted But both groups of Southerners voted the same ticket Were the Republicans more unanimous Anybody can pick Republican voters enough out of his circle of friends to cover the whole gamut of opinion from the irreconcilability of Senators Johnson and Knox to the advocacy of Secretary Hoover and Chief Justice Taft No one can say definitely how many people felt in any particular way about the League nor how many people let their feelings on that subject determine their vote When there are only two ways of expressing a hundred varieties of feeling there is no certain way of knowing what the decisive combination was Senator Borah found in the Republican ticket a reason for voting Republican but so did President Lowell The Republican majority was composed of men and women who thought a Republican victory would kill the League plus those who thought it the most practical way to secure the League plus those who thought it the surest way offered to obtain an amended League All these voters were inextricably entangled with their own desire or the desire of other voters to improve business or put labor in its place or to punish the Democrats for going to war or to punish them for not having gone sooner or to get rid of mister Burleson or to improve the price of wheat or to lower taxes or to stop mister Daniels from outbuilding the world or to help mister Harding do the same thing And yet a sort of decision emerged mister Harding moved into the White House For the least common denominator of all the votes was that the Democrats should go and the Republicans come in That was the only factor remaining after all the contradictions had cancelled each other out But that factor was enough to alter policy for four years The precise reasons why change was desired on that November day in nineteen twenty are not recorded not even in the memories of the individual voters The reasons are not fixed They grow and change and melt into other reasons so that the public opinions mister Harding has to deal with are not the opinions that elected him That there is no inevitable connection between an assortment of opinions and a particular line of action everyone saw in nineteen sixteen Elected apparently on the cry that he kept us out of war mister Wilson within five months led the country into war The working of the popular will therefore has always called for explanation Those who have been most impressed by its erratic working have found a prophet in M LeBon and have welcomed generalizations about what Sir Robert Peel called that great compound of folly weakness prejudice wrong feeling right feeling obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs which is called public opinion Others have concluded that since out of drift and incoherence settled aims do appear there must be a mysterious contrivance at work somewhere over and above the inhabitants of a nation They invoke a collective soul a national mind a spirit of the age which imposes order upon random opinion An oversoul seems to be needed for the emotions and ideas in the members of a group do not disclose anything so simple and so crystalline as the formula which those same individuals will accept as a true statement of their Public Opinion two But the facts can I think be explained more convincingly without the help of the oversoul in any of its disguises After all the art of inducing all sorts of people who think differently to vote alike is practiced in every political campaign In nineteen sixteen for example the Republican candidate had to produce Republican votes out of many different kinds of Republicans Let us look at mister Hughes first speech after accepting the nomination Footnote Delivered at Carnegie Hall New York City July thirty one nineteen sixteen The context is still clear enough in our minds to obviate much explanation yet the issues are no longer contentious The candidate was a man of unusually plain speech who had been out of politics for several years and was not personally committed on the issues of the recent past He had moreover none of that wizardry which popular leaders like Roosevelt Wilson or Lloyd George possess none of that histrionic gift by which such men impersonate the feelings of their followers From that aspect of politics he was by temperament and by training remote But yet he knew by calculation what the politician s technic is He was one of those people who know just how to do a thing but who can not quite do it themselves They are often better teachers than the virtuoso to whom the art is so much second nature that he himself does not know how he does it The statement that those who can do those who cannot teach is not nearly so much of a reflection on the teacher as it sounds mister Hughes knew the occasion was momentous and he had prepared his manuscript carefully In a box sat Theodore Roosevelt just back from Missouri All over the house sat the veterans of Armageddon in various stages of doubt and dismay On the platform and in the other boxes the ex whited sepulchres and ex second story men of nineteen twelve were to be seen obviously in the best of health and in a melting mood Out beyond the hall there were powerful pro Germans and powerful pro Allies a war party in the East and in the big cities a peace party in the middle and far West There was strong feeling about Mexico mister Hughes had to form a majority against the Democrats out of people divided into all sorts of combinations on Taft vs Roosevelt pro Germans vs pro Allies war vs neutrality Mexican intervention vs non intervention About the morality or the wisdom of the affair we are of course not concerned here Our only interest is in the method by which a leader of heterogeneous opinion goes about the business of securing a homogeneous vote This representative gathering is a happy augury It means the strength of reunion It means that the party of Lincoln is restored The italicized words are binders Lincoln in such a speech has of course no relation to Abraham Lincoln It is merely a stereotype by which the piety which surrounds that name can be transferred to the Republican candidate who now stands in his shoes Lincoln reminds the Republicans Bull Moose and Old Guard that before the schism they had a common history About the schism no one can afford to speak But it is there as yet unhealed The speaker must heal it Now the schism of nineteen twelve had arisen over domestic questions the reunion of nineteen sixteen was as mister Roosevelt had declared to be based on a common indignation against mister Wilson s conduct of international affairs But international affairs were also a dangerous source of conflict It was necessary to find an opening subject which would not only ignore nineteen twelve but would avoid also the explosive conflicts of nineteen sixteen The speaker skilfully selected the spoils system in diplomatic appointments Deserving Democrats was a discrediting phrase and mister Hughes at once evokes it The record being indefensible there is no hesitation in the vigor of the attack Logically it was an ideal introduction to a common mood mister Hughes then turns to Mexico beginning with an historical review He had to consider the general sentiment that affairs were going badly in Mexico also a no less general sentiment that war should be avoided and two powerful currents of opinion one of which said President Wilson was right in not recognizing Huerta the other which preferred Huerta to Carranza and intervention to both Huerta was the first sore spot in the record He was certainly in fact the head of the Government in Mexico But the moralists who regarded Huerta as a drunken murderer had to be placated Whether or not he should be recognized was a question to be determined in the exercise of a sound discretion but according to correct principles So instead of saying that Huerta should have been recognized the candidate says that correct principles ought to be applied Everybody believes in correct principles and everybody of course believes he possesses them To blur the issue still further President Wilson s policy is described as intervention It was that in law perhaps but not in the sense then currently meant by the word By stretching the word to cover what mister Wilson had done as well as what the real interventionists wanted the issue between the two factions was to be repressed Having got by the two explosive points Huerta and intervention by letting the words mean all things to all men the speech passes for a while to safer ground The candidate tells the story of Tampico Vera Cruz Villa Santa Ysabel Columbus and Carrizal mister Hughes is specific either because the facts as known from the newspapers are irritating or because the true explanation is as for example in regard to Tampico too complicated No contrary passions could be aroused by such a record But at the end the candidate had to take a position His audience expected it The indictment was mister Roosevelt s Would mister Hughes adopt his remedy intervention The nation has no policy of aggression toward Mexico We have no desire for any part of her territory We wish her to have peace stability and prosperity We should be ready to aid her in binding up her wounds in relieving her from starvation and distress in giving her in every practicable way the benefits of our disinterested friendship The conduct of this administration has created difficulties which we shall have to surmount We shall have to adopt a new policy a policy of firmness and consistency through which alone we can promote an enduring friendship The theme friendship is for the non interventionists the theme new policy and firmness is for the interventionists On the non contentious record the detail is overwhelming on the issue everything is cloudy Concerning the European war mister Hughes employed an ingenious formula I stand for the unflinching maintenance of all American rights on land and sea In order to understand the force of that statement at the time it was spoken we must remember how each faction during the period of neutrality believed that the nations it opposed in Europe were alone violating American rights mister Hughes seemed to say to the pro Allies I would have coerced Germany But the pro Germans had been insisting that British sea power was violating most of our rights The formula covers two diametrically opposed purposes by the symbolic phrase American rights But there was the Lusitania Like the nineteen twelve schism it was an invincible obstacle to harmony I am confident that there would have been no destruction of American lives by the sinking of the Lusitania Thus what cannot be compromised must be obliterated when there is a question on which we cannot all hope to get together let us pretend that it does not exist About the future of American relations with Europe mister Hughes was silent Nothing he could say would possibly please the two irreconcilable factions for whose support he was bidding It is hardly necessary to say that mister Hughes did not invent this technic and did not employ it with the utmost success But he illustrated how a public opinion constituted out of divergent opinions is clouded how its meaning approaches the neutral tint formed out of the blending of many colors Where superficial harmony is the aim and conflict the fact obscurantism in a public appeal is the usual result Almost always vagueness at a crucial point in public debate is a symptom of cross purposes three But how is it that a vague idea so often has the power to unite deeply felt opinions These opinions we recall however deeply they may be felt are not in continual and pungent contact with the facts they profess to treat On the unseen environment Mexico the European war our grip is slight though our feeling may be intense The original pictures and words which aroused it have not anything like the force of the feeling itself The account of what has happened out of sight and hearing in a place where we have never been has not and never can have except briefly as in a dream or fantasy all the dimensions of reality But it can arouse all and sometimes even more emotion than the reality For the trigger can be pulled by more than one stimulus The stimulus which originally pulled the trigger may have been a series of pictures in the mind aroused by printed or spoken words These pictures fade and are hard to keep steady their contours and their pulse fluctuate Gradually the process sets in of knowing what you feel without being entirely certain why you feel it The fading pictures are displaced by other pictures and then by names or symbols But the emotion goes on capable now of being aroused by the substituted images and names Even in severe thinking these substitutions take place for if a man is trying to compare two complicated situations he soon finds exhausting the attempt to hold both fully in mind in all their detail He employs a shorthand of names and signs and samples He has to do this if he is to advance at all because he cannot carry the whole baggage in every phrase through every step he takes But if he forgets that he has substituted and simplified he soon lapses into verbalism and begins to talk about names regardless of objects And then he has no way of knowing when the name divorced from its first thing is carrying on a misalliance with some other thing It is more difficult still to guard against changelings in casual politics For by what is known to psychologists as conditioned response an emotion is not attached merely to one idea There are no end of things which can arouse the emotion and no end of things which can satisfy it This is particularly true where the stimulus is only dimly and indirectly perceived and where the objective is likewise indirect For you can associate an emotion say fear first with something immediately dangerous then with the idea of that thing then with something similar to that idea and so on and on The whole structure of human culture is in one respect an elaboration of the stimuli and responses of which the original emotional capacities remain a fairly fixed center No doubt the quality of emotion has changed in the course of history but with nothing like the speed or elaboration that has characterized the conditioning of it People differ widely in their susceptibility to ideas There are some in whom the idea of a starving child in Russia is practically as vivid as a starving child within sight There are others who are almost incapable of being excited by a distant idea There are many gradations between And there are people who are insensitive to facts and aroused only by ideas But though the emotion is aroused by the idea we are unable to satisfy the emotion by acting ourselves upon the scene itself The idea of the starving Russian child evokes a desire to feed the child But the person so aroused cannot feed it He can only give money to an impersonal organization or to a personification which he calls mister Hoover His money does not reach that child It goes to a general pool from which a mass of children are fed And so just as the idea is second hand so are the effects of the action second hand The cognition is indirect the conation is indirect only the effect is immediate Of the three parts of the process the stimulus comes from somewhere out of sight the response reaches somewhere out of sight only the emotion exists entirely within the person Of the child s hunger he has only an idea of the child s relief he has only an idea but of his own desire to help he has a real experience It is the central fact of the business the emotion within himself which is first hand Within limits that vary the emotion is transferable both as regards stimulus and response Therefore if among a number of people possessing various tendencies to respond you can find a stimulus which will arouse the same emotion in many of them you can substitute it for the original stimuli If for example one man dislikes the League another hates mister Wilson and a third fears labor you may be able to unite them if you can find some symbol which is the antithesis of what they all hate Suppose that symbol is Americanism The first man may read it as meaning the preservation of American isolation or as he may call it independence the second as the rejection of a politician who clashes with his idea of what an American president should be the third as a call to resist revolution The symbol in itself signifies literally no one thing in particular but it can be associated with almost anything And because of that it can become the common bond of common feelings even though those feelings were originally attached to disparate ideas When political parties or newspapers declare for Americanism Progressivism Law and Order Justice Humanity they hope to amalgamate the emotion of conflicting factions which would surely divide if instead of these symbols they were invited to discuss a specific program For when a coalition around the symbol has been effected feeling flows toward conformity under the symbol rather than toward critical scrutiny of the measures It is I think convenient and technically correct to call multiple phrases like these symbolic They do not stand for specific ideas but for a sort of truce or junction between ideas They are like a strategic railroad center where many roads converge regardless of their ultimate origin or their ultimate destination But he who captures the symbols by which public feeling is for the moment contained controls by that much the approaches of public policy And as long as a particular symbol has the power of coalition ambitious factions will fight for possession Think for example of Lincoln s name or of Roosevelt s A leader or an interest that can make itself master of current symbols is master of the current situation There are limits of course Too violent abuse of the actualities which groups of people think the symbol represents or too great resistance in the name of that symbol to new purposes will so to speak burst the symbol In this manner during the year nineteen seventeen the imposing symbol of Holy Russia and the Little Father burst under the impact of suffering and defeat four The tremendous consequences of Russia s collapse were felt on all the fronts and among all the peoples They led directly to a striking experiment in the crystallization of a common opinion out of the varieties of opinion churned up by the war The Fourteen Points were addressed to all the governments allied enemy neutral and to all the peoples They were an attempt to knit together the chief imponderables of a world war Necessarily this was a new departure because this was the first great war in which all the deciding elements of mankind could be brought to think about the same ideas or at least about the same names for ideas simultaneously Without cable radio telegraph and daily press the experiment of the Fourteen Points would have been impossible It was an attempt to exploit the modern machinery of communication to start the return to a common consciousness throughout the world But first we must examine some of the circumstances as they presented themselves at the end of nineteen seventeen For in the form which the document finally assumed all these considerations are somehow represented During the summer and autumn a series of events had occurred which profoundly affected the temper of the people and the course of the war In July the Russians had made a last offensive had been disastrously beaten and the process of demoralization which led to the Bolshevik revolution of November had begun Somewhat earlier the French had suffered a severe and almost disastrous defeat in Champagne which produced mutinies in the army and a defeatist agitation among the civilians England was suffering from the effects of the submarine raids from the terrible losses of the Flanders battles and in November at Cambrai the British armies met a reverse that appalled the troops at the front and the leaders at home Extreme war weariness pervaded the whole of western Europe In effect the agony and disappointment had jarred loose men s concentration on the accepted version of the war Their interests were no longer held by the ordinary official pronouncements and their attention began to wander fixing now upon their own suffering now upon their party and class purposes now upon general resentments against the governments That more or less perfect organization of perception by official propaganda of interest and attention by the stimuli of hope fear and hatred which is called morale was by way of breaking down The minds of men everywhere began to search for new attachments that promised relief Suddenly they beheld a tremendous drama On the Eastern front there was a Christmas truce an end of slaughter an end of noise a promise of peace At Brest Litovsk the dream of all simple people had come to life it was possible to negotiate there was some other way to end the ordeal than by matching lives with the enemy Timidly but with rapt attention people began to turn to the East Why not they asked What is it all for Do the politicians know what they are doing Are we really fighting for what they say Is it possible perhaps to secure it without fighting Under the ban of the censorship little of this was allowed to show itself in print but when Lord Lansdowne spoke there was a response from the heart The earlier symbols of the war had become hackneyed and had lost their power to unify Beneath the surface a wide schism was opening up in each Allied country Something similar was happening in Central Europe There too the original impulse of the war was weakened the union sacree was broken The vertical cleavages along the battle front were cut across by horizontal divisions running in all kinds of unforeseeable ways The moral crisis of the war had arrived before the military decision was in sight All this President Wilson and his advisers realized They had not of course a perfect knowledge of the situation but what I have sketched they knew They knew also that the Allied Governments were bound by a series of engagements that in letter and in spirit ran counter to the popular conception of what the war was about The resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference were of course public property and the network of secret treaties had been published by the Bolsheviks in November of nineteen seventeen Footnote President Wilson stated at his conference with the Senators that he had never heard of these treaties until he reached Paris That statement is perplexing The Fourteen Points as the text shows could not have been formulated without a knowledge of the secret treaties The substance of those treaties was before the President when he and Colonel House prepared the final published text of the Fourteen Points Their terms were only vaguely known to the peoples but it was definitely believed that they did not comport with the idealistic slogan of self determination no annexations and no indemnities Popular questioning took the form of asking how many thousand English lives Alsace Lorraine or Dalmatia were worth how many French lives Poland or Mesopotamia were worth Nor was such questioning entirely unknown in America The whole Allied cause had been put on the defensive by the refusal to participate at Brest Litovsk Here was a highly sensitive state of mind which no competent leader could fail to consider The ideal response would have been joint action by the Allies That was found to be impossible when it was considered at the Interallied Conference of October But by December the pressure had become so great that mister George and mister Wilson were moved independently to make some response The form selected by the President was a statement of peace terms under fourteen heads The numbering of them was an artifice to secure precision and to create at once the impression that here was a business like document The idea of stating peace terms instead of war aims arose from the necessity of establishing a genuine alternative to the Brest Litovsk negotiations They were intended to compete for attention by substituting for the spectacle of Russo German parleys the much grander spectacle of a public world wide debate Having enlisted the interest of the world it was necessary to hold that interest unified and flexible for all the different possibilities which the situation contained The terms had to be such that the majority among the Allies would regard them as worth while They had to meet the national aspirations of each people and yet to limit those aspirations so that no one nation would regard itself as a catspaw for another The terms had to satisfy official interests so as not to provoke official disunion and yet they had to meet popular conceptions so as to prevent the spread of demoralization They had in short to preserve and confirm Allied unity in case the war was to go on But they had also to be the terms of a possible peace so that in case the German center and left were ripe for agitation they would have a text with which to smite the governing class The terms had therefore to push the Allied governors nearer to their people drive the German governors away from their people and establish a line of common understanding between the Allies the non official Germans and the subject peoples of Austria Hungary The Fourteen Points were a daring attempt to raise a standard to which almost everyone might repair If a sufficient number of the enemy people were ready there would be peace if not then the Allies would be better prepared to sustain the shock of war All these considerations entered into the making of the Fourteen Points No one man may have had them all in mind but all the men concerned had some of them in mind Against this background let us examine certain aspects of the document The first five points and the fourteenth deal with open diplomacy freedom of the seas equal trade opportunities reduction of armaments no imperialist annexation of colonies and the League of Nations They might be described as a statement of the popular generalizations in which everyone at that time professed to believe But number three is more specific It was aimed consciously and directly at the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference and was meant to relieve the German people of their fear of suffocation Number six is the first point dealing with a particular nation It was intended as a reply to Russian suspicion of the Allies and the eloquence of its promises was attuned to the drama of Brest Litovsk Number seven deals with Belgium and is as unqualified in form and purpose as was the conviction of practically the whole world including very large sections of Central Europe Over number eight we must pause It begins with an absolute demand for evacuation and restoration of French territory and then passes on to the question of Alsace Lorraine The phrasing of this clause most perfectly illustrates the character of a public statement which must condense a vast complex of interests in a few words And the wrong done to France by Prussia in eighteen seventy one in the matter of Alsace Lorraine which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years should be righted Every word here was chosen with meticulous care The wrong done should be righted why not say that Alsace Lorraine should be restored It was not said because it was not certain that all of the French at that time would fight on indefinitely for reannexation if they were offered a plebiscite and because it was even less certain whether the English and Italians would fight on The formula had therefore to cover both contingencies The word righted guaranteed satisfaction to France but did not read as a commitment to simple annexation But why speak of the wrong done by Prussia in eighteen seventy one The word Prussia was of course intended to remind the South Germans that Alsace Lorraine belonged not to them but to Prussia Why speak of peace unsettled for fifty years and why the use of eighteen seventy one In the first place what the French and the rest of the world remembered was eighteen seventy one That was the nodal point of their grievance But the formulators of the Fourteen Points knew that French officialdom planned for more than the Alsace Lorraine of eighteen seventy one The secret memoranda that had passed between the Czar s ministers and French officials in nineteen sixteen covered the annexation of the Saar Valley and some sort of dismemberment of the Rhineland It was planned to include the Saar Valley under the term Alsace Lorraine because it had been part of Alsace Lorraine in eighteen fourteen though it had been detached in eighteen fifteen and was no part of the territory at the close of the Franco Prussian war The official French formula for annexing the Saar was to subsume it under Alsace Lorraine meaning the Alsace Lorraine of eighteen fourteen eighteen fifteen By insistence on eighteen seventy one the President was really defining the ultimate boundary between Germany and France was adverting to the secret treaty and was casting it aside Number nine a little less subtly does the same thing in respect to Italy Clearly recognizable lines of nationality are exactly what the lines of the Treaty of London were not Those lines were partly strategic partly economic partly imperialistic partly ethnic The only part of them that could possibly procure allied sympathy was that which would recover the genuine Italia Irredenta All the rest as everyone who was informed knew merely delayed the impending Jugoslav revolt five It would be a mistake to suppose that the apparently unanimous enthusiasm which greeted the Fourteen Points represented agreement on a program Everyone seemed to find something that he liked and stressed this aspect and that detail But no one risked a discussion The phrases so pregnant with the underlying conflicts of the civilized world were accepted They stood for opposing ideas but they evoked a common emotion And to that extent they played a part in rallying the western peoples for the desperate ten months of war which they had still to endure As long as the Fourteen Points dealt with that hazy and happy future when the agony was to be over the real conflicts of interpretation were not made manifest They were plans for the settlement of a wholly invisible environment and because these plans inspired all groups each with its own private hope all hopes ran together as a public hope For harmonization as we saw in mister Hughes s speech is a hierarchy of symbols As you ascend the hierarchy in order to include more and more factions you may for a time preserve the emotional connection though you lose the intellectual But even the emotion becomes thinner As you go further away from experience you go higher into generalization or subtlety As you go up in the balloon you throw more and more concrete objects overboard and when you have reached the top with some phrase like the Rights of Humanity or the World Made Safe for Democracy you see far and wide but you see very little Yet the people whose emotions are entrained do not remain passive As the public appeal becomes more and more all things to all men as the emotion is stirred while the meaning is dispersed their very private meanings are given a universal application Whatever you want badly is the Rights of Humanity For the phrase ever more vacant capable of meaning almost anything soon comes to mean pretty nearly everything mister Wilson s phrases were understood in endlessly different ways in every corner of the earth No document negotiated and made of public record existed to correct the confusion Footnote The American interpretation of the fourteen points was explained to the allied statesmen just before the armistice And so when the day of settlement came everybody expected everything The European authors of the treaty had a large choice and they chose to realize those expectations which were held by those of their countrymen who wielded the most power at home They came down the hierarchy from the Rights of Humanity to the Rights of France Britain and Italy They did not abandon the use of symbols They abandoned only those which after the war had no permanent roots in the imagination of their constituents They preserved the unity of France by the use of symbolism but they would not risk anything for the unity of Europe The symbol France was deeply attached the symbol Europe had only a recent history Nevertheless the distinction between an omnibus like Europe and a symbol like France is not sharp The history of states and empires reveals times when the scope of the unifying idea increases and also times when it shrinks One cannot say that men have moved consistently from smaller loyalties to larger ones because the facts will not bear out the claim The Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire bellied out further than those national unifications in the Nineteenth Century from which believers in a World State argue by analogy Nevertheless it is probably true that the real integration has increased regardless of the temporary inflation and deflation of empires six Such a real integration has undoubtedly occurred in American history In the decade before seventeen eighty nine most men it seems felt that their state and their community were real but that the confederation of states was unreal The idea of their state its flag its most conspicuous leaders or whatever it was that represented Massachusetts or Virginia were genuine symbols That is to say they were fed by actual experiences from childhood occupation residence and the like The span of men s experience had rarely traversed the imaginary boundaries of their states The word Virginian was related to pretty nearly everything that most Virginians had ever known or felt It was the most extensive political idea which had genuine contact with their experience Their experience not their needs For their needs arose out of their real environment which in those days was at least as large as the thirteen colonies They needed a common defense They needed a financial and economic regime as extensive as the Confederation But as long as the pseudo environment of the state encompassed them the state symbols exhausted their political interest An interstate idea like the Confederation represented a powerless abstraction It was an omnibus rather than a symbol and the harmony among divergent groups which the omnibus creates is transient I have said that the idea of confederation was a powerless abstraction Yet the need of unity existed in the decade before the Constitution was adopted The need existed in the sense that affairs were askew unless the need of unity was taken into account Gradually certain classes in each colony began to break through the state experience Their personal interests led across the state lines to interstate experiences and gradually there was constructed in their minds a picture of the American environment which was truly national in scope For them the idea of federation became a true symbol and ceased to be an omnibus The most imaginative of these men was Alexander Hamilton It happened that he had no primitive attachment to any one state for he was born in the West Indies and had from the very beginning of his active life been associated with the common interests of all the states Thus to most men of the time the question of whether the capital should be in Virginia or in Philadelphia was of enormous importance because they were locally minded To Hamilton this question was of no emotional consequence what he wanted was the assumption of the state debts because they would further nationalize the proposed union So he gladly traded the site of the capitol for two necessary votes from men who represented the Potomac district To Hamilton the Union was a symbol that represented all his interests and his whole experience to White and Lee from the Potomac the symbol of their province was the highest political entity they served and they served it though they hated to pay the price They agreed says Jefferson to change their votes White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive Footnote Works Vol IX p eighty seven Cited by Beard Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy p one hundred seventy two In the crystallizing of a common will there is always an Alexander Hamilton at work CHAPTER XIV YES OR NO one Symbols are often so useful and so mysteriously powerful that the word itself exhales a magical glamor In thinking about symbols it is tempting to treat them as if they possessed independent energy Yet no end of symbols which once provoked ecstasy have quite ceased to affect anybody The museums and the books of folklore are full of dead emblems and incantations since there is no power in the symbol except that which it acquires by association in the human mind The symbols that have lost their power and the symbols incessantly suggested which fail to take root remind us that if we were patient enough to study in detail the circulation of a symbol we should behold an entirely secular history In the Hughes campaign speech in the Fourteen Points in Hamilton s project symbols are employed But they are employed by somebody at a particular moment The words themselves do not crystallize random feeling The words must be spoken by people who are strategically placed and they must be spoken at the opportune moment Otherwise they are mere wind The symbols must be earmarked For in themselves they mean nothing and the choice of possible symbols is always so great that we should like the donkey who stood equidistant between two bales of hay perish from sheer indecision among the symbols that compete for our attention Here for example are the reasons for their vote as stated by certain private citizens to a newspaper just before the election of nineteen twenty For Harding The patriotic men and women of to day who cast their ballots for Harding and Coolidge will be held by posterity to have signed our Second Declaration of Independence mister Wilmot inventor He will see to it that the United States does not enter into entangling alliances Washington as a city will benefit by changing the control of the government from the Democrats to the Republicans mister Clarence salesman For Cox The people of the United States realize that it is our duty pledged on the fields of France to join the League of Nations We must shoulder our share of the burden of enforcing peace throughout the world Miss Marie stenographer We should lose our own respect and the respect of other nations were we to refuse to enter the League of Nations in obtaining international peace mister Spencer statistician The two sets of phrases are equally noble equally true and almost reversible Would Clarence and Wilmot have admitted for an instant that they intended to default in our duty pledged on the fields of France or that they did not desire international peace Certainly not Would Marie and Spencer have admitted that they were in favor of entangling alliances or the surrender of American independence They would have argued with you that the League was as President Wilson called it a disentangling alliance as well as a Declaration of Independence for all the world plus a Monroe Doctrine for the planet two Since the offering of symbols is so generous and the meaning that can be imputed is so elastic how does any particular symbol take root in any particular person s mind It is planted there by another human being whom we recognize as authoritative If it is planted deeply enough it may be that later we shall call the person authoritative who waves that symbol at us But in the first instance symbols are made congenial and important because they are introduced to us by congenial and important people For we are not born out of an egg at the age of eighteen with a realistic imagination we are still as mister Shaw recalls in the era of Burge and Lubin where in infancy we are dependent upon older beings for our contacts And so we make our connections with the outer world through certain beloved and authoritative persons They are the first bridge to the invisible world And though we may gradually master for ourselves many phases of that larger environment there always remains a vaster one that is unknown To that we still relate ourselves through authorities Where all the facts are out of sight a true report and a plausible error read alike sound alike feel alike Except on a few subjects where our own knowledge is great we cannot choose between true and false accounts So we choose between trustworthy and untrustworthy reporters Footnote See an interesting rather quaint old book George Cornewall Lewis An Essay on the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion Theoretically we ought to choose the most expert on each subject But the choice of the expert though a good deal easier than the choice of truth is still too difficult and often impracticable The experts themselves are not in the least certain who among them is the most expert And at that the expert even when we can identify him is likely as not too busy to be consulted or impossible to get at But there are people whom we can identify easily enough because they are the people who are at the head of affairs Parents teachers and masterful friends are the first people of this sort we encounter Into the difficult question of why children trust one parent rather than another the history teacher rather than the Sunday school teacher we need not try to enter Nor how trust gradually spreads through a newspaper or an acquaintance who is interested in public affairs to public personages The literature of psychoanalysis is rich in suggestive hypothesis At any rate we do find ourselves trusting certain people who constitute our means of junction with pretty nearly the whole realm of unknown things Strangely enough this fact is sometimes regarded as inherently undignified as evidence of our sheep like ape like nature But complete independence in the universe is simply unthinkable If we could not take practically everything for granted we should spend our lives in utter triviality The nearest thing to a wholly independent adult is a hermit and the range of a hermit s action is very short Acting entirely for himself he can act only within a tiny radius and for simple ends If he has time to think great thoughts we can be certain that he has accepted without question before he went in for being a hermit a whole repertory of painfully acquired information about how to keep warm and how to keep from being hungry and also about what the great questions are On all but a very few matters for short stretches in our lives the utmost independence that we can exercise is to multiply the authorities to whom we give a friendly hearing As congenital amateurs our quest for truth consists in stirring up the experts and forcing them to answer any heresy that has the accent of conviction In such a debate we can often judge who has won the dialectical victory but we are virtually defenseless against a false premise that none of the debaters has challenged or a neglected aspect that none of them has brought into the argument We shall see later how the democratic theory proceeds on the opposite assumption and assumes for the purposes of government an unlimited supply of self sufficient individuals The people on whom we depend for contact with the outer world are those who seem to be running it Footnote Cf Bryce Modern Democracies Vol II pp five hundred forty four five hundred forty five They may be running only a very small part of the world The nurse feeds the child bathes it and puts it to bed That does not constitute the nurse an authority on physics zoology and the Higher Criticism mister Smith runs or at least hires the man who runs the factory That does not make him an authority on the Constitution of the United States nor on the effects \of the Fordney tariff mister Smoot runs the Republican party in the State of Utah That in itself does not prove he is the best man to consult about taxation But the nurse may nevertheless determine for a while what zoology the child shall learn mister Smith will have much to say on what the Constitution shall mean to his wife his secretary and perhaps even to his parson and who shall define the limits of Senator Smoot s authority The priest the lord of the manor the captains and the kings the party leaders the merchant the boss however these men are chosen whether by birth inheritance conquest or election they and their organized following administer human affairs They are the officers and although the same man may be field marshal at home second lieutenant at the office and scrub private in politics although in many institutions the hierarchy of rank is vague or concealed yet in every institution that requires the cooperation of many persons some such hierarchy exists Footnote Cf M Ostrogorski Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties passim R Michels Political Parties passim and Bryce Modern Democracies particularly Chap LXXV also Ross Principles of Sociology Chaps XXII XXIV In American politics we call it a machine or the organization three There are a number of important distinctions between the members of the machine and the rank and file The leaders the steering committee and the inner circle are in direct contact with their environment They may to be sure have a very limited notion of what they ought to define as the environment but they are not dealing almost wholly with abstractions There are particular men they hope to see elected particular balance sheets they wish to see improved concrete objectives that must be attained I do not mean that they escape the human propensity to stereotyped vision Their stereotypes often make them absurd routineers But whatever their limitations the chiefs are in actual contact with some crucial part of that larger environment They decide They give orders They bargain And something definite perhaps not at all what they imagined actually happens Their subordinates are not tied to them by a common conviction That is to say the lesser members of a machine do not dispose their loyalty according to independent judgment about the wisdom of the leaders In the hierarchy each is dependent upon a superior and is in turn superior to some class of his dependents What holds the machine together is a system of privileges These may vary according to the opportunities and the tastes of those who seek them from nepotism and patronage in all their aspects to clannishness hero worship or a fixed idea They vary from military rank in armies through land and services in a feudal system to jobs and publicity in a modern democracy That is why you can breakup a particular machine by abolishing its privileges But the machine in every coherent group is I believe certain to reappear For privilege is entirely relative and uniformity is impossible Imagine the most absolute communism of which your mind is capable where no one possessed any object that everyone else did not possess and still if the communist group had to take any action whatever the mere pleasure of being the friend of the man who was going to make the speech that secured the most votes would I am convinced be enough to crystallize an organization of insiders around him It is not necessary then to invent a collective intelligence in order to explain why the judgments of a group are usually more coherent and often more true to form than the remarks of the man in the street One mind or a few can pursue a train of thought but a group trying to think in concert can as a group do little more than assent or dissent The members of a hierarchy can have a corporate tradition As apprentices they learn the trade from the masters who in turn learned it when they were apprentices and in any enduring society the change of personnel within the governing hierarchies is slow enough to permit the transmission of certain great stereotypes and patterns of behavior From father to son from prelate to novice from veteran to cadet certain ways of seeing and doing are taught These ways become familiar and are recognized as such by the mass of outsiders four Distance alone lends enchantment to the view that masses of human beings ever cooperate in any complex affair without a central machine managed by a very few people No one says Bryce Footnote Op cit Vol II p five hundred forty two can have had some years experience of the conduct of affairs in a legislature or an administration without observing how extremely small is the number of persons by whom the world is governed He is referring of course to affairs of state To be sure if you consider all the affairs of mankind the number of people who govern is considerable but if you take any particular institution be it a legislature a party a trade union a nationalist movement a factory or a club the number of those who govern is a very small percentage of those who are theoretically supposed to govern Landslides can turn one machine out and put another in revolutions sometimes abolish a particular machine altogether The democratic revolution set up two alternating machines each of which in the course of a few years reaps the advantage from the mistakes of the other But nowhere does the machine disappear Nowhere is the idyllic theory of democracy realized Certainly not in trades unions nor in socialist parties nor in communist governments There is an inner circle surrounded by concentric circles which fade out gradually into the disinterested or uninterested rank and file Democrats have never come to terms with this commonplace of group life They have invariably regarded it as perverse For there are two visions of democracy one presupposes the self sufficient individual the other an Oversoul regulating everything Of the two the Oversoul has some advantage because it does at least recognize that the mass makes decisions that are not spontaneously born in the breast of every member But the Oversoul as presiding genius in corporate behavior is a superfluous mystery if we fix our attention upon the machine The machine is a quite prosaic reality It consists of human beings who wear clothes and live in houses who can be named and described They perform all the duties usually assigned to the Oversoul five The reason for the machine is not the perversity of human nature It is that out of the private notions of any group no common idea emerges by itself For the number of ways is limited in which a multitude of people can act directly upon a situation beyond their reach Some of them can migrate in one form or another they can strike or boycott they can applaud or hiss They can by these means occasionally resist what they do not like or coerce those who obstruct what they desire But by mass action nothing can be constructed devised negotiated or administered A public as such without an organized hierarchy around which it can gather may refuse to buy if the prices are too high or refuse to work if wages are too low A trade union can by mass action in a strike break an opposition so that the union officials can negotiate an agreement It may win for example the right to joint control But it cannot exercise the right except through an organization A nation can clamor for war but when it goes to war it must put itself under orders from a general staff The limit of direct action is for all practical purposes the power to say Yes or No on an issue presented to the mass Footnote Cf James Some Problems of Philosophy p two hundred twenty seven But for most of our emergencies fractional solutions are impossible Seldom can we act fractionally Cf Lowell Public Opinion and Popular Government pp ninety one ninety two For only in the very simplest cases does an issue present itself in the same form spontaneously and approximately at the same time to all the members of a public There are unorganized strikes and boycotts not merely industrial ones where the grievance is so plain that virtually without leadership the same reaction takes place in many people But even in these rudimentary cases there are persons who know what they want to do more quickly than the rest and who become impromptu ringleaders Where they do not appear a crowd will mill about aimlessly beset by all its private aims or stand by fatalistically as did a crowd of fifty persons the other day and watch a man commit suicide For what we make out of most of the impressions that come to us from the invisible world is a kind of pantomime played out in revery The number of times is small that we consciously decide anything about events beyond our sight and each man s opinion of what he could accomplish if he tried is slight There is rarely a practical issue and therefore no great habit of decision This would be more evident were it not that most information when it reaches us carries with it an aura of suggestion as to how we ought to feel about the news That suggestion we need and if we do not find it in the news we turn to the editorials or to a trusted adviser The revery if we feel ourselves implicated is uncomfortable until we know where we stand that is until the facts have been formulated so that we can feel Yes or No in regard to them When a number of people all say Yes they may have all kinds of reasons for saying it They generally do For the pictures in their minds are as we have already noted varied in subtle and intimate ways But this subtlety remains within their minds it becomes represented publicly by a number of symbolic phrases which carry the individual emotion after evacuating most of the intention The hierarchy or if it is a contest then the two hierarchies associate the symbols with a definite action a vote of Yes or No an attitude pro or con Then Smith who was against the League and Jones who was against Article X and Brown who was against mister Wilson and all his works each for his own reason all in the name of more or less the same symbolic phrase register a vote against the Democrats by voting for the Republicans A common will has been expressed A concrete choice had to be presented the choice had to be connected by the transfer of interest through the symbols with individual opinion The professional politicians learned this long before the democratic philosophers And so they organized the caucus the nominating convention and the steering committee as the means of formulating a definite choice Everyone who wishes to accomplish anything that requires the cooperation of a large number of people follows their example Sometimes it is done rather brutally as when the Peace Conference reduced itself to the Council of Ten and the Council of Ten to the Big Three or Four and wrote a treaty which the minor allies their own constituents and the enemy were permitted to take or leave More consultation than that is generally possible and desirable But the essential fact remains that a small number of heads present a choice to a large group six The abuses of the steering committee have led to various proposals such as the initiative referendum and direct primary But these merely postponed or obscured the need for a machine by complicating the elections or as H G Wells once said with scrupulous accuracy the selections For no amount of balloting can obviate the need of creating an issue be it a measure or a candidate on which the voters can say Yes or No There is in fact no such thing as direct legislation For what happens where it is supposed to exist The citizen goes to the polls receives a ballot on which a number of measures are printed almost always in abbreviated form and if he says anything at all he says Yes or No The most brilliant amendment in the world may occur to him He votes Yes or No on that bill and no other You have to commit violence against the English language to call that legislation I do not argue of course that there are no benefits whatever you call the process I think that for certain kinds of issues there are distinct benefits But the necessary simplicity of any mass decision is a very important fact in view of the inevitable complexity of the world in which those decisions operate The most complicated form of voting that anyone proposes is I suppose the preferential ballot Among a number of candidates presented the voter under that system instead of saying yes to one candidate and no to all the others states the order of his choice But even here immensely more flexible though it is the action of the mass depends upon the quality of the choices presented Footnote Cf H J Laski Foundations of Sovereignty p two hundred twenty four proportional representation by leading as it seems to lead to the group system may deprive the electors of their choice of leaders The group system undoubtedly tends as mister Laski says to make the selection of the executive more indirect but there is no doubt also that it tends to produce legislative assemblies in which currents of opinion are more fully represented Whether that is good or bad cannot be determined a priori But one can say that successful cooperation and responsibility in a more accurately representative assembly require a higher organization of political intelligence and political habit than in a rigid two party house It is a more complex political form and may therefore work less well And those choices are presented by the energetic coteries who hustle about with petitions and round up the delegates The Many can elect after the Few have nominated CHAPTER XV LEADERS AND THE RANK AND FILE I BECAUSE of their transcendent practical importance no successful leader has ever been too busy to cultivate the symbols which organize his following What privileges do within the hierarchy symbols do for the rank and file They conserve unity From the totem pole to the national flag from the wooden idol to God the Invisible King from the magic word to some diluted version of Adam Smith or Bentham symbols have been cherished by leaders many of whom were themselves unbelievers because they were focal points where differences merged The detached observer may scorn the star spangled ritual which hedges the symbol perhaps as much as the king who told himself that Paris was worth a few masses But the leader knows by experience that only when symbols have done their work is there a handle he can use to move a crowd In the symbol emotion is discharged at a common target and the idiosyncrasy of real ideas blotted out No wonder he hates what he calls destructive criticism sometimes called by free spirits the elimination of buncombe Above all things says Bagehot our royalty is to be reverenced and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it Footnote The English Constitution p one hundred twenty seven D Appleton Company nineteen fourteen For poking about with clear definitions and candid statements serves all high purposes known to man except the easy conservation of a common will Poking about as every responsible leader suspects tends to break the transference of emotion from the individual mind to the institutional symbol And the first result of that is as he rightly says a chaos of individualism and warring sects The disintegration of a symbol like Holy Russia or the Iron Diaz is always the beginning of a long upheaval These great symbols possess by transference all the minute and detailed loyalties of an ancient and stereotyped society They evoke the feeling that each individual has for the landscape the furniture the faces the memories that are his first and in a static society his only reality That core of images and devotions without which he is unthinkable to himself is nationality The great symbols take up these devotions and can arouse them without calling forth the primitive images The lesser symbols of public debate the more casual chatter of politics are always referred back to these proto symbols and if possible associated with them The question of a proper fare on a municipal subway is symbolized as an issue between the People and the Interests and then the People is inserted in the symbol American so that finally in the heat of a campaign an eight cent fare becomes unAmerican The Revolutionary fathers died to prevent it Lincoln suffered that it might not come to pass resistance to it was implied in the death of those who sleep in France Because of its power to siphon emotion out of distinct ideas the symbol is both a mechanism of solidarity and a mechanism of exploitation It enables people to work for a common end but just because the few who are strategically placed must choose the concrete objectives the symbol is also an instrument by which a few can fatten on many deflect criticism and seduce men into facing agony for objects they do not understand Many aspects of our subjection to symbols are not flattering if we choose to think of ourselves as realistic self sufficient and self governing personalities Yet it is impossible to conclude that symbols are altogether instruments of the devil In the realm of science and contemplation they are undoubtedly the tempter himself But in the world of action they may be beneficent and are sometimes a necessity The necessity is often imagined the peril manufactured But when quick results are imperative the manipulation of masses through symbols may be the only quick way of having a critical thing done It is often more important to act than to understand It is sometimes true that the action would fail if everyone understood it There are many affairs which cannot wait for a referendum or endure publicity and there are times during war for example when a nation an army and even its commanders must trust strategy to a very few minds when two conflicting opinions though one happens to be right are more perilous than one opinion which is wrong The wrong opinion may have bad results but the two opinions may entail disaster by dissolving unity Footnote Captain Peter S Wright Assistant Secretary of the Supreme War Council At the Supreme War Council is well worth careful reading on secrecy and unity of command even though in respect to the allied leaders he wages a passionate polemic Thus Foch and Sir Henry Wilson who foresaw the impending disaster to Cough s army as a consequence of the divided and scattered reserves nevertheless kept their opinions well within a small circle knowing that even the risk of a smashing defeat was less certainly destructive than would have been an excited debate in the newspapers For what matters most under the kind of tension which prevailed in March nineteen eighteen is less the rightness of a particular move than the unbroken expectation as to the source of command Had Foch gone to the people he might have won the debate but long before he could have won it the armies which he was to command would have dissolved For the spectacle of a row on Olympus is diverting and destructive But so also is a conspiracy of silence Says Captain Wright It is in the High Command and not in the line that the art of camouflage is most practiced and reaches to highest flights All chiefs everywhere are now kept painted by the busy work of numberless publicists so as to be mistaken for Napoleons at a distance It becomes almost impossible to displace these Napoleons whatever their incompetence because of the enormous public support created by hiding or glossing failure and exaggerating or inventing success But the most insidious and worst effect of this so highly organized falsity is on the generals themselves modest and patriotic as they mostly are and as most men must be to take up and follow the noble profession of arms they themselves are ultimately affected by these universal illusions and reading it every morning in the paper they also grow persuaded they are thunderbolts of war and infallible however much they fail and that their maintenance in command is an end so sacred that it justifies the use of any means These various conditions of which this great deceit is the greatest at last emancipate all General Staffs from all control They no longer live for the nation the nation lives or rather dies for them Victory or defeat ceases to be the prime interest What matters to these semi sovereign corporations is whether dear old Willie or poor old Harry is going to be at their head or the Chantilly party prevail over the Boulevard des Invalides party Footnote Op cit pp ninety eight one hundred one one hundred five Yet Captain Wright who can be so eloquent and so discerning about the dangers of silence is forced nevertheless to approve the silence of Foch in not publicly destroying the illusions There is here a complicated paradox arising as we shall see more fully later on because the traditional democratic view of life is conceived not for emergencies and dangers but for tranquillity and harmony And so where masses of people must cooperate in an uncertain and eruptive environment it is usually necessary to secure unity and flexibility without real consent The symbol does that It obscures personal intention neutralizes discrimination and obfuscates individual purpose It immobilizes personality yet at the same time it enormously sharpens the intention of the group and welds that group as nothing else in a crisis can weld it to purposeful action It renders the mass mobile though it immobilizes personality The symbol is the instrument by which in the short run the mass escapes from its own inertia the inertia of indecision or the inertia of headlong movement and is rendered capable of being led along the zigzag of a complex situation two But in the longer run the give and take increases between the leaders and the led The word most often used to describe the state of mind in the rank and file about its leaders is morale That is said to be good when the individuals do the part allotted to them with all their energy when each man s whole strength is evoked by the command from above It follows that every leader must plan his policy with this in mind He must consider his decision not only on the merits but also in its effect on any part of his following whose continued support he requires If he is a general planning an attack he knows that his organized military units will scatter into mobs if the percentage of casualties rises too high In the Great War previous calculations were upset to an extraordinary degree for out of every nine men who went to France five became casualties Footnote Op cit p thirty seven Figures taken by Captain Wright from the statistical abstract of the war in the Archives of the War Office The figures refer apparently to the English losses alone possibly to the English and French The limit of endurance was far greater than anyone had supposed But there was a limit somewhere And so partly because of its effect on the enemy but also in great measure because of its effect on the troops and their families no command in this war dared to publish a candid statement of its losses In France the casualty lists were never published In England America and Germany publication of the losses of a big battle were spread out over long periods so as to destroy a unified impression of the total Only the insiders knew until long afterwards what the Somme had cost or the Flanders battles Footnote Op cit p thirty four the Somme cost nearly five hundred thousand casualties the Arras and Flanders offensives of nineteen seventeen cost six hundred fifty thousand British casualties and Ludendorff undoubtedly had a very much more accurate idea of these casualties than any private person in London Paris or Chicago All the leaders in every camp did their best to limit the amount of actual war which any one soldier or civilian could vividly conceive But of course among old veterans like the French troops of nineteen seventeen a great deal more is known about war than ever reaches the public Such an army begins to judge its commanders in terms of its own suffering And then when another extravagant promise of victory turns out to be the customary bloody defeat you may find that a mutiny breaks out over some comparatively minor blunder Footnote The Allies suffered many bloodier defeats than that on the Chemin des Dames like Nivelle s offensive of nineteen seventeen because it is a cumulative blunder Revolutions and mutinies generally follow a small sample of a big series of evils Footnote Cf Pierrefeu s account op cit on the causes of the Soissons mutinies and the method adopted by Petain to deal with them Vol I Part III et seq The incidence of policy determines the relation between leader and following If those whom he needs in his plan are remote from the place where the action takes place if the results are hidden or postponed if the individual obligations are indirect or not yet due above all if assent is an exercise of some pleasurable emotion the leader is likely to have a free hand Those programs are immediately most popular like prohibition among teetotalers which do not at once impinge upon the private habits of the followers That is one great reason why governments have such a free hand in foreign affairs Most of the frictions between two states involve a series of obscure and long winded contentions occasionally on the frontier but far more often in regions about which school geographies have supplied no precise ideas In Czechoslovakia America is regarded as the Liberator in American newspaper paragraphs and musical comedy in American conversation by and large it has never been finally settled whether the country we liberated is Czechoslavia or Jugoslovakia In foreign affairs the incidence of policy is for a very long time confined to an unseen environment Nothing that happens out there is felt to be wholly real And so because in the ante bellum period nobody has to fight and nobody has to pay governments go along according to their lights without much reference to their people In local affairs the cost of a policy is more easily visible And therefore all but the most exceptional leaders prefer policies in which the costs are as far as possible indirect They do not like direct taxation They do not like to pay as they go They like long term debts They like to have the voters believe that the foreigner will pay They have always been compelled to calculate prosperity in terms of the producer rather than in terms of the consumer because the incidence on the consumer is distributed over so many trivial items Labor leaders have always preferred an increase of money wages to a decrease in prices There has always been more popular interest in the profits of millionaires which are visible but comparatively unimportant than in the wastes of the industrial system which are huge but elusive A legislature dealing with a shortage of houses such as exists when this is written illustrates this rule first by doing nothing to increase the number of houses second by smiting the greedy landlord on the hip third by investigating the profiteering builders and working men For a constructive policy deals with remote and uninteresting factors while a greedy landlord or a profiteering plumber is visible and immediate But while people will readily believe that in an unimagined future and in unseen places a certain policy will benefit them the actual working out of policy follows a different logic from their opinions A nation may be induced to believe that jacking up the freight rates will make the railroads prosperous But that belief will not make the roads prosperous if the impact of those rates on farmers and shippers is such as to produce a commodity price beyond what the consumer can pay Whether the consumer will pay the price depends not upon whether he nodded his head nine months previously at the proposal to raise rates and save business but on whether he now wants a new hat or a new automobile enough to pay for them three Leaders often pretend that they have merely uncovered a program which existed in the minds of their public When they believe it they are usually deceiving themselves Programs do not invent themselves synchronously in a multitude of minds That is not because a multitude of minds is necessarily inferior to that of the leaders but because thought is the function of an organism and a mass is not an organism This fact is obscured because the mass is constantly exposed to suggestion It reads not the news but the news with an aura of suggestion about it indicating the line of action to be taken It hears reports not objective as the facts are but already stereotyped to a certain pattern of behavior Thus the ostensible leader often finds that the real leader is a powerful newspaper proprietor But if as in a laboratory one could remove all suggestion and leading from the experience of a multitude one would I think find something like this A mass exposed to the same stimuli would develop responses that could theoretically be charted in a polygon of error There would be a certain group that felt sufficiently alike to be classified together There would be variants of feeling at both ends These classifications would tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications made their reactions vocal That is to say when the vague feelings of those who felt vaguely had been put into words they would know more definitely what they felt and would then feel it more definitely Leaders in touch with popular feeling are quickly conscious of these reactions They know that high prices are pressing upon the mass or that certain classes of individuals are becoming unpopular or that feeling towards another nation is friendly or hostile But always barring the effect of suggestion which is merely the assumption of leadership by the reporter there would be nothing in the feeling of the mass that fatally determined the choice of any particular policy All that the feeling of the mass demands is that policy as it is developed and exposed shall be if not logically then by analogy and association connected with the original feeling So when a new policy is to be launched there is a preliminary bid for community of feeling as in Mark Antony s speech to the followers of Brutus Footnote Excellently analyzed in Martin The Behavior of Crowds pp one hundred thirty one hundred thirty two In the first phase the leader vocalizes the prevalent opinion of the mass He identifies himself with the familiar attitudes of his audience sometimes by telling a good story sometimes by brandishing his patriotism often by pinching a grievance Finding that he is trustworthy the multitude milling hither and thither may turn in towards him He will then be expected to set forth a plan of campaign But he will not find that plan in the slogans which convey the feelings of the mass It will not even always be indicated by them Where the incidence of policy is remote all that is essential is that the program shall be verbally and emotionally connected at the start with what has become vocal in the multitude Trusted men in a familiar role subscribing to the accepted symbols can go a very long way on their own initiative without explaining the substance of their programs But wise leaders are not content to do that Provided they think publicity will not strengthen opposition too much and that debate will not delay action too long they seek a certain measure of consent They take if not the whole mass then the subordinates of the hierarchy sufficiently into their confidence to prepare them for what might happen and to make them feel that they have freely willed the result But however sincere the leader may be there is always when the facts are very complicated a certain amount of illusion in these consultations For it is impossible that all the contingencies shall be as vivid to the whole public as they are to the more experienced and the more imaginative A fairly large percentage are bound to agree without having taken the time or without possessing the background for appreciating the choices which the leader presents to them No one however can ask for more And only theorists do If we have had our day in court if what we had to say was heard and then if what is done comes out well most of us do not stop to consider how much our opinion affected the business in hand And therefore if the established powers are sensitive and well informed if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction no matter how slowly they proceed provided they are seen to be proceeding they have little to fear It takes stupendous and persistent blundering plus almost infinite tactlessness to start a revolution from below Palace revolutions interdepartmental revolutions are a different matter So too is demagogy That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary and if indulged too often unsanitary He therefore sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer But all leaders are not statesmen all leaders hate to resign and most leaders find it hard to believe that bad as things are the other fellow would not make them worse They do not passively wait for the public to feel the incidence of policy because the incidence of that discovery is generally upon their own heads They are therefore intermittently engaged in mending their fences and consolidating their position The mending of fences consists in offering an occasional scapegoat in redressing a minor grievance affecting a powerful individual or faction rearranging certain jobs placating a group of people who want an arsenal in their home town or a law to stop somebody s vices Study the daily activity of any public official who depends on election and you can enlarge this list There are Congressmen elected year after year who never think of dissipating their energy on public affairs They prefer to do a little service for a lot of people on a lot of little subjects rather than to engage in trying to do a big service out there in the void But the number of people to whom any organization can be a successful valet is limited and shrewd politicians take care to attend either the influential or somebody so blatantly uninfluential that to pay any attention to him is a mark of sensational magnanimity The far greater number who cannot be held by favors the anonymous multitude receive propaganda The established leaders of any organization have great natural advantages They are believed to have better sources of information The books and papers are in their offices They took part in the important conferences They met the important people They have responsibility It is therefore easier for them to secure attention and to speak in a convincing tone But also they have a very great deal of control over the access to the facts Every official is in some degree a censor And since no one can suppress information either by concealing it or forgetting to mention it without some notion of what he wishes the public to know every leader is in some degree a propagandist Strategically placed and compelled often to choose even at the best between the equally cogent though conflicting ideals of safety for the institution and candor to his public the official finds himself deciding more and more consciously what facts in what setting in what guise he shall permit the public to know four That the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no one I think denies The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough The creation of consent is not a new art It is a very old one which was supposed to have died out with the appearance of democracy But it has not died out It has in fact improved enormously in technic because it is now based on analysis rather than on rule of thumb And so as a result of psychological research coupled with the modern means of communication the practice of democracy has turned a corner A revolution is taking place infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power Within the life of the generation now in control of affairs persuasion has become a self conscious art and a regular organ of popular government None of us begins to understand the consequences but it is no daring prophecy to say that the knowledge of how to create consent will alter every political calculation and modify every political premise Under the impact of propaganda not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone the old constants of our thinking have become variables It is no longer possible for example to believe in the original dogma of democracy that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self deception and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition conscience or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach PART VI THE IMAGE OF DEMOCRACY I confess that in America I saw more than America I sought the image of democracy itself Alexis de Tocqueville CHAPTER sixteen THE SELF CENTERED MAN seventeen THE SELF CONTAINED COMMUNITY eighteen THE ROLE OF FORCE PATRONAGE AND PRIVILEGE nineteen THE OLD IMAGE IN A NEW FORM GUILD SOCIALISM twenty A NEW IMAGE CHAPTER XVI THE SELF CENTERED MAN I SINCE Public Opinion is supposed to be the prime mover in democracies one might reasonably expect to find a vast literature One does not find it There are excellent books on government and parties that is on the machinery which in theory registers public opinions after they are formed But on the sources from which these public opinions arise on the processes by which they are derived there is relatively little The existence of a force called Public Opinion is in the main taken for granted and American political writers have been most interested either in finding out how to make government express the common will or in how to prevent the common will from subverting the purposes for which they believe the government exists According to their traditions they have wished either to tame opinion or to obey it Thus the editor of a notable series of text books writes that the most difficult and the most momentous question of government is how to transmit the force of individual opinion into public action Footnote Albert Bushnell Hart in the Introductory note to A Lawrence Lowell s Public Opinion and Popular Government But surely there is a still more momentous question the question of how to validate our private versions of the political scene There is as I shall try to indicate further on the prospect of radical improvement by the development of principles already in operation But this development will depend on how well we learn to use knowledge of the way opinions are put together to watch over our own opinions when they are being put together For casual opinion being the product of partial contact of tradition and personal interests cannot in the nature of things take kindly to a method of political thought which is based on exact record measurement analysis and comparison Just those qualities of the mind which determine what shall seem interesting important familiar personal and dramatic are the qualities which in the first instance realistic opinion frustrates Therefore unless there is in the community at large a growing conviction that prejudice and intuition are not enough the working out of realistic opinion which takes time money labor conscious effort patience and equanimity will not find enough support That conviction grows as self criticism increases and makes us conscious of buncombe contemptuous of ourselves when we employ it and on guard to detect it Without an ingrained habit of analyzing opinion when we read talk and decide most of us would hardly suspect the need of better ideas nor be interested in them when they appear nor be able to prevent the new technic of political intelligence from being manipulated Yet democracies if we are to judge by the oldest and most powerful of them have made a mystery out of public opinion There have been skilled organizers of opinion who understood the mystery well enough to create majorities on election day But these organizers have been regarded by political science as low fellows or as problems not as possessors of the most effective knowledge there was on how to create and operate public opinion The tendency of the people who have voiced the ideas of democracy even when they have not managed its action the tendency of students orators editors has been to look upon Public Opinion as men in other societies looked upon the uncanny forces to which they ascribed the last word in the direction of events For in almost every political theory there is an inscrutable element which in the heyday of that theory goes unexamined Behind the appearances there is a Fate there are Guardian Spirits or Mandates to a Chosen People a Divine Monarchy a Vice Regent of Heaven or a Class of the Better Born The more obvious angels demons and kings are gone out of democratic thinking but the need for believing that there are reserve powers of guidance persists It persisted for those thinkers of the Eighteenth Century who designed the matrix of democracy They had a pale god but warm hearts and in the doctrine of popular sovereignty they found the answer to their need of an infallible origin for the new social order There was the mystery and only enemies of the people touched it with profane and curious hands two They did not remove the veil because they were practical politicians in a bitter and uncertain struggle They had themselves felt the aspiration of democracy which is ever so much deeper more intimate and more important than any theory of government They were engaged as against the prejudice of ages in the assertion of human dignity What possessed them was not whether John Smith had sound views on any public question but that John Smith scion of a stock that had always been considered inferior would now bend his knee to no other man It was this spectacle that made it bliss in that dawn to be alive But every analyst seems to degrade that dignity to deny that all men are reasonable all the time or educated or informed to note that people are fooled that they do not always know their own interests and that all men are not equally fitted to govern The critics were about as welcome as a small boy with a drum Every one of these observations on the fallibility of man was being exploited ad nauseam Had democrats admitted there was truth in any of the aristocratic arguments they would have opened a breach in the defenses And so just as Aristotle had to insist that the slave was a slave by nature the democrats had to insist that the free man was a legislator and administrator by nature They could not stop to explain that a human soul might not yet have or indeed might never have this technical equipment and that nevertheless it had an inalienable right not to be used as the unwilling instrument of other men The superior people were still too strong and too unscrupulous to have refrained from capitalizing so candid a statement So the early democrats insisted that a reasoned righteousness welled up spontaneously out of the mass of men All of them hoped that it would many of them believed that it did although the cleverest like Thomas Jefferson had all sorts of private reservations But one thing was certain if public opinion did not come forth spontaneously nobody in that age believed it would come forth at all For in one fundamental respect the political science on which democracy was based was the same science that Aristotle formulated It was the same science for democrat and aristocrat royalist and republican in that its major premise assumed the art of government to be a natural endowment Men differed radically when they tried to name the men so endowed but they agreed in thinking that the greatest question of all was to find those in whom political wisdom was innate Royalists were sure that kings were born to govern Alexander Hamilton thought that while there are strong minds in every walk of life the representative body with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government will be composed of landholders merchants and men of the learned professions Footnote The Federalist Nos thirty five thirty six Cf comment by Henry Jones Ford in his Rise and Growth of American Politics Ch V Jefferson thought the political faculties were deposited by God in farmers and planters and sometimes spoke as if they were found in all the people Footnote See below p two hundred sixty eight The main premise was the same to govern was an instinct that appeared according to your social preferences in one man or a chosen few in all males or only in males who were white and twenty one perhaps even in all men and all women In deciding who was most fit to govern knowledge of the world was taken for granted The aristocrat believed that those who dealt with large affairs possessed the instinct the democrats asserted that all men possessed the instinct and could therefore deal with large affairs It was no part of political science in either case to think out how knowledge of the world could be brought to the ruler If you were for the people you did not try to work out the question of how to keep the voter informed By the age of twenty one he had his political faculties What counted was a good heart a reasoning mind a balanced judgment These would ripen with age but it was not necessary to consider how to inform the heart and feed the reason Men took in their facts as they took in their breath three But the facts men could come to possess in this effortless way were limited They could know the customs and more obvious character of the place where they lived and worked But the outer world they had to conceive and they did not conceive it instinctively nor absorb trustworthy knowledge of it just by living Therefore the only environment in which spontaneous politics were possible was one confined within the range of the ruler s direct and certain knowledge There is no escaping this conclusion wherever you found government on the natural range of men s faculties If as Aristotle said Footnote Politics Bk VII Ch four the citizens of a state are to judge and distribute offices according to merit then they must know each other s characters where they do not possess this knowledge both the election to offices and the decision of law suits will go wrong Obviously this maxim was binding upon every school of political thought But it presented peculiar difficulties to the democrats Those who believed in class government could fairly claim that in the court of the king or in the country houses of the gentry men did know each other s characters and as long as the rest of mankind was passive the only characters one needed to know were the characters of men in the ruling class But the democrats who wanted to raise the dignity of all men were immediately involved by the immense size and confusion of their ruling class the male electorate Their science told them that politics was an instinct and that the instinct worked in a limited environment Their hopes bade them insist that all men in a very large environment could govern In this deadly conflict between their ideals and their science the only way out was to assume without much discussion that the voice of the people was the voice of God The paradox was too great the stakes too big their ideal too precious for critical examination They could not show how a citizen of Boston was to stay in Boston and conceive the views of a Virginian how a Virginian in Virginia could have real opinions about the government at Washington how Congressmen in Washington could have opinions about China or Mexico For in that day it was not possible for many men to have an unseen environment brought into the field of their judgment There had been some advances to be sure since Aristotle There were a few newspapers and there were books better roads perhaps and better ships But there was no great advance and the political assumptions of the Eighteenth Century had essentially to be those that had prevailed in political science for two thousand years The pioneer democrats did not possess the material for resolving the conflict between the known range of man s attention and their illimitable faith in his dignity Their assumptions antedated not only the modern newspaper the world wide press services photography and moving pictures but what is really more significant they antedated measurement and record quantitative and comparative analysis the canons of evidence and the ability of psychological analysis to correct and discount the prejudices of the witness I do not mean to say that our records are satisfactory our analysis unbiased our measurements sound I do mean to say that the key inventions have been made for bringing the unseen world into the field of judgment They had not been made in the time of Aristotle and they were not yet important enough to be visible for political theory in the age of Rousseau Montesquieu or Thomas Jefferson In a later chapter I think we shall see that even in the latest theory of human reconstruction that of the English Guild Socialists all the deeper premises have been taken over from this older system of political thought That system whenever it was competent and honest had to assume that no man could have more than a very partial experience of public affairs In the sense that he can give only a little time to them that assumption is still true and of the utmost consequence But ancient theory was compelled to assume not only that men could give little attention to public questions but that the attention available would have to be confined to matters close at hand It would have been visionary to suppose that a time would come when distant and complicated events could conceivably be reported analyzed and presented in such a form that a really valuable choice could be made by an amateur That time is now in sight There is no longer any doubt that the continuous reporting of an unseen environment is feasible It is often done badly but the fact that it is done at all shows that it can be done and the fact that we begin to know how badly it is often done shows that it can be done better With varying degrees of skill and honesty distant complexities are reported every day by engineers and accountants for business men by secretaries and civil servants for officials by intelligence officers for the General Staff by some journalists for some readers These are crude beginnings but radical far more radical in the literal meaning of that word than the repetition of wars revolutions abdications and restorations as radical as the change in the scale of human life which has made it possible for mister Lloyd George to discuss Welsh coal mining after breakfast in London and the fate of the Arabs before dinner in Paris For the possibility of bringing any aspect of human affairs within the range of judgment breaks the spell which has lain upon political ideas There have of course been plenty of men who did not realize that the range of attention was the main premise of political science They have built on sand They have demonstrated in their own persons the effects of a very limited and self centered knowledge of the world But for the political thinkers who have counted from Plato and Aristotle through Machiavelli and Hobbes to the democratic theorists speculation has revolved around the self centered man who had to see the whole world by means of a few pictures in his head CHAPTER XVII THE SELF CONTAINED COMMUNITY one THAT groups of self centered people would engage in a struggle for existence if they rubbed against each other has always been evident This much truth there is at any rate in that famous passage in the Leviathan where Hobbes says that though there had never been any time wherein particular men were in a condition of war one against another yet at all times kings and persons of sovereign authority because of their independency are in continual jealousies and in the state and posture of gladiators having their weapons pointing and their eyes fixed on one another Footnote Leviathan Ch XIII Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as concerning their Felicity and Misery two To circumvent this conclusion one great branch of human thought which had and has many schools proceeded in this fashion it conceived an ideally just pattern of human relations in which each person had well defined functions and rights If he conscientiously filled the role allotted to him it did not matter whether his opinions were right or wrong He did his duty the next man did his and all the dutiful people together made a harmonious world Every caste system illustrates this principle you find it in Plato s Republic and in Aristotle in the feudal ideal in the circles of Dante s Paradise in the bureaucratic type of socialism and in laissez faire to an amazing degree in syndicalism guild socialism anarchism and in the system of international law idealized by mister Robert Lansing All of them assume a pre established harmony inspired imposed or innate by which the self opinionated person class or community is orchestrated with the rest of mankind The more authoritarian imagine a conductor for the symphony who sees to it that each man plays his part the anarchistic are inclined to think that a more divine concord would be heard if each player improvised as he went along But there have also been philosophers who were bored by these schemes of rights and duties took conflict for granted and tried to see how their side might come out on top They have always seemed more realistic even when they seemed alarming because all they had to do was to generalize the experience that nobody could escape Machiavelli is the classic of this school a man most mercilessly maligned because he happened to be the first naturalist who used plain language in a field hitherto preempted by supernaturalists Footnote F S Oliver in his Alexander Hamilton says of Machiavelli p one hundred seventy four Assuming the conditions which exist the nature of man and of things to be unchangeable he proceeds in a calm unmoral way like a lecturer on frogs to show how a valiant and sagacious ruler can best turn events to his own advantage and the security of his dynasty He has a worse name and more disciples than any political thinker who ever lived He truly described the technic of existence for the self contained state That is why he has the disciples He has the bad name chiefly because he cocked his eye at the Medici family dreamed in his study at night where he wore his noble court dress that Machiavelli was himself the Prince and turned a pungent description of the way things are done into an eulogy on that way of doing them In his most infamous chapter Footnote The Prince Ch XVIII Concerning the way in which Princes should keep faith Translation by W K Marriott he wrote that a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above named five qualities that he may appear to him who hears and sees him altogether merciful faithful humane upright and religious There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand because it belongs to everybody to see you to few to come in touch with you Everyone sees what you appear to be few really know what you are and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the majesty of the state to defend them and in the actions of all men and especially of princes which it is not prudent to challenge one judges by the result One prince of the present time whom it is not well to name never preaches anything else but peace and good faith and to both he is most hostile and either if he had kept it would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time That is cynical But it is the cynicism of a man who saw truly without knowing quite why he saw what he saw Machiavelli is thinking of the run of men and princes who judge generally more by the eye than by the hand which is his way of saying that their judgments are subjective He was too close to earth to pretend that the Italians of his day saw the world steadily and saw it whole He would not indulge in fantasies and he had not the materials for imagining a race of men that had learned how to correct their vision The world as he found it was composed of people whose vision could rarely be corrected and Machiavelli knew that such people since they see all public relations in a private way are involved in perpetual strife What they see is their own personal class dynastic or municipal version of affairs that in reality extend far beyond the boundaries of their vision They see their aspect They see it as right But they cross other people who are similarly self centered Then their very existence is endangered or at least what they for unsuspected private reasons regard as their existence and take to be a danger The end which is impregnably based on a real though private experience justifies the means They will sacrifice any one of these ideals to save all of them one judges by the result three These elemental truths confronted the democratic philosophers Consciously or otherwise they knew that the range of political knowledge was limited that the area of self government would have to be limited and that self contained states when they rubbed against each other were in the posture of gladiators But they knew just as certainly that there was in men a will to decide their own fate and to find a peace that was not imposed by force How could they reconcile the wish and the fact They looked about them In the city states of Greece and Italy they found a chronicle of corruption intrigue and war Footnote Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths Madison Federalist No ten In their own cities they saw faction artificiality fever This was no environment in which the democratic ideal could prosper no place where a group of independent and equally competent people managed their own affairs spontaneously They looked further guided somewhat perhaps by Jean Jacques Rousseau to remote unspoiled country villages They saw enough to convince themselves that there the ideal was at home Jefferson in particular felt this and Jefferson more than any other man formulated the American image of democracy From the townships had come the power that had carried the American Revolution to victory From the townships were to come the votes that carried Jefferson s party to power Out there in the farming communities of Massachusetts and Virginia if you wore glasses that obliterated the slaves you could see with your mind s eye the image of what democracy was to be The American Revolution broke out says de Tocqueville Footnote Democracy in America Vol I p fifty one Third Edition and the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people which had been nurtured in the townships took possession of the state It certainly took possession of the minds of those men who formulated and popularized the stereotypes of democracy The cherishment of the people was our principle wrote Jefferson Footnote Cited in Charles Beard Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy Ch XIV But the people he cherished almost exclusively were the small landowning farmers Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God if ever He had a chosen people whose breasts He has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue It is the focus in which He keeps alive that sacred fire which otherwise might escape from the face of the earth Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an example However much of the romantic return to nature may have entered into this exclamation there was also an element of solid sense Jefferson was right in thinking that a group of independent farmers comes nearer to fulfilling the requirements of spontaneous democracy than any other human society But if you are to preserve the ideal you must fence off these ideal communities from the abominations of the world If the farmers are to manage their own affairs they must confine affairs to those they are accustomed to managing Jefferson drew all these logical conclusions He disapproved of manufacture of foreign commerce and a navy of intangible forms of property and in theory of any form of government that was not centered in the small self governing group He had critics in his day one of them remarked that wrapt up in the fullness of self consequence and strong enough in reality to defend ourselves against every invader we might enjoy an eternal rusticity and live forever thus apathized and vulgar under the shelter of a selfish satisfied indifference Footnote Op cit p four hundred twenty six four The democratic ideal as Jefferson moulded it consisting of an ideal environment and a selected class did not conflict with the political science of his time It did conflict with the realities And when the ideal was stated in absolute terms partly through exuberance and partly for campaign purposes it was soon forgotten that the theory was originally devised for very special conditions It became the political gospel and supplied the stereotypes through which Americans of all parties have looked at politics That gospel was fixed by the necessity that in Jefferson s time no one could have conceived public opinions that were not spontaneous and subjective The democratic tradition is therefore always trying to see a world where people are exclusively concerned with affairs of which the causes and effects all operate within the region they inhabit Never has democratic theory been able to conceive itself in the context of a wide and unpredictable environment The mirror is concave And although democrats recognize that they are in contact with external affairs they see quite surely that every contact outside that self contained group is a threat to democracy as originally conceived That is a wise fear If democracy is to be spontaneous the interests of democracy must remain simple intelligible and easily managed Conditions must approximate those of the isolated rural township if the supply of information is to be left to casual experience The environment must be confined within the range of every man s direct and certain knowledge The democrat has understood what an analysis of public opinion seems to demonstrate that in dealing with an unseen environment decisions are manifestly settled at haphazard which clearly they ought not to be Footnote Aristotle Politics Bk VII Ch IV So he has always tried in one way or another to minimize the importance of that unseen environment He feared foreign trade because trade involves foreign connections he distrusted manufactures because they produced big cities and collected crowds if he had nevertheless to have manufactures he wanted protection in the interest of self sufficiency When he could not find these conditions in the real world he went passionately into the wilderness and founded Utopian communities far from foreign contacts His slogans reveal his prejudice He is for Self Government Self Determination Independence Not one of these ideas carries with it any notion of consent or community beyond the frontiers of the self governing groups The field of democratic action is a circumscribed area Within protected boundaries the aim has been to achieve self sufficiency and avoid entanglement This rule is not confined to foreign policy but it is plainly evident there because life outside the national boundaries is more distinctly alien than any life within And as history shows democracies in their foreign policy have had generally to choose between splendid isolation and a diplomacy that violated their ideals The most successful democracies in fact Switzerland Denmark Australia New Zealand and America until recently have had no foreign policy in the European sense of that phrase Even a rule like the Monroe Doctrine arose from the desire to supplement the two oceans by a glacis of states that were sufficiently republican to have no foreign policy Whereas danger is a great perhaps an indispensable condition of autocracy Footnote Fisher Ames frightened by the democratic revolution of eighteen hundred wrote to Rufus King in eighteen oh two We need as all nations do the compression on the outside of our circle of a formidable neighbor whose presence shall at all times excite stronger fears than demagogues can inspire the people with towards their government Cited by Ford Rise and Growth of American Politics p sixty nine security was seen to be a necessity if democracy was to work There must be as little disturbance as possible of the premise of a self contained community Insecurity involves surprises It means that there are people acting upon your life over whom you have no control with whom you cannot consult It means that forces are at large which disturb the familiar routine and present novel problems about which quick and unusual decisions are required Every democrat feels in his bones that dangerous crises are incompatible with democracy because he knows that the inertia of masses is such that to act quickly a very few must decide and the rest follow rather blindly This has not made non resistants out of democrats but it has resulted in all democratic wars being fought for pacifist aims Even when the wars are in fact wars of conquest they are sincerely believed to be wars in defense of civilization These various attempts to enclose a part of the earth s surface were not inspired by cowardice apathy or what one of Jefferson s critics called a willingness to live under monkish discipline The democrats had caught sight of a dazzling possibility that every human being should rise to his full stature freed from man made limitations With what they knew of the art of government they could no more than Aristotle before them conceive a society of autonomous individuals except an enclosed and simple one They could then select no other premise if they were to reach the conclusion that all the people could spontaneously manage their public affairs five Having adopted the premise because it was necessary to their keenest hope they drew other conclusions as well Since in order to have spontaneous self government you had to have a simple self contained community they took it for granted that one man was as competent as the next to manage these simple and self contained affairs Where the wish is father to the thought such logic is convincing Moreover the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen is for most practical purposes true in the rural township Everybody in a village sooner or later tries his hand at everything the village does There is rotation in office by men who are jacks of all trades There was no serious trouble with the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen until the democratic stereotype was universally applied so that men looked at a complicated civilization and saw an enclosed village Not only was the individual citizen fitted to deal with all public affairs but he was consistently public spirited and endowed with unflagging interest He was public spirited enough in the township where he knew everybody and was interested in everybody s business The idea of enough for the township turned easily into the idea of enough for any purpose for as we have noted quantitative thinking does not suit a stereotype But there was another turn to the circle Since everybody was assumed to be interested enough in important affairs only those affairs came to seem important in which everybody was interested This meant that men formed their picture of the world outside from the unchallenged pictures in their heads These pictures came to them well stereotyped by their parents and teachers and were little corrected by their own experience Only a few men had affairs that took them across state lines Even fewer had reason to go abroad Most voters lived their whole lives in one environment and with nothing but a few feeble newspapers some pamphlets political speeches their religious training and rumor to go on they had to conceive that larger environment of commerce and finance of war and peace The number of public opinions based on any objective report was very small in proportion to those based on casual fancy And so for many different reasons self sufficiency was a spiritual ideal in the formative period The physical isolation of the township the loneliness of the pioneer the theory of democracy the Protestant tradition and the limitations of political science all converged to make men believe that out of their own consciences they must extricate political wisdom It is not strange that the deduction of laws from absolute principles should have usurped so much of their free energy The American political mind had to live on its capital In legalism it found a tested body of rules from which new rules could be spun without the labor of earning new truths from experience The formulae became so curiously sacred that every good foreign observer has been amazed at the contrast between the dynamic practical energy of the American people and the static theorism of their public life That steadfast love of fixed principles was simply the only way known of achieving self sufficiency But it meant that the public opinions of any one community about the outer world consisted chiefly of a few stereotyped images arranged in a pattern deduced from their legal and their moral codes and animated by the feeling aroused by local experiences Thus democratic theory starting from its fine vision of ultimate human dignity was forced by lack of the instruments of knowledge for reporting its environment to fall back upon the wisdom and experience which happened to have accumulated in the voter God had in the words of Jefferson made men s breasts His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue These chosen people in their self contained environment had all the facts before them The environment was so familiar that one could take it for granted that men were talking about substantially the same things The only real disagreements therefore would be in judgments about the same facts There was no need to guarantee the sources of information They were obvious and equally accessible to all men Nor was there need to trouble about the ultimate criteria In the self contained community one could assume or at least did assume a homogeneous code of morals The only place therefore for differences of opinion was in the logical application of accepted standards to accepted facts And since the reasoning faculty was also well standardized an error in reasoning would be quickly exposed in a free discussion It followed that truth could be obtained by liberty within these limits The community could take its supply of information for granted its codes it passed on through school church and family and the power to draw deductions from a premise rather than the ability to find the premise was regarded as the chief end of intellectual training CHAPTER XVIII THE ROLE OF FORCE PATRONAGE AND PRIVILEGE one IT has happened as was to have been foreseen wrote Hamilton Footnote Federalist No fifteen the measures of the Union have not been executed the delinquencies of the States have step by step matured themselves to an extreme which has at length arrested all the wheels of the national government and brought them to an awful stand For in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite under the confederation to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union How could it be otherwise he asked The rulers of the respective members will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption All this will be done and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state which is essential to right judgment and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects which can hardly fail to mislead the decision The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted and the execution of the plans framed by the councils of the whole will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill informed and prejudiced opinion of every part Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies who have seen how difficult it often is when there is no exterior pressure of circumstances to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies deliberating at a distance from each other at different times and under different impressions long to cooperate in the same views and pursuits Over ten years of storm and stress with a congress that was as John Adams said Footnote Ford op cit p thirty six only a diplomatic assembly had furnished the leaders of the revolution with an instructive but afflicting lesson Footnote Federalist No fifteen in what happens when a number of self centered communities are entangled in the same environment And so when they went to Philadelphia in May of seventeen eighty seven ostensibly to revise the Articles of Confederation they were really in full reaction against the fundamental premise of Eighteenth Century democracy Not only were the leaders consciously opposed to the democratic spirit of the time feeling as Madison said that democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention but within the national frontiers they were determined to offset as far as they could the ideal of self governing communities in self contained environments The collisions and failures of concave democracy where men spontaneously managed all their own affairs were before their eyes The problem as they saw it was to restore government as against democracy They understood government to be the power to make national decisions and enforce them throughout the nation democracy they believed was the insistence of localities and classes upon self determination in accordance with their immediate interests and aims They could not consider in their calculations the possibility of such an organization of knowledge that separate communities would act simultaneously on the same version of the facts We just begin to conceive this possibility for certain parts of the world where there is free circulation of news and a common language and then only for certain aspects of life The whole idea of a voluntary federalism in industry and world politics is still so rudimentary that as we see in our own experience it enters only a little and only very modestly into practical politics What we more than a century later can only conceive as an incentive to generations of intellectual effort the authors of the Constitution had no reason to conceive at all In order to set up national government Hamilton and his colleagues had to make plans not on the theory that men would cooperate because they had a sense of common interest but on the theory that men could be governed if special interests were kept in equilibrium by a balance of power Ambition Madison said Footnote Federalist No fifty one cited by Ford op cit p sixty must be made to counteract ambition They did not as some writers have supposed intend to balance every interest so that the government would be in a perpetual deadlock They intended to deadlock local and class interest to prevent these from obstructing government In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men wrote Madison Footnote Id the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself In one very important sense then the doctrine of checks and balances was the remedy of the federalist leaders for the problem of public opinion They saw no other way to substitute the mild influence of the magistracy for the sanguinary agency of the sword Footnote Federalist No fifteen except by devising an ingenious machine to neutralize local opinion They did not understand how to manipulate a large electorate any more than they saw the possibility of common consent upon the basis of common information It is true that Aaron Burr taught Hamilton a lesson which impressed him a good deal when he seized control of New York City in eighteen hundred by the aid of Tammany Hall But Hamilton was killed before he was able to take account of this new discovery and as mister Ford says Footnote Ford op cit p one hundred nineteen Burr s pistol blew the brains out of the Federal party two When the constitution was written politics could still be managed by conference and agreement among gentlemen Footnote Op cit p one hundred forty four and it was to the gentry that Hamilton turned for a government It was intended that they should manage national affairs when local prejudice had been brought into equilibrium by the constitutional checks and balances No doubt Hamilton who belonged to this class by adoption had a human prejudice in their favor But that by itself is a thin explanation of his statecraft Certainly there can be no question of his consuming passion for union and it is I think an inversion of the truth to argue that he made the Union to protect class privileges instead of saying that he used class privileges to make the Union We must take man as we find him Hamilton said and if we expect him to serve the public we must interest his passions in doing so Footnote Op cit p forty seven He needed men to govern whose passions could be most quickly attached to a national interest These were the gentry the public creditors manufacturers shippers and traders Footnote Beard Economic Interpretation of the Constitution passim and there is probably no better instance in history of the adaptation of shrewd means to clear ends than in the series of fiscal measures by which Hamilton attached the provincial notables to the new government Although the constitutional convention worked behind closed doors and although ratification was engineered by a vote of probably not more than one sixth of the adult males Footnote Beard op cit p three hundred twenty five there was little or no pretence The Federalists argued for union not for democracy and even the word republic had an unpleasant sound to George Washington when he had been for more than two years a republican president The constitution was a candid attempt to limit the sphere of popular rule the only democratic organ it was intended the government should possess was the House based on a suffrage highly limited by property qualifications And even at that the House it was believed would be so licentious a part of the government that it was carefully checked and balanced by the Senate the electoral college the Presidential veto and by judicial interpretation Thus at the moment when the French Revolution was kindling popular feeling the world over the American revolutionists of seventeen seventy six came under a constitution which went back as far as it was expedient to the British Monarchy for a model This conservative reaction could not endure The men who had made it were a minority their motives were under suspicion and when Washington went into retirement the position of the gentry was not strong enough to survive the inevitable struggle for the succession The anomaly between the original plan of the Fathers and the moral feeling of the age was too wide not to be capitalized by a good politician three Jefferson referred to his election as the great revolution of eighteen hundred but more than anything else it was a revolution in the mind No great policy was altered but a new tradition was established For it was Jefferson who first taught the American people to regard the Constitution as an instrument of democracy and he stereotyped the images the ideas and even many of the phrases in which Americans ever since have described politics to each other So complete was the mental victory that twenty five years later de Tocqueville who was received in Federalist homes noted that even those who were galled by its continuance were not uncommonly heard to laud the delights of a republican government and the advantages of democratic institutions when they are in public Footnote Democracy in America Vol I Ch X Third Edition eighteen thirty eight p two hundred sixteen The Constitutional Fathers with all their sagacity had failed to see that a frankly undemocratic constitution would not long be tolerated The bold denial of popular rule was bound to offer an easy point of attack to a man like Jefferson who so far as his constitutional opinions ran was not a bit more ready than Hamilton to turn over government to the unrefined will of the people Footnote Cf his plan for the Constitution of Virginia his ideas for a senate of property holders and his views on the judicial veto Beard Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy pp four hundred fifty et seq The Federalist leaders had been men of definite convictions who stated them bluntly There was little real discrepancy between their public and their private views But Jefferson s mind was a mass of ambiguities not solely because of its defects as Hamilton and his biographers have thought but because he believed in a union and he believed in spontaneous democracies and in the political science of his age there was no satisfactory way to reconcile the two Jefferson was confused in thought and action because he had a vision of a new and tremendous idea that no one had thought out in all its bearings But though popular sovereignty was not clearly understood by anybody it seemed to imply so great an enhancement of human life that no constitution could stand which frankly denied it The frank denials were therefore expunged from consciousness and the document which is on its face an honest example of limited constitutional democracy was talked and thought about as an instrument for direct popular rule Jefferson actually reached the point of believing that the Federalists had perverted the Constitution of which in his fancy they were no longer the authors And so the Constitution was in spirit rewritten Partly by actual amendment partly by practice as in the case of the electoral college but chiefly by looking at it through another set of stereotypes the facade was no longer permitted to look oligarchic The American people came to believe that their Constitution was a democratic instrument and treated it as such They owe that fiction to the victory of Thomas Jefferson and a great conservative fiction it has been It is a fair guess that if everyone had always regarded the Constitution as did the authors of it the Constitution would have been violently overthrown because loyalty to the Constitution and loyalty to democracy would have seemed incompatible Jefferson resolved that paradox by teaching the American people to read the Constitution as an expression of democracy He himself stopped there But in the course of twenty five years or so social conditions had changed so radically that Andrew Jackson carried out the political revolution for which Jefferson had prepared the tradition Footnote The reader who has any doubts as to the extent of the revolution that separated Hamilton s opinions from Jackson s practice should turn to mister Henry Jones Ford s Rise and Growth of American Politics four The political center of that revolution was the question of patronage By the men who founded the government public office was regarded as a species of property not lightly to be disturbed and it was undoubtedly their hope that the offices would remain in the hands of their social class But the democratic theory had as one of its main principles the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen Therefore when people began to look at the Constitution as a democratic instrument it was certain that permanence in office would seem undemocratic The natural ambitions of men coincided here with the great moral impulse of their age Jefferson had popularized the idea without carrying it ruthlessly into practice and removals on party grounds were comparatively few under the Virginian Presidents It was Jackson who founded the practice of turning public office into patronage Curious as it sounds to us the principle of rotation in office with short terms was regarded as a great reform Not only did it acknowledge the new dignity of the average man by treating him as fit for any office not only did it destroy the monopoly of a small social class and appear to open careers to talent but it had been advocated for centuries as a sovereign remedy for political corruption and as the one way to prevent the creation of a bureaucracy Footnote Ford op cit p one hundred sixty nine The practice of rapid change in public office was the application to a great territory of the image of democracy derived from the self contained village Naturally it did not have the same results in the nation that it had in the ideal community on which the democratic theory was based It produced quite unexpected results for it founded a new governing class to take the place of the submerged federalists Unintentionally patronage did for a large electorate what Hamilton s fiscal measures had done for the upper classes We often fail to realize how much of the stability of our government we owe to patronage For it was patronage that weaned natural leaders from too much attachment to the self centered community it was patronage that weakened the local spirit and brought together in some kind of peaceful cooperation the very men who as provincial celebrities would in the absence of a sense of common interest have torn the union apart But of course the democratic theory was not supposed to produce a new governing class and it has never accommodated itself to the fact When the democrat wanted to abolish monopoly of offices to have rotation and short terms he was thinking of the township where anyone could do a public service and return humbly to his own farm The idea of a special class of politicians was just what the democrat did not like But he could not have what he did like because his theory was derived from an ideal environment and he was living in a real one The more deeply he felt the moral impulse of democracy the less ready he was to see the profound truth of Hamilton s statement that communities deliberating at a distance and under different impressions could not long cooperate in the same views and pursuits For that truth postpones anything like the full realization of democracy in public affairs until the art of obtaining common consent has been radically improved And so while the revolution under Jefferson and Jackson produced the patronage which made the two party system which created a substitute for the rule of the gentry and a discipline for governing the deadlock of the checks and balances all that happened as it were invisibly Thus rotation in office might be the ostensible theory in practice the offices oscillated between the henchmen Tenure might not be a permanent monopoly but the professional politician was permanent Government might be as President Harding once said a simple thing but winning elections was a sophisticated performance The salaries in office might be as ostentatiously frugal as Jefferson s home spun but the expenses of party organization and the fruits of victory were in the grand manner The stereotype of democracy controlled the visible government the corrections the exceptions and adaptations of the American people to the real facts of their environment have had to be invisible even when everybody knew all about them It was only the words of the law the speeches of politicians the platforms and the formal machinery of administration that have had to conform to the pristine image of democracy five If one had asked a philosophical democrat how these self contained communities were to cooperate when their public opinions were so self centered he would have pointed to representative government embodied in the Congress And nothing would surprise him more than the discovery of how steadily the prestige of representative government has declined while the power of the Presidency has grown Some critics have traced this to the custom of sending only local celebrities to Washington They have thought that if Congress could consist of the nationally eminent men the life of the capital would be more brilliant It would be of course and it would be a very good thing if retiring Presidents and Cabinet officers followed the example of John Quincy Adams But the absence of these men does not explain the plight of Congress for its decline began when it was relatively the most eminent branch of the government Indeed it is more probable that the reverse is true and that Congress ceased to attract the eminent as it lost direct influence on the shaping of national policy The main reason for the discredit which is world wide is I think to be found in the fact that a congress of representatives is essentially a group of blind men in a vast unknown world With some exceptions the only method recognized in the Constitution or in the theory of representative government by which Congress can inform itself is to exchange opinions from the districts There is no systematic adequate and authorized way for Congress to know what is going on in the world The theory is that the best man of each district brings the best wisdom of his constituents to a central place and that all these wisdoms combined are all the wisdom that Congress needs Now there is no need to question the value of expressing local opinions and exchanging them Congress has great value as the market place of a continental nation In the coatrooms the hotel lobbies the boarding houses of Capitol Hill at the tea parties of the Congressional matrons and from occasional entries into the drawing rooms of cosmopolitan Washington new vistas are opened and wider horizons But even if the theory were applied and the districts always sent their wisest men the sum or a combination of local impressions is not a wide enough base for national policy and no base at all for the control of foreign policy Since the real effects of most laws are subtle and hidden they cannot be understood by filtering local experiences through local states of mind They can be known only by controlled reporting and objective analysis And just as the head of a large factory cannot know how efficient it is by talking to the foreman but must examine cost sheets and data that only an accountant can dig out for him so the lawmaker does not arrive at a true picture of the state of the union by putting together a mosaic of local pictures He needs to know the local pictures but unless he possesses instruments for calibrating them one picture is as good as the next and a great deal better The President does come to the assistance of Congress by delivering messages on the state of the Union He is in a position to do that because he presides over a vast collection of bureaus and their agents which report as well as act But he tells Congress what he chooses to tell it He cannot be heckled and the censorship as to what is compatible with the public interest is in his hands It is a wholly one sided and tricky relationship which sometimes reaches such heights of absurdity that Congress in order to secure an important document has to thank the enterprise of a Chicago newspaper or the calculated indiscretion of a subordinate official So bad is the contact of legislators with necessary facts that they are forced to rely either on private tips or on that legalized atrocity the Congressional investigation where Congressmen starved of their legitimate food for thought go on a wild and feverish man hunt and do not stop at cannibalism Except for the little that these investigations yield the occasional communications from the executive departments interested and disinterested data collected by private persons such newspapers periodicals and books as Congressmen read and a new and excellent practice of calling for help from expert bodies like the Interstate Commerce Commission the Federal Trade Commission and the Tariff Commission the creation of Congressional opinion is incestuous From this it follows either that legislation of a national character is prepared by a few informed insiders and put through by partisan force or that the legislation is broken up into a collection of local items each of which is enacted for a local reason Tariff schedules navy yards army posts rivers and harbors post offices and federal buildings pensions and patronage these are fed out to concave communities as tangible evidence of the benefits of national life Being concave they can see the white marble building which rises out of federal funds to raise local realty values and employ local contractors more readily than they can judge the cumulative cost of the pork barrel It is fair to say that in a large assembly of men each of whom has practical knowledge only of his own district laws dealing with translocal affairs are rejected or accepted by the mass of Congressmen without creative participation of any kind They participate only in making those laws that can be treated as a bundle of local issues For a legislature without effective means of information and analysis must oscillate between blind regularity tempered by occasional insurgency and logrolling And it is the logrolling which makes the regularity palatable because it is by logrolling that a Congressman proves to his more active constituents that he is watching their interests as they conceive them This is no fault of the individual Congressman s except when he is complacent about it The cleverest and most industrious representative cannot hope to understand a fraction of the bills on which he votes The best he can do is to specialize on a few bills and take somebody s word about the rest I have known Congressmen when they were boning up on a subject to study as they had not studied since they passed their final examinations many large cups of black coffee wet towels and all They had to dig for information sweat over arranging and verifying facts which in any consciously organized government should have been easily available in a form suitable for decision And even when they really knew a subject their anxieties had only begun For back home the editors the board of trade the central federated union and the women s clubs had spared themselves these labors and were prepared to view the Congressman s performance through local spectacles six What patronage did to attach political chieftains to the national government the infinite variety of local subsidies and privileges do for self centered communities Patronage and pork amalgamate and stabilize thousands of special opinions local discontents private ambitions There are but two other alternatives One is government by terror and obedience the other is government based on such a highly developed system of information analysis and self consciousness that the knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state is evident to all men The autocratic system is in decay the voluntary system is in its very earliest development and so in calculating the prospects of association among large groups of people a League of Nations industrial government or a federal union of states the degree to which the material for a common consciousness exists determines how far cooperation will depend upon force or upon the milder alternative to force which is patronage and privilege The secret of great state builders like Alexander Hamilton is that they know how to calculate these principles CHAPTER XIX THE OLD IMAGE IN A NEW FORM GUILD SOCIALISM Whenever the quarrels of self centered groups become unbearable reformers in the past found themselves forced to choose between two great alternatives They could take the path to Rome and impose a Roman peace upon the warring tribes They could take the path to isolation to autonomy and self sufficiency Almost always they chose that path which they had least recently travelled If they had tried out the deadening monotony of empire they cherished above all other things the simple freedom of their own community But if they had seen this simple freedom squandered in parochial jealousies they longed for the spacious order of a great and powerful state Whichever choice they made the essential difficulty was the same If decisions were decentralized they soon floundered in a chaos of local opinions If they were centralized the policy of the state was based on the opinions of a small social set at the capital In any case force was necessary to defend one local right against another or to impose law and order on the localities or to resist class government at the center or to defend the whole society centralized or decentralized against the outer barbarian Modern democracy and the industrial system were both born in a time of reaction against kings crown government and a regime of detailed economic regulation In the industrial sphere this reaction took the form of extreme devolution known as laissez faire individualism Each economic decision was to be made by the man who had title to the property involved Since almost everything was owned by somebody there would be somebody to manage everything This was plural sovereignty with a vengeance It was economic government by anybody s economic philosophy though it was supposed to be controlled by immutable laws of political economy that must in the end produce harmony It produced many splendid things but enough sordid and terrible ones to start counter currents One of these was the trust which established a kind of Roman peace within industry and a Roman predatory imperialism outside People turned to the legislature for relief They invoked representative government founded on the image of the township farmer to regulate the semi sovereign corporations The working class turned to labor organization There followed a period of increasing centralization and a sort of race of armaments The trusts interlocked the craft unions federated and combined into a labor movement the political system grew stronger at Washington and weaker in the states as the reformers tried to match its strength against big business In this period practically all the schools of socialist thought from the Marxian left to the New Nationalists around Theodore Roosevelt looked upon centralization as the first stage of an evolution which would end in the absorption of all the semi sovereign powers of business by the political state The evolution never took place except for a few months during the war That was enough and there was a turn of the wheel against the omnivorous state in favor of several new forms of pluralism But this time society was to swing back not to the atomic individualism of Adam Smith s economic man and Thomas Jefferson s farmer but to a sort of molecular individualism of voluntary groups One of the interesting things about all these oscillations of theory is that each in turn promises a world in which no one will have to follow Machiavelli in order to survive They are all established by some form of coercion they all exercise coercion in order to maintain themselves and they are all discarded as a result of coercion Yet they do not accept coercion either physical power or special position patronage or privilege as part of their ideal The individualist said that self enlightened self interest would bring internal and external peace The socialist is sure that the motives to aggression will disappear The new pluralist hopes they will Footnote See G D H Cole Social Theory p one hundred forty two Coercion is the surd in almost all social theory except the Machiavellian The temptation to ignore it because it is absurd inexpressible and unmanageable becomes overwhelming in any man who is trying to rationalize human life two The lengths to which a clever man will sometimes go in order to escape a full recognition of the role of force is shown by mister G D H Cole s book on Guild Socialism The present state he says is primarily an instrument of coercion Footnote Cole Guild Socialism p one hundred seven in a guild socialist society there will be no sovereign power though there will be a coordinating body He calls this body the Commune He then begins to enumerate the powers of the Commune which we recall is to be primarily not an instrument of coercion Footnote Op cit Ch VIII It settles price disputes Sometimes it fixes prices allocates the surplus or distributes the loss It allocates natural resources and controls the issue of credit It also allocates communal labor power It ratifies the budgets of the guilds and the civil services It levies taxes All questions of income fall within its jurisdiction It allocates income to the non productive members of the community It is the final arbiter in all questions of policy and jurisdiction between the guilds It passes constitutional laws fixing the functions of the functional bodies It appoints the judges It confers coercive powers upon the guilds and ratifies their by laws wherever these involve coercion It declares war and makes peace It controls the armed forces It is the supreme representative of the nation abroad It settles boundary questions within the national state It calls into existence new functional bodies or distributes new functions to old ones It runs the police It makes whatever laws are necessary to regulate personal conduct and personal property These powers are exercised not by one commune but by a federal structure of local and provincial communes with a National commune at the top mister Cole is of course welcome to insist that this is not a sovereign state but if there is a coercive power now enjoyed by any modern government for which he has forgotten to make room I cannot think of it He tells us however that Guild society will be non coercive we want to build a new society which will be conceived in the spirit not of coercion but of free service Footnote Op cit p one hundred forty one Everyone who shares that hope as most men and women do will therefore look closely to see what there is in the Guild Socialist plan which promises to reduce coercion to its lowest limits even though the Guildsmen of to day have already reserved for their communes the widest kind of coercive power It is acknowledged at once that the new society cannot be brought into existence by universal consent mister Cole is too honest to shirk the element of force required to make the transition Footnote Cf op cit Ch X And while obviously he cannot predict how much civil war there might be he is quite clear that there would have to be a period of direct action by the trade unions three But leaving aside the problems of transition and any consideration of what the effect is on their future action when men have hacked their way through to the promised land let us imagine the Guild Society in being What keeps it running as a non coercive society mister Cole has two answers to this question One is the orthodox Marxian answer that the abolition of capitalist property will remove the motive to aggression Yet he does not really believe that because if he did he would care as little as does the average Marxian how the working class is to run the government once it is in control If his diagnosis were correct the Marxian would be quite right if the disease were the capitalist class and only the capitalist class salvation would automatically follow its extinction But mister Cole is enormously concerned about whether the society which follows the revolution is to be run by state collectivism by guilds or cooperative societies by a democratic parliament or by functional representation In fact it is as a new theory of representative government that guild socialism challenges attention The guildsmen do not expect a miracle to result from the disappearance of capitalist property rights They do expect and of course quite rightly that if equality of income were the rule social relations would be profoundly altered But they differ as far as I can make out from the orthodox Russian communist in this respect The communist proposes to establish equality by force of the dictatorship of the proletariat believing that if once people were equalized both in income and in service they would then lose the incentives to aggression The guildsmen also propose to establish equality by force but are shrewd enough to see that if an equilibrium is to be maintained they have to provide institutions for maintaining it Guildsmen therefore put their faith in what they believe to be a new theory of democracy Their object says mister Cole is to get the mechanism right and to adjust it as far as possible to the expression of men s social wills Reference Op cit p sixteen These wills need to be given opportunity for self expression in self government in any and every form of social action Behind these words is the true democratic impulse the desire to enhance human dignity as well as the traditional assumption that this human dignity is impugned unless each person s will enters into the management of everything that affects him The guildsman like the earlier democrat therefore looks about him for an environment in which this ideal of self government can be realized A hundred years and more have passed since Rousseau and Jefferson and the center of interest has shifted from the country to the city The new democrat can no longer turn to the idealized rural township for the image of democracy He turns now to the workshop The spirit of association must be given free play in the sphere in which it is best able to find expression This is manifestly the factory in which men have the habit and tradition of working together The factory is the natural and fundamental unit of industrial democracy This involves not only that the factory must be free as far as possible to manage its own affairs but also that the democratic unit of the factory must be made the basis of the larger democracy of the Guild and that the larger organs of Guild administration and government must be based largely on the principle of factory representation Footnote Op cit p forty Factory is of course a very loose word and mister Cole asks us to take it as meaning mines shipyards docks stations and every place which is a natural center of production Footnote Op cit p forty one But a factory in this sense is quite a different thing from an industry The factory as mister Cole conceives it is a work place where men are really in personal contact an environment small enough to be known directly to all the workers This democracy if it is to be real must come home to and be exercisable directly by every individual member of the Guild Footnote Op cit p forty This is important because mister Cole like Jefferson is seeking a natural unit of government The only natural unit is a perfectly familiar environment Now a large plant a railway system a great coal field is not a natural unit in this sense Unless it is a very small factory indeed what mister Cole is really thinking about is the shop That is where men can be supposed to have the habit and tradition of working together The rest of the plant the rest of the industry is an inferred environment four Anybody can see and almost everybody will admit that self government in the purely internal affairs of the shop is government of affairs that can be taken in at a single view Footnote Aristotle Politics Bk VII Ch IV But dispute would arise as to what constitute the internal affairs of a shop Obviously the biggest interests like wages standards of production the purchase of supplies the marketing of the product the larger planning of work are by no means purely internal The shop democracy has freedom subject to enormous limiting conditions from the outside It can deal to a certain extent with the arrangement of work laid out for the shop it can deal with the temper and temperament of individuals it can administer petty industrial justice and act as a court of first instance in somewhat larger individual disputes Above all it can act as a unit in dealing with other shops and perhaps with the plant as a whole But isolation is impossible The unit of industrial democracy is thoroughly entangled in foreign affairs And it is the management of these external relations that constitutes the test of the guild socialist theory They have to be managed by representative government arranged in a federal order from the shop to the plant the plant to the industry the industry to the nation with intervening regional grouping of representatives But all this structure derives from the shop and all its peculiar virtues are ascribed to this source The representatives who choose the representatives who choose the representatives who finally coordinate and regulate the shops are elected mister Cole asserts by a true democracy Because they come originally from a self governing unit the whole federal organism will be inspired by the spirit and the reality of self government Representatives will aim to carry out the workers actual will as understood by themselves Footnote Op cit p forty two that is as understood by the individual in the shops A government run literally on this principle would if history is any guide be either a perpetual logroll or a chaos of warring shops For while the worker in the shop can have a real opinion about matters entirely within the shop his will about the relation of that shop to the plant the industry and the nation is subject to all the limitations of access stereotype and self interest that surround any other self centered opinion His experience in the shop at best brings only aspects of the whole to his attention His opinion of what is right within the shop he can reach by direct knowledge of the essential facts His opinion of what is right in the great complicated environment out of sight is more likely to be wrong than right if it is a generalization from the experience of the individual shop As a matter of experience the representatives of a guild society would find just as the higher trade union officials find today that on a great number of questions which they have to decide there is no actual will as understood by the shops five The guildsmen insist however that such criticism is blind because it ignores a great political discovery You may be quite right they would say in thinking that the representatives of the shops would have to make up their own minds on many questions about which the shops have no opinion But you are simply entangled in an ancient fallacy you are looking for somebody to represent a group of people He cannot be found The only representative possible is one who acts for some particular function Footnote Op cit pp twenty three twenty four and therefore each person must help choose as many representatives as there are distinct essential groups of functions to be performed Assume then that the representatives speak not for the men in the shops but for certain functions in which the men are interested They are mind you disloyal if they do not carry out the will of the group about the function as understood by the group Footnote Cf Part V The Making of a Common Will These functional representatives meet Their business is to coordinate and regulate By what standard does each judge the proposals of the other assuming as we must that there is conflict of opinion between the shops since if there were not there would be no need to coordinate and regulate Now the peculiar virtue of functional democracy is supposed to be that men vote candidly according to their own interests which it is assumed they know by daily experience They can do that within the self contained group But in its external relations the group as a whole or its representative is dealing with matters that transcend immediate experience The shop does not arrive spontaneously at a view of the whole situation Therefore the public opinions of a shop about its rights and duties in the industry and in society are matters of education or propaganda not the automatic product of shop consciousness Whether the guildsmen elect a delegate or a representative they do not escape the problem of the orthodox democrat Either the group as a whole or the elected spokesman must stretch his mind beyond the limits of direct experience He must vote on questions coming up from other shops and on matters coming from beyond the frontiers of the whole industry The primary interest of the shop does not even cover the function of a whole industrial vocation The function of a vocation a great industry a district a nation is a concept not an experience and has to be imagined invented taught and believed And even though you define function as carefully as possible once you admit that the view of each shop on that function will not necessarily coincide with the view of other shops you are saying that the representative of one interest is concerned in the proposals made by other interests You are saying that he must conceive a common interest And in voting for him you are choosing a man who will not simply represent your view of your function which is all that you know at first hand but a man who will represent your views about other people s views of that function You are voting as indefinitely as the orthodox democrat six The guildsmen in their own minds have solved the question of how to conceive a common interest by playing with the word function They imagine a society in which all the main work of the world has been analysed into functions and these functions in turn synthesized harmoniously Footnote Cf op cit Ch XIX They suppose essential agreement about the purposes of society as a whole and essential agreement about the role of every organized group in carrying out those purposes It was a nice sentiment therefore which led them to take the name of their theory from an institution that arose in a Catholic feudal society But they should remember that the scheme of function which the wise men of that age assumed was not worked out by mortal man It is unclear how the guildsmen think the scheme is going to be worked out and made acceptable in the modern world Sometimes they seem to argue that the scheme will develop from trade union organization at other times that the communes will define the constitutional function of the groups But it makes a considerable practical difference whether they believe that the groups define their own functions or not In either case mister Cole assumes that society can be carried on by a social contract based on an accepted idea of distinct essential groups of functions How does one recognize these distinct essential groups So far as I can make out mister Cole thinks that a function is what a group of people are interested in The essence of functional democracy is that a man should count as many times over as there are functions in which he is interested Footnote Social Theory p one hundred two et seq Now there are at least two meanings to the word interested You can use it to mean that a man is involved or that his mind is occupied John Smith for example may have been tremendously interested in the Stillman divorce case He may have read every word of the news in every lobster edition On the other hand young Guy Stillman whose legitimacy was at stake probably did not trouble himself at all John Smith was interested in a suit that did not affect his interests and Guy was uninterested in one that would determine the whole course of his life mister Cole I am afraid leans towards John Smith He is answering the very foolish objection that to vote by functions is to be voting very often If a man is not interested enough to vote and cannot be aroused to interest enough to make him vote on say a dozen distinct subjects he waives his right to vote and the result is no less democratic than if he voted blindly and without interest mister Cole thinks that the uninstructed voter waives his right to vote From this it follows that the votes of the instructed reveal their interest and their interest defines the function Footnote Cf Ch XVIII of this book Since everybody was assumed to be interested enough in important affairs only those affairs came to seem important in which everybody was interested Brown Jones and Robinson must therefore have not one vote each but as many different functional votes as there are different questions calling for associative action in which they are interested Footnote Guild Socialism p twenty four I am considerably in doubt whether mister Cole thinks that Brown Jones and Robinson should qualify in any election where they assert that they are interested or that somebody else not named picks the functions in which they are entitled to be interested If I were asked to say what I believe mister Cole thinks it would be that he has smoothed over the difficulty by the enormously strange assumption that it is the uninstructed voter who waives his right to vote and has concluded that whether functional voting is arranged by a higher power or from below on the principle that a man may vote when it interests him to vote only the instructed will be voting anyway and therefore the institution will work But there are two kinds of uninstructed voter There is the man who does not know and knows that he does not know He is generally an enlightened person He is the man who waives his right to vote But there is also the man who is uninstructed and does not know that he is or care He can always be gotten to the polls if the party machinery is working His vote is the basis of the machine And since the communes of the guild society have large powers over taxation wages prices credit and natural resources it would be preposterous to assume that elections will not be fought at least as passionately as our own The way people exhibit their interest will not then delimit the functions of a functional society There are two other ways that function might be defined One would be by the trade unions which fought the battle that brought guild socialism into being Such a struggle would harden groups of men together in some sort of functional relation and these groups would then become the vested interests of the guild socialist society Some of them like the miners and railroad men would be very strong and probably deeply attached to the view of their function which they learned from the battle with capitalism It is not at all unlikely that certain favorably placed trade unions would under a socialist state become the center of coherence and government But a guild society would inevitably find them a tough problem to deal with for direct action would have revealed their strategic power and some of their leaders at least would not offer up this power readily on the altar of freedom In order to coordinate them guild society would have to gather together its strength and fairly soon one would find I think that the radicals under guild socialism would be asking for communes strong enough to define the functions of the guilds But if you are going to have the government commune define functions the premise of the theory disappears It had to suppose that a scheme of functions was obvious in order that the concave shops would voluntarily relate themselves to society If there is no settled scheme of functions in every voter s head he has no better way under guild socialism than under orthodox democracy of turning a self centered opinion into a social judgment And of course there can be no such settled scheme because even if mister Cole and his friends devised a good one the shop democracies from which all power derives would judge the scheme in operation by what they learn of it and by what they can imagine The guilds would see the same scheme differently And so instead of the scheme being the skeleton that keeps guild society together the attempt to define what the scheme ought to be would be under guild socialism as elsewhere the main business of politics If we could allow mister Cole his scheme of functions we could allow him almost everything Unfortunately he has inserted in his premise what he wishes a guild society to deduce Footnote I have dealt with mister Cole s theory rather than with the experience of Soviet Russia because while the testimony is fragmentary all competent observers seem to agree that Russia in nineteen twenty one does not illustrate a communist state in working order Russia is in revolution and what you can learn from Russia is what a revolution is like You can learn very little about what a communist society would be like It is however immensely significant that first as practical revolutionists and then as public officials the Russian communists have relied not upon the spontaneous democracy of the Russian people but on the discipline special interest and the noblesse oblige of a specialized class the loyal and indoctrinated members of the Communist party In the transition on which no time limit has been set I believe the cure for class government and the coercive state is strictly homeopathic There is also the question of why I selected mister Cole s books rather than the much more closely reasoned Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain by Sidney and Beatrice Webb I admire that book very much but I have not been able to convince myself that it is not an intellectual tour de force mister Cole seems to me far more authentically in the spirit of the socialist movement and therefore a better witness CHAPTER XX A NEW IMAGE one THE lesson is I think a fairly clear one In the absence of institutions and education by which the environment is so successfully reported that the realities of public life stand out sharply against self centered opinion the common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality This class is irresponsible for it acts upon information that is not common property in situations that the public at large does not conceive and it can be held to account only on the accomplished fact The democratic theory by failing to admit that self centered opinions are not sufficient to procure good government is involved in perpetual conflict between theory and practice According to the theory the full dignity of man requires that his will should be as mister Cole says expressed in any and every form of social action It is supposed that the expression of their will is the consuming passion of men for they are assumed to possess by instinct the art of government But as a matter of plain experience self determination is only one of the many interests of a human personality The desire to be the master of one s own destiny is a strong desire but it has to adjust itself to other equally strong desires such as the desire for a good life for peace for relief from burdens In the original assumptions of democracy it was held that the expression of each man s will would spontaneously satisfy not only his desire for self expression but his desire for a good life because the instinct to express one s self in a good life was innate The emphasis therefore has always been on the mechanism for expressing the will The democratic El Dorado has always been some perfect environment and some perfect system of voting and representation where the innate good will and instinctive statesmanship of every man could be translated into action In limited areas and for brief periods the environment has been so favorable that is to say so isolated and so rich in opportunity that the theory worked well enough to confirm men in thinking that it was sound for all time and everywhere Then when the isolation ended and society became complex and men had to adjust themselves closely to one another the democrat spent his time trying to devise more perfect units of voting in the hope that somehow he would as mister Cole says get the mechanism right and adjust it as far as possible to men s social wills But while the democratic theorist was busy at this he was far away from the actual interests of human nature He was absorbed by one interest self government Mankind was interested in all kinds of other things in order in its rights in prosperity in sights and sounds and in not being bored In so far as spontaneous democracy does not satisfy their other interests it seems to most men most of the time to be an empty thing Because the art of successful self government is not instinctive men do not long desire self government for its own sake They desire it for the sake of the results That is why the impulse to self government is always strongest as a protest against bad conditions The democratic fallacy has been its preoccupation with the origin of government rather than with the processes and results The democrat has always assumed that if political power could be derived in the right way it would be beneficent His whole attention has been on the source of power since he is hypnotized by the belief that the great thing is to express the will of the people first because expression is the highest interest of man and second because the will is instinctively good But no amount of regulation at the source of a river will completely control its behavior and while democrats have been absorbed in trying to find a good mechanism for originating social power that is to say a good mechanism of voting and representation they neglected almost every other interest of men For no matter how power originates the crucial interest is in how power is exercised What determines the quality of civilization is the use made of power And that use cannot be controlled at the source If you try to control government wholly at the source you inevitably make all the vital decisions invisible For since there is no instinct which automatically makes political decisions that produce a good life the men who actually exercise power not only fail to express the will of the people because on most questions no will exists but they exercise power according to opinions which are hidden from the electorate If then you root out of the democratic philosophy the whole assumption in all its ramifications that government is instinctive and that therefore it can be managed by self centered opinions what becomes of the democratic faith in the dignity of man It takes a fresh lease of life by associating itself with the whole personality instead of with a meager aspect of it For the traditional democrat risked the dignity of man on one very precarious assumption that he would exhibit that dignity instinctively in wise laws and good government Voters did not do that and so the democrat was forever being made to look a little silly by tough minded men But if instead of hanging human dignity on the one assumption about self government you insist that man s dignity requires a standard of living in which his capacities are properly exercised the whole problem changes The criteria which you then apply to government are whether it is producing a certain minimum of health of decent housing of material necessities of education of freedom of pleasures of beauty not simply whether at the sacrifice of all these things it vibrates to the self centered opinions that happen to be floating around in men s minds In the degree to which these criteria can be made exact and objective political decision which is inevitably the concern of comparatively few people is actually brought into relation with the interests of men There is no prospect in any time which we can conceive that the whole invisible environment will be so clear to all men that they will spontaneously arrive at sound public opinions on the whole business of government And even if there were a prospect it is extremely doubtful whether many of us would wish to be bothered or would take the time to form an opinion on any and every form of social action which affects us The only prospect which is not visionary is that each of us in his own sphere will act more and more on a realistic picture of the invisible world and that we shall develop more and more men who are expert in keeping these pictures realistic Outside the rather narrow range of our own possible attention social control depends upon devising standards of living and methods of audit by which the acts of public officials and industrial directors are measured We cannot ourselves inspire or guide all these acts as the mystical democrat has always imagined But we can steadily increase our real control over these acts by insisting that all of them shall be plainly recorded and their results objectively measured I should say perhaps that we can progressively hope to insist For the working out of such standards and of such audits has only begun PART VII NEWSPAPERS CHAPTER XXI THE BUYING PUBLIC XXII THE CONSTANT READER XXIII THE NATURE OF NEWS XXIV NEWS TRUTH AND A CONCLUSION CHAPTER XXI THE BUYING PUBLIC one THE idea that men have to go forth and study the world in order to govern it has played a very minor part in political thought It could figure very little because the machinery for reporting the world in any way useful to government made comparatively little progress from the time of Aristotle to the age in which the premises of democracy were established Therefore if you had asked a pioneer democrat where the information was to come from on which the will of the people was to be based he would have been puzzled by the question It would have seemed a little as if you had asked him where his life or his soul came from The will of the people he almost always assumed exists at all times the duty of political science was to work out the inventions of the ballot and representative government If they were properly worked out and applied under the right conditions such as exist in the self contained village or the self contained shop the mechanism would somehow overcome the brevity of attention which Aristotle had observed and the narrowness of its range which the theory of a self contained community tacitly acknowledged We have seen how even at this late date the guild socialists are transfixed by the notion that if only you can build on the right unit of voting and representation an intricate cooperative commonwealth is possible Convinced that the wisdom was there if only you could find it democrats have treated the problem of making public opinions as a problem in civil liberties Footnote The best study is Prof Zechariah Chafee s Freedom of Speech Who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter Footnote Milton Areopagitica cited at the opening of mister Chafee s book For comment on this classic doctrine of liberty as stated by Milton John Stuart Mill and mister Bertrand Russel see my Liberty and the News Ch II Supposing that no one has ever seen it put to the worse are we to believe then that the truth is generated by the encounter like fire by rubbing two sticks Behind this classic doctrine of liberty which American democrats embodied in their Bill of Rights there are in fact several different theories of the origin of truth One is a faith that in the competition of opinions the truest will win because there is a peculiar strength in the truth This is probably sound if you allow the competition to extend over a sufficiently long time When men argue in this vein they have in mind the verdict of history and they think specifically of heretics persecuted when they lived canonized after they were dead Milton s question rests also on a belief that the capacity to recognize truth is inherent in all men and that truth freely put in circulation will win acceptance It derives no less from the experience which has shown that men are not likely to discover truth if they cannot speak it except under the eye of an uncomprehending policeman No one can possibly overestimate the practical value of these civil liberties nor the importance of maintaining them When they are in jeopardy the human spirit is in jeopardy and should there come a time when they have to be curtailed as during a war the suppression of thought is a risk to civilization which might prevent its recovery from the effects of war if the hysterics who exploit the necessity were numerous enough to carry over into peace the taboos of war Fortunately the mass of men is too tolerant long to enjoy the professional inquisitors as gradually under the criticism of men not willing to be terrorized they are revealed as mean spirited creatures who nine tenths of the time do not know what they are talking about Footnote Cf for example the publications of the Lusk Committee in New York and the public statements and prophecies of mister Mitchell Palmer who was Attorney General of the United States during the period of President Wilson s illness But in spite of its fundamental importance civil liberty in this sense does not guarantee public opinion in the modern world For it always assumes either that truth is spontaneous or that the means of securing truth exist when there is no external interference But when you are dealing with an invisible environment the assumption is false The truth about distant or complex matters is not self evident and the machinery for assembling information is technical and expensive Yet political science and especially democratic political science has never freed itself from the original assumption of Aristotle s politics sufficiently to restate the premises so that political thought might come to grips with the problem of how to make the invisible world visible to the citizens of a modern state So deep is the tradition that until quite recently for example political science was taught in our colleges as if newspapers did not exist I am not referring to schools of journalism for they are trade schools intended to prepare men and women for a career I am referring to political science as expounded to future business men lawyers public officials and citizens at large In that science a study of the press and the sources of popular information found no place It is a curious fact To anyone not immersed in the routine interests of political science it is almost inexplicable that no American student of government no American sociologist has ever written a book on news gathering There are occasional references to the press and statements that it is not or that it ought to be free and truthful But I can find almost nothing else And this disdain of the professionals finds its counterpart in public opinions Universally it is admitted that the press is the chief means of contact with the unseen environment And practically everywhere it is assumed that the press should do spontaneously for us what primitive democracy imagined each of us could do spontaneously for himself that every day and twice a day it will present us with a true picture of all the outer world in which we are interested two This insistent and ancient belief that truth is not earned but inspired revealed supplied gratis comes out very plainly in our economic prejudices as readers of newspapers We expect the newspaper to serve us with truth however unprofitable the truth may be For this difficult and often dangerous service which we recognize as fundamental we expected to pay until recently the smallest coin turned out by the mint We have accustomed ourselves now to paying two and even three cents on weekdays and on Sundays for an illustrated encyclopedia and vaudeville entertainment attached we have screwed ourselves up to paying a nickel or even a dime Nobody thinks for a moment that he ought to pay for his newspaper He expects the fountains of truth to bubble but he enters into no contract legal or moral involving any risk cost or trouble to himself He will pay a nominal price when it suits him will stop paying whenever it suits him will turn to another paper when that suits him Somebody has said quite aptly that the newspaper editor has to be re elected every day This casual and one sided relationship between readers and press is an anomaly of our civilization There is nothing else quite like it and it is therefore hard to compare the press with any other business or institution It is not a business pure and simple partly because the product is regularly sold below cost but chiefly because the community applies one ethical measure to the press and another to trade or manufacture Ethically a newspaper is judged as if it were a church or a school But if you try to compare it with these you fail the taxpayer pays for the public school the private school is endowed or supported by tuition fees there are subsidies and collections for the church You cannot compare journalism with law medicine or engineering for in every one of these professions the consumer pays for the service A free press if you judge by the attitude of the readers means newspapers that are virtually given away Yet the critics of the press are merely voicing the moral standards of the community when they expect such an institution to live on the same plane as that on which the school the church and the disinterested professions are supposed to live This illustrates again the concave character of democracy No need for artificially acquired information is felt to exist The information must come naturally that is to say gratis if not out of the heart of the citizen then gratis out of the newspaper The citizen will pay for his telephone his railroad rides his motor car his entertainment But he does not pay openly for his news He will however pay handsomely for the privilege of having someone read about him He will pay directly to advertise And he will pay indirectly for the advertisements of other people because that payment being concealed in the price of commodities is part of an invisible environment that he does not effectively comprehend It would be regarded as an outrage to have to pay openly the price of a good ice cream soda for all the news of the world though the public will pay that and more when it buys the advertised commodities The public pays for the press but only when the payment is concealed three Circulation is therefore the means to an end It becomes an asset only when it can be sold to the advertiser who buys it with revenues secured through indirect taxation of the reader Footnote An established newspaper is entitled to fix its advertising rates so that its net receipts from circulation may be left on the credit side of the profit and loss account To arrive at net receipts I would deduct from the gross the cost of promotion distribution and other expenses incidental to circulation From an address by mister Adolph S Ochs publisher of the New York Times at the Philadelphia Convention of the Associated Advertising Clubs of The World June twenty six nineteen sixteen Cited Elmer Davis History of The New York Times eighteen fifty one nineteen twenty one pp three hundred ninety seven three hundred ninety eight The kind of circulation which the advertiser will buy depends on what he has to sell It may be quality or mass On the whole there is no sharp dividing line for in respect to most commodities sold by advertising the customers are neither the small class of the very rich nor the very poor They are the people with enough surplus over bare necessities to exercise discretion in their buying The paper therefore which goes into the homes of the fairly prosperous is by and large the one which offers most to the advertiser It may also go into the homes of the poor but except for certain lines of goods an analytical advertising agent does not rate that circulation as a great asset unless as seems to be the case with certain of mister Hearst s properties the circulation is enormous A newspaper which angers those whom it pays best to reach through advertisements is a bad medium for an advertiser And since no one ever claimed that advertising was philanthropy advertisers buy space in those publications which are fairly certain to reach their future customers One need not spend much time worrying about the unreported scandals of the dry goods merchants They represent nothing really significant and incidents of this sort are less common than many critics of the press suppose The real problem is that the readers of a newspaper unaccustomed to paying the cost of newsgathering can be capitalized only by turning them into circulation that can be sold to manufacturers and merchants And those whom it is most important to capitalize are those who have the most money to spend Such a press is bound to respect the point of view of the buying public It is for this buying public that newspapers are edited and published for without that support the newspaper cannot live A newspaper can flout an advertiser it can attack a powerful banking or traction interest but if it alienates the buying public it loses the one indispensable asset of its existence mister John L Given Footnote Making a Newspaper p thirteen This is the best technical book I know and should be read by everyone who undertakes to discuss the press mister G B Diblee who wrote the volume on The Newspaper in the Home University Library says p two hundred fifty three that on the press for pressmen I only know of one good book mister Given s formerly of the New York Evening Sun stated in nineteen fourteen that out of over two thousand three hundred dailies published in the United States there were about one hundred and seventy five printed in cities having over one hundred thousand inhabitants These constitute the press for general news They are the key papers which collect the news dealing with great events and even the people who do not read any one of the one hundred and seventy five depend ultimately upon them for news of the outer world For they make up the great press associations which cooperate in the exchange of news Each is therefore not only the informant of its own readers but it is the local reporter for the newspapers of other cities The rural press and the special press by and large take their general news from these key papers And among these there are some very much richer than others so that for international news in the main the whole press of the nation may depend upon the reports of the press associations and the special services of a few metropolitan dailies Roughly speaking the economic support for general news gathering is in the price paid for advertised goods by the fairly prosperous sections of cities with more than one hundred thousand inhabitants These buying publics are composed of the members of families who depend for their income chiefly on trade merchandising the direction of manufacture and finance They are the clientele among whom it pays best to advertise in a newspaper They wield a concentrated purchasing power which may be less in volume than the aggregate for farmers and workingmen but within the radius covered by a daily newspaper they are the quickest assets four They have moreover a double claim to attention They are not only the best customers for the advertiser they include the advertisers Therefore the impression made by the newspapers on this public matters deeply Fortunately this public is not unanimous It may be capitalistic but it contains divergent views on what capitalism is and how it is to be run Except in times of danger this respectable opinion is sufficiently divided to permit of considerable differences of policy These would be greater still if it were not that publishers are themselves usually members of these urban communities and honestly see the world through the lenses of their associates and friends They are engaged in a speculative business Footnote Sometimes so speculative that in order to secure credit the publisher has to go into bondage to his creditors Information on this point is very difficult to obtain and for that reason its general importance is often much exaggerated which depends on the general condition of trade and more peculiarly on a circulation based not on a marriage contract with their readers but on free love The object of every publisher is therefore to turn his circulation from a medley of catch as catch can news stand buyers into a devoted band of constant readers A newspaper that can really depend upon the loyalty of its readers is as independent as a newspaper can be given the economics of modern journalism Footnote It is an axiom in newspaper publishing more readers more independence of the influence of advertisers fewer readers and more dependence on the advertiser It may seem like a contradiction yet it is the truth to assert the greater the number of advertisers the less influence they are individually able to exercise with the publisher Adolph S Ochs of supra A body of readers who stay by it through thick and thin is a power greater than any which the individual advertiser can wield and a power great enough to break up a combination of advertisers Therefore whenever you find a newspaper betraying its readers for the sake of an advertiser you can be fairly certain either that the publisher sincerely shares the views of the advertiser or that he thinks perhaps mistakenly he cannot count upon the support of his readers if he openly resists dictation It is a question of whether the readers who do not pay in cash for their news will pay for it in loyalty CHAPTER XXII THE CONSTANT READER I THE loyalty of the buying public to a newspaper is not stipulated in any bond In almost every other enterprise the person who expects to be served enters into an agreement that controls his passing whims At least he pays for what he obtains In the publishing of periodicals the nearest approach to an agreement for a definite time is the paid subscription and that is not I believe a great factor in the economy of a metropolitan daily The reader is the sole and the daily judge of his loyalty and there can be no suit against him for breach of promise or nonsupport Though everything turns on the constancy of the reader there does not exist even a vague tradition to call that fact to the reader s mind His constancy depends on how he happens to feel or on his habits And these depend not simply on the quality of the news but more often on a number of obscure elements that in our casual relation to the press we hardly take the trouble to make conscious The most important of these is that each of us tends to judge a newspaper if we judge it at all by its treatment of that part of the news in which we feel ourselves involved The newspaper deals with a multitude of events beyond our experience But it deals also with some events within our experience And by its handling of those events we most frequently decide to like it or dislike it to trust it or refuse to have the sheet in the house If the newspaper gives a satisfactory account of that which we think we know our business our church our party it is fairly certain to be immune from violent criticism by us What better criterion does the man at the breakfast table possess than that the newspaper version checks up with his own opinion Therefore most men tend to hold the newspaper most strictly accountable in their capacity not of general readers but of special pleaders on matters of their own experience Rarely is anyone but the interested party able to test the accuracy of a report If the news is local and if there is competition the editor knows that he will probably hear from the man who thinks his portrait unfair and inaccurate But if the news is not local the corrective diminishes as the subject matter recedes into the distance The only people who can correct what they think is a false picture of themselves printed in another city are members of groups well enough organized to hire publicity men Now it is interesting to note that the general reader of a newspaper has no standing in law if he thinks he is being misled by the news It is only the aggrieved party who can sue for slander or libel and he has to prove a material injury to himself The law embodies the tradition that general news is not a matter of common concern Footnote The reader will not mistake this as a plea for censorship It might however be a good thing if there were competent tribunals preferably not official ones where charges of untruthfulness and unfairness in the general news could be sifted Cf Liberty and the News pp seventy three seventy six except as to matter which is vaguely described as immoral or seditious But the body of the news though unchecked as a whole by the disinterested reader consists of items about which some readers have very definite preconceptions Those items are the data of his judgment and news which men read without this personal criterion they judge by some other standard than their standard of accuracy They are dealing here with a subject matter which to them is indistinguishable from fiction The canon of truth cannot be applied They do not boggle over such news if it conforms to their stereotypes and they continue to read it if it interests them Footnote Note for example how absent is indignation in mister Upton Sinclair against socialist papers even those which are as malignantly unfair to employers as certain of the papers cited by him are unfair to radicals two There are newspapers even in large cities edited on the principle that the readers wish to read about themselves The theory is that if enough people see their own names in the paper often enough can read about their weddings funerals sociables foreign travels lodge meetings school prizes their fiftieth birthdays their sixtieth birthdays their silver weddings their outings and clambakes they will make a reliable circulation The classic formula for such a newspaper is contained in a letter written by Horace Greeley on April three eighteen sixty to Friend Fletcher who was about to start a country newspaper Footnote Cited James Melvin Lee The History of American Journalism p four hundred five I Begin with a clear conception that the subject of deepest interest to an average human being is himself next to that he is most concerned about his neighbors Asia and the Tongo Islands stand a long way after these in his regard Do not let a new church be organized or new members be added to one already existing a farm be sold a new house raised a mill set in motion a store opened nor anything of interest to a dozen families occur without having the fact duly though briefly chronicled in your columns If a farmer cuts a big tree or grows a mammoth beet or harvests a bounteous yield of wheat or corn set forth the fact as concisely and unexceptionally as possible The function of becoming as mister Lee puts it the printed diary of the home town is one that every newspaper no matter where it is published must in some measure fill And where as in a great city like New York the general newspapers circulated broadcast cannot fill it there exist small newspapers published on Greeley s pattern for sections of the city In the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx there are perhaps twice as many local dailies as there are general newspapers Footnote Cf John L Given Making a Newspaper p thirteen And they are supplemented by all kinds of special publications for trades religions nationalities These diaries are published for people who find their own lives interesting But there are also great numbers of people who find their own lives dull and wish like Hedda Gabler to live a more thrilling life For them there are published a few whole newspapers and sections of others devoted to the personal lives of a set of imaginary people with whose gorgeous vices the reader can in his fancy safely identify himself mister Hearst s unflagging interest in high society caters to people who never hope to be in high society and yet manage to derive some enhancement out of the vague feeling that they are part of the life that they read about In the great cities the printed diary of the home town tends to be the printed diary of a smart set And it is as we have already noted the dailies of the cities which carry the burden of bringing distant news to the private citizen But it is not primarily their political and social news which holds the circulation The interest in that is intermittent and few publishers can bank on it alone The newspaper therefore takes to itself a variety of other features all primarily designed to hold a body of readers together who so far as big news is concerned are not able to be critical Moreover in big news the competition in any one community is not very serious The press services standardize the main events it is only once in a while that a great scoop is made there is apparently not a very great reading public for such massive reporting as has made the New York Times of recent years indispensable to men of all shades of opinion In order to differentiate themselves and collect a steady public most papers have to go outside the field of general news They go to the dazzling levels of society to scandal and crime to sports pictures actresses advice to the lovelorn highschool notes women s pages buyer s pages cooking receipts chess whist gardening comic strips thundering partisanship not because publishers and editors are interested in everything but news but because they have to find some way of holding on to that alleged host of passionately interested readers who are supposed by some critics of the press to be clamoring for the truth and nothing but the truth The newspaper editor occupies a strange position His enterprises depend upon indirect taxation levied by his advertisers upon his readers the patronage of the advertisers depends upon the editor s skill in holding together an effective group of customers These customers deliver judgment according to their private experiences and their stereotyped expectations for in the nature of things they have no independent knowledge of most news they read If the judgment is not unfavorable the editor is at least within range of a circulation that pays But in order to secure that circulation he cannot rely wholly upon news of the greater environment He handles that as interestingly as he can of course but the quality of the general news especially about public affairs is not in itself sufficient to cause very large numbers of readers to discriminate among the dailies This somewhat left handed relationship between newspapers and public information is reflected in the salaries of newspaper men Reporting which theoretically constitutes the foundation of the whole institution is the most poorly paid branch of newspaper work and is the least regarded By and large able men go into it only by necessity or for experience and with the definite intention of being graduated as soon as possible For straight reporting is not a career that offers many great rewards The rewards in journalism go to specialty work to signed correspondence which has editorial quality to executives and to men with a knack and flavor of their own This is due no doubt to what economists call the rent of ability But this economic principle operates with such peculiar violence in journalism that newsgathering does not attract to itself anything like the number of trained and able men which its public importance would seem to demand The fact that the able men take up straight reporting with the intention of leaving it as soon as possible is I think the chief reason why it has never developed in sufficient measure those corporate traditions that give to a profession prestige and a jealous self respect For it is these corporate traditions which engender the pride of craft which tend to raise the standards of admission punish breaches of the code and give men the strength to insist upon their status in society three Yet all this does not go to the root of the matter For while the economics of journalism is such as to depress the value of news reporting it is I am certain a false determinism which would abandon the analysis at that point The intrinsic power of the reporter appears to be so great the number of very able men who pass through reporting is so large that there must be some deeper reason why comparatively speaking so little serious effort has gone into raising the vocation to the level say of medicine engineering or law mister Upton Sinclair speaks for a large body of opinion in America Footnote mister Hilaire Belloc makes practically the same analysis for English newspapers Cf The Free Press when he claims that in what he calls The Brass Check he has found this deeper reason The Brass Check is found in your pay envelope every week you who write and print and distribute our newspapers and magazines The Brass check is the price of your shame you who take the fair body of truth and sell it in the market place who betray the virgin hopes of mankind into the loathsome brothel of Big Business Footnote Upton Sinclair The Brass Check A Study of American Journalism p one hundred sixteen It would seem from this that there exists a body of known truth and a set of well founded hopes which are prostituted by a more or less conscious conspiracy of the rich owners of newspapers If this theory is correct then a certain conclusion follows It is that the fair body of truth would be inviolate in a press not in any way connected with Big Business For if it should happen that a press not controlled by and not even friendly with Big Business somehow failed to contain the fair body of truth something would be wrong with mister Sinclair s theory There is such a press Strange to say in proposing a remedy mister Sinclair does not advise his readers to subscribe to the nearest radical newspaper Why not If the troubles of American journalism go back to the Brass Check of Big Business why does not the remedy lie in reading the papers that do not in any remote way accept the Brass Check Why subsidize a National News with a large board of directors of all creeds or causes to print a paper full of facts regardless of what is injured the Steel Trust or the I W W the Standard Oil Company or the Socialist Party If the trouble is Big Business that is the Steel Trust Standard Oil and the like why not urge everybody to read I W W or Socialist papers mister Sinclair does not say why not But the reason is simple He cannot convince anybody not even himself that the anti capitalist press is the remedy for the capitalist press He ignores the anti capitalist press both in his theory of the Brass Check and in his constructive proposal But if you are diagnosing American journalism you cannot ignore it If what you care about is the fair body of truth you do not commit the gross logical error of assembling all the instances of unfairness and lying you can find in one set of newspapers ignore all the instances you could easily find in another set and then assign as the cause of the lying the one supposedly common characteristic of the press to which you have confined your investigation If you are going to blame capitalism for the faults of the press you are compelled to prove that those faults do not exist except where capitalism controls That mister Sinclair cannot do this is shown by the fact that while in his diagnosis he traces everything to capitalism in his prescription he ignores both capitalism and anti capitalism One would have supposed that the inability to take any non capitalist paper as a model of truthfulness and competence would have caused mister Sinclair and those who agree with him to look somewhat more critically at their assumptions They would have asked themselves for example where is the fair body of truth that Big Business prostitutes but anti Big Business does not seem to obtain For that question leads I believe to the heart of the matter to the question of what is news CHAPTER XXIII THE NATURE OF NEWS one ALL the reporters in the world working all the hours of the day could not witness all the happenings in the world There are not a great many reporters And none of them has the power to be in more than one place at a time Reporters are not clairvoyant they do not gaze into a crystal ball and see the world at will they are not assisted by thought transference Yet the range of subjects these comparatively few men manage to cover would be a miracle indeed if it were not a standardized routine Newspapers do not try to keep an eye on all mankind Footnote See the illuminating chapter in mister John L Given s book already cited on Uncovering the News Ch V They have watchers stationed at certain places like Police Headquarters the Coroner s Office the County Clerk s Office City Hall the White House the Senate House of Representatives and so forth They watch or rather in the majority of cases they belong to associations which employ men who watch a comparatively small number of places where it is made known when the life of anyone departs from ordinary paths or when events worth telling about occur For example John Smith let it be supposed becomes a broker For ten years he pursues the even tenor of his way and except for his customers and his friends no one gives him a thought To the newspapers he is as if he were not But in the eleventh year he suffers heavy losses and at last his resources all gone summons his lawyer and arranges for the making of an assignment The lawyer posts off to the County Clerk s office and a clerk there makes the necessary entries in the official docket Here in step the newspapers While the clerk is writing Smith s business obituary a reporter glances over his shoulder and a few minutes later the reporters know Smith s troubles and are as well informed concerning his business status as they would be had they kept a reporter at his door every day for over ten years Footnote Op cit p fifty seven When mister Given says that the newspapers know Smith s troubles and his business status he does not mean that they know them as Smith knows them or as mister Arnold Bennett would know them if he had made Smith the hero of a three volume novel The newspapers know only in a few minutes the bald facts which are recorded in the County Clerk s Office That overt act uncovers the news about Smith Whether the news will be followed up or not is another matter The point is that before a series of events become news they have usually to make themselves noticeable in some more or less overt act Generally too in a crudely overt act Smith s friends may have known for years that he was taking risks rumors may even have reached the financial editor if Smith s friends were talkative But apart from the fact that none of this could be published because it would be libel there is in these rumors nothing definite on which to peg a story Something definite must occur that has unmistakable form It may be the act of going into bankruptcy it may be a fire a collision an assault a riot an arrest a denunciation the introduction of a bill a speech a vote a meeting the expressed opinion of a well known citizen an editorial in a newspaper a sale a wage schedule a price change the proposal to build a bridge There must be a manifestation The course of events must assume a certain definable shape and until it is in a phase where some aspect is an accomplished fact news does not separate itself from the ocean of possible truth two Naturally there is room for wide difference of opinion as to when events have a shape that can be reported A good journalist will find news oftener than a hack If he sees a building with a dangerous list he does not have to wait until it falls into the street in order to recognize news It was a great reporter who guessed the name of the next Indian Viceroy when he heard that Lord So and So was inquiring about climates There are lucky shots but the number of men who can make them is small Usually it is the stereotyped shape assumed by an event at an obvious place that uncovers the run of the news The most obvious place is where people s affairs touch public authority De minimis non curat lex It is at these places that marriages births deaths contracts failures arrivals departures lawsuits disorders epidemics and calamities are made known In the first instance therefore the news is not a mirror of social conditions but the report of an aspect that has obtruded itself The news does not tell you how the seed is germinating in the ground but it may tell you when the first sprout breaks through the surface It may even tell you what somebody says is happening to the seed under ground It may tell you that the sprout did not come up at the time it was expected The more points then at which any happening can be fixed objectified measured named the more points there are at which news can occur So if some day a legislature having exhausted all other ways of improving mankind should forbid the scoring of baseball games it might still be possible to play some sort of game in which the umpire decided according to his own sense of fair play how long the game should last when each team should go to bat and who should be regarded as the winner If that game were reported in the newspapers it would consist of a record of the umpire s decisions plus the reporter s impression of the hoots and cheers of the crowd plus at best a vague account of how certain men who had no specified position on the field moved around for a few hours on an unmarked piece of sod The more you try to imagine the logic of so absurd a predicament the more clear it becomes that for the purposes of newsgathering let alone the purposes of playing the game it is impossible to do much without an apparatus and rules for naming scoring recording Because that machinery is far from perfect the umpire s life is often a distracted one Many crucial plays he has to judge by eye The last vestige of dispute could be taken out of the game as it has been taken out of chess when people obey the rules if somebody thought it worth his while to photograph every play It was the moving pictures which finally settled a real doubt in many reporters minds owing to the slowness of the human eye as to just what blow of Dempsey s knocked out Carpentier Wherever there is a good machinery of record the modern news service works with great precision There is one on the stock exchange and the news of price movements is flashed over tickers with dependable accuracy There is a machinery for election returns and when the counting and tabulating are well done the result of a national election is usually known on the night of the election In civilized communities deaths births marriages and divorces are recorded and are known accurately except where there is concealment or neglect The machinery exists for some and only some aspects of industry and government in varying degrees of precision for securities money and staples bank clearances realty transactions wage scales It exists for imports and exports because they pass through a custom house and can be directly recorded It exists in nothing like the same degree for internal trade and especially for trade over the counter It will be found I think that there is a very direct relation between the certainty of news and the system of record If you call to mind the topics which form the principal indictment by reformers against the press you find they are subjects in which the newspaper occupies the position of the umpire in the unscored baseball game All news about states of mind is of this character so are all descriptions of personalities of sincerity aspiration motive intention of mass feeling of national feeling of public opinion the policies of foreign governments So is much news about what is going to happen So are questions turning on private profit private income wages working conditions the efficiency of labor educational opportunity unemployment Footnote Think of what guess work went into the Reports of Unemployment in nineteen twenty one monotony health discrimination unfairness restraint of trade waste backward peoples conservatism imperialism radicalism liberty honor righteousness All involve data that are at best spasmodically recorded The data may be hidden because of a censorship or a tradition of privacy they may not exist because nobody thinks record important because he thinks it red tape or because nobody has yet invented an objective system of measurement Then the news on these subjects is bound to be debatable when it is not wholly neglected The events which are not scored are reported either as personal and conventional opinions or they are not news They do not take shape until somebody protests or somebody investigates or somebody publicly in the etymological meaning of the word makes an issue of them This is the underlying reason for the existence of the press agent The enormous discretion as to what facts and what impressions shall be reported is steadily convincing every organized group of people that whether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it the exercise of discretion cannot be left to the reporter It is safer to hire a press agent who stands between the group and the newspapers Having hired him the temptation to exploit his strategic position is very great Shortly before the war says mister Frank Cobb the newspapers of New York took a census of the press agents who were regularly employed and regularly accredited and found that there were about twelve hundred of them How many there are now nineteen nineteen I do not pretend to know but what I do know is that many of the direct channels to news have been closed and the information for the public is first filtered through publicity agents The great corporations have them the banks have them the railroads have them all the organizations of business and of social and political activity have them and they are the media through which news comes Even statesmen have them Footnote Address before the Women s City Club of New York Dec eleven nineteen nineteen Reprinted New Republic Dec thirty one nineteen nineteen p forty four Were reporting the simple recovery of obvious facts the press agent would be little more than a clerk But since in respect to most of the big topics of news the facts are not simple and not at all obvious but subject to choice and opinion it is natural that everyone should wish to make his own choice of facts for the newspapers to print The publicity man does that And in doing it he certainly saves the reporter much trouble by presenting him a clear picture of a situation out of which he might otherwise make neither head nor tail But it follows that the picture which the publicity man makes for the reporter is the one he wishes the public to see He is censor and propagandist responsible only to his employers and to the whole truth responsible only as it accords with the employers conception of his own interests The development of the publicity man is a clear sign that the facts of modern life do not spontaneously take a shape in which they can be known They must be given a shape by somebody and since in the daily routine reporters cannot give a shape to facts and since there is little disinterested organization of intelligence the need for some formulation is being met by the interested parties three The good press agent understands that the virtues of his cause are not news unless they are such strange virtues that they jut right out of the routine of life This is not because the newspapers do not like virtue but because it is not worth while to say that nothing has happened when nobody expected anything to happen So if the publicity man wishes free publicity he has speaking quite accurately to start something He arranges a stunt obstructs the traffic teases the police somehow manages to entangle his client or his cause with an event that is already news The suffragists knew this did not particularly enjoy the knowledge but acted on it and kept suffrage in the news long after the arguments pro and con were straw in their mouths and people were about to settle down to thinking of the suffrage movement as one of the established institutions of American life Footnote Cf Inez Haynes Irwin The Story of the Woman s Party It is not only a good account of a vital part of a great agitation but a reservoir of material on successful non revolutionary non conspiring agitation under modern conditions of public attention public interest and political habit Fortunately the suffragists as distinct from the feminists had a perfectly concrete objective and a very simple one What the vote symbolizes is not simple as the ablest advocates and the ablest opponents knew But the right to vote is a simple and familiar right Now in labor disputes which are probably the chief item in the charges against newspapers the right to strike like the right to vote is simple enough But the causes and objects of a particular strike are like the causes and objects of the woman s movement extremely subtle Let us suppose the conditions leading up to a strike are bad What is the measure of evil A certain conception of a proper standard of living hygiene economic security and human dignity The industry may be far below the theoretical standard of the community and the workers may be too wretched to protest Conditions may be above the standard and the workers may protest violently The standard is at best a vague measure However we shall assume that the conditions are below par as par is understood by the editor Occasionally without waiting for the workers to threaten but prompted say by a social worker he will send reporters to investigate and will call attention to bad conditions Necessarily he cannot do that often For these investigations cost time money special talent and a lot of space To make plausible a report that conditions are bad you need a good many columns of print In order to tell the truth about the steel worker in the Pittsburgh district there was needed a staff of investigators a great deal of time and several fat volumes of print It is impossible to suppose that any daily newspaper could normally regard the making of Pittsburgh Surveys or even Interchurch Steel Reports as one of its tasks News which requires so much trouble as that to obtain is beyond the resources of a daily press Footnote Not long ago Babe Ruth was jailed for speeding Released from jail just before the afternoon game started he rushed into his waiting automobile and made up for time lost in jail by breaking the speed laws on his way to the ball grounds No policeman stopped him but a reporter timed him and published his speed the next morning Babe Ruth is an exceptional man Newspapers cannot time all motorists They have to take their news about speeding from the police The bad conditions as such are not news because in all but exceptional cases journalism is not a first hand report of the raw material It is a report of that material after it has been stylized Thus bad conditions might become news if the Board of Health reported an unusually high death rate in an industrial area Failing an intervention of this sort the facts do not become news until the workers organize and make a demand upon their employers Even then if an easy settlement is certain the news value is low whether or not the conditions themselves are remedied in the settlement But if industrial relations collapse into a strike or lockout the news value increases If the stoppage involves a service on which the readers of the newspapers immediately depend or if it involves a breach of order the news value is still greater The underlying trouble appears in the news through certain easily recognizable symptoms a demand a strike disorder From the point of view of the worker or of the disinterested seeker of justice the demand the strike and the disorder are merely incidents in a process that for them is richly complicated But since all the immediate realities lie outside the direct experience both of the reporter and of the special public by which most newspapers are supported they have normally to wait for a signal in the shape of an overt act When that signal comes say through a walkout of the men or a summons for the police it calls into play the stereotypes people have about strikes and disorders The unseen struggle has none of its own flavor It is noted abstractly and that abstraction is then animated by the immediate experience of the reader and reporter Obviously this is a very different experience from that which the strikers have They feel let us say the temper of the foreman the nerve racking monotony of the machine the depressingly bad air the drudgery of their wives the stunting of their children the dinginess of their tenements The slogans of the strike are invested with these feelings But the reporter and reader see at first only a strike and some catchwords They invest these with their feelings Their feelings may be that their jobs are insecure because the strikers are stopping goods they need in their work that there will be shortage and higher prices that it is all devilishly inconvenient These too are realities And when they give color to the abstract news that a strike has been called it is in the nature of things that the workers are at a disadvantage It is in the nature that is to say of the existing system of industrial relations that news arising from grievances or hopes by workers should almost invariably be uncovered by an overt attack on production You have therefore the circumstances in all their sprawling complexity the overt act which signalizes them the stereotyped bulletin which publishes the signal and the meaning that the reader himself injects after he has derived that meaning from the experience which directly affects him Now the reader s experience of a strike may be very important indeed but from the point of view of the central trouble which caused the strike it is eccentric Yet this eccentric meaning is automatically the most interesting Footnote Cf Ch XI The Enlisting of Interest To enter imaginatively into the central issues is for the reader to step out of himself and into very different lives It follows that in the reporting of strikes the easiest way is to let the news be uncovered by the overt act and to describe the event as the story of interference with the reader s life That is where his attention is first aroused and his interest most easily enlisted A great deal I think myself the crucial part of what looks to the worker and the reformer as deliberate misrepresentation on the part of newspapers is the direct outcome of a practical difficulty in uncovering the news and the emotional difficulty of making distant facts interesting unless as Emerson says we can perceive them to be only a new version of our familiar experience and can set about translating them at once into our parallel facts Footnote From his essay entitled Art and Criticism The quotation occurs in a passage cited on page eighty seven of Professor R W Brown s The Writer s Art If you study the way many a strike is reported in the press you will find very often that the issues are rarely in the headlines barely in the leading paragraphs and sometimes not even mentioned anywhere A labor dispute in another city has to be very important before the news account contains any definite information as to what is in dispute The routine of the news works that way with modifications it works that way in regard to political issues and international news as well The news is an account of the overt phases that are interesting and the pressure on the newspaper to adhere to this routine comes from many sides It comes from the economy of noting only the stereotyped phase of a situation It comes from the difficulty of finding journalists who can see what they have not learned to see It comes from the almost unavoidable difficulty of finding sufficient space in which even the best journalist can make plausible an unconventional view It comes from the economic necessity of interesting the reader quickly and the economic risk involved in not interesting him at all or of offending him by unexpected news insufficiently or clumsily described All these difficulties combined make for uncertainty in the editor when there are dangerous issues at stake and cause him naturally to prefer the indisputable fact and a treatment more readily adapted to the reader s interest The indisputable fact and the easy interest are the strike itself and the reader s inconvenience All the subtler and deeper truths are in the present organization of industry very unreliable truths They involve judgments about standards of living productivity human rights that are endlessly debatable in the absence of exact record and quantitative analysis And as long as these do not exist in industry the run of news about it will tend as Emerson said quoting from Isocrates to make of moles mountains and of mountains moles Footnote Id supra Where there is no constitutional procedure in industry and no expert sifting of evidence and the claims the fact that is sensational to the reader is the fact that almost every journalist will seek Given the industrial relations that so largely prevail even where there is conference or arbitration but no independent filtering of the facts for decision the issue for the newspaper public will tend not to be the issue for the industry And so to try disputes by an appeal through the newspapers puts a burden upon newspapers and readers which they cannot and ought not to carry As long as real law and order do not exist the bulk of the news will unless consciously and courageously corrected work against those who have no lawful and orderly method of asserting themselves The bulletins from the scene of action will note the trouble that arose from the assertion rather than the reasons which led to it The reasons are intangible four The editor deals with these bulletins He sits in his office reads them rarely does he see any large portion of the events themselves He must as we have seen woo at least a section of his readers every day because they will leave him without mercy if a rival paper happens to hit their fancy He works under enormous pressure for the competition of newspapers is often a matter of minutes Every bulletin requires a swift but complicated judgment It must be understood put in relation to other bulletins also understood and played up or played down according to its probable interest for the public as the editor conceives it Without standardization without stereotypes without routine judgments without a fairly ruthless disregard of subtlety the editor would soon die of excitement The final page is of a definite size must be ready at a precise moment there can be only a certain number of captions on the items and in each caption there must be a definite number of letters Always there is the precarious urgency of the buying public the law of libel and the possibility of endless trouble The thing could not be managed at all without systematization for in a standardized product there is economy of time and effort as well as a partial guarantee against failure It is here that newspapers influence each other most deeply Thus when the war broke out the American newspapers were confronted with a subject about which they had no previous experience Certain dailies rich enough to pay cable tolls took the lead in securing news and the way that news was presented became a model for the whole press But where did that model come from It came from the English press not because Northcliffe owned American newspapers but because at first it was easier to buy English correspondence and because later it was easier for American journalists to read English newspapers than it was for them to read any others London was the cable and news center and it was there that a certain technic for reporting the war was evolved Something similar occurred in the reporting of the Russian Revolution In that instance access to Russia was closed by military censorship both Russian and Allied and closed still more effectively by the difficulties of the Russian language But above all it was closed to effective news reporting by the fact that the hardest thing to report is chaos even though it is an evolving chaos This put the formulating of Russian news at its source in Helsingfors Stockholm Geneva Paris and London into the hands of censors and propagandists They were for a long time subject to no check of any kind Until they had made themselves ridiculous they created let us admit out of some genuine aspects of the huge Russian maelstrom a set of stereotypes so evocative of hate and fear that the very best instinct of journalism its desire to go and see and tell was for a long time crushed Footnote Cf A Test of the News by Walter Lippmann and Charles Merz assisted by Faye Lippmann New Republic August four nineteen twenty five Every newspaper when it reaches the reader is the result of a whole series of selections as to what items shall be printed in what position they shall be printed how much space each shall occupy what emphasis each shall have There are no objective standards here There are conventions Take two newspapers published in the same city on the same morning The headline of one reads Britain pledges aid to Berlin against French aggression France openly backs Poles The headline of the second is missus Stillman s Other Love Which you prefer is a matter of taste but not entirely a matter of the editor s taste It is a matter of his judgment as to what will absorb the half hour s attention a certain set of readers will give to his newspaper Now the problem of securing attention is by no means equivalent to displaying the news in the perspective laid down by religious teaching or by some form of ethical culture It is a problem of provoking feeling in the reader of inducing him to feel a sense of personal identification with the stories he is reading News which does not offer this opportunity to introduce oneself into the struggle which it depicts cannot appeal to a wide audience The audience must participate in the news much as it participates in the drama by personal identification Just as everyone holds his breath when the heroine is in danger as he helps Babe Ruth swing his bat so in subtler form the reader enters into the news In order that he shall enter he must find a familiar foothold in the story and this is supplied to him by the use of stereotypes They tell him that if an association of plumbers is called a combine it is appropriate to develop his hostility if it is called a group of leading business men the cue is for a favorable reaction It is in a combination of these elements that the power to create opinion resides Editorials reinforce Sometimes in a situation that on the news pages is too confusing to permit of identification they give the reader a clue by means of which he engages himself A clue he must have if as most of us must he is to seize the news in a hurry A suggestion of some sort he demands which tells him so to speak where he a man conceiving himself to be such and such a person shall integrate his feelings with the news he reads It has been said writes Walter Bagehot Footnote On the Emotion of Conviction Literary Studies Vol Ill p one hundred seventy two that if you can only get a middleclass Englishman to think whether there are snails in Sirius he will soon have an opinion on it It will be difficult to make him think but if he does think he cannot rest in a negative he will come to some decision And on any ordinary topic of course it is so A grocer has a full creed as to foreign policy a young lady a complete theory of the sacraments as to which neither has any doubt whatever Yet that same grocer will have many doubts about his groceries and that young lady marvelously certain about the sacraments may have all kinds of doubts as to whether to marry the grocer and if not whether it is proper to accept his attentions The ability to rest in the negative implies either a lack of interest in the result or a vivid sense of competing alternatives In the case of foreign policy or the sacraments the interest in the results is intense while means for checking the opinion are poor This is the plight of the reader of the general news If he is to read it at all he must be interested that is to say he must enter into the situation and care about the outcome But if he does that he cannot rest in a negative and unless independent means of checking the lead given him by his newspaper exists the very fact that he is interested may make it difficult to arrive at that balance of opinions which may most nearly approximate the truth The more passionately involved he becomes the more he will tend to resent not only a different view but a disturbing bit of news That is why many a newspaper finds that having honestly evoked the partisanship of its readers it can not easily supposing the editor believes the facts warrant it change position If a change is necessary the transition has to be managed with the utmost skill and delicacy Usually a newspaper will not attempt so hazardous a performance It is easier and safer to have the news of that subject taper off and disappear thus putting out the fire by starving it CHAPTER XXIV NEWS TRUTH AND A CONCLUSION As we begin to make more and more exact studies of the press much will depend upon the hypothesis we hold 
6080_233342_000002_000001	train-clean-360	If we assume with mister Sinclair and most of his opponents that news and truth are two words for the same thing we shall I believe arrive nowhere 
6080_233342_000002_000002	train-clean-360	We shall prove that on this point the newspaper lied 
none	none	We shall prove that on that point mister Sinclair s account lied We shall demonstrate that mister Sinclair lied when he said that somebody lied and that somebody lied when he said mister Sinclair lied We shall vent our feelings but we shall vent them into air The hypothesis which seems to me the most fertile is that news and truth are not the same thing and must be clearly distinguished Footnote When I wrote Liberty and the News I did not understand this distinction clearly enough to state it but cf p eighty nine ff The function of news is to signalize an event the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts to set them into relation with each other and make a picture of reality on which men can act Only at those points where social conditions take recognizable and measurable shape do the body of truth and the body of news coincide That is a comparatively small part of the whole field of human interest 
6080_233342_000003_000003	train-clean-360	In this sector and only in this sector the tests of the news are sufficiently exact to make the charges of perversion or suppression more than a partisan judgment 
none	none	There is no defense no extenuation no excuse whatever for stating six times that Lenin is dead when the only information the paper possesses is a report that he is dead from a source repeatedly shown to be unreliable The news in that instance is not Lenin Dead but Helsingfors Says Lenin is Dead And a newspaper can be asked to take the responsibility of not making Lenin more dead than the source of the news is reliable if there is one subject on which editors are most responsible it is in their judgment of the reliability of the source 
6080_233342_000003_000006	train-clean-360	But when it comes to dealing for example with stories of what the Russian people want no such test exists 
6080_233342_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The absence of these exact tests accounts I think for the character of the profession as no other explanation does 
none	none	There is a very small body of exact knowledge which it requires no outstanding ability or training to deal with 
6080_233342_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The rest is in the journalist s own discretion Once he departs from the region where it is definitely recorded at the County Clerk s office that John Smith has gone into bankruptcy all fixed standards disappear 
none	none	The story of why John Smith failed his human frailties the analysis of the economic conditions on which he was shipwrecked all of this can be told in a hundred different ways There is no discipline in applied psychology as there is a discipline in medicine engineering or even law which has authority to direct the journalist s mind when he passes from the news to the vague realm of truth 
6080_233342_000004_000004	train-clean-360	There are no canons to direct his own mind and no canons that coerce the reader s judgment or the publisher s 
none	none	His version of the truth is only his version 
6080_233342_000004_000006	train-clean-360	How can he demonstrate the truth as he sees it 
none	none	He cannot demonstrate it any more than mister Sinclair Lewis can demonstrate that he has told the whole truth about Main Street And the more he understands his own weaknesses the more ready he is to admit that where there is no objective test his own opinion is in some vital measure constructed out of his own stereotypes according to his own code and by the urgency of his own interest He knows that he is seeing the world through subjective lenses He cannot deny that he too is as Shelley remarked a dome of many colored glass which stains the white radiance of eternity And by this knowledge his assurance is tempered 
6080_233342_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He may have all kinds of moral courage and sometimes has but he lacks that sustaining conviction of a certain technic which finally freed the physical sciences from theological control 
none	none	It was the gradual development of an irrefragable method that gave the physicist his intellectual freedom as against all the powers of the world 
6080_233342_000005_000003	train-clean-360	His proofs were so clear his evidence so sharply superior to tradition that he broke away finally from all control 
6080_233342_000005_000004	train-clean-360	But the journalist has no such support in his own conscience or in fact 
none	none	The control exercised over him by the opinions of his employers and his readers is not the control of truth by prejudice but of one opinion by another opinion that it is not demonstrably less true Between Judge Gary s assertion that the unions will destroy American institutions and mister Gomper s assertion that they are agencies of the rights of man the choice has in large measure to be governed by the will to believe 
6080_233342_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The task of deflating these controversies and reducing them to a point where they can be reported as news is not a task which the reporter can perform 
none	none	It is possible and necessary for journalists to bring home to people the uncertain character of the truth on which their opinions are founded and by criticism and agitation to prod social science into making more usable formulations of social facts and to prod statesmen into establishing more visible institutions 
6080_233342_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The press in other words can fight for the extension of reportable truth 
none	none	But as social truth is organized to day the press is not constituted to furnish from one edition to the next the amount of knowledge which the democratic theory of public opinion demands This is not due to the Brass Check as the quality of news in radical papers shows but to the fact that the press deals with a society in which the governing forces are so imperfectly recorded 
6080_233342_000006_000005	train-clean-360	The theory that the press can itself record those forces is false 
6080_233342_000006_000006	train-clean-360	It can normally record only what has been recorded for it by the working of institutions 
6080_233342_000006_000007	train-clean-360	Everything else is argument and opinion and fluctuates with the vicissitudes the self consciousness and the courage of the human mind 
6080_233342_000007_000000	train-clean-360	If the press is not so universally wicked nor so deeply conspiring as mister Sinclair would have us believe it is very much more frail than the democratic theory has as yet admitted 
6080_233342_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It is too frail to carry the whole burden of popular sovereignty to supply spontaneously the truth which democrats hoped was inborn 
6080_233342_000007_000002	train-clean-360	And when we expect it to supply such a body of truth we employ a misleading standard of judgment 
none	none	We misunderstand the limited nature of news the illimitable complexity of society we overestimate our own endurance public spirit and all round competence We suppose an appetite for uninteresting truths which is not discovered by any honest analysis of our own tastes 
6080_233342_000008_000000	train-clean-360	If the newspapers then are to be charged with the duty of translating the whole public life of mankind so that every adult can arrive at an opinion on every moot topic they fail they are bound to fail in any future one can conceive they will continue to fail 
none	none	It is not possible to assume that a world carried on by division of labor and distribution of authority can be governed by universal opinions in the whole population 
6080_233342_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Unconsciously the theory sets up the single reader as theoretically omnicompetent and puts upon the press the burden of accomplishing whatever representative government industrial organization and diplomacy have failed to accomplish 
6080_233342_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Acting upon everybody for thirty minutes in twenty four hours the press is asked to create a mystical force called Public Opinion that will take up the slack in public institutions 
none	none	The press has often mistakenly pretended that it could do just that It has at great moral cost to itself encouraged a democracy still bound to its original premises to expect newspapers to supply spontaneously for every organ of government for every social problem the machinery of information which these do not normally supply themselves 
6080_233342_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Institutions having failed to furnish themselves with instruments of knowledge have become a bundle of problems which the population as a whole reading the press as a whole is supposed to solve 
none	none	The press in other words has come to be regarded as an organ of direct democracy charged on a much wider scale and from day to day with the function often attributed to the initiative referendum and recall 
6080_233342_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The Court of Public Opinion open day and night is to lay down the law for everything all the time 
6080_233342_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It is not workable 
6080_233342_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And when you consider the nature of news it is not even thinkable 
6080_233342_000009_000004	train-clean-360	For the news as we have seen is precise in proportion to the precision with which the event is recorded 
none	none	Unless the event is capable of being named measured given shape made specific it either fails to take on the character of news or it is subject to the accidents and prejudices of observation Therefore on the whole the quality of the news about modern society is an index of its social organization The better the institutions the more all interests concerned are formally represented the more issues are disentangled the more objective criteria are introduced the more perfectly an affair can be presented as news At its best the press is a servant and guardian of institutions at its worst it is a means by which a few exploit social disorganization to their own ends In the degree to which institutions fail to function the unscrupulous journalist can fish in troubled waters and the conscientious one must gamble with uncertainties 
6080_233342_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The press is no substitute for institutions 
none	none	It is like the beam of a searchlight that moves restlessly about bringing one episode and then another out of darkness into vision Men cannot do the work of the world by this light alone 
6080_233342_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They cannot govern society by episodes incidents and eruptions 
none	none	It is only when they work by a steady light of their own that the press when it is turned upon them reveals a situation intelligible enough for a popular decision 
6080_233342_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The trouble lies deeper than the press and so does the remedy 
none	none	It lies in social organization based on a system of analysis and record and in all the corollaries of that principle in the abandonment of the theory of the omnicompetent citizen in the decentralization of decision in the coordination of decision by comparable record and analysis If at the centers of management there is a running audit which makes work intelligible to those who do it and those who superintend it issues when they arise are not the mere collisions of the blind 
6080_233342_000011_000008	train-clean-360	Then too the news is uncovered for the press by a system of intelligence that is also a check upon the press 
6080_233342_000012_000000	train-clean-360	That is the radical way 
none	none	For the troubles of the press like the troubles of representative government be it territorial or functional like the troubles of industry be it capitalist cooperative or communist go back to a common source to the failure of self governing people to transcend their casual experience and their prejudice by inventing creating and organizing a machinery of knowledge 
6080_233342_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It is because they are compelled to act without a reliable picture of the world that governments schools newspapers and churches make such small headway against the more obvious failings of democracy against violent prejudice apathy preference for the curious trivial as against the dull important and the hunger for sideshows and three legged calves 
6080_233342_000012_000003	train-clean-360	This is the primary defect of popular government a defect inherent in its traditions and all its other defects can I believe be traced to this one 
none	none	PART VIII ORGANIZED INTELLIGENCE CHAPTER XXV THE ENTERING WEDGE XXVI INTELLIGENCE WORK XXVII THE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC XXVIII THE APPEAL TO REASON CHAPTER XXV THE ENTERING WEDGE one If the remedy were interesting American pioneers like Charles McCarthy Robert Valentine and Frederick W Taylor would not have had to fight so hard for a hearing But it is clear why they had to fight and why bureaus of governmental research industrial audits budgeting and the like are the ugly ducklings of reform They reverse the process by which interesting public opinions are built up Instead of presenting a casual fact a large screen of stereotypes and a dramatic identification they break down the drama break through the stereotypes and offer men a picture of facts which is unfamiliar and to them impersonal When this is not painful it is dull and those to whom it is painful the trading politician and the partisan who has much to conceal often exploit the dullness that the public feels in order to remove the pain that they feel two Yet every complicated community has sought the assistance of special men of augurs priests elders Our own democracy based though it was on a theory of universal competence sought lawyers to manage its government and to help manage its industry It was recognized that the specially trained man was in some dim way oriented to a wider system of truth than that which arises spontaneously in the amateur s mind But experience has shown that the traditional lawyer s equipment was not enough assistance The Great Society had grown furiously and to colossal dimensions by the application of technical knowledge It was made by engineers who had learned to use exact measurements and quantitative analysis It could not be governed men began to discover by men who thought deductively about rights and wrongs It could be brought under human control only by the technic which had created it Gradually then the more enlightened directing minds have called in experts who were trained or had trained themselves to make parts of this Great Society intelligible to those who manage it These men are known by all kinds of names as statisticians accountants auditors industrial counsellors engineers of many species scientific managers personnel administrators research men scientists and sometimes just as plain private secretaries They have brought with them each a jargon of his own as well as filing cabinets card catalogues graphs loose leaf contraptions and above all the perfectly sound ideal of an executive who sits before a flat top desk one sheet of typewritten paper before him and decides on matters of policy presented in a form ready for his rejection or approval This whole development has been the work not so much of a spontaneous creative evolution as of blind natural selection The statesman the executive the party leader the head of a voluntary association found that if he had to discuss two dozen different subjects in the course of the day somebody would have to coach him He began to clamor for memoranda He found he could not read his mail He demanded somebody who would blue pencil the interesting sentences in the important letters He found he could not digest the great stacks of type written reports that grew mellow on his desk He demanded summaries He found he could not read an unending series of figures He embraced the man who made colored pictures of them He found that he really did not know one machine from another He hired engineers to pick them and tell him how much they cost and what they could do He peeled off one burden after another as a man will take off first his hat then his coat then his collar when he is struggling to move an unwieldy load three Yet curiously enough though he knew that he needed help he was slow to call in the social scientist The chemist the physicist the geologist had a much earlier and more friendly reception Laboratories were set up for them inducements offered for there was quick appreciation of the victories over nature But the scientist who has human nature as his problem is in a different case There are many reasons for this the chief one that he has so few victories to exhibit He has so few because unless he deals with the historic past he cannot prove his theories before offering them to the public The physical scientist can make an hypothesis test it revise the hypothesis hundreds of times and if after all that he is wrong no one else has to pay the price But the social scientist cannot begin to offer the assurance of a laboratory test and if his advice is followed and he is wrong the consequences may be incalculable He is in the nature of things far more responsible and far less certain But more than that In the laboratory sciences the student has conquered the dilemma of thought and action He brings a sample of the action to a quiet place where it can be repeated at will and examined at leisure But the social scientist is constantly being impaled on a dilemma If he stays in his library where he has the leisure to think he has to rely upon the exceedingly casual and meager printed record that comes to him through official reports newspapers and interviews If he goes out into the world where things are happening he has to serve a long often wasteful apprenticeship before he is admitted to the sanctum where they are being decided What he cannot do is to dip into action and out again whenever it suits him There are no privileged listeners The man of affairs observing that the social scientist knows only from the outside what he knows in part at least from the inside recognizing that the social scientist s hypothesis is not in the nature of things susceptible of laboratory proof and that verification is possible only in the real world has developed a rather low opinion of social scientists who do not share his views of public policy In his heart of hearts the social scientist shares this estimate of himself He has little inner certainty about his own work He only half believes in it and being sure of nothing he can find no compelling reason for insisting on his own freedom of thought What can he actually claim for it in the light of his own conscience Footnote Cf Charles E Merriam The Present State of the Study of Politics American Political Science Review Vol XV No two May nineteen twenty one His data are uncertain his means of verification lacking The very best qualities in him are a source of frustration For if he is really critical and saturated in the scientific spirit he cannot be doctrinaire and go to Armageddon against the trustees and the students and the Civic Federation and the conservative press for a theory of which he is not sure If you are going to Armageddon you have to battle for the Lord but the political scientist is always a little doubtful whether the Lord called him Consequently if so much of social science is apologetic rather than constructive the explanation lies in the opportunities of social science not in capitalism The physical scientists achieved their freedom from clericalism by working out a method that produced conclusions of a sort that could not be suppressed or ignored They convinced themselves and acquired dignity and knew what they were fighting for The social scientist will acquire his dignity and his strength when he has worked out his method He will do that by turning into opportunity the need among directing men of the Great Society for instruments of analysis by which an invisible and made intelligible But as things go now the social scientist assembles his data out of a mass of unrelated material Social processes are recorded spasmodically quite often as accidents of administration A report to Congress a debate an investigation legal briefs a census a tariff a tax schedule the material like the skull of the Piltdown man has to be put together by ingenious inference before the student obtains any sort of picture of the event he is studying Though it deals with the conscious life of his fellow citizens it is all too often distressingly opaque because the man who is trying to generalize has practically no supervision of the way his data are collected Imagine medical research conducted by students who could rarely go into a hospital were deprived of animal experiment and compelled to draw conclusions from the stories of people who had been ill the reports of nurses each of whom had her own system of diagnosis and the statistics compiled by the Bureau of Internal Revenue on the excess profits of druggists The social scientist has usually to make what he can out of categories that were uncritically in the mind of an official who administered some part of a law or who was out to justify to persuade to claim or to prove The student knows this and as a protection against it has developed that branch of scholarship which is an elaborated suspicion about where to discount his information That is a virtue but it becomes a very thin virtue when it is merely a corrective for the unwholesome position of social science For the scholar is condemned to guess as shrewdly as he can why in a situation not clearly understood something or other may have happened But the expert who is employed as the mediator among representatives and as the mirror and measure of administration has a very different control of the facts Instead of being the man who generalizes from the facts dropped to him by the men of action he becomes the man who prepares the facts for the men of action This is a profound change in his strategic position He no longer stands outside chewing the cud provided by busy men of affairs but he takes his place in front of decision instead of behind it To day the sequence is that the man of affairs finds his facts and decides on the basis of them then some time later the social scientist deduces excellent reasons why he did or did not decide wisely This ex post facto relationship is academic in the bad sense of that fine word The real sequence should be one where the disinterested expert first finds and formulates the facts for the man of action and later makes what wisdom he can out of comparison between the decision which he understands and the facts which he organized four For the physical sciences this change in strategic position began slowly and then accelerated rapidly There was a time when the inventor and the engineer were romantic half starved outsiders treated as cranks The business man and the artisan knew all the mysteries of their craft Then the mysteries grew more mysterious and at last industry began to depend upon physical laws and chemical combinations that no eye could see and only a trained mind could conceive The scientist moved from his noble garret in the Latin Quarter into office buildings and laboratories For he alone could construct a working image of the reality on which industry rested From the new relationship he took as much as he gave perhaps more pure science developed faster than applied though it drew its economic support a great deal of its inspiration and even more of its relevancy from constant contact with practical decision But physical science still labored under the enormous limitation that the men who made decisions had only their commonsense to guide them They administered without scientific aid a world complicated by scientists Again they had to deal with facts they could not apprehend and as once they had to call in engineers they now have to call in statisticians accountants experts of all sorts These practical students are the true pioneers of a new social science They are in mesh with the driving wheels Footnote Cf The Address of the President of the American Philosophical Association mister Ralph Barton Perry Dec twenty eight nineteen twenty Published in the Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Meeting and from this practical engagement of science and action both will benefit radically action by the clarification of its beliefs beliefs by a continuing test in action We are in the earliest beginnings But if it is conceded that all large forms of human association must because of sheer practical difficulty contain men who will come to see the need for an expert reporting of their particular environment then the imagination has a premise on which to work In the exchange of technic and result among expert staffs one can see I think the beginning of experimental method in social science When each school district and budget and health department and factory and tariff schedule is the material of knowledge for every other the number of comparable experiences begins to approach the dimensions of genuine experiment In forty eight states and twenty four hundred cities and two hundred seventy seven thousand school houses two hundred seventy thousand manufacturing establishments twenty seven thousand mines and quarries there is a wealth of experience if only it were recorded and available And there is too opportunity for trial and error at such slight risk that any reasonable hypothesis might be given a fair test without shaking the foundations of society The wedge has been driven not only by some directors of industry and some statesmen who had to have help but by the bureaus of municipal research Footnote The number of these organizations in the United States is very great Some are alive some half dead They are in rapid flux Lists of them supplied to me by doctor L D Upson of the Detroit Bureau of Governmental Research Miss Rebecca B Rankin of the Municipal Reference Library of New York City mister Edward A Fitzpatrick Secretary of the State Board of Education Wisconsin mister Savel Zimand of the Bureau of Industrial Research New York City run into the hundreds the legislative reference libraries the specialized lobbies of corporations and trade unions and public causes and by voluntary organizations like the League of Women Voters the Consumers League the Manufacturers Associations by hundreds of trade associations and citizens unions by publications like the Searchlight on Congress and the Survey and by foundations like the General Education Board Not all by any means are disinterested That is not the point All of them do begin to demonstrate the need for interposing some form of expertness between the private citizen and the vast environment in which he is entangled CHAPTER XXVI INTELLIGENCE WORK one THE practice of democracy has been ahead of its theory For the theory holds that the adult electors taken together make decisions out of a will that is in them But just as there grew up governing hierarchies which were invisible in theory so there has been a large amount of constructive adaptation also unaccounted for in the image of democracy Ways have been found to represent many interests and functions that are normally out of sight We are most conscious of this in our theory of the courts when we explain their legislative powers and their vetoes on the theory that there are interests to be guarded which might be forgotten by the elected officials But the Census Bureau when it counts classifies and correlates people things and changes is also speaking for unseen factors in the environment The Geological Survey makes mineral resources evident the Department of Agriculture represents in the councils of the nation factors of which each farmer sees only an infinitesimal part School authorities the Tariff Commission the consular service the Bureau of Internal Revenue give representation to persons ideas and objects which would never automatically find themselves represented in this perspective by an election The Children s Bureau is the spokesman of a whole complex of interests and functions not ordinarily visible to the voter and therefore incapable of becoming spontaneously a part of his public opinions Thus the printing of comparative statistics of infant mortality is often followed by a reduction of the death rate of babies Municipal officials and voters did not have before publication a place in their picture of the environment for those babies The statistics made them visible as visible as if the babies had elected an alderman to air their grievances In the State Department the government maintains a Division of Far Eastern Affairs What is it for The Japanese and the Chinese Governments both maintain ambassadors in Washington Are they not qualified to speak for the Far East They are its representatives Yet nobody would argue that the American Government could learn all that it needed to know about the Far East by consulting these ambassadors Supposing them to be as candid as they know how to be they are still limited channels of information Therefore to supplement them we maintain embassies in Tokio and Peking and consular agents at many points Also I assume some secret agents These people are supposed to send reports which pass through the Division of Far Eastern Affairs to the Secretary of State Now what does the Secretary expect of the Division I know one who expected it to spend its appropriation But there are Secretaries to whom special revelation is denied and they turn to their divisions for help The last thing they expect to find is a neat argument justifying the American position What they demand is that the experts shall bring the Far East to the Secretary s desk with all the elements in such relation that it is as if he were in contact with the Far East itself The expert must translate simplify generalize but the inference from the result must apply in the East not merely on the premises of the report If the Secretary is worth his salt the very last thing he will tolerate in his experts is the suspicion that they have a policy He does not want to know from them whether they like Japanese policy in China He wants to know what different classes of Chinese and Japanese English Frenchmen Germans and Russians think about it and what they are likely to do because of what they think He wants all that represented to him as the basis of his decision The more faithfully the Division represents what is not otherwise represented either by the Japanese or American ambassadors or the Senators and Congressmen from the Pacific coast the better Secretary of State he will be He may decide to take his policy from the Pacific Coast but he will take his view of Japan from Japan two It is no accident that the best diplomatic service in the world is the one in which the divorce between the assembling of knowledge and the control of policy is most perfect During the war in many British Embassies and in the British Foreign Office there were nearly always men permanent officials or else special appointees who quite successfully discounted the prevailing war mind They discarded the rigmarole of being pro and con of having favorite nationalities and pet aversions and undelivered perorations in their bosoms They left that to the political chiefs But in an American Embassy I once heard an ambassador say that he never reported anything to Washington which would not cheer up the folks at home He charmed all those who met him helped many a stranded war worker and was superb when he unveiled a monument He did not understand that the power of the expert depends upon separating himself from those who make the decisions upon not caring in his expert self what decision is made The man who like the ambassador takes a line and meddles with the decision is soon discounted There he is just one more on that side of the question For when he begins to care too much he begins to see what he wishes to see and by that fact ceases to see what he is there to see He is there to represent the unseen He represents people who are not voters functions of voters that are not evident events that are out of sight mute people unborn people relations between things and people He has a constituency of intangibles And intangibles cannot be used to form a political majority because voting is in the last analysis a test of strength a sublimated battle and the expert represents no strength available in the immediate But he can exercise force by disturbing the line up of the forces By making the invisible visible he confronts the people who exercise material force with a new environment sets ideas and feelings at work in them throws them out of position and so in the profoundest way affects the decision Men cannot long act in a way that they know is a contradiction of the environment as they conceive it If they are bent on acting in a certain way they have to reconceive the environment they have to censor out to rationalize But if in their presence there is an insistent fact which is so obtrusive that they cannot explain it away one of three courses is open They can perversely ignore it though they will cripple themselves in the process will overact their part and come to grief They can take it into account but refuse to act They pay in internal discomfort and frustration Or and I believe this to be the most frequent case they adjust their whole behavior to the enlarged environment The idea that the expert is an ineffectual person because he lets others make the decisions is quite contrary to experience The more subtle the elements that enter into the decision the more irresponsible power the expert wields He is certain moreover to exercise more power in the future than ever he did before because increasingly the relevant facts will elude the voter and the administrator All governing agencies will tend to organize bodies of research and information which will throw out tentacles and expand as have the intelligence departments of all the armies in the world But the experts will remain human beings They will enjoy power and their temptation will be to appoint themselves censors and so absorb the real function of decision Unless their function is correctly defined they will tend to pass on the facts they think appropriate and to pass down the decisions they approve They will tend in short to become a bureaucracy The only institutional safeguard is to separate as absolutely as it is possible to do so the staff which executes from the staff which investigates The two should be parallel but quite distinct bodies of men recruited differently paid if possible from separate funds responsible to different heads intrinsically uninterested in each other s personal success In industry the auditors accountants and inspectors should be independent of the manager the superintendents foremen and in time I believe we shall come to see that in order to bring industry under social control the machinery of record will have to be independent of the boards of directors and the shareholders three But in building the intelligence sections of industry and politics we do not start on cleared ground And apart from insisting on this basic separation of function it would be cumbersome to insist too precisely on the form which in any particular instance the principle shall take There are men who believe in intelligence work and will adopt it there are men who do not understand it but cannot do their work without it there are men who will resist But provided the principle has a foothold somewhere in every social agency it will make progress and the way to begin is to begin In the federal government for example it is not necessary to straighten out the administrative tangle and the illogical duplications of a century s growth in order to find a neat place for the intelligence bureaus which Washington so badly needs Before election you can promise to rush bravely into the breach But when you arrive there all out of breath you find that each absurdity is invested with habits strong interests and chummy Congressmen Attack all along the line and you engage every force of reaction You go forth to battle as the poet said and you always fall You can lop off an antiquated bureau here a covey of clerks there you can combine two bureaus And by that time you are busy with the tariff and the railroads and the era of reform is over Besides in order to effect a truly logical reorganization of the government such as all candidates always promise you would have to disturb more passions than you have time to quell And any new scheme supposing you had one ready would require officials to man it Say what one will about officeholders even Soviet Russia was glad to get many of the old ones back and these old officials if they are too ruthlessly treated will sabotage Utopia itself No administrative scheme is workable without good will and good will about strange practices is impossible without education The better way is to introduce into the existing machinery wherever you can find an opening agencies that will hold up a mirror week by week month by month You can hope then to make the machine visible to those who work it as well as to the chiefs who are responsible and to the public outside When the office holders begin to see themselves or rather when the outsiders the chiefs and the subordinates all begin to see the same facts the same damning facts if you like the obstruction will diminish The reformer s opinion that a certain bureau is inefficient is just his opinion not so good an opinion in the eyes of the bureau as its own But let the work of that bureau be analysed and recorded and then compared with other bureaus and with private corporations and the argument moves to another plane There are ten departments at Washington represented in the Cabinet Suppose then there was a permanent intelligence section for each What would be some of the conditions of effectiveness Beyond all others that the intelligence officials should be independent both of the Congressional Committees dealing with that department and of the Secretary at the head of it that they should not be entangled either in decision or in action Independence then would turn mainly on three points on funds tenure and access to the facts For clearly if a particular Congress or departmental official can deprive them of money dismiss them or close the files the staff becomes its creature four The question of funds is both important and difficult No agency of research can be really free if it depends upon annual doles from what may be a jealous or a parsimonious congress Yet the ultimate control of funds cannot be removed from the legislature The financial arrangement should insure the staff against left handed joker and rider attack against sly destruction and should at the same time provide for growth The staff should be so well entrenched that an attack on its existence would have to be made in the open It might perhaps work behind a federal charter creating a trust fund and a sliding scale over a period of years based on the appropriation for the department to which the intelligence bureau belonged No great sums of money are involved anyway The trust fund might cover the overhead and capital charges for a certain minimum staff the sliding scale might cover the enlargements At any rate the appropriation should be put beyond accident like the payment of any long term obligation This is a much less serious way of tying the hands of Congress than is the passage of a Constitutional amendment or the issuance of government bonds Congress could repeal the charter But it would have to repeal it not throw monkey wrenches into it Tenure should be for life with provision for retirement on a liberal pension with sabbatical years set aside for advanced study and training and with dismissal only after a trial by professional colleagues The conditions which apply to any non profit making intellectual career should apply here If the work is to be salient the men who do it must have dignity security and in the upper ranks at least that freedom of mind which you find only where men are not too immediately concerned in practical decision Access to the materials should be established in the organic act The bureau should have the right to examine all papers and to question any official or any outsider Continuous investigation of this sort would not at all resemble the sensational legislative inquiry and the spasmodic fishing expedition which are now a common feature of our government The bureau should have the right to propose accounting methods to the department and if the proposal is rejected or violated after it has been accepted to appeal under its charter to Congress In the first instance each intelligence bureau would be the connecting link between Congress and the Department a better link in my judgment than the appearance of cabinet officers on the floor of both House and Senate though the one proposal in no way excludes the other The bureau would be the Congressional eye on the execution of its policy It would be the departmental answer to Congressional criticism And then since operation of the Department would be permanently visible perhaps Congress would cease to feel the need of that minute legislation born of distrust and a false doctrine of the separation of powers which does so much to make efficient administration difficult five But of course each of the ten bureaus could not work in a watertight compartment In their relation one to another lies the best chance for that coordination of which so much is heard and so little seen Clearly the various staffs would need to adopt wherever possible standards of measurement that were comparable They would exchange their records Then if the War Department and the Post Office both buy lumber hire carpenters or construct brick walls they need not necessarily do them through the same agency for that might mean cumbersome over centralization but they would be able to use the same measure for the same things be conscious of the comparisons and be treated as competitors And the more competition of this sort the better For the value of competition is determined by the value of the standards used to measure it Instead then of asking ourselves whether we believe in competition we should ask ourselves whether we believe in that for which the competitors compete No one in his senses expects to abolish competition for when the last vestige of emulation had disappeared social effort would consist in mechanical obedience to a routine tempered in a minority by native inspiration Yet no one expects to work out competition to its logical conclusion in a murderous struggle of each against all The problem is to select the goals of competition and the rules of the game Almost always the most visible and obvious standard of measurement will determine the rules of the game such as money power popularity applause or mister Veblen s conspicuous waste What other standards of measurement does our civilization normally provide How does it measure efficiency productivity service for which we are always clamoring By and large there are no measures and there is therefore not so much competition to achieve these ideals For the difference between the higher and the lower motives is not as men often assert a difference between altruism and selfishness Footnote Cf Ch XII It is a difference between acting for easily understood aims and for aims that are obscure and vague Exhort a man to make more profit than his neighbor and he knows at what to aim Exhort him to render more social service and how is he to be certain what service is social What is the test what is the measure A subjective feeling somebody s opinion Tell a man in time of peace that he ought to serve his country and you have uttered a pious platitude Tell him in time of war and the word service has a meaning it is a number of concrete acts enlistment or buying bonds or saving food or working for a dollar a year and each one of these services he sees definitely as part of a concrete purpose to put at the front an army larger and better armed than the enemy s So the more you are able to analyze administration and work out elements that can be compared the more you invent quantitative measures for the qualities you wish to promote the more you can turn competition to ideal ends If you can contrive the right index numbers Footnote I am not using the term index numbers in its purely technical meaning but to cover any device for the comparative measurement of social phenomena you can set up a competition between individual workers in a shop between shops between factories between schools Footnote See for example An Index Number for State School Systems by Leonard P Ayres Russell Sage Foundation nineteen twenty The principle of the quota was very successfully applied in the Liberty Loan Campaigns and under very much more difficult circumstances by the Allied Maritime Transport Council between government departments between regiments between divisions between ships between states counties cities and the better your index numbers the more useful the competition six The possibilities that lie in the exchange of material are evident Each department of government is all the time asking for information that may already have been obtained by another department though perhaps in a somewhat different form The State Department needs to know let us say the extent of the Mexican oil reserves their relation to the rest of the world s supply the present ownership of Mexican oil lands the importance of oil to warships now under construction or planned the comparative costs in different fields How does it secure such information to day The information is probably scattered through the Departments of Interior Justice Commerce Labor and Navy Either a clerk in the State Department looks up Mexican oil in a book of reference which may or may not be accurate or somebody s private secretary telephones somebody else s private secretary asks for a memorandum and in the course of time a darkey messenger arrives with an armful of unintelligible reports The Department should be able to call on its own intelligence bureau to assemble the facts in a way suited to the diplomatic problem up for decision And these facts the diplomatic intelligence bureau would obtain from the central clearing house Footnote There has been a vast development of such services among the trade associations The possibilities of a perverted use were revealed by the New York Building Trades investigation of nineteen twenty one This establishment would pretty soon become a focus of information of the most extraordinary kind And the men in it would be made aware of what the problems of government really are They would deal with problems of definition of terminology of statistical technic of logic they would traverse concretely the whole gamut of the social sciences It is difficult to see why all this material except a few diplomatic and military secrets should not be open to the scholars of the country It is there that the political scientist would find the real nuts to crack and the real researches for his students to make The work need not all be done in Washington but it could be done in reference to Washington The central agency would thus have in it the makings of a national university The staff could be recruited there for the bureaus from among college graduates They would be working on theses selected after consultation between the curators of the national university and teachers scattered over the country If the association was as flexible as it ought to be there would be as a supplement to the permanent staff a steady turnover of temporary and specialist appointments from the universities and exchange lecturers called out from Washington Thus the training and the recruiting of the staff would go together A part of the research itself would be done by students and political science in the universities would be associated with politics in America seven In its main outlines the principle is equally applicable to state governments to cities and to rural counties The work of comparison and interchange could take place by federations of state and city and county bureaus And within those federations any desirable regional combination could be organized So long as the accounting systems were comparable a great deal of duplication would be avoided Regional coordination is especially desirable For legal frontiers often do not coincide with the effective environments Yet they have a certain basis in custom that it would be costly to disturb By coordinating their information several administrative areas could reconcile autonomy of decision with cooperation New York City for example is already an unwieldy unit for good government from the City Hall Yet for many purposes such as health and transportation the metropolitan district is the true unit of administration In that district however there are large cities like Yonkers Jersey City Paterson Elizabeth Hoboken Bayonne They could not all be managed from one center and yet they should act together for many functions Ultimately perhaps some such flexible scheme of local government as Sidney and Beatrice Webb have suggested may be the proper solution Footnote The Reorganization of Local Government Ch IV in A Constitution for the Socialist Commonwealth of Great Britain But the first step would be a coordination not of decision and action but of information and research Let the officials of the various municipalities see their common problems in the light of the same facts eight It would be idle to deny that such a net work of intelligence bureaus in politics and industry might become a dead weight and a perpetual irritation One can easily imagine its attraction for men in search of soft jobs for pedants for meddlers One can see red tape mountains of papers questionnaires ad nauseam seven copies of every document endorsements delays lost papers the use of form one hundred thirty six instead of form twogb the return of the document because pencil was used instead of ink or black ink instead of red ink The work could be done very badly There are no fool proof institutions But if one could assume that there was circulation through the whole system between government departments factories offices and the universities a circulation of men a circulation of data and of criticism the risks of dry rot would not be so great Nor would it be true to say that these intelligence bureaus will complicate life They will tend on the contrary to simplify by revealing a complexity now so great as to be humanly unmanageable The present fundamentally invisible system of government is so intricate that most people have given up trying to follow it and because they do not try they are tempted to think it comparatively simple It is on the contrary elusive concealed opaque The employment of an intelligence system would mean a reduction of personnel per unit of result because by making available to all the experience of each it would reduce the amount of trial and error and because by making the social process visible it would assist the personnel to self criticism It does not involve a great additional band of officials if you take into account the time now spent vainly by special investigating committees grand juries district attorneys reform organizations and bewildered office holders in trying to find their way through a dark muddle If the analysis of public opinion and of the democratic theories in relation to the modern environment is sound in principle then I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that such intelligence work is the clue to betterment I am not referring to the few suggestions contained in this chapter They are merely illustrations The task of working out the technic is in the hands of men trained to do it and not even they can to day completely foresee the form much less the details The number of social phenomena which are now recorded is small the instruments of analysis are very crude the concepts often vague and uncriticized But enough has been done to demonstrate I think that unseen environments can be reported effectively that they can be reported to divergent groups of people in a way which is neutral to their prejudice and capable of overcoming their subjectivism If that is true then in working out the intelligence principle men will find the way to overcome the central difficulty of self government the difficulty of dealing with an unseen reality Because of that difficulty it has been impossible for any self governing community to reconcile its need for isolation with the necessity for wide contact to reconcile the dignity and individuality of local decision with security and wide coordination to secure effective leaders without sacrificing responsibility to have useful public opinions without attempting universal public opinions on all subjects As long as there was no way of establishing common versions of unseen events common measures for separate actions the only image of democracy that would work even in theory was one based on an isolated community of people whose political faculties were limited according to Aristotle s famous maxim by the range of their vision But now there is a way out a long one to be sure but a way It is fundamentally the same way as that which has enabled a citizen of Chicago with no better eyes or ears than an Athenian to see and hear over great distances It is possible to day it will become more possible when more labor has gone into it to reduce the discrepancies between the conceived environment and the effective environment As that is done federalism will work more and more by consent less and less by coercion For while federalism is the only possible method of union among self governing groups Footnote Cf H J Laski The Foundations of Sovereignty and other Essays particularly the Essay of this name as well as the Problems of Administrative Areas The Theory of Popular Sovereignty and The Pluralistic State federalism swings either towards imperial centralization or towards parochial anarchy wherever the union is not based on correct and commonly accepted ideas of federal matters These ideas do not arise spontaneously They have to be pieced together by generalization based on analysis and the instruments for that analysis have to be invented and tested by research No electoral device no manipulation of areas no change in the system of property goes to the root of the matter You cannot take more political wisdom out of human beings than there is in them And no reform however sensational is truly radical which does not consciously provide a way of overcoming the subjectivism of human opinion based on the limitation of individual experience There are systems of government of voting and representation which extract more than others But in the end knowledge must come not from the conscience but from the environment with which that conscience deals When men act on the principle of intelligence they go out to find the facts and to make their wisdom When they ignore it they go inside themselves and find only what is there They elaborate their prejudice instead of increasing their knowledge CHAPTER XXVII THE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC one IN real life no one acts on the theory that he can have a public opinion on every public question though this fact is often concealed where a person thinks there is no public question because he has no public opinion But in the theory of our politics we continue to think more literally than Lord Bryce intended that the action of Opinion is continuous Footnote Modern Democracies Vol I p one hundred fifty nine even though its action deals with broad principles only Footnote Id footnote p one hundred fifty eight And then because we try to think of ourselves having continuous opinions without being altogether certain what a broad principle is we quite naturally greet with an anguished yawn an argument that seems to involve the reading of more government reports more statistics more curves and more graphs For all these are in the first instance just as confusing as partisan rhetoric and much less entertaining The amount of attention available is far too small for any scheme in which it was assumed that all the citizens of the nation would after devoting themselves to the publications of all the intelligence bureaus become alert informed and eager on the multitude of real questions that never do fit very well into any broad principle I am not making that assumption Primarily the intelligence bureau is an instrument of the man of action of the representative charged with decision of the worker at his work and if it does not help them it will help nobody in the end But in so far as it helps them to understand the environment in which they are working it makes what they do visible And by that much they become more responsible to the general public The purpose then is not to burden every citizen with expert opinions on all questions but to push that burden away from him towards the responsible administrator An intelligence system has value of course as a source of general information and as a check on the daily press But that is secondary Its real use is as an aid to representative government and administration both in politics and industry The demand for the assistance of expert reporters in the shape of accountants statisticians secretariats and the like comes not from the public but from men doing public business who can no longer do it by rule of thumb It is in origin and in ideal an instrument for doing public business better rather than an instrument for knowing better how badly public business is done two As a private citizen as a sovereign voter no one could attempt to digest these documents But as one party to a dispute as a committeeman in a legislature as an officer in government business or a trade union as a member of an industrial council reports on the specific matter at issue will be increasingly welcome The private citizen interested in some cause would belong as he does now to voluntary societies which employed a staff to study the documents and make reports that served as a check on officialdom There would be some study of this material by newspaper men and a good deal by experts and by political scientists But the outsider and every one of us is an outsider to all but a few aspects of modern life has neither time nor attention nor interest nor the equipment for specific judgment It is on the men inside working under conditions that are sound that the daily administrations of society must rest The general public outside can arrive at judgments about whether these conditions are sound only on the result after the event and on the procedure before the event The broad principles on which the action of public opinion can be continuous are essentially principles of procedure The outsider can ask experts to tell him whether the relevant facts were duly considered he cannot in most cases decide for himself what is relevant or what is due consideration The outsider can perhaps judge whether the groups interested in the decision were properly heard whether the ballot if there was one was honestly taken and perhaps whether the result was honestly accepted He can watch the procedure when the news indicates that there is something to watch He can raise a question as to whether the procedure itself is right if its normal results conflict with his ideal of a good life Footnote Cf Chapter XX But if he tries in every case to substitute himself for the procedure to bring in Public Opinion like a providential uncle in the crisis of a play he will confound his own confusion He will not follow any train of thought consecutively For the practice of appealing to the public on all sorts of intricate matters means almost always a desire to escape criticism from those who know by enlisting a large majority which has had no chance to know The verdict is made to depend on who has the loudest or the most entrancing voice the most skilful or the most brazen publicity man the best access to the most space in the newspapers For even when the editor is scrupulously fair to the other side fairness is not enough There may be several other sides unmentioned by any of the organized financed and active partisans The private citizen beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion will soon see perhaps that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence As his civic education takes account of the complexity of his environment he will concern himself about the equity and the sanity of procedure and even this he will in most cases expect his elected representative to watch for him He will refuse himself to accept the burden of these decisions and will turn down his thumbs in most cases on those who in their hurry to win rush from the conference table with the first dope for the reporters Only by insisting that problems shall not come up to him until they have passed through a procedure can the busy citizen of a modern state hope to deal with them in a form that is intelligible For issues as they are stated by a partisan almost always consist of an intricate series of facts as he has observed them surrounded by a large fatty mass of stereotyped phrases charged with his emotion According to the fashion of the day he will emerge from the conference room insisting that what he wants is some soulfilling idea like Justice Welfare Americanism Socialism On such issues the citizen outside can sometimes be provoked to fear or admiration but to judgment never Before he can do anything with the argument the fat has to be boiled out of it for him three That can be done by having the representative inside carry on discussion in the presence of some one chairman or mediator who forces the discussion to deal with the analyses supplied by experts This is the essential organization of any representative body dealing with distant matters The partisan voices should be there but the partisans should find themselves confronted with men not personally involved who control enough facts and have the dialectical skill to sort out what is real perception from what is stereotype pattern and elaboration It is the Socratic dialogue with all of Socrates s energy for breaking through words to meanings and something more than that because the dialectic in modern life must be done by men who have explored the environment as well as the human mind There is for example a grave dispute in the steel industry Each side issues a manifesto full of the highest ideals The only public opinion that is worth respect at this stage is the opinion which insists that a conference be organized For the side which says its cause is too just to be contaminated by conference there can be little sympathy since there is no such cause anywhere among mortal men Perhaps those who object to conference do not say quite that Perhaps they say that the other side is too wicked they cannot shake hands with traitors All that public opinion can do then is to organize a hearing by public officials to hear the proof of wickedness It cannot take the partisans word for it But suppose a conference is agreed to and suppose there is a neutral chairman who has at his beck and call the consulting experts of the corporation the union and let us say the Department of Labor Judge Gary states with perfect sincerity that his men are well paid and not overworked and then proceeds to sketch the history of Russia from the time of Peter the Great to the murder of the Czar mister Foster rises states with equal sincerity that the men are exploited and then proceeds to outline the history of human emancipation from Jesus of Nazareth to Abraham Lincoln At this point the chairman calls upon the intelligence men for wage tables in order to substitute for the words well paid and exploited a table showing what the different classes are paid Does Judge Gary think they are all well paid He does Does mister Foster think they are all exploited No he thinks that groups C M and X are exploited What does he mean by exploited He means they are not paid a living wage They are says Judge Gary What can a man buy on that wage asks the chairman Nothing says mister Foster Everything he needs says Judge Gary The chairman consults the budgets and price statistics of the government Footnote See an article on The Cost of Living and Wage Cuts in the New Republic July twenty seven nineteen twenty one by doctor Leo Wolman for a brilliant discussion of the naive use of such figures and pseudo principles The warning is of particular importance because it comes from an economist and statistician who has himself done so much to improve the technic of industrial disputes He rules that X can meet an average budget but that C and M cannot Judge Gary serves notice that he does not regard the official statistics as sound The budgets are too high and prices have come down mister Foster also serves notice of exception The budget is too low prices have gone up The chairman rules that this point is not within the jurisdiction of the conference that the official figures stand and that Judge Gary s experts and mister Foster s should carry their appeals to the standing committee of the federated intelligence bureaus Nevertheless says Judge Gary we shall be ruined if we change these wage scales What do you mean by ruined asks the chairman produce your books I can t they are private says Judge Gary What is private does not interest us says the chairman and therefore issues a statement to the public announcing that the wages of workers in groups C and M are so and so much below the official minimum living wage and that Judge Gary declines to increase them for reasons that he refuses to state After a procedure of that sort a public opinion in the eulogistic sense of the term Footnote As used by mister Lowell in his Public Opinion and Popular Government can exist The value of expert mediation is not that it sets up opinion to coerce the partisans but that it disintegrates partisanship Judge Gary and mister Foster may remain as little convinced as when they started though even they would have to talk in a different strain But almost everyone else who was not personally entangled would save himself from being entangled For the entangling stereotypes and slogans to which his reflexes are so ready to respond are by this kind of dialectic untangled four On many subjects of great public importance and in varying degree among different people for more personal matters the threads of memory and emotion are in a snarl The same word will connote any number of different ideas emotions are displaced from the images to which they belong to names which resemble the names of these images In the uncriticized parts of the mind there is a vast amount of association by mere clang contact and succession There are stray emotional attachments there are words that were names and are masks In dreams reveries and panic we uncover some of the disorder enough to see how the naive mind is composed and how it behaves when not disciplined by wakeful effort and external resistance We see that there is no more natural order than in a dusty old attic There is often the same incongruity between fact idea and emotion as there might be in an opera house if all the wardrobes were dumped in a heap and all the scores mixed up so that Madame Butterfly in a Valkyr s dress waited lyrically for the return of Faust At Christmas tide says an editorial old memories soften the heart Holy teachings are remembered afresh as thoughts run back to childhood The world does not seem so bad when seen through the mist of half happy half sad recollections of loved ones now with God No heart is untouched by the mysterious influence The country is honeycombed with red propaganda but there is a good supply of ropes muscles and lampposts while this world moves the spirit of liberty will burn in the breast of man The man who found these phrases in his mind needs help He needs a Socrates who will separate the words cross examine him until he has defined them and made words the names of ideas Made them mean a particular object and nothing else For these tense syllables have got themselves connected in his mind by primitive association and are bundled together by his memories of Christmas his indignation as a conservative and his thrills as the heir to a revolutionary tradition Sometimes the snarl is too huge and ancient for quick unravelling Sometimes as in modern psychotherapy there are layers upon layers of memory reaching back to infancy which have to be separated and named The effect of naming the effect that is of saying that the labor groups C and M but not X are underpaid instead of saying that Labor is Exploited is incisive Perceptions recover their identity and the emotion they arouse is specific since it is no longer reinforced by large and accidental connections with everything from Christmas to Moscow The disentangled idea with a name of its own and an emotion that has been scrutinized is ever so much more open to correction by new data in the problem It had been imbedded in the whole personality had affiliations of some sort with the whole ego a challenge would reverberate through the whole soul After it has been thoroughly criticized the idea is no longer me but that It is objectified it is at arm s length Its fate is not bound up with my fate but with the fate of the outer world upon which I am acting five Re education of this kind will help to bring our public opinions into grip with the environment That is the way the enormous censoring stereotyping and dramatizing apparatus can be liquidated Where there is no difficulty in knowing what the relevant environment is the critic the teacher the physician can unravel the mind But where the environment is as obscure to the analyst as to his pupil no analytic technic is sufficient Intelligence work is required In political and industrial problems the critic as such can do something but unless he can count upon receiving from expert reporters a valid picture of the environment his dialectic cannot go far Therefore though here as in most other matters education is the supreme remedy the value of this education will depend upon the evolution of knowledge And our knowledge of human institutions is still extraordinarily meager and impressionistic The gathering of social knowledge is on the whole still haphazard not as it will have to become the normal accompaniment of action And yet the collection of information will not be made one may be sure for the sake of its ultimate use It will be made because modern decision requires it to be made But as it is being made there will accumulate a body of data which political science can turn into generalization and build up for the schools into a conceptual picture of the world When that picture takes form civic education can become a preparation for dealing with an unseen environment As a working model of the social system becomes available to the teacher he can use it to make the pupil acutely aware of how his mind works on unfamiliar facts Until he has such a model the teacher cannot hope to prepare men fully for the world they will find What he can do is to prepare them to deal with that world with a great deal more sophistication about their own minds He can by the use of the case method teach the pupil the habit of examining the sources of his information He can teach him for example to look in his newspaper for the place where the dispatch was filed for the name of the correspondent the name of the press service the authority given for the statement the circumstances under which the statement was secured He can teach the pupil to ask himself whether the reporter saw what he describes and to remember how that reporter described other events in the past He can teach him the character of censorship of the idea of privacy and furnish him with knowledge of past propaganda He can by the proper use of history make him aware of the stereotype and can educate a habit of introspection about the imagery evoked by printed words He can by courses in comparative history and anthropology produce a life long realization of the way codes impose a special pattern upon the imagination He can teach men to catch themselves making allegories dramatizing relations and personifying abstractions He can show the pupil how he identifies himself with these allegories how he becomes interested and how he selects the attitude heroic romantic economic which he adopts while holding a particular opinion The study of error is not only in the highest degree prophylactic but it serves as a stimulating introduction to the study of truth As our minds become more deeply aware of their own subjectivism we find a zest in objective method that is not otherwise there We see vividly as normally we should not the enormous mischief and casual cruelty of our prejudices And the destruction of a prejudice though painful at first because of its connection with our self respect gives an immense relief and a fine pride when it is successfully done There is a radical enlargement of the range of attention As the current categories dissolve a hard simple version of the world breaks up The scene turns vivid and full There follows an emotional incentive to hearty appreciation of scientific method which otherwise it is not easy to arouse and is impossible to sustain Prejudices are so much easier and more interesting For if you teach the principles of science as if they had always been accepted their chief virtue as a discipline which is objectivity will make them dull But teach them at first as victories over the superstitions of the mind and the exhilaration of the chase and of the conquest may carry the pupil over that hard transition from his own self bound experience to the phase where his curiosity has matured and his reason has acquired passion CHAPTER XXVIII THE APPEAL TO REASON one I HAVE written and then thrown away several endings to this book Over all of them there hung that fatality of last chapters in which every idea seems to find its place and all the mysteries that the writer has not forgotten are unravelled In politics the hero does not live happily ever after or end his life perfectly There is no concluding chapter because the hero in politics has more future before him than there is recorded history behind him The last chapter is merely a place where the writer imagines that the polite reader has begun to look furtively at his watch two When Plato came to the point where it was fitting that he should sum up his assurance turned into stage fright as he thought how absurd it would sound to say what was in him about the place of reason in politics Those sentences in book five of the Republic were hard even for Plato to speak they are so sheer and so stark that men can neither forget them nor live by them So he makes Socrates say to Glaucon that he will be broken and drowned in laughter for telling what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form Footnote Republic Bk V four hundred seventy three Jowett transl because the thought he would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant was that until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one cities will never cease from ill no nor the human race Hardly had he said these awful words when he realized they were a counsel of perfection and felt embarrassed at the unapproachable grandeur of his idea So he hastens to add that of course the true pilot will be called a prater a star gazer a good for nothing Footnote two Bk VI four hundred eighty eight four hundred eighty nine But this wistful admission though it protects him against whatever was the Greek equivalent for the charge that he lacked a sense of humor furnished a humiliating tailpiece to a solemn thought He becomes defiant and warns Adeimantus that he must attribute the uselessness of philosophers to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature And with this haughty gesture he hurriedly picked up the tools of reason and disappeared into the Academy leaving the world to Machiavelli Thus in the first great encounter between reason and politics the strategy of reason was to retire in anger But meanwhile as Plato tells us the ship is at sea There have been many ships on the sea since Plato wrote and to day whether we are wise or foolish in our belief we could no longer call a man a true pilot simply because he knows how to pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art Footnote Bk VI four hundred eighty eight four hundred eighty nine He can dismiss nothing which is necessary to make that ship sail prosperously Because there are mutineers aboard he cannot say so much the worse for us all it is not in the order of nature that I should handle a mutiny it is not in the order of philosophy that I should consider mutiny I know how to navigate I do not know how to navigate a ship full of sailors and if they do not see that I am the man to steer I cannot help it We shall all go on the rocks they to be punished for their sins I with the assurance that I knew better three Whenever we make an appeal to reason in politics the difficulty in this parable recurs For there is an inherent difficulty about using the method of reason to deal with an unreasoning world Even if you assume with Plato that the true pilot knows what is best for the ship you have to recall that he is not so easy to recognize and that this uncertainty leaves a large part of the crew unconvinced By definition the crew does not know what he knows and the pilot fascinated by the stars and winds does not know how to make the crew realize the importance of what he knows There is no time during mutiny at sea to make each sailor an expert judge of experts There is no time for the pilot to consult his crew and find out whether he is really as wise as he thinks he is For education is a matter of years the emergency a matter of hours It would be altogether academic then to tell the pilot that the true remedy is for example an education that will endow sailors with a better sense of evidence You can tell that only to shipmasters on dry land In the crisis the only advice is to use a gun or make a speech utter a stirring slogan offer a compromise employ any quick means available to quell the mutiny the sense of evidence being what it is It is only on shore where men plan for many voyages that they can afford to and must for their own salvation deal with those causes that take a long time to remove They will be dealing in years and generations not in emergencies alone And nothing will put a greater strain upon their wisdom than the necessity of distinguishing false crises from real ones For when there is panic in the air with one crisis tripping over the heels of another actual dangers mixed with imaginary scares there is no chance at all for the constructive use of reason and any order soon seems preferable to any disorder It is only on the premise of a certain stability over a long run of time that men can hope to follow the method of reason This is not because mankind is inept or because the appeal to reason is visionary but because the evolution of reason on political subjects is only in its beginnings Our rational ideas in politics are still large thin generalities much too abstract and unrefined for practical guidance except where the aggregates are large enough to cancel out individual peculiarity and exhibit large uniformities Reason in politics is especially immature in predicting the behavior of individual men because in human conduct the smallest initial variation often works out into the most elaborate differences That perhaps is why when we try to insist solely upon an appeal to reason in dealing with sudden situations we are broken and drowned in laughter four For the rate at which reason as we possess it can advance itself is slower than the rate at which action has to be taken In the present state of political science there is therefore a tendency for one situation to change into another before the first is clearly understood and so to make much political criticism hindsight and little else Both in the discovery of what is unknown and in the propagation of that which has been proved there is a time differential which ought to in a much greater degree than it ever has occupy the political philosopher We have begun chiefly under the inspiration of mister Graham Wallas to examine the effect of an invisible environment upon our opinions We do not as yet understand except a little by rule of thumb the element of time in politics though it bears most directly upon the practicability of any constructive proposal Footnote Cf H G Wells in the opening chapters of Mankind in the Making We can see for example that somehow the relevancy of any plan depends upon the length of time the operation requires Because on the length of time it will depend whether the data which the plan assumes as given will in truth remain the same Footnote The better the current analysis in the intelligence work of any institution the less likely of course that men will deal with tomorrow s problems in the light of yesterday s facts There is a factor here which realistic and experienced men do take into account and it helps to mark them off somehow from the opportunist the visionary the philistine and the pedant Footnote Not all but some of the differences between reactionaries conservatives liberals and radicals are due I think to a different intuitive estimate of the rate of change in social affairs But just how the calculation of time enters into politics we do not know at present in any systematic way Until we understand these matters more clearly we can at least remember that there is a problem of the utmost theoretical difficulty and practical consequence It will help us to cherish Plato s ideal without sharing his hasty conclusion about the perversity of those who do not listen to reason It is hard to obey reason in politics because you are trying to make two processes march together which have as yet a different gait and a different pace Until reason is subtle and particular the immediate struggle of politics will continue to require an amount of native wit force and unprovable faith that reason can neither provide nor control because the facts of life are too undifferentiated for its powers of understanding The methods of social science are so little perfected that in many of the serious decisions and most of the casual ones there is as yet no choice but to gamble with fate as intuition prompts But we can make a belief in reason one of those intuitions We can use our wit and our force to make footholds for reason Behind our pictures of the world we can try to see the vista of a longer duration of events and wherever it is possible to escape from the urgent present allow this longer time to control our decisions And yet even when there is this will to let the future count we find again and again that we do not know for certain how to act according to the dictates of reason The number of human problems on which reason is prepared to dictate is small five There is however a noble counterfeit in that charity which comes from self knowledge and an unarguable belief that no one of our gregarious species is alone in his longing for a friendlier world So many of the grimaces men make at each other go with a flutter of their pulse that they are not all of them important And where so much is uncertain where so many actions have to be carried out on guesses the demand upon the reserves of mere decency is enormous and it is necessary to live as if good will would work We cannot prove in every instance that it will nor why hatred intolerance suspicion bigotry secrecy fear and lying are the seven deadly sins against public opinion We can only insist that they have no place in the appeal to reason that in the longer run they are a poison and taking our stand upon a view of the world which outlasts our own predicaments and our own lives we can cherish a hearty prejudice against them We can do this all the better if we do not allow frightfulness and fanaticism to impress us so deeply that we throw up our hands peevishly and lose interest in the longer run of time because we have lost faith in the future of man There is no ground for this despair because all the ifs on which as James said our destiny hangs are as pregnant as they ever were What we have seen of brutality we have seen and because it was strange it was not conclusive It was only Berlin Moscow Versailles in nineteen fourteen to nineteen nineteen not Armageddon as we rhetorically said The more realistically men have faced out the brutality and the hysteria the more they have earned the right to say that it is not foolish for men to believe because another great war took place that intelligence courage and effort cannot ever contrive a good life for all men Great as was the horror it was not universal There were corrupt and there were incorruptible There was muddle and there were miracles There was huge lying There were men with the will to uncover it It is no judgment but only a mood when men deny that what some men have been more men and ultimately enough men might be You can despair of what has never been You can despair of ever having three heads though mister Shaw has declined to despair even of that But you cannot despair of the possibilities that could exist by virtue of any human quality which a human being has exhibited And if amidst all the evils of this decade you have not seen men and women known moments that you would like to multiply the Lord
