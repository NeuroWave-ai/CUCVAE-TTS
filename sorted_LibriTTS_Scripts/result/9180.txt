SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON LL D Having left Ashbourne in the evening we stopped to change horses at Derby and availed ourselves of a moment to enjoy the conversation of my countryman doctor Butter then physician there He was in great indignation because Lord Mountstuart s bill for a Scotch militia one had been lost doctor Johnson was as violent against it I am glad said he that Parliament has had the spirit to throw it out You wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our scoundrels meaning I suppose the ministry It may be observed that he used the epithet scoundrel very commonly not quite in the sense in which it is generally understood but as a strong term of disapprobation as when he abruptly answered missus Thrale who had asked him how he did Ready to become a scoundrel Madam with a little more spoiling you will I think make me a complete rascal two he meant easy to become a capricious and self indulgent valetudinarian a character for which I have heard him express great disgust Johnson had with him upon this jaunt Il Palmerino d Inghilterra a romance three praised by Cervantes but did not like it much He said he read it for the language by way of preparation for his Italian expedition We lay this night at Loughborough On Thursday March twenty eight we pursued our journey I mentioned that old mister Sheridan complained of the ingratitude of mister Wedderburne four and General Fraser who had been much obliged to him when they were young Scotchmen entering upon life in England JOHNSON Why Sir a man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of those who have risen far above him A man when he gets into a higher sphere into other habits of life cannot keep up all his former connections Then Sir those who knew him formerly upon a level with themselves may think that they ought still to be treated as on a level which cannot be and an acquaintance in a former situation may bring out things which it would be very disagreeable to have mentioned before higher company though perhaps every body knows of them He placed this subject in a new light to me and shewed that a man who has risen in the world must not be condemned too harshly for being distant to former acquaintance even though he may have been much obliged to them It is no doubt to be wished that a proper degree of attention should be shewn by great men to their early friends But if either from obtuse insensibility to difference of situation or presumptuous forwardness which will not submit even to an exteriour observance of it the dignity of high place cannot be preserved when they are admitted into the company of those raised above the state in which they once were encroachment must be repelled and the kinder feelings sacrificed To one of the very fortunate persons whom I have mentioned namely mister Wedderburne now Lord Loughborough I must do the justice to relate that I have been assured by another early acquaintance of his old mister Macklin five who assisted in improving his pronunciation that he found him very grateful Macklin I suppose had not pressed upon his elevation with so much eagerness as the gentleman who complained of him doctor Johnson s remark as to the jealousy entertained of our friends who rise far above us is certainly very just By this was withered the early friendship between Charles Townshend and Akenside six and many similar instances might be adduced He said It is commonly a weak man who marries for love We then talked of marrying women of fortune and I mentioned a common remark that a man may be upon the whole richer by marrying a woman with a very small portion because a woman of fortune will be proportionally expensive whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expenses JOHNSON Depend upon it Sir this is not true A woman of fortune being used to the handling of money spends it judiciously but a woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her marriage has such a gust in spending it that she throws it away with great profusion He praised the ladies of the present age insisting that they were more faithful to their husbands and more virtuous in every respect than in former times because their understandings were better cultivated seven It was an undoubted proof of his good sense and good disposition that he was never querulous never prone to inveigh against the present times as is so common when superficial minds are on the fret On the contrary he was willing to speak favourably of his own age and indeed maintained its superiority eight in every respect except in its reverence for government the relaxation of which he imputed as its grand cause to the shock which our monarchy received at the Revolution though necessary nine and secondly to the timid concessions made to faction by successive administrations in the reign of his present Majesty I am happy to think that he lived to see the Crown at last recover its just influence ten At Leicester we read in the news paper that doctor James eleven was dead I thought that the death of an old school fellow and one with whom he had lived a good deal in London would have affected my fellow traveller much but he only said Ah poor Jamy Afterwards however when we were in the chaise he said with more tenderness Since I set out on this jaunt I have lost an old friend and a young one doctor James and poor Harry twelve Meaning mister Thrale s son Having lain at saint Alban s on Thursday March twenty eight we breakfasted the next morning at Barnet I expressed to him a weakness of mind which I could not help an uneasy apprehension that my wife and children who were at a great distance from me might perhaps be ill Sir said he consider how foolish you would think it in them to be apprehensive that you are ill thirteen This sudden turn relieved me for the moment but I afterwards perceived it to be an ingenious fallacy I might to be sure be satisfied that they had no reason to be apprehensive about me because I knew that I myself was well but we might have a mutual anxiety without the charge of folly because each was in some degree uncertain as to the condition of the other I enjoyed the luxury of our approach to London that metropolis which we both loved so much for the high and varied intellectual pleasure which it furnishes fourteen I experienced immediate happiness while whirled along with such a companion and said to him Sir you observed one day at General Oglethorpe s fifteen that a man is never happy for the present but when he is drunk Will you not add or when driving rapidly in a post chaise sixteen JOHNSON No Sir you are driving rapidly from something or to something Talking of melancholy he said Some men and very thinking men too have not those vexing thoughts seventeen Sir Joshua Reynolds is the same all the year round eighteen Beauclerk except when ill and in pain is the same But I believe most men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them If I were in the country and were distressed by that malady I would force myself to take a book and every time I did it I should find it the easier Melancholy indeed should be diverted by every means but drinking nineteen We stopped at Messieurs Dillys booksellers in the Poultry from whence he hurried away in a hackney coach to mister Thrale s in the Borough I called at his house in the evening having promised to acquaint missus Williams of his safe return when to my surprize I found him sitting with her at tea and as I thought not in a very good humour for it seems when he had got to mister Thrale s he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry missus and Miss Thrale and Signor Baretti their Italian master to Bath twenty This was not shewing the attention which might have been expected to the Guide Philosopher and Friend twenty one the Imlac twenty two who had hastened from the country to console a distressed mother who he understood was very anxious for his return They had I found without ceremony proceeded on their intended journey I was glad to understand from him that it was still resolved that his tour to Italy with mister and missus Thrale should take place of which he had entertained some doubt on account of the loss which they had suffered and his doubts afterwards proved to be well founded He observed indeed very justly that their loss was an additional reason for their going abroad and if it had not been fixed that he should have been one of the party he would force them out but he would not advise them unless his advice was asked lest they might suspect that he recommended what he wished on his own account I was not pleased that his intimacy with mister Thrale s family though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment was not without some degree of restraint not as has been grossly suggested that it was required of him as a task to talk for the entertainment of them and their company but that he was not quite at his ease which however might partly be owing to his own honest pride that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant On Sunday March thirty one I called on him and shewed him as a curiosity which I had discovered his Translation of Lobo s Account of Abyssinia which Sir John Pringle had lent me it being then little known as one of his works twenty three He said Take no notice of it or don t talk of it He seemed to think it beneath him though done at six and twenty I said to him Your style Sir is much improved since you translated this He answered with a sort of triumphant smile Sir I hope it is On Wednesday April three in the morning I found him very busy putting his books in order and as they were generally very old ones clouds of dust were flying around him He had on a pair of large gloves such as hedgers use His present appearance put me in mind of my uncle doctor Boswell s twenty four description of him A robust genius born to grapple with whole libraries I gave him an account of a conversation which had passed between me and Captain Cook the day before at dinner at Sir John Pringle s twenty five and he was much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that celebrated circumnavigator who set me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by doctor Hawkesworth of his Voyages I told him that while I was with the Captain I catched the enthusiasm twenty six of curiosity and adventure and felt a strong inclination to go with him on his next voyage JOHNSON Why Sir a man does feel so till he considers how very little he can learn from such voyages BOSWELL But one is carried away with the general grand and indistinct notion of A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD JOHNSON Yes Sir but a man is to guard himself against taking a thing in general I said I was certain that a great part of what we are told by the travellers to the South Sea must be conjecture because they had not enough of the language of those countries to understand so much as they have related Objects falling under the observation of the senses might be clearly known but every thing intellectual every thing abstract politicks morals and religion must be darkly guessed doctor Johnson was of the same opinion He upon another occasion when a friend mentioned to him several extraordinary facts as communicated to him by the circumnavigators slily observed Sir I never before knew how much I was respected by these gentlemen they told me none of these things He had been in company with Omai a native of one of the South Sea Islands after he had been some time in this country He was struck with the elegance of his behaviour and accounted for it thus Sir he had passed his time while in England only in the best company so that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel As a proof of this Sir Lord Mulgrave and he dined one day at Streatham they sat with their backs to the light fronting me so that I could not see distinctly and there was so little of the savage in Omai that I was afraid to speak to either lest I should mistake one for the other twenty seven We agreed to dine to day at the Mitre tavern after the rising of the House of Lords where a branch of the litigation concerning the Douglas Estate twenty eight in which I was one of the counsel was to come on I brought with me mister Murray Solicitor General of Scotland now one of the Judges of the Court of Session with the title of Lord Henderland I mentioned mister Solicitor s relation Lord Charles Hay twenty nine with whom I knew doctor Johnson had been acquainted JOHNSON I wrote something thirty for Lord Charles and I thought he had nothing to fear from a court martial I suffered a great loss when he died he was a mighty pleasing man in conversation and a reading man The character of a soldier is high They who stand forth the foremost in danger for the community have the respect of mankind An officer is much more respected than any other man who has as little money In a commercial country money will always purchase respect But you find an officer who has properly speaking no money is every where well received and treated with attention The character of a soldier always stands him in stead thirty one BOSWELL Yet Sir I think that common soldiers are worse thought of than other men in the same rank of life such as labourers JOHNSON Why Sir a common soldier is usually a very gross man thirty two and any quality which procures respect may be overwhelmed by grossness A man of learning may be so vicious or so ridiculous that you cannot respect him A common soldier too generally eats more than he can pay for But when a common soldier is civil in his quarters his red coat procures him a degree of respect thirty three The peculiar respect paid to the military character in France was mentioned BOSWELL I should think that where military men are so numerous they would be less valued as not being rare JOHNSON Nay Sir wherever a particular character or profession is high in the estimation of a people those who are of it will be valued above other men We value an Englishman highly in this country and yet Englishmen are not rare in it mister Murray praised the ancient philosophers for the candour and good humour with which those of different sects disputed with each other JOHNSON Sir they disputed with good humour because they were not in earnest as to religion Had the ancients been serious in their belief we should not have had their Gods exhibited in the manner we find them represented in the Poets The people would not have suffered it They disputed with good humour upon their fanciful theories because they were not interested in the truth of them when a man has nothing to lose he may be in good humour with his opponent Accordingly you see in Lucian the Epicurean who argues only negatively keeps his temper the Stoick who has something positive to preserve grows angry thirty four Being angry with one who controverts an opinion which you value is a necessary consequence of the uneasiness which you feel Every man who attacks my belief diminishes in some degree my confidence in it and therefore makes me uneasy and I am angry with him who makes me uneasy thirty five Those only who believed in revelation have been angry at having their faith called in question because they only had something upon which they could rest as matter of fact MURRAY It seems to me that we are not angry at a man for controverting an opinion which we believe and value we rather pity him JOHNSON Why Sir to be sure when you wish a man to have that belief which you think is of infinite advantage you wish well to him but your primary consideration is your own quiet If a madman were to come into this room with a stick in his hand no doubt we should pity the state of his mind but our primary consideration would be to take care of ourselves We should knock him down first and pity him afterwards No Sir every man will dispute with great good humour upon a subject in which he is not interested I will dispute very calmly upon the probability of another man s son being hanged but if a man zealously enforces the probability that my own son will be hanged I shall certainly not be in a very good humour with him I added this illustration If a man endeavours to convince me that my wife whom I love very much and in whom I place great confidence is a disagreeable woman and is even unfaithful to me I shall be very angry for he is putting me in fear of being unhappy MURRAY But Sir truth will always bear an examination JOHNSON Yes Sir but it is painful to be forced to defend it Consider Sir how should you like though conscious of your innocence to be tried before a jury for a capital crime once a week We talked of education at great schools the advantages and disadvantages of which Johnson displayed in a luminous manner but his arguments preponderated so much in favour of the benefit which a boy of good parts thirty six might receive at one of them that I have reason to believe mister Murray was very much influenced by what he had heard to day in his determination to send his own son to Westminster school thirty seven I have acted in the same manner with regard to my own two sons having placed the eldest at Eton and the second at Westminster I cannot say which is best thirty eight But in justice to both those noble seminaries I with high satisfaction declare that my boys have derived from them a great deal of good and no evil and I trust they will like Horace thirty nine be grateful to their father for giving them so valuable an education I introduced the topick which is often ignorantly urged that the Universities of England are too rich forty so that learning does not flourish in them as it would do if those who teach had smaller salaries and depended on their assiduity for a great part of their income JOHNSON Sir the very reverse of this is the truth the English Universities are not rich enough Our fellowships are only sufficient to support a man during his studies to fit him for the world and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away Now and then perhaps there is a fellow who grows old in his college but this is against his will unless he be a man very indolent indeed A hundred a year is reckoned a good fellowship and that is no more than is necessary to keep a man decently as a scholar We do not allow our fellows to marry because we consider academical institutions as preparatory to a settlement in the world It is only by being employed as a tutor that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood To be sure a man who has enough without teaching will probably not teach for we would all be idle if we could forty one In the same manner a man who is to get nothing by teaching will not exert himself Gresham College was intended as a place of instruction for London able professors were to read lectures gratis they contrived to have no scholars whereas if they had been allowed to receive but sixpence a lecture from each scholar they would have been emulous to have had many scholars Every body will agree that it should be the interest of those who teach to have scholars and this is the case in our Universities forty two That they are too rich is certainly not true for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life In the foreign Universities a professorship is a high thing It is as much almost as a man can make by his learning and therefore we find the most learned men abroad are in the Universities forty three It is not so with us Our Universities are impoverished of learning by the penury of their provisions I wish there were many places of a thousand a year at Oxford to keep first rate men of learning from quitting the University Undoubtedly if this were the case Literature would have a still greater dignity and splendour at Oxford and there would be grander living sources of instruction I mentioned mister Maclaurin s forty four uneasiness on account of a degree of ridicule carelessly thrown on his deceased father in Goldsmith s History of Animated Nature in which that celebrated mathematician is represented as being subject to fits of yawning so violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture a story altogether unfounded but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation forty five This led us to agitate the question whether legal redress could be obtained even when a man s deceased relation was calumniated in a publication mister Murray maintained there should be reparation unless the author could justify himself by proving the fact JOHNSON Sir it is of so much more consequence that truth should be told than that individuals should not be made uneasy that it is much better that the law does not restrain writing freely concerning the characters of the dead Damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his life time because he may be hurt in his worldly interest or at least hurt in his mind but the law does not regard that uneasiness which a man feels on having his ancestor calumniated forty six That is too nice Let him deny what is said and let the matter have a fair chance by discussion But if a man could say nothing against a character but what he can prove history could not be written for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought A minister may be notoriously known to take bribes and yet you may not be able to prove it mister Murray suggested that the authour should be obliged to shew some sort of evidence though he would not require a strict legal proof but Johnson firmly and resolutely opposed any restraint whatever as adverse to a free investigation of the characters of mankind forty seven On Thursday April four having called on doctor Johnson I said it was a pity that truth was not so firm as to bid defiance to all attacks so that it might be shot at as much as people chose to attempt and yet remain unhurt JOHNSON Then Sir it would not be shot at Nobody forty eight attempts to dispute that two and two make four but with contests concerning moral truth human passions are generally mixed and therefore it must ever be liable to assault and misrepresentation On Friday April five being Good Friday after having attended the morning service at saint Clement s Church forty nine I walked home with Johnson We talked of the Roman Catholick religion JOHNSON In the barbarous ages Sir priests and people were equally deceived but afterwards there were gross corruptions introduced by the clergy such as indulgences to priests to have concubines and the worship of images not indeed inculcated but knowingly permitted He strongly censured the licensed stews at Rome BOSWELL So then Sir you would allow of no irregular intercourse whatever between the sexes JOHNSON To be sure I would not Sir I would punish it much more than it is done and so restrain it In all countries there has been fornication as in all countries there has been theft but there may be more or less of the one as well as of the other in proportion to the force of law All men will naturally commit fornication as all men will naturally steal And Sir it is very absurd to argue as has been often done that prostitutes are necessary to prevent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life nay should be permitted in order to preserve the chastity of our wives and daughters Depend upon it Sir severe laws steadily enforced would be sufficient against those evils and would promote marriage I stated to him this case Suppose a man has a daughter who he knows has been seduced but her misfortune is concealed from the world should he keep her in his house Would he not by doing so be accessory to imposition And perhaps a worthy unsuspecting man might come and marry this woman unless the father inform him of the truth JOHNSON Sir he is accessory to no imposition His daughter is in his house and if a man courts her he takes his chance If a friend or indeed if any man asks his opinion whether he should marry her he ought to advise him against it without telling why because his real opinion is then required Or if he has other daughters who know of her frailty he ought not to keep her in his house You are to consider the state of life is this we are to judge of one another s characters as well as we can and a man is not bound in honesty or honour to tell us the faults of his daughter or of himself A man who has debauched his friend s daughter is not obliged to say to every body Take care of me don t let me into your houses without suspicion I once debauched a friend s daughter I may debauch yours mister Thrale called upon him and appeared to bear the loss of his son with a manly composure There was no affectation about him and he talked as usual upon indifferent subjects fifty He seemed to me to hesitate as to the intended Italian tour on which I flattered myself he and missus Thrale and doctor Johnson were soon to set out and therefore I pressed it as much as I could I mentioned that mister Beauclerk had said that Baretti whom they were to carry with them would keep them so long in the little towns of his own district that they would not have time to see Rome I mentioned this to put them on their guard JOHNSON Sir we do not thank mister Beauclerk for supposing that we are to be directed by Baretti No Sir mister Thrale is to go by my advice to mister Jackson fifty one the all knowing and get from him a plan for seeing the most that can be seen in the time that we have to travel We must to be sure see Rome Naples Florence and Venice and as much more as we can Speaking with a tone of animation When I expressed an earnest wish for his remarks on Italy he said I do not see that I could make a book upon Italy fifty two yet I should be glad to get two hundred pounds or five hundred pounds by such a work This shewed both that a journal of his Tour upon the Continent was not wholly out of his contemplation and that he uniformly adhered to that strange opinion which his indolent disposition made him utter No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money fifty three Numerous instances to refute this will occur to all who are versed in the history of literature fifty four He gave us one of the many sketches of character which were treasured in his mind and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner I lately said he received a letter from the East Indies from a gentleman whom I formerly knew very well he had returned from that country with a handsome fortune as it was reckoned before means were found to acquire those immense sums which have been brought from thence of late he was a scholar and an agreeable man and lived very prettily in London till his wife died After her death he took to dissipation and gaming and lost all he had One evening he lost a thousand pounds to a gentleman whose name I am sorry I have forgotten Next morning he sent the gentleman five hundred pounds with an apology that it was all he had in the world The gentleman sent the money back to him declaring he would not accept of it and adding that if mister had occasion for five hundred pounds more he would lend it to him He resolved to go out again to the East Indies and make his fortune anew He got a considerable appointment and I had some intention of accompanying him Had I thought then as I do now I should have gone but at that time I had objections to quitting England It was a very remarkable circumstance about Johnson whom shallow observers have supposed to have been ignorant of the world that very few men had seen greater variety of characters and none could observe them better as was evident from the strong yet nice portraits which he often drew I have frequently thought that if he had made out what the French call une catalogue raisonnee of all the people who had passed under his observation it would have afforded a very rich fund of instruction and entertainment The suddenness with which his accounts of some of them started out in conversation was not less pleasing than surprising I remember he once observed to me It is wonderful Sir what is to be found in London The most literary conversation that I ever enjoyed was at the table of Jack Ellis a money scrivener behind the Royal Exchange with whom I at one period used to dine generally once a week fifty five Volumes would be required to contain a list of his numerous and various acquaintance fifty six none of whom he ever forgot and could describe and discriminate them all with precision and vivacity He associated with persons the most widely different in manners abilities rank and accomplishments fifty seven He was at once the companion of the brilliant Colonel Forrester fifty eight of the Guards who wrote The Polite Philosopher and of the aukward and uncouth Robert Levet of Lord Thurlow and mister Sastres the Italian master and has dined one day with the beautiful gay and fascinating Lady Craven fifty nine and the next with good missus Gardiner sixty the tallow chandler on Snow hill On my expressing my wonder at his discovering so much of the knowledge peculiar to different professions he told me I learnt what I know of law chiefly from mister Ballow sixty one a very able man I learnt some too from Chambers sixty two but was not so teachable then One is not willing to be taught by a young man When I expressed a wish to know more about mister Ballow Johnson said Sir I have seen him but once these twenty years The tide of life has driven us different ways I was sorry at the time to hear this but whoever quits the creeks of private connections and fairly gets into the great ocean of London will by imperceptible degrees unavoidably experience such cessations of acquaintance My knowledge of physick he added I learnt from doctor James whom I helped in writing the proposals for his Dictionary and also a little in the Dictionary itself sixty three I also learnt from doctor Lawrence but was then grown more stubborn A curious incident happened to day while mister Thrale and I sat with him Francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the post office said to have come from Lisbon and it was charged seven pounds ten shillings He would not receive it supposing it to be some trick nor did he even look at it But upon enquiry afterwards he found that it was a real packet for him from that very friend in the East Indies of whom he had been speaking and the ship which carried it having come to Portugal this packet with others had been put into the post office at Lisbon I mentioned a new gaming club sixty four of which mister Beauclerk had given me an account where the members played to a desperate extent JOHNSON Depend upon it Sir this is mere talk Who is ruined by gaming You will not find six instances in an age There is a strange rout made about deep play whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade and yet we do not hear such an outcry against it THRALE There may be few people absolutely ruined by deep play but very many are much hurt in their circumstances by it JOHNSON Yes Sir and so are very many by other kinds of expence I had heard him talk once before in the same manner and at Oxford he said he wished he had learnt to play at cards sixty five The truth however is that he loved to display his ingenuity in argument and therefore would sometimes in conversation maintain opinions which he was sensible were wrong but in supporting which his reasoning and wit would be most conspicuous sixty six He would begin thus Why Sir as to the good or evil of card playing Now said Garrick he is thinking which side he shall take sixty seven He appeared to have a pleasure in contradiction especially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence sixty eight so that there was hardly any topick if not one of the great truths of Religion and Morality that he might not have been incited to argue either for or against Lord Elibank sixty nine had the highest admiration of his powers He once observed to me Whatever opinion Johnson maintains I will not say that he convinces me but he never fails to shew me that he has good reasons for it I have heard Johnson pay his Lordship this high compliment I never was in Lord Elibank s company without learning something seventy We sat together till it was too late for the afternoon service Thrale said he had come with intention to go to church with us We went at seven to evening prayers at saint Clement s church after having drank coffee an indulgence which I understood Johnson yielded to on this occasion in compliment to Thrale seventy one On Sunday April seven Easter day after having been at saint Paul s Cathedral I came to doctor Johnson according to my usual custom It seemed to me that there was always something peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy festival the commemoration of the most joyful event in the history of our world the resurrection of our LORD and SAVIOUR who having triumphed over death and the grave proclaimed immortality to mankind seventy two I repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance who maintained that her husband s having been guilty of numberless infidelities released her from conjugal obligations because they were reciprocal JOHNSON This is miserable stuff Sir To the contract of marriage besides the man and wife there is a third party Society and if it be considered as a vow GOD and therefore it cannot be dissolved by their consent alone Laws are not made for particular cases but for men in general A woman may be unhappy with her husband but she cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and ecclesiastical power A man may be unhappy because he is not so rich as another but he is not to seize upon another s property with his own hand BOSWELL But Sir this lady does not want that the contract should be dissolved she only argues that she may indulge herself in gallantries with equal freedom as her husband does provided she takes care not to introduce a spurious issue into his family You know Sir what Macrobius has told us of Julia seventy three JOHNSON This lady of yours Sir I think is very fit for a brothel mister Macbean seventy four authour of the Dictionary of ancient Geography came in He mentioned that he had been forty years absent from Scotland Ah Boswell said Johnson smiling what would you give to be forty years from Scotland I said I should not like to be so long absent from the seat of my ancestors This gentleman missus Williams and mister Levet dined with us doctor Johnson made a remark which both mister Macbean and I thought new It was this that the law against usury is for the protection of creditors as well as of debtors for if there were no such check people would be apt from the temptation of great interest to lend to desperate persons by whom they would lose their money Accordingly there are instances of ladies being ruined by having injudiciously sunk their fortunes for high annuities which after a few years ceased to be paid in consequence of the ruined circumstances of the borrower missus Williams was very peevish and I wondered at Johnson s patience with her now as I had often done on similar occasions The truth is that his humane consideration of the forlorn and indigent state in which this lady was left by her father induced him to treat her with the utmost tenderness and even to be desirous of procuring her amusement so as sometimes to incommode many of his friends by carrying her with him to their houses where from her manner of eating in consequence of her blindness she could not but offend the delicacy of persons of nice sensations seventy five After coffee we went to afternoon service in saint Clement s church Observing some beggars in the street as we walked along I said to him I supposed there was no civilised country in the world where the misery of want in the lowest classes of the people was prevented JOHNSON I believe Sir there is not but it is better that some should be unhappy than that none should be happy which would be the case in a general state of equality seventy six When the service was ended I went home with him and we sat quietly by ourselves He recommended doctor Cheyne s books I said I thought Cheyne had been reckoned whimsical So he was said he in some things but there is no end of objections There are few books to which some objection or other may not be made He added I would not have you read anything else of Cheyne but his book on Health and his English Malady seventy seven Upon the question whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force himself into solitude and sadness JOHNSON No Sir unless it prevent him from being vicious again With some people gloomy penitence is only madness turned upside down A man may be gloomy till in order to be relieved from gloom he has recourse again to criminal indulgencies seventy eight On Wednesday April ten I dined with him at mister Thrale s where were mister Murphy and some other company Before dinner doctor Johnson and I passed some time by ourselves I was sorry to find it was now resolved that the proposed journey to Italy should not take place this year seventy nine He said I am disappointed to be sure but it is not a great disappointment I wondered to see him bear with a philosophical calmness what would have made most people peevish and fretful I perceived however that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes that he could not easily part with the scheme for he said I shall probably contrive to get to Italy some other way But I won t mention it to mister and missus Thrale as it might vex them I suggested that going to Italy might have done mister and missus Thrale good JOHNSON I rather believe not Sir While grief is fresh every attempt to divert only irritates You must wait till grief be digested and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it At dinner mister Murphy entertained us with the history of mister Joseph Simpson eighty a schoolfellow of doctor Johnson s a barrister at law of good parts but who fell into a dissipated course of life incompatible with that success in his profession which he once had and would otherwise have deservedly maintained yet he still preserved a dignity in his deportment He wrote a tragedy on the story of Leonidas entitled The Patriot He read it to a company of lawyers who found so many faults that he wrote it over again so then there were two tragedies on the same subject and with the same title doctor Johnson told us that one of them was still in his possession This very piece was after his death published by some person who had been about him and for the sake of a little hasty profit was fallaciously advertised so as to make it be believed to have been written by Johnson himself I said I disliked the custom which some people had of bringing their children into company eighty one because it in a manner forced us to pay foolish compliments to please their parents JOHNSON You are right Sir We may be excused for not caring much about other people s children for there are many who care very little about their own children It may be observed that men who from being engaged in business or from their course of life in whatever way seldom see their children do not care much about them I myself should not have had much fondness for a child of my own eighty two missus THRALE Nay Sir how can you talk so JOHNSON At least I never wished to have a child mister Murphy mentioned doctor Johnson s having a design to publish an edition of Cowley Johnson said he did not know but he should and he expressed his disapprobation of doctor Hurd for having published a mutilated edition under the title of Select Works of Abraham Cowley eighty three mister Murphy thought it a bad precedent observing that any authour might be used in the same manner and that it was pleasing to see the variety of an authour s compositions at different periods We talked of Flatman s Poems and missus Thrale observed that Pope had partly borrowed from him The dying Christian to his Soul eighty four Johnson repeated Rochester s verses upon Flatman eighty five which I think by much too severe Nor that slow drudge in swift Pindarick strains Flatman who Cowley imitates with pains And rides a jaded Muse whipt with loose reins I like to recollect all the passages that I heard Johnson repeat it stamps a value on them He told us that the book entitled The Lives of the Poets by mister Cibber was entirely compiled by mister Shiels a Scotchman one of his amanuenses The bookseller said he gave Theophilus Cibber who was then in prison ten guineas to allow Mr Cibber to be put upon the title page as the authour by this a double imposition was intended in the first place that it was the work of a Cibber at all and in the second place that it was the work of old Cibber eighty six mister Murphy said that The Memoirs of Gray s Life set him much higher in his estimation than his poems did for you there saw a man constantly at work in literature Johnson acquiesced in this but depreciated the book I thought very unreasonably For he said I forced myself to read it only because it was a common topick of conversation I found it mighty dull and as to the style it is fit for the second table eighty seven Why he thought so I was at a loss to conceive He now gave it as his opinion that Akenside eighty eight was a superiour poet both to Gray and Mason Talking of the Reviews Johnson said I think them very impartial I do not know an instance of partiality eighty nine He mentioned what had passed upon the subject of the Monthly and Critical Reviews in the conversation with which his Majesty had honoured him ninety He expatiated a little more on them this evening The Monthly Reviewers said he are not Deists but they are Christians with as little christianity as may be and are for pulling down all establishments The Critical Reviewers are for supporting the constitution both in church and state ninety one The Critical Reviewers I believe often review without reading the books through but lay hold of a topick and write chiefly from their own minds The Monthly Reviewers are duller men and are glad to read the books through He talked of Lord Lyttelton s extreme anxiety as an authour observing that he was thirty years in preparing his History and that he employed a man to point it for him as if laughing another man could point his sense better than himself ninety two mister Murphy said he understood his history was kept back several years for fear of Smollet ninety three JOHNSON This seems strange to Murphy and me who never felt that anxiety but sent what we wrote to the press and let it take its chance missus THRALE The time has been Sir when you felt it JOHNSON Why really Madam I do not recollect a time when that was the case Talking of The Spectator he said It is wonderful that there is such a proportion of bad papers in the half of the work which was not written by Addison for there was all the world to write that half yet not a half of that half is good One of the finest pieces in the English language is the paper on Novelty ninety four yet we do not hear it talked of It was written by Grove a dissenting teacher He would not I perceived call him a clergyman though he was candid enough to allow very great merit to his composition mister Murphy said he remembered when there were several people alive in London who enjoyed a considerable reputation merely from having written a paper in The Spectator He mentioned particularly mister Ince who used to frequent Tom s coffee house But said Johnson you must consider how highly Steele speaks of mister Ince ninety five He would not allow that the paper ninety six on carrying a boy to travel signed Philip Homebred which was reported to be written by the Lord Chancellor Hardwicke had merit He said it was quite vulgar and had nothing luminous Johnson mentioned doctor Barry s ninety seven System of Physick He was a man said he who had acquired a high reputation in Dublin came over to England and brought his reputation with him but had not great success His notion was that pulsation occasions death by attrition and that therefore the way to preserve life is to retard pulsation ninety eight But we know that pulsation is strongest in infants and that we increase in growth while it operates in its regular course so it cannot be the cause of destruction Soon after this he said something very flattering to missus Thrale which I do not recollect but it concluded with wishing her long life Sir said I if doctor Barry s system be true you have now shortened missus Thrale s life perhaps some minutes by accelerating her pulsation On Thursday April eleven ninety nine I dined with him at General Paoli s in whose house I now resided and where I had ever afterwards the honour of being entertained with the kindest attention as his constant guest while I was in London till I had a house of my own there I mentioned my having that morning introduced to mister Garrick Count Neni a Flemish Nobleman of great rank and fortune to whom Garrick talked of Abel Drugger one hundred as a small part and related with pleasant vanity that a Frenchman who had seen him in one of his low characters exclaimed Comment je ne le crois pas Ce n est pas Monsieur Garrick ce Grand Homme Garrick added with an appearance of grave recollection If I were to begin life again I think I should not play those low characters Upon which I observed Sir you would be in the wrong for your great excellence is your variety of playing your representing so well characters so very different JOHNSON Garrick Sir was not in earnest in what he said for to be sure his peculiar excellence is his variety one hundred one and perhaps there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by somebody else as he could do it BOSWELL Why then Sir did he talk so JOHNSON Why Sir to make you answer as you did BOSWELL I don t know Sir he seemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection JOHNSON He had not far to dip Sir he said the same thing probably twenty times before Of a nobleman raised at a very early period to high office he said His parts Sir are pretty well for a Lord but would not be distinguished in a man who had nothing else but his parts one hundred two A journey to Italy was still in his thoughts one hundred three He said A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see The grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the Mediterranean On those shores were the four great Empires of the world the Assyrian the Persian the Grecian and the Roman All our religion almost all our law almost all our arts almost all that sets us above savages has come to us from the shores of the Mediterranean The General observed that THE MEDITERRANEAN would be a noble subject for a poem one hundred four We talked of translation I said I could not define it nor could I think of a similitude to illustrate it but that it appeared to me the translation of poetry could be only imitation JOHNSON You may translate books of science exactly You may also translate history in so far as it is not embellished with oratory one hundred five which is poetical Poetry indeed cannot be translated and therefore it is the poets that preserve languages for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language if we could have all that is written in it just as well in a translation But as the beauties of poetry cannot be preserved in any language except that in which it was originally written we learn the language A gentleman maintained that the art of printing had hurt real learning by disseminating idle writings JOHNSON Sir if it had not been for the art of printing we should now have no learning at all for books would have perished faster than they could have been transcribed This observation seems not just considering for how many ages books were preserved by writing alone The same gentleman maintained that a general diffusion of knowledge among a people was a disadvantage for it made the vulgar rise above their humble sphere JOHNSON Sir while knowledge is a distinction those who are possessed of it will naturally rise above those who are not Merely to read and write was a distinction at first but we see when reading and writing have become general the common people keep their stations And so were higher attainments to become general the effect would be the same one hundred six Goldsmith he said referred every thing to vanity his virtues and his vices too were from that motive He was not a social man He never exchanged mind with you We spent the evening at mister Hoole s mister Mickle the excellent translator of The Lusiad one hundred seven was there I have preserved little of the conversation of this evening one hundred eight doctor Johnson said Thomson had a true poetical genius the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light His fault is such a cloud of words sometimes that the sense can hardly peep through Shiels who compiled Cibber s Lives of the Poets one hundred nine was one day sitting with me I took down Thomson and read aloud a large portion of him and then asked Is not this fine Shiels having expressed the highest admiration Well Sir said I I have omitted every other line one hundred ten I related a dispute between Goldsmith and mister Robert Dodsley one day when they and I were dining at Tom Davies s in seventeen sixty two Goldsmith asserted that there was no poetry produced in this age Dodsley appealed to his own Collection one hundred eleven and maintained that though you could not find a palace like Dryden s Ode on saint Cecilia s Day you had villages composed of very pretty houses and he mentioned particularly The Spleen one hundred twelve JOHNSON I think Dodsley gave up the question He and Goldsmith said the same thing only he said it in a softer manner than Goldsmith did for he acknowledged that there was no poetry nothing that towered above the common mark You may find wit and humour in verse and yet no poetry Hudibras has a profusion of these yet it is not to be reckoned a poem The Spleen in Dodsley s Collection on which you say he chiefly rested is not poetry one hundred thirteen BOSWELL Does not Gray s poetry Sir tower above the common mark JOHNSON Yes Sir but we must attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would and what every man may do if he would Sixteen string Jack one hundred fourteen towered above the common mark BOSWELL Then Sir what is poetry JOHNSON Why Sir it is much easier to say what it is not We all know what light is but it is not easy to tell what it is On Friday April twelve I dined with him at our friend Tom Davies s where we met mister Cradock of Leicestershire authour of Zobeide a tragedy one hundred fifteen a very pleasing gentleman to whom my friend doctor Farmer s very excellent Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare one hundred sixteen is addressed and doctor Harwood who has written and published various works particularly a fantastical translation of the New Testament in modern phrase one hundred seventeen and with a Socinian twist I introduced Aristotle s doctrine in his Art of Poetry of the Greek katharis ton pathaematon the purging of the passions as the purpose of tragedy one hundred eighteen But how are the passions to be purged by terrour and pity said I with an assumed air of ignorance to incite him to talk for which it was often necessary to employ some address one hundred nineteen JOHNSON Why Sir you are to consider what is the meaning of purging in the original sense It is to expel impurities from the human body The mind is subject to the same imperfection The passions are the great movers of human actions but they are mixed with such impurities that it is necessary they should be purged or refined by means of terrour and pity For instance ambition is a noble passion but by seeing upon the stage that a man who is so excessively ambitious as to raise himself by injustice is punished we are terrified at the fatal consequences of such a passion In the same manner a certain degree of resentment is necessary but if we see that a man carries it too far we pity the object of it and are taught to moderate that passion My record upon this occasion does great injustice to Johnson s expression which was so forcible and brilliant that mister Cradock whispered me O that his words were written in a book one hundred twenty I observed the great defect of the tragedy of Othello was that it had not a moral for that no man could resist the circumstances of suspicion which were artfully suggested to Othello s mind JOHNSON In the first place Sir we learn from Othello this very useful moral not to make an unequal match in the second place we learn not to yield too readily to suspicion The handkerchief is merely a trick though a very pretty trick but there are no other circumstances of reasonable suspicion except what is related by Iago of Cassio s warm expressions concerning Desdemona in his sleep and that depended entirely upon the assertion of one man one hundred twenty one No Sir I think Othello has more moral than almost any play Talking of a penurious gentleman of our acquaintance Johnson said Sir he is narrow not so much from avarice as from impotence to spend his money He cannot find in his heart to pour out a bottle of wine but he would not much care if it should sour He said he wished to see John Dennis s Critical Works collected Davies said they would not sell doctor Johnson seemed to think otherwise one hundred twenty two Davies said of a well known dramatick authour that he lived upon potted stories and that he made his way as Hannibal did by vinegar having begun by attacking people particularly the players one hundred twenty three He reminded doctor Johnson of mister Murphy s having paid him the highest compliment that ever was paid to a layman by asking his pardon for repeating some oaths in the course of telling a story one hundred twenty four Johnson and I supt this evening at the Crown and Anchor tavern in company with Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Langton mister Nairne one hundred twenty five now one of the Scotch Judges with the title of Lord Dunsinan and my very worthy friend Sir William Forbes one hundred twenty six of Pitsligo We discussed the question whether drinking improved conversation and benevolence one hundred twenty seven Sir Joshua maintained it did JOHNSON No Sir before dinner men meet with great inequality of understanding and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk When they have drunk wine every man feels himself happy and loses that modesty and grows impudent and vociferous but he is not improved he is only not sensible of his defects Sir Joshua said the Doctor was talking of the effects of excess in wine but that a moderate glass enlivened the mind by giving a proper circulation to the blood I am said he in very good spirits when I get up in the morning By dinner time I am exhausted wine puts me in the same state as when I got up and I am sure that moderate drinking makes people talk better JOHNSON No Sir wine gives not light gay ideal hilarity but tumultuous noisy clamorous merriment I have heard none of those drunken nay drunken is a coarse word none of those vinous flights SIR JOSHUA Because you have sat by quite sober and felt an envy of the happiness of those who were drinking JOHNSON Perhaps contempt one hundred twenty eight And Sir it is not necessary to be drunk one s self to relish the wit of drunkenness Do we not judge of the drunken wit of the dialogue between Iago and Cassio the most excellent in its kind when we are quite sober Wit is wit by whatever means it is produced and if good will appear so at all times I admit that the spirits are raised by drinking as by the common participation of any pleasure cock fighting or bear baiting will raise the spirits of a company as drinking does though surely they will not improve conversation I also admit that there are some sluggish men who are improved by drinking as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten There are such men but they are medlars I indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking but I maintain that I am right as to the effects of drinking in general and let it be considered that there is no position however false in its universality which is not true of some particular man Sir William Forbes said Might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer which is made brisker by being set before the fire Nay said Johnson laughing I cannot answer that that is too much for me I observed that wine did some people harm by inflaming confusing and irritating their minds but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour of moderate drinking JOHNSON Sir I do not say it is wrong to produce self complacency by drinking I only deny that it improves the mind When I drank wine I scorned to drink it when in company one hundred twenty nine I have drunk many a bottle by myself in the first place because I had need of it to raise my spirits in the second place because I would have nobody to witness its effects upon me He told us almost all his Ramblers were written just as they were wanted for the press that he sent a certain portion of the copy one hundred thirty of an essay and wrote the remainder while the former part of it was printing When it was wanted and he had fairly sat down to it he was sure it would be done one hundred thirty one He said that for general improvement a man should read whatever his immediate inclination prompts him to though to be sure if a man has a science to learn he must regularly and resolutely advance He added what we read with inclination makes a much stronger impression If we read without inclination half the mind is employed in fixing the attention so there is but one half to be employed on what we read one hundred thirty two He told us he read Fielding s Amelia through without stopping one hundred thirty three He said if a man begins to read in the middle of a book and feels an inclination to go on let him not quit it to go to the beginning He may perhaps not feel again the inclination Sir Joshua mentioned mister Cumberland s Odes one hundred thirty four which were just published JOHNSON Why Sir they would have been thought as good as Odes commonly are if Cumberland had not put his name to them but a name immediately draws censure unless it be a name that bears down everything before it Nay Cumberland has made his Odes subsidiary to the fame of another man one hundred thirty five They might have run well enough by themselves but he has not only loaded them with a name but has made them carry double We talked of the Reviews and doctor Johnson spoke of them as he did at Thrale s one hundred thirty six Sir Joshua said what I have often thought that he wondered to find so much good writing employed in them when the authours were to remain unknown and so could not have the motive of fame JOHNSON Nay Sir those who write in them write well in order to be paid well Soon after this day he went to Bath with mister and missus Thrale I had never seen that beautiful city and wished to take the opportunity of visiting it while Johnson was there Having written to him I received the following answer To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Why do you talk of neglect When did I neglect you If you will come to Bath we shall all be glad to see you Come therefore as soon as you can But I have a little business for you at London Bid Francis look in the paper drawer of the chest of drawers in my bed chamber for two cases one for the Attorney General one hundred thirty seven and one for the Solicitor General one hundred thirty eight They lie I think at the top of my papers otherwise they are somewhere else and will give me more trouble Please to write to me immediately if they can be found Make my compliments to all our friends round the world and to missus Williams at home I am Sir your c SAM JOHNSON Search for the papers as soon as you can that if it is necessary I may write to you again before you come down On the twenty sixth of April I went to Bath one hundred thirty nine and on my arrival at the Pelican inn found lying for me an obliging invitation from mister and missus Thrale by whom I was agreeably entertained almost constantly during my stay They were gone to the rooms one hundred forty but there was a kind note from doctor Johnson that he should sit at home all the evening I went to him directly and before mister and missus Thrale returned we had by ourselves some hours of tea drinking and talk I shall group together such of his sayings as I preserved during the few days that I was at Bath Of a person one hundred forty one who differed from him in politicks he said In private life he is a very honest gentleman but I will not allow him to be so in publick life People may be honest though they are doing wrong that is between their Maker and them But we who are suffering by their pernicious conduct are to destroy them We are sure that acts from interest We know what his genuine principles were They who allow their passions to confound the distinctions between right and wrong are criminal They may be convinced but they have not come honestly by their conviction one hundred forty two It having been mentioned I know not with what truth that a certain female political writer one hundred forty three whose doctrines he disliked had of late become very fond of dress sat hours together at her toilet and even put on rouge JOHNSON She is better employed at her toilet than using her pen It is better she should be reddening her own cheeks than blackening other people s characters He told us that Addison wrote Budgell s papers in the Spectator at least mended them so much that he made them almost his own and that Draper Tonson s partner assured missus Johnson that the much admired Epilogue to The Distressed Mother which came out in Budgell s name was in reality written by Addison one hundred forty four The mode of government by one may be ill adapted to a small society but is best for a great nation The characteristick of our own government at present is imbecility one hundred forty five The magistrate dare not call the guards for fear of being hanged The guards will not come for fear of being given up to the blind rage of popular juries one hundred forty six Of the father of one of our friends he observed He never clarified his notions by filtrating them through other minds He had a canal upon his estate where at one place the bank was too low I dug the canal deeper said he one hundred forty seven He told me that so long ago as seventeen forty eight one hundred forty eight he had read The Grave a Poem one hundred forty nine but did not like it much I differed from him for though it is not equal throughout and is seldom elegantly correct it abounds in solemn thought and poetical imagery beyond the common reach The world has differed from him for the poem has passed through many editions and is still much read by people of a serious cast of mind A literary lady of large fortune one hundred fifty was mentioned as one who did good to many but by no means by stealth and instead of blushing to find it fame one hundred fifty one acted evidently from vanity JOHNSON I have seen no beings who do as much good from benevolence as she does from whatever motive If there are such under the earth or in the clouds I wish they would come up or come down What Soame Jenyns says upon this subject is not to be minded he is a wit No Sir to act from pure benevolence is not possible for finite beings Human benevolence is mingled with vanity interest or some other motive one hundred fifty two He would not allow me to praise a lady then at Bath observing She does not gain upon me Sir I think her empty headed He was indeed a stern critick upon characters and manners Even missus Thrale did not escape his friendly animadversion at times When he and I were one day endeavouring to ascertain article by article how one of our friends one hundred fifty three could possibly spend as much money in his family as he told us he did she interrupted us by a lively extravagant sally on the expence of clothing his children describing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner Johnson looked a little angry and said Nay Madam when you are declaiming declaim and when you are calculating calculate At another time when she said perhaps affectedly I don t like to fly JOHNSON With your wings Madam you must fly but have a care there are clippers abroad How very well was this said and how fully has experience proved the truth of it But have they not clipped rather rudely and gone a great deal closer than was necessary one hundred fifty four A gentleman one hundred fifty five expressed a wish to go and live three years at Otaheite or New Zealand in order to obtain a full acquaintance with people so totally different from all that we have ever known and be satisfied what pure nature can do for man JOHNSON What could you learn Sir What can savages tell but what they themselves have seen Of the past or the invisible they can tell nothing The inhabitants of Otaheite and New Zealand are not in a state of pure nature for it is plain they broke off from some other people Had they grown out of the ground you might have judged of a state of pure nature Fanciful people may talk of a mythology being amongst them but it must be invention They have once had religion which has been gradually debased And what account of their religion can you suppose to be learnt from savages Only consider Sir our own state our religion is in a book we have an order of men whose duty it is to teach it we have one day in the week set apart for it and this is in general pretty well observed yet ask the first ten gross men you meet and hear what they can tell of their religion On Monday April twenty nine he and I made an excursion to Bristol where I was entertained with seeing him enquire upon the spot into the authenticity of Rowley s Poetry one hundred fifty six as I had seen him enquire upon the spot into the authenticity of Ossian s Poetry one hundred fifty seven George Catcot the pewterer who was as zealous for Rowley as doctor Hugh Blair one hundred fifty eight was for Ossian I trust my Reverend friend will excuse the comparison attended us at our inn and with a triumphant air of lively simplicity called out I ll make doctor Johnson a convert doctor Johnson at his desire read aloud some of Chatterton s fabricated verses while Catcot stood at the back of his chair moving himself like a pendulum and beating time with his feet and now and then looking into doctor Johnson s face wondering that he was not yet convinced We called on mister Barret the surgeon and saw some of the originals as they were called which were executed very artificially one hundred fifty nine but from a careful inspection of them and a consideration of the circumstances with which they were attended we were quite satisfied of the imposture which indeed has been clearly demonstrated from internal evidence by several able criticks one hundred sixty Honest Catcot seemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections but insisted as an end of all controversy that we should go with him to the tower of the church of saint Mary Redcliff and view with our own eyes the ancient chest in which the manuscripts were found To this doctor Johnson good naturedly agreed and though troubled with a shortness of breathing laboured up a long flight of steps till we came to the place where the wonderous chest stood There said Catcot with a bouncing confident credulity there is the very chest itself one hundred sixty one After this ocular demonstration there was no more to be said He brought to my recollection a Scotch Highlander a man of learning too and who had seen the world attesting and at the same time giving his reasons for the authenticity of Fingal I have heard all that poem when I was young Have you Sir Pray what have you heard I have heard Ossian Oscar and every one of them Johnson said of Chatterton This is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things one hundred sixty two We were by no means pleased with our inn at Bristol Let us see now said I how we should describe it Johnson was ready with his raillery Describe it Sir Why it was so bad that Boswell wished to be in Scotland After doctor Johnson s return to London one hundred sixty three I was several times with him at his house where I occasionally slept in the room that had been assigned to me one hundred sixty four I dined with him at doctor Taylor s at General Oglethorpe s and at General Paoli s To avoid a tedious minuteness I shall group together what I have preserved of his conversation during this period also without specifying each scene where it passed except one which will be found so remarkable as certainly to deserve a very particular relation Where the place or the persons do not contribute to the zest of the conversation it is unnecessary to encumber my page with mentioning them To know of what vintage our wine is enables us to judge of its value and to drink it with more relish but to have the produce of each vine of one vineyard in the same year kept separate would serve no purpose To know that our wine to use an advertising phrase is of the stock of an Ambassadour lately deceased heightens its flavour but it signifies nothing to know the bin where each bottle was once deposited Garrick he observed does not play the part of Archer in The Beaux Stratagem well The gentleman should break out through the footman which is not the case as he does it one hundred sixty five Where there is no education as in savage countries men will have the upper hand of women Bodily strength no doubt contributes to this but it would be so exclusive of that for it is mind that always governs When it comes to dry understanding man has the better The little volumes entitled Respublicae one hundred sixty six which are very well done were a bookseller s work There is much talk of the misery which we cause to the brute creation but they are recompensed by existence one hundred sixty seven If they were not useful to man and therefore protected by him they would not be nearly so numerous This argument is to be found in the able and benignant Hutchinson s Moral Philosophy But the question is whether the animals who endure such sufferings of various kinds for the service and entertainment of man would accept of existence upon the terms on which they have it Madame Sevigne one hundred sixty eight who though she had many enjoyments felt with delicate sensibility the prevalence of misery complains of the task of existence having been imposed upon her without her consent one hundred sixty nine That man is never happy for the present is so true that all his relief from unhappiness is only forgetting himself for a little while Life is a progress from want to want not from enjoyment to enjoyment one hundred seventy Though many men are nominally entrusted with the administration of hospitals and other publick institutions almost all the good is done by one man by whom the rest are driven on owing to confidence in him and indolence in them one hundred seventy one Lord Chesterfield s Letters to his Son I think might be made a very pretty book Take out the immorality and it should be put into the hands of every young gentleman An elegant manner and easiness of behaviour are acquired gradually and imperceptibly No man can say I ll be genteel There are ten genteel women for one genteel man because they are more restrained A man without some degree of restraint is insufferable but we are all less restrained than women Were a woman sitting in company to put out her legs before her as most men do we should be tempted to kick them in No man was a more attentive and nice observer of behaviour in those in whose company he happened to be than Johnson or however strange it may seem to many had a higher estimation of its refinements one hundred seventy two Lord Eliot informs me that one day when Johnson and he were at dinner at a gentleman s house in London upon Lord Chesterfield s Letters being mentioned Johnson surprized the company by this sentence Every man of any education would rather be called a rascal than accused of deficiency in the graces mister Gibbon who was present turned to a lady who knew Johnson well and lived much with him and in his quaint manner tapping his box addressed her thus Don t you think Madam looking towards Johnson that among all your acquaintance you could find one exception The lady smiled and seemed to acquiesce one hundred seventy three I read said he Sharpe s letters on Italy over again when I was at Bath There is a great deal of matter in them one hundred seventy four missus Williams was angry that Thrale s family did not send regularly to her every time they heard from me while I was in the Hebrides Little people are apt to be jealous but they should not be jealous for they ought to consider that superiour attention will necessarily be paid to superiour fortune or rank Two persons may have equal merit and on that account may have an equal claim to attention but one of them may have also fortune and rank and so may have a double claim Talking of his notes on Shakspeare he said I despise those who do not see that I am right in the passage where as is repeated and asses of great charge introduced That on To be or not to be is disputable one hundred seventy five A gentleman whom I found sitting with him one morning said that in his opinion the character of an infidel was more detestable than that of a man notoriously guilty of an atrocious crime I differed from him because we are surer of the odiousness of the one than of the errour of the other JOHNSON Sir I agree with him for the infidel would be guilty of any crime if he were inclined to it Many things which are false are transmitted from book to book and gain credit in the world One of these is the cry against the evil of luxury Now the truth is that luxury produces much good one hundred seventy six Take the luxury of buildings in London Does it not produce real advantage in the conveniency and elegance of accommodation and this all from the exertion of industry People will tell you with a melancholy face how many builders are in gaol It is plain they are in gaol not for building for rents are not fallen A man gives half a guinea for a dish of green peas How much gardening does this occasion how many labourers must the competition to have such things early in the market keep in employment You will hear it said very gravely Why was not the half guinea thus spent in luxury given to the poor To how many might it have afforded a good meal Alas has it not gone to the industrious poor whom it is better to support than the idle poor You are much surer that you are doing good when you pay money to those who work as the recompence of their labour than when you give money merely in charity Suppose the ancient luxury of a dish of peacock s brains were to be revived how many carcases would be left to the poor at a cheap rate and as to the rout that is made about people who are ruined by extravagance it is no matter to the nation that some individuals suffer When so much general productive exertion is the consequence of luxury the nation does not care though there are debtors in gaol nay they would not care though their creditors were there too one hundred seventy seven The uncommon vivacity of General Oglethorpe s mind and variety of knowledge having sometimes made his conversation seem too desultory Johnson observed Oglethorpe Sir never completes what he has to say He on the same account made a similar remark on Patrick Lord Elibank Sir there is nothing conclusive in his talk one hundred seventy eight When I complained of having dined at a splendid table without hearing one sentence of conversation worthy of being remembered he said Sir there seldom is any such conversation BOSWELL Why then meet at table JOHNSON Why to eat and drink together and to promote kindness and Sir this is better done when there is no solid conversation for when there is people differ in opinion and get into bad humour or some of the company who are not capable of such conversation are left out and feel themselves uneasy It was for this reason Sir Robert Walpole said he always talked bawdy at his table because in that all could join one hundred seventy nine Being irritated by hearing a gentleman one hundred eighty ask mister Levett a variety of questions concerning him when he was sitting by he broke out Sir you have but two topicks yourself and me I am sick of both A man said he should not talk of himself nor much of any particular person He should take care not to be made a proverb and therefore should avoid having any one topick of which people can say We shall hear him upon it There was a doctor Oldfield who was always talking of the Duke of Marlborough He came into a coffee house one day and told that his Grace had spoken in the House of Lords for half an hour Did he indeed speak for half an hour said Belchier the surgeon Yes And what did he say of doctor Oldfield Nothing Why then Sir he was very ungrateful for doctor Oldfield could not have spoken for a quarter of an hour without saying something of him Every man is to take existence on the terms on which it is given to him one hundred eighty one To some men it is given on condition of not taking liberties which other men may take without much harm One may drink wine and be nothing the worse for it on another wine may have effects so inflammatory as to injure him both in body and mind and perhaps make him commit something for which he may deserve to be hanged Lord Hailes s Annals of Scotland one hundred eighty two have not that painted form which is the taste of this age but it is a book which will always sell it has such a stability of dates such a certainty of facts and such a punctuality of citation I never before read Scotch history with certainty I asked him whether he would advise me to read the Bible with a commentary and what commentaries he would recommend JOHNSON To be sure Sir I would have you read the Bible with a commentary and I would recommend Lowth and Patrick on the Old Testament and Hammond on the New During my stay in London this spring I solicited his attention to another law case in which I was engaged In the course of a contested election for the Borough of Dumfermline which I attended as one of my friend Colonel afterwards Sir Archibald Campbell s counsel one of his political agents who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer and having deserted to the opposite party for a pecuniary reward attacked very rudely in a news paper the Reverend mister James Thomson one of the ministers of that place on account of a supposed allusion to him in one of his sermons Upon this the minister on a subsequent Sunday arraigned him by name from the pulpit with some severity and the agent after the sermon was over rose up and asked the minister aloud What bribe he had received for telling so many lies from the chair of verity one hundred eighty three I was present at this very extraordinary scene The person arraigned and his father and brother who had also had a share both of the reproof from the pulpit and in the retaliation brought an action against mister Thomson in the Court of Session for defamation and damages and I was one of the counsel for the reverend defendant The Liberty of the Pulpit was our great ground of defence but we argued also on the provocation of the previous attack and on the instant retaliation The Court of Session however the fifteen Judges who are at the same time the Jury decided against the minister contrary to my humble opinion and several of them expressed themselves with indignation against him He was an aged gentleman formerly a military chaplain and a man of high spirit and honour Johnson was satisfied that the judgement was wrong and dictated to me the following argument in confutation of it Of the censure pronounced from the pulpit our determination must be formed as in other cases by a consideration of the action itself and the particular circumstances with which it is invested The right of censure and rebuke seems necessarily appendant to the pastoral office He to whom the care of a congregation is entrusted is considered as the shepherd of a flock as the teacher of a school as the father of a family As a shepherd tending not his own sheep but those of his master he is answerable for those that stray and that lose themselves by straying But no man can be answerable for losses which he has not power to prevent or for vagrancy which he has not authority to restrain As a teacher giving instruction for wages and liable to reproach if those whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency he must have the power of enforcing attendance of awakening negligence and repressing contradiction As a father he possesses the paternal authority of admonition rebuke and punishment He cannot without reducing his office to an empty name be hindered from the exercise of any practice necessary to stimulate the idle to reform the vicious to check the petulant and correct the stubborn If we enquire into the practice of the primitive church we shall I believe find the ministers of the word exercising the whole authority of this complicated character We shall find them not only encouraging the good by exhortation but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation In the earliest ages of the Church while religion was yet pure from secular advantages the punishment of sinners was publick censure and open penance penalties inflicted merely by ecclesiastical authority at a time while the church had yet no help from the civil power while the hand of the magistrate lifted only the rod of persecution and when governours were ready to afford a refuge to all those who fled from clerical authority That the Church therefore had once a power of publick censure is evident because that power was frequently exercised That it borrowed not its power from the civil authority is likewise certain because civil authority was at that time its enemy The hour came at length when after three hundred years of struggle and distress Truth took possession of imperial power and the civil laws lent their aid to the ecclesiastical constitutions The magistrate from that time company operated with the priest and clerical sentences were made efficacious by secular force But the State when it came to the assistance of the church had no intention to diminish its authority Those rebukes and those censures which were lawful before were lawful still But they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary submission The refractory and contemptuous were at first in no danger of temporal severities except what they might suffer from the reproaches of conscience or the detestation of their fellow Christians When religion obtained the support of law if admonitions and censures had no effect they were seconded by the magistrates with coercion and punishment It therefore appears from ecclesiastical history that the right of inflicting shame by publick censure has been always considered as inherent in the Church and that this right was not conferred by the civil power for it was exercised when the civil power operated against it By the civil power it was never taken away for the Christian magistrate interposed his office not to rescue sinners from censure but to supply more powerful means of reformation to add pain where shame was insufficient and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the society of the faithful to restrain them by imprisonment from spreading abroad the contagion of wickedness It is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of publick censure grew in time the practice of auricular confession Those who dreaded the blast of publick reprehension were willing to submit themselves to the priest by a private accusation of themselves and to obtain a reconciliation with the Church by a kind of clandestine absolution and invisible penance conditions with which the priest would in times of ignorance and corruption easily comply as they increased his influence by adding the knowledge of secret sins to that of notorious offences and enlarged his authority by making him the sole arbiter of the terms of reconcilement From this bondage the Reformation set us free The minister has no longer power to press into the retirements of conscience to torture us by interrogatories or put himself in possession of our secrets and our lives But though we have thus controlled his usurpations his just and original power remains unimpaired He may still see though he may not pry he may yet hear though he may not question And that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is still his duty to use for the benefit of his flock A father who lives near a wicked neighbour may forbid a son to frequent his company A minister who has in his congregation a man of open and scandalous wickedness may warn his parishioners to shun his conversation To warn them is not only lawful but not to warn them would be criminal He may warn them one by one in friendly converse or by a parochial visitation But if he may warn each man singly what shall forbid him to warn them altogether Of that which is to be made known to all how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each singly or to all together What is known to all must necessarily be publick Whether it shall be publick at once or publick by degrees is the only question And of a sudden and solemn publication the impression is deeper and the warning more effectual It may easily be urged if a minister be thus left at liberty to delate sinners from the pulpit and to publish at will the crimes of a parishioner he may often blast the innocent and distress the timorous He may be suspicious and condemn without evidence he may be rash and judge without examination he may be severe and treat slight offences with too much harshness he may be malignant and partial and gratify his private interest or resentment under the shelter of his pastoral character Of all this there is possibility and of all this there is danger But if possibility of evil be to exclude good no good ever can be done If nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger we must all sink into hopeless inactivity The evils that may be feared from this practice arise not from any defect in the institution but from the infirmities of human nature Power in whatever hands it is placed will be sometimes improperly exerted yet courts of law must judge though they will sometimes judge amiss A father must instruct his children though he himself may often want instruction A minister must censure sinners though his censure may be sometimes erroneous by want of judgement and sometimes unjust by want of honesty If we examine the circumstances of the present case we shall find the sentence neither erroneous nor unjust we shall find no breach of private confidence no intrusion into secret transactions The fact was notorious and indubitable so easy to be proved that no proof was desired The act was base and treacherous the perpetration insolent and open and the example naturally mischievous The minister however being retired and recluse had not yet heard what was publickly known throughout the parish and on occasion of a publick election warned his people according to his duty against the crimes which publick elections frequently produce His warning was felt by one of his parishioners as pointed particularly at himself But instead of producing as might be wished private compunction and immediate reformation it kindled only rage and resentment He charged his minister in a publick paper with scandal defamation and falsehood The minister thus reproached had his own character to vindicate upon which his pastoral authority must necessarily depend To be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life To be charged with polluting the pastoral office with scandal and falsehood was a violation of character still more atrocious as it affected not only his personal but his clerical veracity His indignation naturally rose in proportion to his honesty and with all the fortitude of injured honesty he dared this calumniator in the church and at once exonerated himself from censure and rescued his flock from deception and from danger The man whom he accuses pretends not to be innocent or at least only pretends for he declines a trial The crime of which he is accused has frequent opportunities and strong temptations It has already spread far with much depravation of private morals and much injury to publick happiness To warn the people therefore against it was not wanton and officious but necessary and pastoral What then is the fault with which this worthy minister is charged He has usurped no dominion over conscience He has exerted no authority in support of doubtful and controverted opinions He has not dragged into light a bashful and corrigible sinner His censure was directed against a breach of morality against an act which no man justifies The man who appropriated this censure to himself is evidently and notoriously guilty His consciousness of his own wickedness incited him to attack his faithful reprover with open insolence and printed accusations Such an attack made defence necessary and we hope it will be at last decided that the means of defence were just and lawful When I read this to mister Burke he was highly pleased and exclaimed Well he does his work in a workman like manner one hundred eighty four mister Thomson wished to bring the cause by appeal before the House of Lords but was dissuaded by the advice of the noble person who lately presided so ably in that Most Honourable House and who was then Attorney General As my readers will no doubt be glad also to read the opinion of this eminent man upon the same subject I shall here insert it CASE There is herewith laid before you one Petition for the Reverend mister James Thomson minister of Dumfermline two Answers thereto three Copy of the judgement of the Court of Session upon both four Notes of the opinions of the Judges being the reasons upon which their decree is grounded These papers you will please to peruse and give your opinion Whether there is a probability of the above decree of the Court of Session s being reversed if mister Thomson should appeal from the same I don t think the appeal adviseable not only because the value of the judgement is in no degree adequate to the expence but because there are many chances that upon the general complexion of the case the impression will be taken to the disadvantage of the appellant It is impossible to approve the style of that sermon But the complaint was not less ungracious from that man who had behaved so ill by his original libel and at the time when he received the reproach he complains of In the last article all the plaintiffs are equally concerned It struck me also with some wonder that the Judges should think so much fervour apposite to the occasion of reproving the defendant for a little excess Upon the matter however I agree with them in condemning the behaviour of the minister and in thinking it a subject fit for ecclesiastical censure and even for an action if any individual could qualify one hundred eighty five a wrong and a damage arising from it But this I doubt The circumstance of publishing the reproach in a pulpit though extremely indecent and culpable in another view does not constitute a different sort of wrong or any other rule of law than would have obtained if the same words had been pronounced elsewhere I don t know whether there be any difference in the law of Scotland in the definition of slander before the Commissaries or the Court of Session The common law of England does not give way to actions for every reproachful word An action cannot be brought for general damages upon any words which import less than an offence cognisable by law consequently no action could have been brought here for the words in question Both laws admit the truth to be a justification in action for words and the law of England does the same in actions for libels The judgement therefore seems to me to have been wrong in that the Court repelled that defence E THURLOW I am now to record a very curious incident in doctor Johnson s Life which fell under my own observation of which pars magna fui one hundred eighty six and which I am persuaded will with the liberal minded be much to his credit My desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description had made me much about the same time obtain an introduction to doctor Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes esquire Two men more different could perhaps not be selected out of all mankind They had even attacked one another with some asperity one hundred eighty seven in their writings yet I lived in habits of friendship with both one hundred eighty eight I could fully relish the excellence of each for I have ever delighted in that intellectual chymistry which can separate good qualities from evil in the same person Sir John Pringle mine own friend and my Father s friend between whom and doctor Johnson I in vain wished to establish an acquaintance one hundred eighty nine as I respected and lived in intimacy with both of them observed to me once very ingeniously It is not in friendship as in mathematicks where two things each equal to a third are equal between themselves You agree with Johnson as a middle quality and you agree with me as a middle quality but Johnson and I should not agree Sir John was not sufficiently flexible so I desisted knowing indeed that the repulsion was equally strong on the part of Johnson who I know not from what cause unless his being a Scotchman had formed a very erroneous opinion of Sir John But I conceived an irresistible wish if possible to bring doctor Johnson and mister Wilkes together How to manage it was a nice and difficult matter My worthy booksellers and friends Messieurs Dilly in the Poultry one hundred ninety at whose hospitable and well covered table I have seen a greater number of literary men than at any other except that of Sir Joshua Reynolds had invited me to meet mister Wilkes and some more gentlemen on Wednesday May fifteen Pray said I let us have doctor Johnson What with mister Wilkes not for the world said mister Edward Dilly doctor Johnson would never forgive me Come said I if you ll let me negociate for you I will be answerable that all shall go well DILLY Nay if you will take it upon you I am sure I shall be very happy to see them both here Notwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained for doctor Johnson I was sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of contradiction and by means of that I hoped I should gain my point I was persuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct proposal Sir will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes he would have flown into a passion and would probably have answered Dine with Jack Wilkes Sir I d as soon dine with Jack Ketch one hundred ninety one I therefore while we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an evening took occasion to open my plan thus mister Dilly Sir sends his respectful compliments to you and would be happy if you would do him the honour to dine with him on Wednesday next along with me as I must soon go to Scotland JOHNSON Sir I am obliged to mister Dilly I will wait upon him BOSWELL Provided Sir I suppose that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you JOHNSON What do you mean Sir What do you take me for Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table BOSWELL I beg your pardon Sir for wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like Perhaps he may have some of what he calls his patriotick friends with him JOHNSON Well Sir and what then What care I for his patriotick friends one hundred ninety two Poh BOSWELL I should not be surprized to find Jack Wilkes there JOHNSON And if Jack Wilkes should be there what is that to me Sir My dear friend let us have no more of this I am sorry to be angry with you but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever occasionally BOSWELL Pray forgive me Sir I meant well But you shall meet whoever comes for me Thus I secured him and told Dilly that he would find him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the day appointed Upon the much expected Wednesday I called on him about half an hour before dinner as I often did when we were to dine out together to see that he was ready in time and to accompany him I found him buffeting his books as upon a former occasion one hundred ninety three covered with dust and making no preparation for going abroad How is this Sir said I Don t you recollect that you are to dine at mister Dilly s JOHNSON Sir I did not think of going to Dilly s it went out of my head I have ordered dinner at home with missus Williams BOSWELL But my dear Sir you know you were engaged to mister Dilly and I told him so He will expect you and will be much disappointed if you don t come JOHNSON You must talk to missus Williams about this Here was a sad dilemma I feared that what I was so confident I had secured would yet be frustrated He had accustomed himself to shew missus Williams such a degree of humane attention as frequently imposed some restraint upon him and I knew that if she should be obstinate he would not stir I hastened down stairs to the blind lady s room and told her I was in great uneasiness for doctor Johnson had engaged to me to dine this day at mister Dilly s but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement and had ordered dinner at home Yes Sir said she pretty peevishly doctor Johnson is to dine at home Madam said I his respect for you is such that I know he will not leave you unless you absolutely desire it But as you have so much of his company I hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day as mister Dilly is a very worthy man has frequently had agreeable parties at his house for doctor Johnson and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to day And then Madam be pleased to consider my situation I carried the message and I assured mister Dilly that doctor Johnson was to come and no doubt he has made a dinner and invited a company and boasted of the honour he expected to have I shall be quite disgraced if the Doctor is not there She gradually softened to my solicitations which were certainly as earnest as most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion and was graciously pleased to empower me to tell doctor Johnson That all things considered she thought he should certainly go I flew back to him still in dust and careless of what should be the event indifferent in his choice to go or stay one hundred ninety four but as soon as I had announced to him missus Williams consent he roared Frank a clean shirt and was very soon drest When I had him fairly seated in a hackney coach with me I exulted as much as a fortune hunter who has got an heiress into a post chaise with him to set out for Gretna Green When we entered mister Dilly s drawing room he found himself in the midst of a company he did not know I kept myself snug and silent watching how he would conduct himself I observed him whispering to mister Dilly Who is that gentleman Sir mister Arthur Lee JOHNSON Too too too under his breath which was one of his habitual mutterings one hundred ninety five mister Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to Johnson for he was not only a patriot but an American one hundred ninety six He was afterwards minister from the United States at the court of Madrid And who is the gentleman in lace mister Wilkes Sir This information confounded him still more he had some difficulty to restrain himself and taking up a book sat down upon a window seat and read or at least kept his eye upon it intently for some time till he composed himself His feelings I dare say were aukward enough But he no doubt recollected his having rated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any company and he therefore resolutely set himself to behave quite as an easy man of the world who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet The cheering sound of Dinner is upon the table dissolved his reverie and we all sat down without any symptom of ill humour There were present beside mister Wilkes and mister Arthur Lee who was an old companion of mine when he studied physick at Edinburgh mister now Sir John Miller doctor Lettsom and mister Slater the druggist mister Wilkes placed himself next to doctor Johnson and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness one hundred ninety seven that he gained upon him insensibly No man eat more heartily than Johnson or loved better what was nice and delicate mister Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal Pray give me leave Sir It is better here A little of the brown Some fat Sir A little of the stuffing Some gravy Let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange or the lemon perhaps may have more zest Sir Sir I am obliged to you Sir cried Johnson bowing and turning his head to him with a look for some time of surly virtue one hundred ninety eight but in a short while of complacency Foote being mentioned Johnson said He is not a good mimick one hundred ninety nine One of the company added A merry Andrew a buffoon JOHNSON But he has wit too and is not deficient in ideas or in fertility and variety of imagery and not empty of reading he has knowledge enough to fill up his part One species of wit he has in an eminent degree that of escape You drive him into a corner with both hands but he s gone Sir when you think you have got him like an animal that jumps over your head Then he has a great range for wit he never lets truth stand between him and a jest and he is sometimes mighty coarse Garrick is under many restraints from which Foote is free two hundred WILKES Garrick s wit is more like Lord Chesterfield s JOHNSON The first time I was in company with Foote was at Fitzherbert s Having no good opinion of the fellow I was resolved not to be pleased and it is very difficult to please a man against his will two hundred one I went on eating my dinner pretty sullenly affecting not to mind him But the dog was so very comical that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork throw myself back upon my chair and fairly laugh it out No Sir he was irresistible two hundred two He upon one occasion experienced in an extraordinary degree the efficacy of his powers of entertaining Amongst the many and various modes which he tried of getting money he became a partner with a small beer brewer and he was to have a share of the profits for procuring customers amongst his numerous acquaintance Fitzherbert was one who took his small beer but it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink it They were at some loss how to notify their resolution being afraid of offending their master who they knew liked Foote much as a companion At last they fixed upon a little black boy who was rather a favourite to be their deputy and deliver their remonstrance and having invested him with the whole authority of the kitchen he was to inform mister Fitzherbert in all their names upon a certain day that they would drink Foote s small beer no longer On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert s and this boy served at table he was so delighted with Foote s stories and merriment and grimace that when he went down stairs he told them This is the finest man I have ever seen I will not deliver your message I will drink his small beer Somebody observed that Garrick could not have done this WILKES Garrick would have made the small beer still smaller He is now leaving the stage but he will play Scrub two hundred three all his life I knew that Johnson would let nobody attack Garrick but himself two hundred four as Garrick once said to me and I had heard him praise his liberality so to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil I said loudly I have heard Garrick is liberal two hundred five JOHNSON Yes Sir I know that Garrick has given away more money than any man in England that I am acquainted with and that not from ostentatious views Garrick was very poor when he began life so when he came to have money he probably was very unskilful in giving away and saved when he should not But Garrick began to be liberal as soon as he could and I am of opinion the reputation of avarice which he has had has been very lucky for him and prevented his having many enemies You despise a man for avarice but do not hate him Garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more splendour than is suitable to a player two hundred six if they had had the wit to have assaulted him in that quarter they might have galled him more But they have kept clamouring about his avarice which has rescued him from much obloquy and envy Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentick information for biography two hundred seven Johnson told us When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the Life of Dryden and in order to get materials I applied to the only two persons then alive who had seen him two hundred eight these were old Swinney two hundred nine and old Cibber Swinney s information was no more than this That at Will s coffee house Dryden had a particular chair for himself which was set by the fire in winter and was then called his winter chair and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in summer and was then called his summer chair Cibber could tell no more but That he remembered him a decent old man arbiter of critical disputes at Will s two hundred ten You are to consider that Cibber was then at a great distance from Dryden had perhaps one leg only in the room and durst not draw in the other BOSWELL Yet Cibber was a man of observation JOHNSON I think not two hundred eleven BOSWELL You will allow his Apology to be well done JOHNSON Very well done to be sure Sir two hundred twelve That book is a striking proof of the justice of Pope s remark Each might his several province well command Would all but stoop to what they understand two hundred thirteen BOSWELL And his plays are good JOHNSON Yes but that was his trade l esprit du corps he had been all his life among players and play writers two hundred fourteen I wondered that he had so little to say in conversation for he had kept the best company and learnt all that can be got by the ear He abused Pindar to me and then shewed me an Ode of his own with an absurd couplet making a linnet soar on an eagle s wing two hundred fifteen I told him that when the ancients made a simile they always made it like something real mister Wilkes remarked that among all the bold flights of Shakspeare s imagination the boldest was making Birnamwood march to Dunsinane creating a wood where there never was a shrub a wood in Scotland ha ha ha And he also observed that the clannish slavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the single exception to Milton s remark of The Mountain Nymph sweet Liberty two hundred sixteen being worshipped in all hilly countries When I was at Inverary said he on a visit to my old friend Archibald Duke of Argyle his dependents congratulated me on being such a favourite of his Grace I said It is then gentlemen truely lucky for me for if I had displeased the Duke and he had wished it there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring John Wilkes s head to him in a charger It would have been only Off with his head So much for Aylesbury two hundred seventeen I was then member for Aylesbury doctor Johnson and mister Wilkes talked of the contested passage in Horace s Art of Poetry two hundred eighteen Difficile est proprie communia dicere mister Wilkes according to my note gave the interpretation thus It is difficult to speak with propriety of common things as if a poet had to speak of Queen Caroline drinking tea he must endeavour to avoid the vulgarity of cups and saucers But upon reading my note he tells me that he meant to say that the word communia being a Roman law term signifies here things communis juris that is to say what have never yet been treated by any body and this appears clearly from what followed Tuque Rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus You will easier make a tragedy out of the Iliad than on any subject not handled before two hundred nineteen JOHNSON He means that it is difficult to appropriate to particular persons qualities which are common to all mankind as Homer has done WILKES We have no City Poet now that is an office which has gone into disuse The last was Elkanah Settle There is something in names which one cannot help feeling Now Elkanah Settle sounds so queer who can expect much from that name We should have no hesitation to give it for John Dryden in preference to Elkanah Settle from the names only without knowing their different merits two hundred twenty JOHNSON I suppose Sir Settle did as well for Aldermen in his time as John Home could do now Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn English two hundred twenty one mister Arthur Lee mentioned some Scotch who had taken possession of a barren part of America and wondered why they should choose it JOHNSON Why Sir all barrenness is comparative The Scotch would not know it to be barren BOSWELL Come come he is flattering the English You have now been in Scotland Sir and say if you did not see meat and drink enough there JOHNSON Why yes Sir meat and drink enough to give the inhabitants sufficient strength to run away from home All these quick and lively sallies were said sportively quite in jest and with a smile which showed that he meant only wit Upon this topick he and mister Wilkes could perfectly assimilate here was a bond of union between them and I was conscious that as both of them had visited Caledonia both were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who imagine that it is a land of famine two hundred twenty two But they amused themselves with persevering in the old jokes When I claimed a superiority for Scotland over England in one respect that no man can be arrested there for a debt merely because another swears it against him but there must first be the judgement of a court of law ascertaining its justice and that a seizure of the person before judgement is obtained can take place only if his creditor should swear that he is about to fly from the country or as it is technically expressed is in meditatione fugae WILKES That I should think may be safely sworn of all the Scotch nation JOHNSON to mister Wilkes You must know Sir I lately took my friend Boswell and shewed him genuine civilised life in an English provincial town I turned him loose at Lichfield my native city that he might see for once real civility two hundred twenty three for you know he lives among savages in Scotland and among rakes in London WILKES Except when he is with grave sober decent people like you and me JOHNSON smiling And we ashamed of him They were quite frank and easy Johnson told the story two hundred twenty four of his asking missus Macaulay to allow her footman to sit down with them to prove the ridiculousness of the argument for the equality of mankind and he said to me afterwards with a nod of satisfaction You saw mister Wilkes acquiesced Wilkes talked with all imaginable freedom of the ludicrous title given to the Attorney General Diabolus Regis adding I have reason to know something about that officer for I was prosecuted for a libel Johnson who many people would have supposed must have been furiously angry at hearing this talked of so lightly said not a word He was now indeed a good humoured fellow two hundred twenty five After dinner we had an accession of missus Knowles two hundred twenty six the Quaker lady well known for her various talents and of mister Alderman Lee Amidst some patriotick groans somebody I think the Alderman said Poor old England is lost JOHNSON Sir it is not so much to be lamented that Old England is lost as that the Scotch have found it two hundred twenty seven WILKES Had Lord Bute governed Scotland only I should not have taken the trouble to write his eulogy and dedicate Mortimer to him two hundred twenty eight mister Wilkes held a candle to shew a fine print of a beautiful female figure which hung in the room and pointed out the elegant contour of the bosom with the finger of an arch connoisseur He afterwards in a conversation with me waggishly insisted that all the time Johnson shewed visible signs of a fervent admiration of the corresponding charms of the fair Quaker This record though by no means so perfect as I could wish will serve to give a notion of a very curious interview which was not only pleasing at the time but had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling any animosity and sweetening any acidity which in the various bustle of political contest had been produced in the minds of two men who though widely different had so many things in common classical learning modern literature wit and humour and ready repartee that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been for ever at a distance from each other two hundred twenty nine mister Burke gave me much credit for this successful negociation and pleasantly said that there was nothing to equal it in the whole history of the Corps Diplomatique I attended doctor Johnson home and had the satisfaction to hear him tell missus Williams how much he had been pleased with mister Wilkes s company and what an agreeable day he had passed two hundred thirty I talked a good deal to him of the celebrated Margaret Caroline Rudd whom I had visited induced by the fame of her talents address and irresistible power of fascination two hundred thirty one To a lady who disapproved of my visiting her he said on a former occasion two hundred thirty two Nay Madam Boswell is in the right I should have visited her myself were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the news papers This evening he exclaimed I envy him his acquaintance with missus Rudd I mentioned a scheme which I had of making a tour to the Isle of Man and giving a full account of it and that mister Burke had playfully suggested as a motto The proper study of mankind is MAN two hundred thirty three JOHNSON Sir you will get more by the book than the jaunt will cost you so you will have your diversion for nothing and add to your reputation On the evening of the next day I took leave of him being to set out for Scotland two hundred thirty four I thanked him with great warmth for all his kindness Sir said he you are very welcome Nobody repays it with more How very false is the notion which has gone round the world of the rough and passionate and harsh manners of this great and good man That he had occasional sallies of heat of temper and that he was sometimes perhaps too easily provoked two hundred thirty five by absurdity and folly and sometimes too desirous of triumph in colloquial contest must be allowed The quickness both of his perception and sensibility disposed him to sudden explosions of satire to which his extraordinary readiness of wit was a strong and almost irresistible incitement To adopt one of the finest images in mister Home s Douglas two hundred thirty six On each glance of thought Decision followed as the thunderbolt Pursues the flash I admit that the beadle within him was often so eager to apply the lash that the Judge had not time to consider the case with sufficient deliberation That he was occasionally remarkable for violence of temper may be granted but let us ascertain the degree and not let it be supposed that he was in a perpetual rage and never without a club in his hand to knock down every one who approached him On the contrary the truth is that by much the greatest part of his time he was civil obliging nay polite in the true sense of the word so much so that many gentlemen who were long acquainted with him never received or even heard a strong expression from him two hundred thirty seven The following letters concerning an Epitaph which he wrote for the monument of doctor Goldsmith in Westminster Abbey afford at once a proof of his unaffected modesty his carelessness as to his own writings and of the great respect which he entertained for the taste and judgement of the excellent and eminent person to whom they are addressed TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS DEAR SIR I have been kept away from you I know not well how and of these vexatious hindrances I know not when there will be an end I therefore send you the poor dear Doctor s epitaph Read it first yourself and if you then think it right shew it to the Club I am you know willing to be corrected If you think any thing much amiss keep it to yourself till we come together I have sent two copies but prefer the card The dates must be settled by doctor Percy I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May sixteen seventeen seventy six TO THE SAME SIR Miss Reynolds has a mind to send the Epitaph to doctor Beattie I am very willing but having no copy cannot immediately recollect it She tells me you have lost it Try to recollect and put down as much as you retain you perhaps may have kept what I have dropped The lines for which I am at a loss are something of rerum civilium sive naturalium two hundred thirty eight It was a sorry trick to lose it help me if you can I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON June twenty two seventeen seventy six The gout grows better but slowly two hundred thirty nine It was I think after I had left London this year that this Epitaph gave occasion to a Remonstrance to the MONARCH OF LITERATURE for an account of which I am indebted to Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo That my readers may have the subject more fully and clearly before them I shall first insert the Epitaph OLIVARII GOLDSMITH Poetae Physici Historici Qui nullum fere scribendi genus Non tetigit Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit two hundred forty Sive risus essent movendi Sive lacrymae Affectuum potens at lenis dominator Ingenio sublimis vividus versatilis Oratione grandis nitidus venustus Hoc monumento memoriam coluit Sodalium amor Amicorum fides Lectorum veneratio Natus in Hibernia Forniae Longfordiensis In loco cui nomen Pallas Nov XXIX MDCCXXXI two hundred forty one Eblanae literis institutus Obiit Londini April IV MDCCLXXIV Sir William Forbes writes to me thus I enclose the Round Robin This jeu d esprit took its rise one day at dinner at our friend Sir Joshua Reynolds s two hundred forty two All the company present except myself were friends and acquaintance of doctor Goldsmith two hundred forty three The Epitaph written for him by doctor Johnson became the subject of conversation and various emendations were suggested which it was agreed should be submitted to the Doctor s consideration But the question was who should have the courage to propose them to him At last it was hinted that there could be no way so good as that of a Round Robin as the sailors call it which they make use of when they enter into a conspiracy so as not to let it be known who puts his name first or last to the paper This proposition was instantly assented to and doctor Barnard Dean of Derry now Bishop of Killaloe two hundred forty four drew up an address to doctor Johnson on the occasion replete with wit and humour but which it was feared the Doctor might think treated the subject with too much levity mister Burke then proposed the address as it stands in the paper in writing to which I had the honour to officiate as clerk Sir Joshua agreed to carry it to doctor Johnson who received it with much good humour two hundred forty five and desired Sir Joshua to tell the gentlemen that he would alter the Epitaph in any manner they pleased as to the sense of it but he would never consent to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English inscription I consider this Round Robin as a species of literary curiosity worth preserving as it marks in a certain degree doctor Johnson s character My readers are presented with a faithful transcript of a paper which I doubt not of their being desirous to see Sir William Forbes s observation is very just The anecdote now related proves in the strongest manner the reverence and awe with which Johnson was regarded by some of the most eminent men of his time in various departments and even by such of them as lived most with him while it also confirms what I have again and again inculcated that he was by no means of that ferocious and irascible character which has been ignorantly imagined This hasty composition is also to be remarked as one of a thousand instances which evince the extraordinary promptitude of mister Burke who while he is equal to the greatest things can adorn the least can with equal facility embrace the vast and complicated speculations of politicks or the ingenious topicks of literary investigation two hundred forty six doctor JOHNSON TO missus BOSWELL MADAM You must not think me uncivil in omitting to answer the letter with which you favoured me some time ago I imagined it to have been written without mister Boswell s knowledge and therefore supposed the answer to require what I could not find a private conveyance The difference with Lord Auchinleck is now over and since young Alexander two hundred forty seven has appeared I hope no more difficulties will arise among you for I sincerely wish you all happy Do not teach the young ones to dislike me as you dislike me yourself but let me at least have Veronica s kindness because she is my acquaintance You will now have mister Boswell home it is well that you have him he has led a wild life I have taken him to Lichfield and he has followed mister Thrale to Bath Pray take care of him and tame him The only thing in which I have the honour to agree with you is in loving him and while we are so much of a mind in a matter of so much importance our other quarrels will I hope produce no great bitterness I am Madam Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May sixteen seventeen seventy six mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh June twenty five seventeen seventy six You have formerly complained that my letters were too long There is no danger of that complaint being made at present for I find it difficult for me to write to you at all Here an account of having been afflicted with a return of melancholy or bad spirits The boxes of books two hundred forty eight which you sent to me are arrived but I have not yet examined the contents I send you mister Maclaurin s paper for the negro who claims his freedom in the Court of Session two hundred forty nine doctor JOHNSON TO mister BOSWELL Dear Sir These black fits of which you complain perhaps hurt your memory as well as your imagination When did I complain that your letters were too long two hundred fifty Your last letter after a very long delay brought very bad news Here a series of reflections upon melancholy and what I could not help thinking strangely unreasonable in him who had suffered so much from it himself a good deal of severity and reproof as if it were owing to my own fault or that I was perhaps affecting it from a desire of distinction Read Cheyne s English Malady two hundred fifty one but do not let him teach you a foolish notion that melancholy is a proof of acuteness To hear that you have not opened your boxes of books is very offensive The examination and arrangement of so many volumes might have afforded you an amusement very seasonable at present and useful for the whole of life I am I confess very angry that you manage yourself so ill two hundred fifty two I do not now say any more than that I am with great kindness and sincerity dear Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON July two seventeen seventy six It was last year two hundred fifty three determined by Lord Mansfield in the Court of King s Bench that a negro cannot be taken out of the kingdom without his own consent doctor JOHNSON TO mister BOSWELL DEAR SIR I make haste to write again lest my last letter should give you too much pain If you are really oppressed with overpowering and involuntary melancholy you are to be pitied rather than reproached Now my dear Bozzy let us have done with quarrels and with censure Let me know whether I have not sent you a pretty library There are perhaps many books among them which you never need read through but there are none which it is not proper for you to know and sometimes to consult Of these books of which the use is only occasional it is often sufficient to know the contents that when any question arises you may know where to look for information Since I wrote I have looked over mister Maclaurin s plea and think it excellent How is the suit carried on If by subscription I commission you to contribute in my name what is proper Let nothing be wanting in such a case doctor Drummond two hundred fifty four I see is superseded His father would have grieved but he lived to obtain the pleasure of his son s election and died before that pleasure was abated Langton s lady has brought him a girl and both are well I dined with him the other day It vexes me to tell you that on the evening of the twenty ninth of May I was seized by the gout and am not quite well The pain has not been violent but the weakness and tenderness were very troublesome and what is said to be very uncommon it has not alleviated my other disorders Make use of youth and health while you have them make my compliments to missus Boswell I am my dear Sir Your most affectionate SAM JOHNSON July six two hundred fifty five seventeen seventy six mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh July eighteen seventeen seventy six MY DEAR SIR Your letter of the second of this month was rather a harsh medicine but I was delighted with that spontaneous tenderness which a few days afterwards sent forth such balsam as your next brought me I found myself for some time so ill that all I could do was to preserve a decent appearance while all within was weakness and distress Like a reduced garrison that has some spirit left I hung out flags and planted all the force I could muster upon the walls I am now much better and I sincerely thank you for your kind attention and friendly counsel Count Manucci two hundred fifty six came here last week from travelling in Ireland I have shewn him what civilities I could on his own account on yours and on that of mister and missus Thrale He has had a fall from his horse and been much hurt I regret this unlucky accident for he seems to be a very amiable man As the evidence of what I have mentioned at the beginning of this year I select from his private register the following passage July twenty five seventeen seventy six O GOD who hast ordained that whatever is to be desired should be sought by labour and who by thy blessing bringest honest labour to good effect look with mercy upon my studies and endeavours Grant me O LORD to design only what is lawful and right and afford me calmness of mind and steadiness of purpose that I may so do thy will in this short life as to obtain happiness in the world to come for the sake of JESUS CHRIST our Lord Amen two hundred fifty seven It appears from a note subjoined that this was composed when he purposed to apply vigorously to study particularly of the Greek and Italian tongues Such a purpose so expressed at the age of sixty seven is admirable and encouraging and it must impress all the thinking part of my readers with a consolatory confidence in habitual devotion when they see a man of such enlarged intellectual powers as Johnson thus in the genuine earnestness of secrecy imploring the aid of that Supreme Being from whom cometh down every good and every perfect gift two hundred fifty eight TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS SIR A young man whose name is Paterson offers himself this evening to the Academy He is the son of a man two hundred fifty nine for whom I have long had a kindness and who is now abroad in distress I shall be glad that you will be pleased to shew him any little countenance or pay him any small distinction How much it is in your power to favour or to forward a young man I do not know nor do I know how much this candidate deserves favour by his personal merit or what hopes his proficiency may now give of future eminence I recommend him as the son of my friend Your character and station enable you to give a young man great encouragement by very easy means You have heard of a man who asked no other favour of Sir Robert Walpole than that he would bow to him at his levee I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Aug three seventeen seventy six mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh August thirty seventeen seventy six After giving him an account of my having examined the chests of books which he had sent to me and which contained what may be truely called a numerous and miscellaneous Stall Library thrown together at random Lord Hailes was against the decree in the case of my client the minister two hundred sixty not that he justified the minister but because the parishioner both provoked and retorted I sent his Lordship your able argument upon the case for his perusal His observation upon it in a letter to me was doctor Johnson s Suasorium is pleasantly two hundred sixty one and artfully composed I suspect however that he has not convinced himself for I believe that he is better read in ecclesiastical history than to imagine that a Bishop or a Presbyter has a right to begin censure or discipline e cathedra two hundred sixty two For the honour of Count Manucci as well as to observe that exactness of truth which you have taught me I must correct what I said in a former letter He did not fall from his horse which might have been an imputation on his skill as an officer of cavalry his horse fell with him I have since I saw you read every word of Granger s Biographical History It has entertained me exceedingly and I do not think him the Whig that you supposed two hundred sixty three Horace Walpole s being his patron two hundred sixty four is indeed no good sign of his political principles But he denied to Lord Mountstuart that he was a Whig and said he had been accused by both parties of partiality It seems he was like Pope While Tories call me Whig and Whigs a Tory two hundred sixty five I wish you would look more into his book and as Lord Mountstuart wishes much to find a proper person to continue the work upon Granger s plan and has desired I would mention it to you if such a man occurs please to let me know His Lordship will give him generous encouragement TO mister ROBERT LEVETT DEAR SIR Having spent about six weeks at this place we have at length resolved upon returning I expect to see you all in Fleet street on the thirtieth of this month I did not go into the sea till last Friday two hundred sixty six but think to go most of this week though I know not that it does me any good My nights are very restless and tiresome but I am otherwise well I have written word of my coming to missus Williams Remember me kindly to Francis and Betsy I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON two hundred sixty seven Brighthelmstone two hundred sixty eight Oct twenty one seventeen seventy six I again wrote to doctor Johnson on the twenty first of October informing him that my father had in the most liberal manner paid a large debt for me two hundred sixty nine and that I had now the happiness of being upon very good terms with him to which he returned the following answer To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I had great pleasure in hearing that you are at last on good terms with your father two hundred seventy Cultivate his kindness by all honest and manly means Life is but short no time can be afforded but for the indulgence of real sorrow or contests upon questions seriously momentous Let us not throw away any of our days upon useless resentment or contend who shall hold out longest in stubborn malignity It is best not to be angry and best in the next place to be quickly reconciled May you and your father pass the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence Do you ever hear from mister Langton I visit him sometimes but he does not talk I do not like his scheme of life two hundred seventy one but as I am not permitted to understand it I cannot set any thing right that is wrong His children are sweet babies I hope my irreconcileable enemy missus Boswell is well Desire her not to transmit her malevolence to the young people Let me have Alexander and Veronica and Euphemia for my friends missus Williams whom you may reckon as one of your well wishers is in a feeble and languishing state with little hope of growing better She went for some part of the autumn into the country but is little benefited and doctor Lawrence confesses that his art is at an end Death is however at a distance and what more than that can we say of ourselves I am sorry for her pain and more sorry for her decay mister Levett is sound wind and limb I was some weeks this autumn at Brighthelmstone The place was very dull and I was not well the expedition to the Hebrides was the most pleasant journey that I ever made two hundred seventy two Such an effort annually would give the world a little diversification Every year however we cannot wander and must therefore endeavour to spend our time at home as well as we can I believe it is best to throw life into a method that every hour may bring its employment and every employment have its hour Xenophon observes in his Treatise of Oeconomy two hundred seventy three that if every thing be kept in a certain place when any thing is worn out or consumed the vacuity which it leaves will shew what is wanting so if every part of time has its duty the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagement I have not practised all this prudence myself but I have suffered much for want of it and I would have you by timely recollection and steady resolution escape from those evils which have lain heavy upon me two hundred seventy four I am my dearest Boswell Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Bolt court Nov sixteen seventeen seventy six On the sixteenth of November I informed him that mister Strahan had sent me twelve copies of the Journey to the Western Islands handsomely bound instead of the twenty copies which were stipulated two hundred seventy five but which I supposed were to be only in sheets requested to know how they should be distributed and mentioned that I had another son born to me who was named David and was a sickly infant To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have been for some time ill of a cold which perhaps I made an excuse to myself for not writing when in reality I knew not what to say The books you must at last distribute as you think best in my name or your own as you are inclined or as you judge most proper Every body cannot be obliged but I wish that nobody may be offended Do the best you can I congratulate you on the increase of your family and hope that little David is by this time well and his mamma perfectly recovered I am much pleased to hear of the re establishment of kindness between you and your father Cultivate his paternal tenderness as much as you can To live at variance at all is uncomfortable and variance with a father is still more uncomfortable Besides that in the whole dispute you have the wrong side at least you gave the first provocations and some of them very offensive two hundred seventy six Let it now be all over As you have no reason to think that your new mother has shewn you any foul play treat her with respect and with some degree of confidence this will secure your father When once a discordant family has felt the pleasure of peace they will not willingly lose it If missus Boswell would but be friends with me we might now shut the temple of Janus What came of doctor Memis s cause two hundred seventy seven Is the question about the negro determined two hundred seventy eight Has Sir Allan any reasonable hopes two hundred seventy nine What is become of poor Macquarry two hundred eighty Let me know the event of all these litigations I wish particularly well to the negro and Sir Allan missus Williams has been much out of order and though she is something better is likely in her physician s opinion to endure her malady for life though she may perhaps die of some other missus Thrale is big and fancies that she carries a boy if it were very reasonable to wish much about it I should wish her not to be disappointed The desire of male heirs is not appendant only to feudal tenures A son is almost necessary to the continuance of Thrale s fortune for what can misses do with a brewhouse Lands are fitter for daughters than trades two hundred eighty one Baretti went away from Thrale s in some whimsical fit of disgust or ill nature without taking any leave two hundred eighty two It is well if he finds in any other place as good an habitation and as many conveniencies He has got five and twenty guineas by translating Sir Joshua s Discourses into Italian and mister Thrale gave him an hundred in the spring two hundred eighty three so that he is yet in no difficulties Colman has bought Foote s patent and is to allow Foote for life sixteen hundred pounds a year as Reynolds told me and to allow him to play so often on such terms that he may gain four hundred pounds more two hundred eighty four What Colman can get by this bargain but trouble and hazard I do not see I am dear Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Dec twenty one seventeen seventy six The Reverend doctor Hugh Blair who had long been admired as a preacher at Edinburgh thought now of diffusing his excellent sermons more extensively and encreasing his reputation by publishing a collection of them He transmitted the manuscript to mister Strahan the printer who after keeping it for some time wrote a letter to him discouraging the publication two hundred eighty five Such at first was the unpropitious state of one of the most successful theological books that has ever appeared mister Strahan however had sent one of the sermons to doctor Johnson for his opinion and after his unfavourable letter to doctor Blair had been sent off he received from Johnson on Christmas eve a note in which was the following paragraph I have read over doctor Blair s first sermon with more than approbation to say it is good is to say too little two hundred eighty six I believe mister Strahan had very soon after this time a conversation with doctor Johnson concerning them and then he very candidly wrote again to doctor Blair enclosing Johnson s note and agreeing to purchase the volume for which he and mister Cadell gave one hundred pounds The sale was so rapid and extensive and the approbation of the publick so high that to their honour be it recorded the proprietors made doctor Blair a present first of one sum and afterwards of another of fifty pounds thus voluntarily doubling the stipulated price and when he prepared another volume they gave him at once three hundred pounds being in all five hundred pounds by an agreement to which I am a subscribing witness and now for a third octavo volume he has received no less than six hundred pounds seventeen seventy seven AETAT sixty eight In seventeen seventy seven it appears from his Prayers and Meditations that Johnson suffered much from a state of mind unsettled and perplexed two hundred eighty seven and from that constitutional gloom which together with his extreme humility and anxiety with regard to his religious state made him contemplate himself through too dark and unfavourable a medium It may be said of him that he saw GOD in clouds two hundred eighty eight Certain we may be of his injustice to himself in the following lamentable paragraph which it is painful to think came from the contrite heart of this great man to whose labours the world is so much indebted When I survey my past life I discover nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body and disturbances of the mind very near to madness two hundred eighty nine which I hope He that made me will suffer to extenuate many faults and excuse many deficiencies two hundred ninety But we find his devotions in this year eminently fervent and we are comforted by observing intervals of quiet composure and gladness On Easter day we find the following emphatick prayer Almighty and most merciful Father who seest all our miseries and knowest all our necessities look down upon me and pity me Defend me from the violent incursion incursions of evil thoughts and enable me to form and keep such resolutions as may conduce to the discharge of the duties which thy providence shall appoint me and so help me by thy Holy Spirit that my heart may surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found and that I may serve thee with pure affection and a cheerful mind Have mercy upon me O GOD have mercy upon me years and infirmities oppress me terrour and anxiety beset me Have mercy upon me my Creator and my Judge In all dangers protect me In all perplexities relieve and free me and so help me by thy Holy Spirit that I may now so commemorate the death of thy Son our Saviour JESUS CHRIST as that when this short and painful life shall have an end I may for his sake be received to everlasting happiness Amen two hundred ninety one While he was at church the agreeable impressions upon his mind are thus commemorated I was for some time distressed but at last obtained I hope from the GOD of Peace more quiet than I have enjoyed for a long time I had made no resolution but as my heart grew lighter my hopes revived and my courage increased and I wrote with my pencil in my Common Prayer Book Vita ordinanda Biblia legenda Theologiae opera danda Serviendum et laetandum two hundred ninety two mister Steevens whose generosity is well known joined doctor Johnson in kind assistance to a female relation of doctor Goldsmith and desired that on her return to Ireland she would procure authentick particulars of the life of her celebrated relation two hundred ninety three Concerning her there is the following letter To GEORGE STEEVENS esquire DEAR SIR You will be glad to hear that from missus Goldsmith whom we lamented as drowned I have received a letter full of gratitude to us all with promise to make the enquiries which we recommended to her I would have had the honour of conveying this intelligence to Miss Caulfield but that her letter is not at hand and I know not the direction You will tell the good news I am Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON February twenty five seventeen seventy seven mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb fourteen seventeen seventy seven My Dear Sir My state of epistolary accounts with you at present is extraordinary The balance as to number is on your side I am indebted to you for two letters one dated the sixteenth of November upon which very day I wrote to you so that our letters were exactly exchanged and one dated the twenty first of December last My heart was warmed with gratitude by the truely kind contents of both of them and it is amazing and vexing that I have allowed so much time to elapse without writing to you But delay is inherent in me by nature or by bad habit I waited till I should have an opportunity of paying you my compliments on a new year I have procrastinated till the year is no longer new doctor Memis s cause was determined against him with Lforty costs The Lord President and two other of the Judges dissented from the majority upon this ground that although there may have been no intention to injure him by calling him Doctor of Medicine instead of Physician yet as he remonstrated against the designation before the charter was printed off and represented that it was disagreeable and even hurtful to him it was ill natured to refuse to alter it and let him have the designation to which he was certainly entitled My own opinion is that our court has judged wrong The defendants were in mala fide to persist in naming him in a way that he disliked You remember poor Goldsmith when he grew important and wished to appear Doctor Major two hundred ninety four could not bear your calling him Goldy two hundred ninety five Would it not have been wrong to have named him so in your Preface to Shakspeare or in any serious permanent writing of any sort The difficulty is whether an action should be allowed on such petty wrongs De minimis non curat lex The Negro cause is not yet decided A memorial is preparing on the side of slavery I shall send you a copy as soon as it is printed Maclaurin is made happy by your approbation of his memorial for the black Macquarry was here in the winter and we passed an evening together The sale of his estate cannot be prevented Sir Allan Maclean s suit against the Duke of Argyle for recovering the ancient inheritance of his family is now fairly before all our judges I spoke for him yesterday and Maclaurin to day Crosbie spoke to day against him Three more counsel are to be heard and next week the cause will be determined I send you the Informations or Cases on each side which I hope you will read You said to me when we were under Sir Allan s hospitable roof I will help him with my pen You said it with a generous glow and though his Grace of Argyle did afterwards mount you upon an excellent horse upon which you looked like a Bishop two hundred ninety six you must not swerve from your purpose at Inchkenneth I wish you may understand the points at issue amidst our Scotch law principles and phrases Here followed a full state of the case in which I endeavoured to make it as clear as I could to an Englishman who had no knowledge of the formularies and technical language of the law of Scotland I shall inform you how the cause is decided here But as it may be brought under the review of our Judges and is certainly to be carried by appeal to the House of Lords the assistance of such a mind as yours will be of consequence Your paper on Vicious Intromission two hundred ninety seven is a noble proof of what you can do even in Scotch law I have not yet distributed all your books Lord Hailes and Lord Monboddo have each received one and return you thanks Monboddo dined with me lately and having drank tea we were a good while by ourselves and as I knew that he had read the Journey superficially as he did not talk of it as I wished I brought it to him and read aloud several passages and then he talked so that I told him he was to have a copy from the authour He begged that might be marked on it I ever am my dear Sir Your most faithful And affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL SIR ALEXANDER DICK TO doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Prestonfield Feb seventeen seventeen seventy seven Sir I had yesterday the honour of receiving your book of your Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland which you was so good as to send me by the hands of our mutual friend two hundred ninety eight mister Boswell of Auchinleck for which I return you my most hearty thanks and after carefully reading it over again shall deposit in my little collection of choice books next our worthy friend s Journey to Corsica As there are many things to admire in both performances I have often wished that no Travels or Journeys should be published but those undertaken by persons of integrity and capacity to judge well and describe faithfully and in good language the situation condition and manners of the countries past through Indeed our country of Scotland in spite of the union of the crowns is still in most places so devoid of clothing or cover from hedges and plantations that it was well you gave your readers a sound Monitoire with respect to that circumstance The truths you have told and the purity of the language in which they are expressed as your Journey is universally read may and already appear to have a very good effect For a man of my acquaintance who has the largest nursery for trees and hedges in this country tells me that of late the demand upon him for these articles is doubled and sometimes tripled I have therefore listed doctor Samuel Johnson in some of my memorandums of the principal planters and favourers of the enclosures under a name which I took the liberty to invent from the Greek Papadendrion two hundred ninety nine Lord Auchinleck and some few more are of the list I am told that one gentleman in the shire of Aberdeen viz Sir Archibald Grant has planted above fifty millions of trees on a piece of very wild ground at Monimusk I must enquire if he has fenced them well before he enters my list for that is the soul of enclosing I began myself to plant a little our ground being too valuable for much and that is now fifty years ago and the trees now in my seventy fourth year I look up to with reverence and shew them to my eldest son now in his fifteenth year and they are full the height of my country house here where I had the pleasure of receiving you and hope again to have that satisfaction with our mutual friend mister Boswell I shall always continue with the truest esteem dear Doctor Your much obliged And obedient humble servant ALEXANDER DICK three hundred To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR It is so long since I heard any thing from you three hundred one that I am not easy about it write something to me next post When you sent your last letter every thing seemed to be mending I hope nothing has lately grown worse I suppose young Alexander continues to thrive and Veronica is now very pretty company I do not suppose the lady is yet reconciled to me yet let her know that I love her very well and value her very much doctor Blair is printing some sermons If they are all like the first which I have read they are sermones aurei ac auro magis aurei It is excellently written both as to doctrine and language mister Watson s book three hundred two seems to be much esteemed Poor Beauclerk still continues very ill three hundred three Langton lives on as he used to do three hundred four His children are very pretty and I think his lady loses her Scotch Paoli I never see I have been so distressed by difficulty of breathing that I lost as was computed six and thirty ounces of blood in a few days three hundred five I am better but not well I wish you would be vigilant and get me Graham s Telemachus three hundred six that was printed at Glasgow a very little book and Johnstoni Poemata three hundred seven another little book printed at Middleburgh missus Williams sends her compliments and promises that when you come hither she will accommodate you as well as ever she can in the old room three hundred eight She wishes to know whether you sent her book three hundred nine to Sir Alexander Gordon three hundred ten My dear Boswell do not neglect to write to me for your kindness is one of the pleasures of my life which I should be sorry to lose I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON February eighteen seventeen seventy seven To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb twenty four seventeen seventy seven DEAR SIR Your letter dated the eighteenth instant I had the pleasure to receive last post Although my late long neglect or rather delay was truely culpable I am tempted not to regret it since it has produced me so valuable a proof of your regard I did indeed during that inexcusable silence sometimes divert the reproaches of my own mind by fancying that I should hear again from you inquiring with some anxiety about me because for aught you knew I might have been ill You are pleased to shew me that my kindness is of some consequence to you My heart is elated at the thought Be assured my dear Sir that my affection and reverence for you are exalted and steady I do not believe that a more perfect attachment ever existed in the history of mankind And it is a noble attachment for the attractions are Genius Learning and Piety Your difficulty of breathing alarms me and brings into my imagination an event which although in the natural course of things I must expect at some period I cannot view with composure My wife is much honoured by what you say of her She begs you may accept of her best compliments She is to send you some marmalade of oranges of her own making I ever am my dear Sir Your most obliged And faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have been much pleased with your late letter and am glad that my old enemy missus Boswell begins to feel some remorse As to Miss Veronica s Scotch I think it cannot be helped An English maid you might easily have but she would still imitate the greater number as they would be likewise those whom she must most respect Her dialect will not be gross Her Mamma has not much Scotch and you have yourself very little I hope she knows my name and does not call me Johnston three hundred eleven The immediate cause of my writing is this One Shaw three hundred twelve who seems a modest and a decent man has written an Erse Grammar which a very learned Highlander Macbean three hundred thirteen has at my request examined and approved The book is very little but mister Shaw has been persuaded by his friends to set it at half a guinea though I advised only a crown and thought myself liberal You whom the authour considers as a great encourager of ingenious men will receive a parcel of his proposals and receipts I have undertaken to give you notice of them and to solicit your countenance You must ask no poor man because the price is really too high Yet such a work deserves patronage It is proposed to augment our club from twenty to thirty of which I am glad for as we have several in it whom I do not much like to consort with three hundred fourteen I am for reducing it to a mere miscellaneous collection of conspicuous men without any determinate character I am dear Sir Most affectionately your s SAM JOHNSON March eleven seventeen seventy seven My respects to Madam to Veronica to Alexander to Euphemia to David mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh April four seventeen seventy seven After informing him of the death of my little son David and that I could not come to London this spring I think it hard that I should be a whole year without seeing you May I presume to petition for a meeting with you in the autumn You have I believe seen all the cathedrals in England except that of Carlisle If you are to be with doctor Taylor at Ashbourne it would not be a great journey to come thither We may pass a few most agreeable days there by ourselves and I will accompany you a good part of the way to the southward again Pray think of this You forget that mister Shaw s Erse Grammar was put into your hands by myself last year Lord Eglintoune put it into mine I am glad that mister Macbean approves of it I have received mister Shaw s Proposals for its publication which I can perceive are written by the hand of a MASTER Pray get for me all the editions of Walton s Lives I have a notion that the republication of them with Notes will fall upon me between doctor Home and Lord Hailes three hundred fifteen mister Shaw s Proposals dagger for An Analysis of the Scotch Celtick Language were thus illuminated by the pen of Johnson Though the Erse dialect of the Celtick language has from the earliest times been spoken in Britain and still subsists in the northern parts and adjacent islands yet by the negligence of a people rather warlike than lettered it has hitherto been left to the caprice and judgement of every speaker and has floated in the living voice without the steadiness of analogy or direction of rules An Erse Grammar is an addition to the stores of literature and its authour hopes for the indulgence always shewn to those that attempt to do what was never done before If his work shall be found defective it is at least all his own he is not like other grammarians a compiler or transcriber what he delivers he has learned by attentive observation among his countrymen who perhaps will be themselves surprized to see that speech reduced to principles which they have used only by imitation The use of this book will however not be confined to the mountains and islands it will afford a pleasing and important subject of speculation to those whose studies lead them to trace the affinity of languages and the migrations of the ancient races of mankind To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Glasgow April twenty four seventeen seventy seven MY DEAR SIR Our worthy friend Thrale s death having appeared in the newspapers and been afterwards contradicted I have been placed in a state of very uneasy uncertainty from which I hoped to be relieved by you but my hopes have as yet been vain How could you omit to write to me on such an occasion I shall wait with anxiety I am going to Auchinleck to stay a fortnight with my father It is better not to be there very long at one time But frequent renewals of attention are agreeable to him Pray tell me about this edition of The English Poets with a Preface biographical and critical to each Authour by Samuel Johnson LL D which I see advertised I am delighted with the prospect of it Indeed I am happy to feel that I am capable of being so much delighted with literature three hundred sixteen But is not the charm of this publication chiefly owing to the magnum nomen in the front of it What do you say of Lord Chesterfield s Memoirs and last Letters three hundred seventeen My wife has made marmalade of oranges for you I left her and my daughters and Alexander all well yesterday I have taught Veronica to speak of you thus doctor John son not Jon ston I remain my dear Sir Your most affectionate And obliged humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR The story of mister Thrale s death as he had neither been sick nor in any other danger made so little impression upon me that I never thought about obviating its effects on any body else It is supposed to have been produced by the English custom of making April fools that is of sending one another on some foolish errand on the first of April Tell missus Boswell that I shall taste her marmalade cautiously at first Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes three hundred eighteen Beware says the Italian proverb of a reconciled enemy But when I find it does me no harm I shall then receive it and be thankful for it as a pledge of firm and I hope of unalterable kindness She is after all a dear dear lady Please to return doctor Blair thanks for his sermons The Scotch write English wonderfully well Your frequent visits to Auchinleck and your short stay there are very laudable and very judicious Your present concord with your father gives me great pleasure it was all that you seemed to want My health is very bad and my nights are very unquiet three hundred nineteen What can I do to mend them I have for this summer nothing better in prospect than a journey into Staffordshire and Derbyshire perhaps with Oxford and Birmingham in my way Make my compliments to Miss Veronica I must leave it to her philosophy to comfort you for the loss of little David You must remember that to keep three out of four is more than your share missus Thrale has but four out of eleven three hundred twenty I am engaged to write little Lives and little Prefaces to a little edition of The English Poets I think I have persuaded the book sellers to insert something of Thomson and if you could give me some information about him for the life which we have is very scanty I should be glad I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON May three seventeen seventy seven To those who delight in tracing the progress of works of literature it will be an entertainment to compare the limited design with the ample execution of that admirable performance The Lives of the English Poets which is the richest most beautiful and indeed most perfect production of Johnson s pen His notion of it at this time appears in the preceding letter He has a memorandum in this year twenty nine May three hundred twenty one Easter Eve I treated with booksellers on a bargain but the time was not long three hundred twenty two The bargain was concerning that undertaking but his tender conscience seems alarmed lest it should have intruded too much on his devout preparation for the solemnity of the ensuing day But indeed very little time was necessary for Johnson s concluding a treaty with the booksellers as he had I believe less attention to profit from his labours than any man to whom literature has been a profession three hundred twenty three I shall here insert from a letter to me from my late worthy friend mister Edward Dilly though of a later date an account of this plan so happily conceived since it was the occasion of procuring for us an elegant collection of the best biography and criticism of which our language can boast TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire Southill Sept twenty six seventeen seventy seven DEAR SIR You will find by this letter that I am still in the same calm retreat from the noise and bustle of London as when I wrote to you last I am happy to find you had such an agreeable meeting with your old friend doctor Johnson I have no doubt your stock is much increased by the interview few men nay I may say scarcely any man has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as doctor Johnson in conversation When he opens freely every one is attentive to what he says and cannot fail of improvement as well as pleasure The edition of The Poets now printing will do honour to the English press and a concise account of the life of each authour by doctor Johnson will be a very valuable addition and stamp the reputation of this edition superiour to any thing that is gone before The first cause that gave rise to this undertaking I believe was owing to the little trifling edition of The Poets printing by the Martins at Edinburgh and to be sold by Bell in London Upon examining the volumes which were printed the type was found so extremely small that many persons could not read them not only this inconvenience attended it but the inaccuracy of the press was very conspicuous These reasons as well as the idea of an invasion of what we call our Literary Property three hundred twenty four induced the London Booksellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the English Poets of reputation from Chaucer to the present time Accordingly a select number of the most respectable booksellers met on the occasion and on consulting together agreed that all the proprietors of copy right in the various Poets should be summoned together and when their opinions were given to proceed immediately on the business Accordingly a meeting was held consisting of about forty of the most respectable booksellers of London when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of The English Poets should be immediately printed with a concise account of the life of each authour by doctor Samuel Johnson and that three persons should be deputed to wait upon doctor Johnson to solicit him to undertake the Lives viz T Davies Strahan and Cadell The Doctor very politely undertook it and seemed exceedingly pleased with the proposal As to the terms it was left entirely to the Doctor to name his own he mentioned two hundred guineas three hundred twenty five it was immediately agreed to and a farther compliment I believe will be made him three hundred twenty six A committee was likewise appointed to engage the best engravers viz Bartolozzi Sherwin Hall et cetera Likewise another committee for giving directions about the paper printing et cetera so that the whole will be conducted with spirit and in the best manner with respect to authourship editorship engravings et cetera et cetera My brother will give you a list of the Poets we mean to give many of which are within the time of the Act of Queen Anne three hundred twenty seven which Martin and Bell cannot give as they have no property in them the proprietors are almost all the booksellers in London of consequence I am dear Sir Ever your s EDWARD DILLY I shall afterwards have occasion to consider the extensive and varied range which Johnson took when he was once led upon ground which he trod with a peculiar delight having long been intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of it that could interest and please doctor JOHNSON TO CHARLES O CONNOR esquire three hundred twenty eight SIR Having had the pleasure of conversing with doctor Campbell about your character and your literary undertaking I am resolved to gratify myself by renewing a correspondence which began and ended a great while ago and ended I am afraid by my fault a fault which if you have not forgotten it you must now forgive If I have ever disappointed you give me leave to tell you that you have likewise disappointed me I expected great discoveries in Irish antiquity and large publications in the Irish language but the world still remains at it was doubtful and ignorant What the Irish language is in itself and to what languages it has affinity are very interesting questions which every man wishes to see resolved that has any philological or historical curiosity doctor Leland begins his history too late the ages which deserve an exact enquiry are those times for three hundred twenty nine such there were when Ireland was the school of the west the quiet habitation of sanctity and literature If you could give a history though imperfect of the Irish nation from its conversion to Christianity to the invasion from England you would amplify knowledge with new views and new objects Set about it therefore if you can do what you can easily do without anxious exactness Lay the foundation and leave the superstructure to posterity I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May nineteen seventeen seventy seven Early in this year came out in two volumes quarto the posthumous works of the learned doctor Zachary Pearce Bishop of Rochester being A Commentary with Notes on the four Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles with other theological pieces Johnson had now an opportunity of making a grateful return to that excellent prelate who we have seen three hundred thirty was the only person who gave him any assistance in the compilation of his Dictionary The Bishop had left some account of his life and character written by himself To this Johnson made some valuable additions three hundred thirty one dagger and also furnished to the editor the Reverend mister Derby a Dedication dagger which I shall here insert both because it will appear at this time with peculiar propriety and because it will tend to propagate and increase that fervour of Loyalty three hundred thirty two which in me who boast of the name of TORY is not only a principle but a passion To THE KING SIR I presume to lay before your Majesty the last labours of a learned Bishop who died in the toils and duties of his calling three hundred thirty three He is now beyond the reach of all earthly honours and rewards and only the hope of inciting others to imitate him makes it now fit to be remembered that he enjoyed in his life the favour of your Majesty The tumultuary life of Princes seldom permits them to survey the wide extent of national interest without losing sight of private merit to exhibit qualities which may be imitated by the highest and the humblest of mankind and to be at once amiable and great Such characters if now and then they appear in history are contemplated with admiration May it be the ambition of all your subjects to make haste with their tribute of reverence and as posterity may learn from your Majesty how Kings should live may they learn likewise from your people how they should be honoured I am May it please your Majesty With the most profound respect Your Majesty s Most dutiful and devoted Subject and Servant In the summer he wrote a Prologue which was spoken before A Word to the Wise a comedy by mister Hugh Kelly three hundred thirty four which had been brought upon the stage in seventeen seventy but he being a writer for ministry in one of the news papers it fell a sacrifice to popular fury and in the playhouse phrase was damned By the generosity of mister Harris the proprietor of Covent Garden theatre it was now exhibited for one night for the benefit of the authour s widow and children To conciliate the favour of the audience was the intention of Johnson s Prologue which as it is not long I shall here insert as a proof that his poetical talents were in no degree impaired This night presents a play which publick rage Or right or wrong once hooted from the stage From zeal or malice now no more we dread For English vengeance wars not with the dead A generous foe regards with pitying eye The man whom Fate has laid where all must lie To wit reviving from its authour s dust Be kind ye judges or at least be just Let no renewed hostilities invade Th oblivious grave s inviolable shade Let one great payment every claim appease And him who cannot hurt allow to please To please by scenes unconscious of offence By harmless merriment or useful sense Where aught of bright or fair the piece displays Approve it only tis too late to praise If want of skill or want of care appear Forbear to hiss the poet cannot hear By all like him must praise and blame be found At last a fleeting gleam or empty sound Yet then shall calm reflection bless the night When liberal pity dignified delight When pleasure fir d her torch at virtue s flame And mirth was bounty with an humbler name three hundred thirty five A circumstance which could not fail to be very pleasing to Johnson occurred this year The Tragedy of Sir Thomas Overbury written by his early companion in London Richard Savage three hundred thirty six was brought out with alterations at Drury lane theatre three hundred thirty seven The Prologue to it was written by mister Richard Brinsley Sheridan in which after describing very pathetically the wretchedness of Ill fated Savage at whose birth was giv n No parent but the Muse no friend but Heav n he introduced an elegant compliment to Johnson on his Dictionary that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly praised of which mister Harris in his Philological Inquiries three hundred thirty eight justly and liberally observes Such is its merit that our language does not possess a more copious learned and valuable work The concluding lines of this Prologue were these So pleads the tale that gives to future times The son s misfortunes and the parent s crimes There shall his fame if own d to night survive Fix d by THE HAND THAT BIDS OUR LANGUAGE LIVE three hundred thirty nine mister Sheridan here at once did honour to his taste and to his liberality of sentiment by shewing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and doctor Johnson I have already mentioned that Johnson was very desirous of reconciliation with old mister Sheridan three hundred forty It will therefore not seem at all surprizing that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his son While it had as yet been displayed only in the drama Johnson proposed him as a member of THE LITERARY CLUB observing that He who has written the two best comedies of his age is surely a considerable man three hundred forty one And he had accordingly the honour to be elected for an honour it undoubtedly must be allowed to be when it is considered of whom that society consists and that a single black ball excludes a candidate mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON July nine seventeen seventy seven three hundred forty two MY DEAR SIR For the health of my wife and children I have taken the little country house at which you visited my uncle doctor Boswell three hundred forty three who having lost his wife is gone to live with his son We took possession of our villa about a week ago we have a garden of three quarters of an acre well stocked with fruit trees and flowers and gooseberries and currants and peas and beans and cabbages c c and my children are quite happy I now write to you in a little study from the window of which I see around me a verdant grove and beyond it the lofty mountain called Arthur s Seat Your last letter in which you desire me to send you some additional information concerning Thomson reached me very fortunately just as I was going to Lanark to put my wife s two nephews the young Campbells to school there under the care of mister Thomson the master of it whose wife is sister to the authour of The Seasons She is an old woman but her memory is very good and she will with pleasure give me for you every particular that you wish to know and she can tell Pray then take the trouble to send me such questions as may lead to biographical materials You say that the Life which we have of Thomson is scanty Since I received your letter I have read his Life published under the name of Cibber but as you told me really written by a mister Shiels three hundred forty four that written by doctor Murdoch one prefixed to an edition of the Seasons published at Edinburgh which is compounded of both with the addition of an anecdote of Quin s relieving Thomson from prison three hundred forty five the abridgement of Murdoch s account of him in the Biographia Britannica and another abridgement of it in the Biographical Dictionary enriched with doctor Joseph Warton s critical panegyrick on the Seasons in his Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope from all these it appears to me that we have a pretty full account of this poet However you will I doubt not shew me many blanks and I shall do what can be done to have them filled up As Thomson never returned to Scotland which you will think very wise his sister can speak from her own knowledge only as to the early part of his life She has some letters from him which may probably give light as to his more advanced progress if she will let us see them which I suppose she will three hundred forty six I believe George Lewis Scott three hundred forty seven and doctor Armstrong three hundred forty eight are now his only surviving companions while he lived in and about London and they I dare say can tell more of him than is yet known My own notion is that Thomson was a much coarser man than his friends are willing to acknowledge three hundred forty nine His Seasons are indeed full of elegant and pious sentiments but a rank soil nay a dunghill will produce beautiful flowers three hundred fifty Your edition of The English Poets three hundred fifty one will be very valuable on account of the Prefaces and Lives But I have seen a specimen of an edition of The Poets at the Apollo press at Edinburgh which for excellence in printing and engraving highly deserves a liberal encouragement Most sincerely do I regret the bad health and bad rest with which you have been afflicted and I hope you are better I cannot believe that the Prologue which you generously gave to mister Kelly s widow and children the other day is the effusion of one in sickness and in disquietude but external circumstances are never sure indications of the state of man I send you a letter which I wrote to you two years ago at Wilton three hundred fifty two and did not send it at the time for fear of being reproved as indulging too much tenderness and one written to you at the tomb of Melancthon three hundred fifty three which I kept back lest I should appear at once too superstitious and too enthusiastick I now imagine that perhaps they may please you You do not take the least notice of my proposal for our meeting at Carlisle three hundred fifty four Though I have meritoriously refrained from visiting London this year I ask you if it would not be wrong that I should be two years without having the benefit of your conversation when if you come down as far as Derbyshire we may meet at the expence of a few days journeying and not many pounds I wish you to see Carlisle which made me mention that place But if you have not a desire to complete your tour of the English cathedrals I will take a larger share of the road between this place and Ashbourne So tell me where you will fix for our passing a few days by ourselves Now don t cry foolish fellow or idle dog Chain your humour and let your kindness play You will rejoice to hear that Miss Macleod of Rasay three hundred fifty five is married to Colonel Mure Campbell an excellent man with a pretty good estate of his own and the prospect of having the Earl of Loudoun s fortune and honours Is not this a noble lot for our fair Hebridean How happy am I that she is to be in Ayrshire We shall have the Laird of Rasay and old Malcolm and I know not how many gallant Macleods and bagpipes c c at Auchinleck Perhaps you may meet them all there Without doubt you have read what is called The Life of David Hume three hundred fifty six written by himself with the letter from doctor Adam Smith subjoined to it Is not this an age of daring effrontery My friend mister Anderson Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow at whose house you and I supped three hundred fifty seven and to whose care mister Windham three hundred fifty eight of Norfolk was entrusted at that University paid me a visit lately and after we had talked with indignation and contempt of the poisonous productions with which this age is infested he said there was now an excellent opportunity for doctor Johnson to step forth I agreed with him that you might knock Hume s and Smith s heads together and make vain and ostentatious infidelity exceedingly ridiculous Would it not be worth your while to crush such noxious weeds in the moral garden You have said nothing to me of doctor Dodd three hundred fifty nine I know not how you think on that subject though the newspapers give us a saying of your s in favour of mercy to him But I own I am very desirous that the royal prerogative of remission of punishment should be employed to exhibit an illustrious instance of the regard which GOD s VICEGERENT will ever shew to piety and virtue If for ten righteous men the ALMIGHTY would have spared Sodom shall not a thousand acts of goodness done by doctor Dodd counterbalance one crime Such an instance would do more to encourage goodness than his execution would do to deter from vice I am not afraid of any bad consequence to society for who will persevere for a long course of years in a distinguished discharge of religious duties with a view to commit a forgery with impunity Pray make my best compliments acceptable to mister and missus Thrale by assuring them of my hearty joy that the Master three hundred sixty as you call him is alive I hope I shall often taste his Champagne soberly I have not heard from Langton for a long time I suppose he is as usual Studious the busy moments to deceive three hundred sixty one I remain my dear Sir Your most affectionate and faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL On the twenty third of June I again wrote to doctor Johnson enclosing a ship master s receipt for a jar of orange marmalade and a large packet of Lord Hailes s Annals of Scotland To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have just received your packet from mister Thrale s but have not day light enough to look much into it I am glad that I have credit enough with Lord Hailes to be trusted with more copy three hundred sixty two I hope to take more care of it than of the last I return missus Boswell my affectionate thanks for her present which I value as a token of reconciliation Poor Dodd was put to death yesterday in opposition to the recommendation of the jury three hundred sixty three the petition of the city of London three hundred sixty four and a subsequent petition signed by three and twenty thousand hands Surely the voice of the publick when it calls so loudly and calls only for mercy ought to be heard three hundred sixty five The saying that was given me in the papers I never spoke but I wrote many of his petitions and some of his letters He applied to me very often He was I am afraid long flattered with hopes of life but I had no part in the dreadful delusion for as soon as the King had signed his sentence three hundred sixty six I obtained from mister Chamier three hundred sixty seven an account of the disposition of the court towards him with a declaration that there was no hope even of a respite This letter immediately was laid before Dodd but he believed those whom he wished to be right as it is thought till within three days of his end He died with pious composure and resolution I have just seen the Ordinary that attended him His address to his fellow convicts offended the Methodists three hundred sixty eight but he had a Moravian with him much of his time three hundred sixty nine His moral character is very bad I hope all is not true that is charged upon him Of his behaviour in prison an account will be published I give you joy of your country house and your pretty garden and hope some time to see you in your felicity I was much pleased with your two letters that had been kept so long in store three hundred seventy and rejoice at Miss Rasay s advancement and wish Sir Allan success I hope to meet you somewhere towards the north but am loath to come quite to Carlisle Can we not meet at Manchester But we will settle it in some other letters mister Seward three hundred seventy one a great favourite at Streatham has been I think enkindled by our travels with a curiosity to see the Highlands I have given him letters to you and Beattie He desires that a lodging may be taken for him at Edinburgh against his arrival He is just setting out Langton has been exercising the militia three hundred seventy two missus Williams is I fear declining doctor Lawrence says he can do no more She is gone to summer in the country with as many conveniences about her as she can expect but I have no great hope We must all die may we all be prepared I suppose Miss Boswell reads her book and young Alexander takes to his learning Let me hear about them for every thing that belongs to you belongs in a more remote degree and not I hope very remote to dear Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON June twenty eight seventeen seventy seven TO THE SAME DEAR SIR This gentleman is a great favourite at Streatham and therefore you will easily believe that he has very valuable qualities Our narrative has kindled him with a desire of visiting the Highlands after having already seen a great part of Europe You must receive him as a friend and when you have directed him to the curiosities of Edinburgh give him instructions and recommendations for the rest of his journey I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON June twenty four seventeen seventy seven Johnson s benevolence to the unfortunate was I am confident as steady and active as that of any of those who have been most eminently distinguished for that virtue Innumerable proofs of it I have no doubt will be for ever concealed from mortal eyes We may however form some judgement of it from the many and very various instances which have been discovered One which happened in the course of this summer is remarkable from the name and connection of the person who was the object of it The circumstance to which I allude is ascertained by two letters one to mister Langton and another to the Reverend doctor Vyse rector of Lambeth son of the respectable clergyman at Lichfield who was contemporary with Johnson and in whose father s family Johnson had the happiness of being kindly received in his early years doctor JOHNSON TO BENNET LANGTON esquire DEAR SIR I have lately been much disordered by a difficulty of breathing but am now better I hope your house is well You know we have been talking lately of saint Cross at Winchester I have an old acquaintance whose distress makes him very desirous of an hospital and I am afraid I have not strength enough to get him into the Chartreux He is a painter who never rose higher than to get his immediate living and from that at eighty three he is disabled by a slight stroke of the palsy such as does not make him at all helpless on common occasions though his hand is not steady enough for his art My request is that you will try to obtain a promise of the next vacancy from the Bishop of Chester It is not a great thing to ask and I hope we shall obtain it doctor Warton has promised to favour him with his notice and I hope he may end his days in peace I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON June twenty nine seventeen seventy seven To THE REVEREND doctor VYSE AT LAMBETH SIR I doubt not but you will readily forgive me for taking the liberty of requesting your assistance in recommending an old friend to his Grace the Archbishop as Governour of the Charter house His name is De Groot he was born at Gloucester I have known him many years He has all the common claims to charity being old poor and infirm in a great degree He has likewise another claim to which no scholar can refuse attention he is by several descents the nephew of Hugo Grotius of him from whom perhaps every man of learning has learnt something Let it not be said that in any lettered country a nephew of Grotius asked a charity and was refused three hundred seventy three I am reverend Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON July nine seventeen seventy seven REVEREND doctor VYSE TO mister BOSWELL Lambeth June nine seventeen eighty seven SIR I have searched in vain for the letter which I spoke of and which I wished at your desire to communicate to you It was from doctor Johnson to return me thanks for my application to Archbishop Cornwallis in favour of poor De Groot He rejoices at the success it met with and is lavish in the praise he bestows upon his favourite Hugo Grotius I am really sorry that I cannot find this letter as it is worthy of the writer That which I send you enclosed three hundred seventy four is at your service It is very short and will not perhaps be thought of any consequence unless you should judge proper to consider it as a proof of the very humane part which doctor Johnson took in behalf of a distressed and deserving person I am Sir Your most obedient humble servant W VYSE doctor JOHNSON TO mister EDWARD DILLY three hundred seventy five SIR To the collection of English Poets I have recommended the volume of doctor Watts to be added his name has long been held by me in veneration three hundred seventy six and I would not willingly be reduced to tell of him only that he was born and died Yet of his life I know very little and therefore must pass him in a manner very unworthy of his character unless some of his friends will favour me with the necessary information many of them must be known to you and by your influence perhaps I may obtain some instruction My plan does not exact much but I wish to distinguish Watts a man who never wrote but for a good purpose Be pleased to do for me what you can I am Sir your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Bolt Court Fleet street July seven seventeen seventy seven To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh July fifteen seventeen seventy seven MY DEAR SIR The fate of poor doctor Dodd made a dismal impression upon my mind I had sagacity enough to divine that you wrote his speech to the Recorder before sentence was pronounced I am glad you have written so much for him and I hope to be favoured with an exact list of the several pieces when we meet I received mister Seward as the friend of mister and missus Thrale and as a gentleman recommended by doctor Johnson to my attention I have introduced him to Lord Kames Lord Monboddo and mister Nairne He is gone to the Highlands with doctor Gregory when he returns I shall do more for him Sir Allan Maclean has three hundred seventy seven carried that branch of his cause of which we had good hopes the President and one other Judge only were against him I wish the House of Lords may do as well as the Court of Session has done But Sir Allan has not the lands of Brolos quite cleared by this judgement till a long account is made up of debts and interests on the one side and rents on the other I am however not much afraid of the balance Macquarry s estates three hundred seventy eight Staffa and all were sold yesterday and bought by a Campbell I fear he will have little or nothing left out of the purchase money I send you the case against the negro three hundred seventy nine by mister Cullen son to doctor Cullen in opposition to Maclaurin s for liberty of which you have approved Pray read this and tell me what you think as a Politician as well as a Poet upon the subject Be so kind as to let me know how your time is to be distributed next autumn I will meet you at Manchester or where you please but I wish you would complete your tour of the cathedrals and come to Carlisle and I will accompany you a part of the way homewards I am ever Most faithfully yours JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Your notion of the necessity of an yearly interview is very pleasing to both my vanity and tenderness I shall perhaps come to Carlisle another year but my money has not held out so well as it used to do I shall go to Ashbourne and I purpose to make doctor Taylor invite you If you live awhile with me at his house we shall have much time to ourselves and our stay will be no expence to us or him I shall leave London the twenty eighth and after some stay at Oxford and Lichfield shall probably come to Ashbourne about the end of your Session but of all this you shall have notice Be satisfied we will meet somewhere What passed between me and poor doctor Dodd you shall know more fully when we meet Of lawsuits there is no end poor Sir Allan must have another trial for which however his antagonist cannot be much blamed having two Judges on his side I am more afraid of the debts than of the House of Lords It is scarcely to be imagined to what debts will swell that are daily increasing by small additions and how carelessly in a state of desperation debts are contracted Poor Macquarry was far from thinking that when he sold his islands he should receive nothing For what were they sold And what was their yearly value The admission of money into the Highlands will soon put an end to the feudal modes of life by making those men landlords who were not chiefs I do not know that the people will suffer by the change but there was in the patriarchal authority something venerable and pleasing Every eye must look with pain on a Campbell turning the Macquarries at will out of their sedes avitae their hereditary island Sir Alexander Dick is the only Scotsman liberal enough not to be angry that I could not find trees where trees were not I was much delighted by his kind letter I remember Rasay with too much pleasure not to partake of the happiness of any part of that amiable family Our ramble in the islands hangs upon my imagination I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see when we travel again let us look better about us You have done right in taking your uncle s house Some change in the form of life gives from time to time a new epocha three hundred eighty of existence In a new place there is something new to be done and a different system of thoughts rises in the mind I wish I could gather currants in your garden Now fit up a little study and have your books ready at hand do not spare a little money to make your habitation pleasing to yourself I have dined lately with poor dear three hundred eighty one I do not think he goes on well His table is rather coarse and he has his children too much about him three hundred eighty two But he is a very good man missus Williams is in the country to try if she can improve her health she is very ill Matters have come so about that she is in the country with very good accommodation but age and sickness and pride have made her so peevish that I was forced to bribe the maid to stay with her by a secret stipulation of half a crown a week over her wages Our CLUB ended its session about six weeks ago three hundred eighty three We now only meet to dine once a fortnight mister Dunning three hundred eighty four the great lawyer is one of our members The Thrales are well I long to know how the Negro s cause will be decided What is the opinion of Lord Auchinleck or Lord Hailes or Lord Monboddo I am dear Sir Your most affectionate c SAM JOHNSON July twenty two seventeen seventy seven doctor JOHNSON TO missus BOSWELL MADAM Though I am well enough pleased with the taste of sweetmeats very little of the pleasure which I received at the arrival of your jar of marmalade arose from eating it three hundred eighty five I received it as a token of friendship as a proof of reconciliation things much sweeter than sweetmeats and upon this consideration I return you dear Madam my sincerest thanks By having your kindness I think I have a double security for the continuance of mister Boswell s which it is not to be expected that any man can long keep when the influence of a lady so highly and so justly valued operates against him mister Boswell will tell you that I was always faithful to your interest and always endeavoured to exalt you in his estimation You must now do the same for me We must all help one another and you must now consider me as dear Madam Your most obliged And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON July twenty two seventeen seventy seven mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh July twenty eight seventeen seventy seven My Dear Sir This is the day on which you were to leave London and I have been amusing myself in the intervals of my law drudgery with figuring you in the Oxford post coach I doubt however if you have had so merry a journey as you and I had in that vehicle last year when you made so much sport with Gwyn three hundred eighty six the architect Incidents upon a journey are recollected with peculiar pleasure they are preserved in brisk spirits and come up again in our minds tinctured with that gaiety or at least that animation with which we first perceived them I added that something had occurred which I was afraid might prevent me from meeting him three hundred eighty seven and that my wife had been affected with complaints which threatened a consumption but was now better To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Do not disturb yourself about our interviews I hope we shall have many nor think it any thing hard or unusual that your design of meeting me is interrupted We have both endured greater evils and have greater evils to expect missus Boswell s illness makes a more serious distress Does the blood rise from her lungs or from her stomach From little vessels broken in the stomach there is no danger Blood from the lungs is I believe always frothy as mixed with wind Your physicians know very well what is to be done The loss of such a lady would indeed be very afflictive and I hope she is in no danger Take care to keep her mind as easy as is possible I have left Langton in London He has been down with the militia and is again quiet at home talking to his little people as I suppose you do sometimes Make my compliments to Miss Veronica three hundred eighty eight The rest are too young for ceremony I cannot but hope that you have taken your country house at a very seasonable time and that it may conduce to restore or establish missus Boswell s health as well as provide room and exercise for the young ones That you and your lady may both be happy and long enjoy your happiness is the sincere and earnest wish of dear Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON Oxford Aug four seventeen seventy seven mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Informing him that my wife had continued to grow better so that my alarming apprehensions were relieved and that I hoped to disengage myself from the other embarrassment which had occurred and therefore requesting to know particularly when he intended to be at Ashbourne To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I am this day come to Ashbourne and have only to tell you that doctor Taylor says you shall be welcome to him and you know how welcome you will be to me Make haste to let me know when you may be expected Make my compliments to missus Boswell and tell her I hope we shall be at variance no more I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON August thirty seventeen seventy seven To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR On Saturday I wrote a very short letter immediately upon my arrival hither to shew you that I am not less desirous of the interview than yourself Life admits not of delays when pleasure can be had it is fit to catch it Every hour takes away part of the things that please us and perhaps part of our disposition to be pleased When I came to Lichfield I found my old friend Harry Jackson dead three hundred eighty nine It was a loss and a loss not to be repaired as he was one of the companions of my childhood I hope we may long continue to gain friends but the friends which merit or usefulness can procure us are not able to supply the place of old acquaintance with whom the days of youth may be retraced and those images revived which gave the earliest delight If you and I live to be much older we shall take great delight in talking over the Hebridean Journey In the mean time it may not be amiss to contrive some other little adventure but what it can be I know not leave it as Sidney says To virtue fortune wine and woman s breast three hundred ninety for I believe missus Boswell must have some part in the consultation One thing you will like The Doctor so far as I can judge is likely to leave us enough to ourselves He was out to day before I came down and I fancy will stay out till dinner I have brought the papers about poor Dodd to show you but you will soon have dispatched them Before I came away I sent poor missus Williams into the country very ill of a pituitous defluxion which wastes her gradually away and which her physician declares himself unable to stop I supplied her as far as could be desired with all conveniences to make her excursion and abode pleasant and useful But I am afraid she can only linger a short time in a morbid state of weakness and pain The Thrales little and great are all well and purpose to go to Brighthelmstone at Michaelmas They will invite me to go with them and perhaps I may go but I hardly think I shall like to stay the whole time but of futurity we know but little missus Porter is well but missus Aston one of the ladies at Stowhill has been struck with a palsy from which she is not likely ever to recover How soon may such a stroke fall upon us Write to me and let us know when we may expect you I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Ashbourne Sept one seventeen seventy seven mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Sept nine seventeen seventy seven After informing him that I was to set out next day in order to meet him at Ashbourne I have a present for you from Lord Hailes the fifth book of Lactantius which he has published with Latin notes He is also to give you a few anecdotes for your Life of Thomson who I find was private tutor to the present Earl of Hadington Lord Hailes s cousin a circumstance not mentioned by doctor Murdoch I have keen expectations of delight from your edition of The English Poets I am sorry for poor missus Williams s situation You will however have the comfort of reflecting on your kindness to her mister Jackson s death and missus Aston s palsy are gloomy circumstances Yet surely we should be habituated to the uncertainty of life and health When my mind is unclouded by melancholy I consider the temporary distresses of this state of being as light afflictions three hundred ninety one by stretching my mental view into that glorious after existence when they will appear to be as nothing But present pleasures and present pains must be felt I lately read Rasselas over again with great satisfaction three hundred ninety two Since you are desirous to hear about Macquarry s sale I shall inform you particularly The gentleman who purchased Ulva is mister Campbell of Auchnaba our friend Macquarry was proprietor of two thirds of it of which the rent was Lone hundred fifty six fives one one twod This parcel was set up at Lfour thousand sixty nine fives oned but it sold for no less than Lfive thousand five hundred forty The other third of Ulva with the island of Staffa belonged to Macquarry of Ormaig Its rent including that of Staffa Leighty three twelves two one twod set up at Ltwenty one seventy eight sixteens fourd sold for no less than Lthree thousand five hundred forty The Laird of colonel wished to purchase Ulva but he thought the price too high There may indeed be great improvements made there both in fishing and agriculture but the interest of the purchase money exceeds the rent so very much that I doubt if the bargain will be profitable There is an island called Little Colonsay of Lten yearly rent which I am informed has belonged to the Macquarrys of Ulva for many ages but which was lately claimed by the Presbyterian Synod of Argyll in consequence of a grant made to them by Queen Anne It is believed that their claim will be dismissed and that Little Colonsay will also be sold for the advantage of Macquarry s creditors What think you of purchasing this island and endowing a school or college there the master to be a clergyman of the Church of England How venerable would such an institution make the name of doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON in the Hebrides I have like yourself a wonderful pleasure in recollecting our travels in those islands The pleasure is I think greater than it reasonably should be considering that we had not much either of beauty or elegance to charm our imaginations or of rude novelty to astonish Let us by all means have another expedition I shrink a little from our scheme of going up the Baltick three hundred ninety three I am sorry you have already been in Wales for I wish to see it Shall we go to Ireland of which I have seen but little We shall try to strike out a plan when we are at Ashbourne I am ever Your most faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I write to be left at Carlisle as you direct me but you cannot have it Your letter dated Sept six was not at this place till this day Thursday Sept eleven and I hope you will be here before this is at Carlisle three hundred ninety four However what you have not going you may have returning and as I believe I shall not love you less after our interview it will then be as true as it is now that I set a very high value upon your friendship and count your kindness as one of the chief felicities of my life Do not fancy that an intermission of writing is a decay of kindness No man is always in a disposition to write nor has any man at all times something to say That distrust which intrudes so often on your mind is a mode of melancholy which if it be the business of a wise man to be happy it is foolish to indulge and if it be a duty to preserve our faculties entire for their proper use it is criminal Suspicion is very often an useless pain From that and all other pains I wish you free and safe for I am dear Sir Most affectionately yours SAM JOHNSON Ashbourne Sept eleven seventeen seventy seven On Sunday evening Sept fourteen I arrived at Ashbourne and drove directly up to doctor Taylor s door doctor Johnson and he appeared before I had got out of the post chaise and welcomed me cordially three hundred ninety five I told them that I had travelled all the preceding night and gone to bed at Leek in Staffordshire and that when I rose to go to church in the afternoon I was informed there had been an earthquake three hundred ninety six of which it seems the shock had been felt in some degree at Ashbourne JOHNSON Sir it will be much exaggerated in popular talk for in the first place the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects nor secondly do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts they do not mean to lie but taking no pains to be exact they give you very false accounts A great part of their language is proverbial If anything rocks at all they say it rocks like a cradle and in this way they go on The subject of grief for the loss of relations and friends being introduced I observed that it was strange to consider how soon it in general wears away doctor Taylor mentioned a gentleman of the neighbourhood as the only instance he had ever known of a person who had endeavoured to retain grief He told doctor Taylor that after his Lady s death which affected him deeply he resolved that the grief which he cherished with a kind of sacred fondness should be lasting but that he found he could not keep it long JOHNSON All grief for what cannot in the course of nature be helped soon wears away in some sooner indeed in some later but it never continues very long unless where there is madness such as will make a man have pride so fixed in his mind as to imagine himself a King or any other passion in an unreasonable way for all unnecessary grief is unwise and therefore will not be long retained by a sound mind three hundred ninety seven If indeed the cause of our grief is occasioned by our own misconduct if grief is mingled with remorse of conscience it should be lasting BOSWELL But Sir we do not approve of a man who very soon forgets the loss of a wife or a friend JOHNSON Sir we disapprove of him not because he soon forgets his grief for the sooner it is forgotten the better but because we suppose that if he forgets his wife or his friend soon he has not had much affection for them three hundred ninety eight I was somewhat disappointed in finding that the edition of The English Poets for which he was to write Prefaces and Lives was not an undertaking directed by him but that he was to furnish a Preface and Life to any poet the booksellers pleased I asked him if he would do this to any dunce s works if they should ask him JOHNSON Yes Sir and say he was a dunce My friend seemed now not much to relish talking of this edition On Monday September fifteen doctor Johnson observed that every body commended such parts of his Journey to the Western Islands as were in their own way For instance said he mister Jackson the all knowing three hundred ninety nine told me there was more good sense upon trade in it than he should hear in the House of Commons in a year except from Burke Jones commended the part which treats of language Burke that which describes the inhabitants of mountainous countries four hundred After breakfast Johnson carried me to see the garden belonging to the school of Ashbourne which is very prettily formed upon a bank rising gradually behind the house The Reverend mister Langley four hundred one the head master accompanied us While we sat basking in the sun upon a seat here I introduced a common subject of complaint the very small salaries which many curates have and I maintained that no man should be invested with the character of a clergyman unless he has a security for such an income as will enable him to appear respectable that therefore a clergyman should not be allowed to have a curate unless he gives him a hundred pounds a year if he cannot do that let him perform the duty himself JOHNSON To be sure Sir it is wrong that any clergyman should be without a reasonable income but as the church revenues were sadly diminished at the Reformation the clergy who have livings cannot afford in many instances to give good salaries to curates without leaving themselves too little and if no curate were to be permitted unless he had a hundred pounds a year their number would be very small which would be a disadvantage as then there would not be such choice in the nursery for the church curates being candidates for the higher ecclesiastical offices according to their merit and good behaviour He explained the system of the English Hierarchy exceedingly well It is not thought fit said he to trust a man with the care of a parish till he has given proof as a curate that he shall deserve such a trust This is an excellent theory and if the practice were according to it the Church of England would be admirable indeed However as I have heard doctor Johnson observe as to the Universities bad practice does not infer that the constitution is bad four hundred two We had with us at dinner several of doctor Taylor s neighbours good civil gentlemen who seemed to understand doctor Johnson very well and not to consider him in the light that a certain person did four hundred three who being struck or rather stunned by his voice and manner when he was afterwards asked what he thought of him answered He s a tremendous companion Johnson told me that Taylor was a very sensible acute man and had a strong mind four hundred four that he had great activity in some respects and yet such a sort of indolence that if you should put a pebble upon his chimney piece you would find it there in the same state a year afterwards And here is the proper place to give an account of Johnson s humane and zealous interference in behalf of the Reverend doctor William Dodd formerly Prebendary of Brecon and chaplain in ordinary to his Majesty four hundred five celebrated as a very popular preacher four hundred six an encourager of charitable institutions and authour of a variety of works chiefly theological Having unhappily contracted expensive habits of living partly occasioned by licentiousness of manners he in an evil hour when pressed by want of money and dreading an exposure of his circumstances forged a bond of which he attempted to avail himself to support his credit flattering himself with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected The person whose name he thus rashly and criminally presumed to falsify was the Earl of Chesterfield four hundred seven to whom he had been tutor and who he perhaps in the warmth of his feelings flattered himself would have generously paid the money in case of an alarm being taken rather than suffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful consequences of violating the law against forgery the most dangerous crime in a commercial country but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was mistaken His noble pupil appeared against him and he was capitally convicted Johnson told me that doctor Dodd was very little acquainted with him having been but once in his company many years previous to this period four hundred eight which was precisely the state of my own acquaintance with Dodd but in his distress he bethought himself of Johnson s persuasive power of writing if haply it might avail to obtain for him the Royal Mercy He did not apply to him directly but extraordinary as it may seem through the late Countess of Harrington who wrote a letter to Johnson asking him to employ his pen in favour of Dodd mister Allen the printer who was Johnson s landlord and next neighbour in Bolt court and for whom he had much kindness four hundred nine was one of Dodd s friends of whom to the credit of humanity be it recorded that he had many who did not desert him even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the state of a man under sentence of death mister Allen told me that he carried Lady Harrington s letter to Johnson that Johnson read it walking up and down his chamber and seemed much agitated after which he said I will do what I can and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions He this evening as he had obligingly promised in one of his letters put into my hands the whole series of his writings upon this melancholy occasion and I shall present my readers with the abstract which I made from the collection in doing which I studied to avoid copying what had appeared in print and now make part of the edition of Johnson s Works published by the Booksellers of London but taking care to mark Johnson s variations in some of the pieces there exhibited doctor Johnson wrote in the first place doctor Dodd s Speech to the Recorder of London at the Old Bailey when sentence of death was about to be pronounced upon him He wrote also The Convict s Address to his unhappy Brethren a sermon delivered by doctor Dodd in the chapel of Newgate four hundred ten According to Johnson s manuscript it began thus after the text What shall I do to be saved four hundred eleven These were the words with which the keeper to whose custody Paul and Silas were committed by their prosecutors addressed his prisoners when he saw them freed from their bonds by the perceptible agency of divine favour and was therefore irresistibly convinced that they were not offenders against the laws but martyrs to the truth doctor Johnson was so good as to mark for me with his own hand on a copy of this sermon which is now in my possession such passages as were added by doctor Dodd They are not many whoever will take the trouble to look at the printed copy and attend to what I mention will be satisfied of this There is a short introduction by doctor Dodd and he also inserted this sentence You see with what confusion and dishonour I now stand before you no more in the pulpit of instruction but on this humble seat with yourselves The notes are entirely Dodd s own and Johnson s writing ends at the words the thief whom he pardoned on the cross four hundred twelve What follows was supplied by doctor Dodd himself four hundred thirteen The other pieces mentioned by Johnson in the above mentioned collection are two letters one to the Lord Chancellor Bathurst not Lord North as is erroneously supposed and one to Lord Mansfield A Petition from doctor Dodd to the King A Petition from missus Dodd to the Queen Observations of some length inserted in the news papers on occasion of Earl Percy s having presented to his Majesty a petition for mercy to Dodd signed by twenty thousand people but all in vain He told me that he had also written a petition from the city of London but said he with a significant smile they mended it four hundred fourteen The last of these articles which Johnson wrote is Dr Dodd s last solemn Declaration which he left with the sheriff at the place of execution Here also my friend marked the variations on a copy of that piece now in my possession Dodd inserted I never knew or attended to the calls of frugality or the needful minuteness of painful oeconomy and in the next sentence he introduced the words which I distinguish by Italicks My life for some few unhappy years past has been dreadfully erroneous Johnson s expression was hypocritical but his remark on the margin is With this he said he could not charge himself Having thus authentically settled what part of the Occasional Papers concerning doctor Dodd s miserable situation came from the pen of Johnson I shall proceed to present my readers with my record of the unpublished writings relating to that extraordinary and interesting matter I found a letter to doctor Johnson from doctor Dodd May twenty three seventeen seventy seven in which The Convict s Address seems clearly to be meant I am so penetrated my ever dear Sir with a sense of your extreme benevolence towards me that I cannot find words equal to the sentiments of my heart You are too conversant in the world to need the slightest hint from me of what infinite utility the Speech four hundred fifteen on the aweful day has been to me I experience every hour some good effect from it I am sure that effects still more salutary and important must follow from your kind and intended favour I will labour GOD being my helper to do justice to it from the pulpit I am sure had I your sentiments constantly to deliver from thence in all their mighty force and power not a soul could be left unconvinced and unpersuaded He added May GOD ALMIGHTY bless and reward with his choicest comforts your philanthropick actions and enable me at all times to express what I feel of the high and uncommon obligations which I owe to the first man in our times On Sunday June twenty two he writes begging doctor Johnson s assistance in framing a supplicatory letter to his Majesty If his Majesty could be moved of his royal clemency to spare me and my family the horrours and ignominy of a publick death which the publick itself is solicitous to wave and to grant me in some silent distant corner of the globe to pass the remainder of my days in penitence and prayer I would bless his clemency and be humbled This letter was brought to doctor Johnson when in church He stooped down and read it and wrote when he went home the following letter for doctor Dodd to the King SIR May it not offend your Majesty that the most miserable of men applies himself to your clemency as his last hope and his last refuge that your mercy is most earnestly and humbly implored by a clergyman whom your Laws and Judges have condemned to the horrour and ignominy of a publick execution I confess the crime and own the enormity of its consequences and the danger of its example Nor have I the confidence to petition for impunity but humbly hope that publick security may be established without the spectacle of a clergyman dragged through the streets to a death of infamy amidst the derision of the profligate and profane and that justice may be satisfied with irrevocable exile perpetual disgrace and hopeless penury My life Sir has not been useless to mankind I have benefited many But my offences against GOD are numberless and I have had little time for repentance Preserve me Sir by your prerogative of mercy from the necessity of appearing unprepared at that tribunal before which Kings and Subjects must stand at last together Permit me to hide my guilt in some obscure corner of a foreign country where if I can ever attain confidence to hope that my prayers will be heard they shall be poured with all the fervour of gratitude for the life and happiness of your Majesty I am Sir Your Majesty s c Subjoined to it was written as follows To doctor DODD SIR I most seriously enjoin you not to let it be at all known that I have written this letter and to return the copy to mister Allen in a cover to me I hope I need not tell you that I wish it success But do not indulge hope Tell nobody It happened luckily that mister Allen was pitched on to assist in this melancholy office for he was a great friend of mister Akerman the keeper of Newgate doctor Johnson never went to see doctor Dodd He said to me it would have done him more harm than good to Dodd who once expressed a desire to see him but not earnestly doctor Johnson on the twentieth of June wrote the following letter To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES JENKINSON SIR Since the conviction and condemnation of doctor Dodd I have had by the intervention of a friend some intercourse with him and I am sure I shall lose nothing in your opinion by tenderness and commiseration Whatever be the crime it is not easy to have any knowledge of the delinquent without a wish that his life may be spared at least when no life has been taken away by him I will therefore take the liberty of suggesting some reasons for which I wish this unhappy being to escape the utmost rigour of his sentence He is so far as I can recollect the first clergyman of our church who has suffered publick execution for immorality and I know not whether it would not be more for the interest of religion to bury such an offender in the obscurity of perpetual exile than to expose him in a cart and on the gallows to all who for any reason are enemies to the clergy The supreme power has in all ages paid some attention to the voice of the people and that voice does not least deserve to be heard when it calls out for mercy There is now a very general desire that Dodd s life should be spared More is not wished and perhaps this is not too much to be granted If you Sir have any opportunity of enforcing these reasons you may perhaps think them worthy of consideration but whatever you determine I most respectfully intreat that you will be pleased to pardon for this intrusion Sir Your most obedient And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON It has been confidently circulated with invidious remarks that to this letter no attention whatever was paid by mister Jenkinson afterwards Earl of Liverpool four hundred sixteen and that he did not even deign to shew the common civility of owning the receipt of it I could not but wonder at such conduct in the noble Lord whose own character and just elevation in life I thought must have impressed him with all due regard for great abilities and attainments As the story had been much talked of and apparently from good authority I could not but have animadverted upon it in this work had it been as was alleged but from my earnest love of truth and having found reason to think that there might be a mistake I presumed to write to his Lordship requesting an explanation and it is with the sincerest pleasure that I am enabled to assure the world that there is no foundation for it the fact being that owing to some neglect or accident Johnson s letter never came to Lord Hawkesbury s hands I should have thought it strange indeed if that noble Lord had undervalued my illustrious friend but instead of this being the case his Lordship in the very polite answer with which he was pleased immediately to honour me thus expresses himself I have always respected the memory of doctor Johnson and admire his writings and I frequently read many parts of them with pleasure and great improvement All applications for the Royal Mercy having failed doctor Dodd prepared himself for death and with a warmth of gratitude wrote to doctor Johnson as follows June twenty five Midnight Accept thou great and good heart my earnest and fervent thanks and prayers for all thy benevolent and kind efforts in my behalf Oh doctor Johnson as I sought your knowledge at an early hour in life would to heaven I had cultivated the love and acquaintance of so excellent a man I pray GOD most sincerely to bless you with the highest transports the infelt satisfaction of humane and benevolent exertions And admitted as I trust I shall be to the realms of bliss before you I shall hail your arrival there with transports and rejoice to acknowledge that you was my Comforter my Advocate and my Friend GOD be ever with you doctor Johnson lastly wrote to doctor Dodd this solemn and soothing letter To THE REVEREND doctor DODD DEAR SIR That which is appointed to all men is now coming upon you Outward circumstances the eyes and the thoughts of men are below the notice of an immortal being about to stand the trial for eternity before the Supreme Judge of heaven and earth Be comforted your crime morally or religiously considered has no very deep dye of turpitude It corrupted no man s principles it attacked no man s life It involved only a temporary and reparable injury Of this and of all other sins you are earnestly to repent and may GOD who knoweth our frailty and desireth not our death accept your repentance for the sake of his Son JESUS CHRIST our Lord In requital of those well intended offices which you are pleased so emphatically to acknowledge let me beg that you make in your devotions one petition for my eternal welfare I am dear Sir Your affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON June twenty six seventeen seventy seven Under the copy of this letter I found written in Johnson s own hand Next day June twenty seven he was executed To conclude this interesting episode with an useful application let us now attend to the reflections of Johnson at the end of the Occasional Papers concerning the unfortunate doctor Dodd Such were the last thoughts of a man whom we have seen exulting in popularity and sunk in shame For his reputation which no man can give to himself those who conferred it are to answer Of his publick ministry the means of judging were sufficiently attainable He must be allowed to preach well whose sermons strike his audience with forcible conviction Of his life those who thought it consistent with his doctrine did not originally form false notions He was at first what he endeavoured to make others but the world broke down his resolution and he in time ceased to exemplify his own instructions Let those who are tempted to his faults tremble at his punishment and those whom he impressed from the pulpit with religious sentiments endeavour to confirm them by considering the regret and self abhorrence with which he reviewed in prison his deviations from rectitude Johnson gave us this evening in his happy discriminative manner a portrait of the late mister Fitzherbert of Derbyshire There was said he no sparkle no brilliancy in Fitzherbert but I never knew a man who was so generally acceptable four hundred seventeen He made every body quite easy overpowered nobody by the superiority of his talents made no man think worse of himself by being his rival seemed always to listen did not oblige you to hear much from him and did not oppose what you said Every body liked him but he had no friend as I understand the word nobody with whom he exchanged intimate thoughts four hundred eighteen People were willing to think well of every thing about him A gentleman was making an affected rant as many people do of great feelings about his dear son who was at school near London how anxious he was lest he might be ill and what he would give to see him Can t you said Fitzherbert take a post chaise and go to him This to be sure finished the affected man but there was not much in it four hundred nineteen However this was circulated as wit for a whole winter and I believe part of a summer too a proof that he was no very witty man He was an instance of the truth of the observation that a man will please more upon the whole by negative qualities than by positive by never offending than by giving a great deal of delight In the first place men hate more steadily than they love and if I have said something to hurt a man once I shall not get the better of this by saying many things to please him four hundred twenty Tuesday September sixteen doctor Johnson having mentioned to me the extraordinary size and price of some cattle reared by doctor Taylor I rode out with our host surveyed his farm and was shown one cow which he had sold for a hundred and twenty guineas and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty four hundred twenty one Taylor thus described to me his old schoolfellow and friend Johnson He is a man of a very clear head great power of words and a very gay imagination but there is no disputing with him He will not hear you and having a louder voice than you must roar you down In the afternoon I tried to get doctor Johnson to like the Poems of mister Hamilton of Bangour four hundred twenty two which I had brought with me I had been much pleased with them at a very early age the impression still remained on my mind it was confirmed by the opinion of my friend the Honourable Andrew Erskine himself both a good poet four hundred twenty three and a good critick who thought Hamilton as true a poet as ever wrote and that his not having fame was unaccountable Johnson upon repeated occasions while I was at Ashbourne talked slightingly of Hamilton He said there was no power of thinking in his verses nothing that strikes one nothing better than what you generally find in magazines and that the highest praise they deserved was that they were very well for a gentleman to hand about among his friends He said the imitation of Ne sit ancillae tibi amor four hundred twenty four c was too solemn he read part of it at the beginning He read the beautiful pathetick song Ah the poor shepherd s mournful fate and did not seem to give attention to what I had been used to think tender elegant strains but laughed at the rhyme in Scotch pronunciation wishes and blushes four hundred twenty five reading wushes and there he stopped He owned that the epitaph on Lord Newhall was pretty well done He read the Inscription in a Summer house and a little of the imitations of Horace s Epistles but said he found nothing to make him desire to read on When I urged that there were some good poetical passages in the book Where said he will you find so large a collection without some I thought the description of Winter might obtain his approbation See four hundred twenty six Winter from the frozen north Drives his iron chariot forth His grisly hand in icy chains Fair Tweeda s silver flood constrains c He asked why an iron chariot and said icy chains was an old image four hundred twenty seven I was struck with the uncertainty of taste and somewhat sorry that a poet whom I had long read with fondness was not approved by doctor Johnson I comforted myself with thinking that the beauties were too delicate for his robust perceptions Garrick maintained that he had not a taste for the finest productions of genius but I was sensible that when he took the trouble to analyse critically he generally convinced us that he was right In the evening the Reverend mister Seward four hundred twenty eight of Lichfield who was passing through Ashbourne in his way home drank tea with us Johnson described him thus Sir his ambition is to be a fine talker so he goes to Buxton and such places where he may find companies to listen to him And Sir he is valetudinarian one of those who are always mending themselves I do not know a more disagreeable character than a valetudinarian who thinks he may do any thing that is for his ease and indulges himself in the grossest freedoms Sir he brings himself to the state of a hog in a stye four hundred twenty nine doctor Taylor s nose happening to bleed he said it was because he had omitted to have himself blooded four days after a quarter of a year s interval doctor Johnson who was a great dabbler in physick four hundred thirty disapproved much of periodical bleeding four hundred thirty one For said he you accustom yourself to an evacuation which Nature cannot perform of herself and therefore she cannot help you should you from forgetfulness or any other cause omit it so you may be suddenly suffocated You may accustom yourself to other periodical evacuations because should you omit them Nature can supply the omission but Nature cannot open a vein to blood you I do not like to take an emetick said Taylor for fear of breaking some small vessels Poh said Johnson if you have so many things that will break you had better break your neck at once and there s an end on t You will break no small vessels blowing with high derision I mentioned to doctor Johnson that David Hume s persisting in his infidelity when he was dying shocked me much JOHNSON Why should it shock you Sir Hume owned he had never read the New Testament with attention Here then was a man who had been at no pains to inquire into the truth of religion and had continually turned his mind the other way It was not to be expected that the prospect of death would alter his way of thinking unless GOD should send an angel to set him right I said I had reason to believe that the thought of annihilation gave Hume no pain JOHNSON It was not so Sir four hundred thirty two He had a vanity in being thought easy It is more probable that he should assume an appearance of ease than that so very improbable a thing should be as a man not afraid of going as in spite of his delusive theory he cannot be sure but he may go into an unknown state and not being uneasy at leaving all he knew And you are to consider that upon his own principle of annihilation he had no motive to speak the truth The horrour of death which I had always observed in doctor Johnson appeared strong to night I ventured to tell him that I had been for moments in my life not afraid of death therefore I could suppose another man in that state of mind for a considerable space of time He said he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him four hundred thirty three He added that it had been observed that scarce any man four hundred thirty four dies in publick but with apparent resolution from that desire of praise which never quits us I said doctor Dodd seemed to be willing to die and full of hopes of happiness Sir said he doctor Dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived The better a man is the more afraid he is of death having a clearer view of infinite purity He owned that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation was mysterious and said Ah we must wait till we are in another state of being to have many things explained to us Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity But I thought that the gloom of uncertainty in solemn religious speculation being mingled with hope was yet more consolatory than the emptiness of infidelity A man can live in thick air but perishes in an exhausted receiver doctor Johnson was much pleased with a remark which I told him was made to me by General Paoli That it is impossible not to be afraid of death and that those who at the time of dying are not afraid are not thinking of death but of applause or something else which keeps death out of their sight so that all men are equally afraid of death when they see it only some have a power of turning their sight away from it better than others four hundred thirty five On Wednesday September seventeen doctor Butter physician at Derby drank tea with us and it was settled that doctor Johnson and I should go on Friday and dine with him Johnson said I m glad of this He seemed weary of the uniformity of life at doctor Taylor s Talking of biography I said in writing a life a man s peculiarities should be mentioned because they mark his character JOHNSON Sir there is no doubt as to peculiarities the question is whether a man s vices should be mentioned for instance whether it should be mentioned that Addison and Parnell drank too freely for people will probably more easily indulge in drinking from knowing this so that more ill may be done by the example than good by telling the whole truth four hundred thirty six Here was an instance of his varying from himself in talk for when Lord Hailes and he sat one morning calmly conversing in my house at Edinburgh I well remember that doctor Johnson maintained that If a man is to write A Panegyrick he may keep vices out of sight but if he professes to write A Life he must represent it really as it was and when I objected to the danger of telling that Parnell drank to excess he said that it would produce an instructive caution to avoid drinking when it was seen that even the learning and genius of Parnell could be debased by it And in the Hebrides he maintained as appears from my Journal four hundred thirty seven that a man s intimate friend should mention his faults if he writes his life four hundred thirty eight He had this evening partly I suppose from the spirit of contradiction to his Whig friend a violent argument with doctor Taylor as to the inclinations of the people of England at this time towards the Royal Family of Stuart He grew so outrageous as to say that if England were fairly polled the present King would be sent away to night and his adherents hanged to morrow Taylor who was as violent a Whig as Johnson was a Tory was roused by this to a pitch of bellowing He denied loudly what Johnson said and maintained that there was an abhorrence against the Stuart family though he admitted that the people were not much attached to the present King four hundred thirty nine JOHNSON Sir the state of the country is this the people knowing it to be agreed on all hands that this King has not the hereditary right to the crown and there being no hope that he who has it can be restored have grown cold and indifferent upon the subject of loyalty and have no warm attachment to any King They would not therefore risk any thing to restore the exiled family They would not give twenty shillings a piece to bring it about But if a mere vote could do it there would be twenty to one at least there would be a very great majority of voices for it For Sir you are to consider that all those who think a King has a right to his crown as a man has to his estate which is the just opinion would be for restoring the King who certainly has the hereditary right could he be trusted with it in which there would be no danger now when laws and every thing else are so much advanced and every King will govern by the laws And you must also consider Sir that there is nothing on the other side to oppose to this for it is not alleged by any one that the present family has any inherent right four hundred forty so that the Whigs could not have a contest between two rights doctor Taylor admitted that if the question as to hereditary right were to be tried by a poll of the people of England to be sure the abstract doctrine would be given in favour of the family of Stuart but he said the conduct of that family which occasioned their expulsion was so fresh in the minds of the people that they would not vote for a restoration doctor Johnson I think was contented with the admission as to the hereditary right leaving the original point in dispute viz what the people upon the whole would do taking in right and affection for he said people were afraid of a change even though they think it right doctor Taylor said something of the slight foundation of the hereditary right of the house of Stuart Sir said Johnson the house of Stuart succeeded to the full right of both the houses of York and Lancaster whose common source had the undisputed right A right to a throne is like a right to any thing else Possession is sufficient where no better right can be shown This was the case with the Royal Family of England as it is now with the King of France for as to the first beginning of the right we are in the dark four hundred forty one Thursday September eighteen Last night doctor Johnson had proposed that the crystal lustre or chandelier in doctor Taylor s large room should be lighted up some time or other Taylor said it should be lighted up next night That will do very well said I for it is doctor Johnson s birth day four hundred forty two When we were in the Isle of Sky Johnson had desired me not to mention his birth day He did not seem pleased at this time that I mentioned it and said somewhat sternly he would not have the lustre lighted the next day Some ladies who had been present yesterday when I mentioned his birth day came to dinner to day and plagued him unintentionally by wishing him joy I know not why he disliked having his birth day mentioned unless it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death of which he had a constant dread four hundred forty three I mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low spirits and much distressed by the fear of death but was now uniformly placid and contemplated his dissolution without any perturbation Sir said Johnson this is only a disordered imagination taking a different turn We talked of a collection being made of all the English Poets who had published a volume of poems Johnson told me that a mister Coxeter four hundred forty four whom he knew had gone the greatest length towards this having collected I think about five hundred volumes of poets whose works were little known but that upon his death Tom Osborne four hundred forty five bought them and they were dispersed which he thought a pity as it was curious to see any series complete and in every volume of poems something good may be found He observed that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad style of poetry of late four hundred forty six He puts said he a very common thing in a strange dress till he does not know it himself and thinks other people do not know it BOSWELL That is owing to his being so much versant in old English poetry four hundred forty seven JOHNSON What is the purpose Sir If I say a man is drunk and you tell me it is owing to his taking much drink the matter is not mended No Sir has taken to an odd mode For example he d write thus Hermit hoar in solemn cell Wearing out life s evening gray four hundred forty eight Gray evening is common enough but evening gray he d think fine four hundred forty nine Stay we ll make out the stanza Hermit hoar in solemn cell Wearing out life s evening gray Smite thy bosom sage and tell What is bliss and which the way BOSWELL But why smite his bosom Sir JOHNSON Why to shew he was in earnest smiling He at an after period added the following stanza Thus I spoke and speaking sigh d Scarce repress d the starting tear When the smiling sage reply d Come my lad and drink some beer four hundred fifty I cannot help thinking the first stanza very good solemn poetry as also the three first lines of the second Its last line is an excellent burlesque surprise on gloomy sentimental enquirers And perhaps the advice is as good as can be given to a low spirited dissatisfied being Don t trouble your head with sickly thinking take a cup and be merry Friday September nineteen after breakfast doctor Johnson and I set out in doctor Taylor s chaise to go to Derby The day was fine and we resolved to go by Keddlestone the seat of Lord Scarsdale that I might see his Lordship s fine house I was struck with the magnificence of the building and the extensive park with the finest verdure covered with deer and cattle and sheep delighted me The number of old oaks of an immense size filled me with a sort of respectful admiration for one of them sixty pounds was offered The excellent smooth gravel roads the large piece of water formed by his Lordship from some small brooks with a handsome barge upon it the venerable Gothick church now the family chapel just by the house in short the grand group of objects agitated and distended my mind in a most agreeable manner One should think said I that the proprietor of all this must be happy Nay Sir said Johnson all this excludes but one evil poverty four hundred fifty one Our names were sent up and a well drest elderly housekeeper a most distinct articulator shewed us the house which I need not describe as there is an account of it published in Adam s Works in Architecture doctor Johnson thought better of it to day than when he saw it before four hundred fifty two for he had lately attacked it violently saying It would do excellently for a town hall The large room with the pillars said he would do for the Judges to sit in at the assizes the circular room for a jury chamber and the room above for prisoners Still he thought the large room ill lighted and of no use but for dancing in and the bed chambers but indifferent rooms and that the immense sum which it cost was injudiciously laid out doctor Taylor had put him in mind of his appearing pleased with the house But said he that was when Lord Scarsdale was present Politeness obliges us to appear pleased with a man s works when he is present No man will be so ill bred as to question you You may therefore pay compliments without saying what is not true I should say to Lord Scarsdale of his large room My Lord this is the most costly room that I ever saw which is true doctor Manningham physician in London who was visiting at Lord Scarsdale s accompanyed us through many of the rooms and soon afterwards my Lord himself to whom doctor Johnson was known appeared and did the honours of the house We talked of mister Langton Johnson with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard exclaimed The earth does not bear a worthier man than Bennet Langton We saw a good many fine pictures which I think are described in one of Young s Tours four hundred fifty three There is a printed catalogue of them which the housekeeper put into my hand I should like to view them at leisure I was much struck with Daniel interpreting Nebuchadnezzar s dream by Rembrandt We were shown a pretty large library In his Lordship s dressing room lay Johnson s small Dictionary he shewed it to me with some eagerness saying Look ye Quae terra nostri non plena laboris four hundred fifty four He observed also Goldsmith s Animated Nature and said Here s our friend The poor Doctor would have been happy to hear of this In our way Johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a post chaise four hundred fifty five If said he I had no duties and no reference to futurity I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post chaise with a pretty woman but she should be one who could understand me and would add something to the conversation I observed that we were this day to stop just where the Highland army did in seventeen forty five four hundred fifty six JOHNSON It was a noble attempt BOSWELL I wish we could have an authentick history of it JOHNSON If you were not an idle dog you might write it by collecting from every body what they can tell and putting down your authorities BOSWELL But I could not have the advantage of it in my life time JOHNSON You might have the satisfaction of its fame by printing it in Holland and as to profit consider how long it was before writing came to be considered in a pecuniary view Baretti says he is the first man that ever received copy money in Italy four hundred fifty seven I said that I would endeavour to do what doctor Johnson suggested and I thought that I might write so as to venture to publish my History of the Civil War in Great Britain in seventeen forty five and seventeen forty six without being obliged to go to a foreign press four hundred fifty eight When we arrived at Derby doctor Butter accompanied us to see the manufactory of china there I admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man fashioned clay into a cup a saucer or a tea pot while a boy turned round a wheel to give the mass rotundity I thought this as excellent in its species of power as making good verses in its species Yet I had no respect for this potter Neither indeed has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere verse maker in whose numbers however perfect there is no poetry no mind The china was beautiful but doctor Johnson justly observed it was too dear for that he could have vessels of silver of the same size as cheap as what were here made of porcelain four hundred fifty nine I felt a pleasure in walking about Derby such as I always have in walking about any town to which I am not accustomed There is an immediate sensation of novelty and one speculates on the way in which life is passed in it which although there is a sameness every where upon the whole is yet minutely diversified The minute diversities in every thing are wonderful Talking of shaving the other night at doctor Taylor s doctor Johnson said Sir of a thousand shavers two do not shave so much alike as not to be distinguished I thought this not possible till he specified so many of the varieties in shaving holding the razor more or less perpendicular drawing long or short strokes beginning at the upper part of the face or the under at the right side or the left side Indeed when one considers what variety of sounds can be uttered by the windpipe in the compass of a very small aperture we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor We dined with doctor Butter whose lady is daughter of my cousin Sir John Douglas whose grandson is now presumptive heir of the noble family of Queensberry Johnson and he had a good deal of medical conversation Johnson said he had somewhere or other given an account of doctor Nichols s four hundred sixty discourse De Anima Medica He told us that whatever a man s distemper was doctor Nichols would not attend him as a physician if his mind was not at ease for he believed that no medicines would have any influence He once attended a man in trade upon whom he found none of the medicines he prescribed had any effect he asked the man s wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way She said no He continued his attendance some time still without success At length the man s wife told him she had discovered that her husband s affairs were in a bad way When Goldsmith was dying doctor Turton said to him Your pulse is in greater disorder than it should be from the degree of fever which you have is your mind at ease Goldsmith answered it was not After dinner missus Butter went with me to see the silk mill which mister John Lombe had four hundred sixty one had a patent for having brought away the contrivance from Italy I am not very conversant with mechanicks but the simplicity of this machine and its multiplied operations struck me with an agreeable surprize I had learnt from doctor Johnson during this interview not to think with a dejected indifference of the works of art and the pleasures of life because life is uncertain and short but to consider such indifference as a failure of reason a morbidness of mind for happiness should be cultivated as much as we can and the objects which are instrumental to it should be steadily considered as of importance four hundred sixty two with a reference not only to ourselves but to multitudes in successive ages Though it is proper to value small parts as Sands make the mountain moments make the year four hundred sixty three yet we must contemplate collectively to have a just estimation of objects One moment s being uneasy or not seems of no consequence yet this may be thought of the next and the next and so on till there is a large portion of misery In the same way one must think of happiness of learning of friendship We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed As in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over We must not divide objects of our attention into minute parts and think separately of each part It is by contemplating a large mass of human existence that a man while he sets a just value on his own life does not think of his death as annihilating all that is great and pleasing in the world as if actually contained in his mind according to Berkeley s reverie four hundred sixty four If his imagination be not sickly and feeble it wings its distant way four hundred sixty five far beyond himself and views the world in unceasing activity of every sort It must be acknowledged however that Pope s plaintive reflection that all things would be as gay as ever on the day of his death is natural and common four hundred sixty six We are apt to transfer to all around us our own gloom without considering that at any given point of time there is perhaps as much youth and gaiety in the world as at another Before I came into this life in which I have had so many pleasant scenes have not thousands and ten thousands of deaths and funerals happened and have not families been in grief for their nearest relations But have those dismal circumstances at all affected me Why then should the gloomy scenes which I experience or which I know affect others Let us guard against imagining that there is an end of felicity upon earth when we ourselves grow old or are unhappy doctor Johnson told us at tea that when some of doctor Dodd s pious friends were trying to console him by saying that he was going to leave a wretched world he had honesty enough not to join in the cant four hundred sixty seven No no said he it has been a very agreeable world to me Johnson added I respect Dodd for thus speaking the truth for to be sure he had for several years enjoyed a life of great voluptuousness four hundred sixty eight He told us that Dodd s city friends stood by him so that a thousand pounds were ready to be given to the gaoler if he would let him escape He added that he knew a friend of Dodd s who walked about Newgate for some time on the evening before the day of his execution with five hundred pounds in his pocket ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out but it was too late for he was watched with much circumspection four hundred sixty nine He said Dodd s friends had an image of him made of wax which was to have been left in his place and he believed it was carried into the prison Johnson disapproved of doctor Dodd s leaving the world persuaded that The Convict s Address to his unhappy Brethren was of his own writing four hundred seventy But Sir said I you contributed to the deception for when mister Seward expressed a doubt to you that it was not Dodd s own because it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his you answered Why should you think so Depend upon it Sir when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully JOHNSON Sir as Dodd got it from me to pass as his own while that could do him any good there was an implied promise that I should not own it To own it therefore would have been telling a lie with the addition of breach of promise which was worse than simply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd s Besides Sir I did not directly tell a lie I left the matter uncertain Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the less to be mine for what I said but I would not put it in his power to say I had owned it He praised Blair s sermons Yet said he willing to let us see he was aware that fashionable fame however deserved is not always the most lasting perhaps they may not be re printed after seven years at least not after Blair s death four hundred seventy one He said Goldsmith was a plant that flowered late four hundred seventy two There appeared nothing remarkable about him when he was young though when he had got high in fame one of his friends four hundred seventy three began to recollect something of his being distinguished at College Goldsmith in the same manner recollected more of that friend s early years as he grew a greater man I mentioned that Lord Monboddo told me he awaked every morning at four and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked with the window open which he called taking an air bath four hundred seventy four after which he went to bed again and slept two hours more Johnson who was always ready to beat down any thing that seemed to be exhibited with disproportionate importance thus observed I suppose Sir there is no more in it than this he awakes at four and cannot sleep till he chills himself and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful sensation I talked of the difficulty of rising in the morning doctor Johnson told me that the learned missus Carter at that period when she was eager in study did not awake as early as she wished and she therefore had a contrivance that at a certain hour her chamber light should burn a string to which a heavy weight was suspended which then fell with a strong sudden noise this roused her from sleep and then she had no difficulty in getting up But I said that was my difficulty and wished there could be some medicine invented which would make one rise without pain which I never did unless after lying in bed a very long time Perhaps there may be something in the stores of Nature which could do this I have thought of a pulley to raise me gradually but that would give me pain as it would counteract my internal inclination I would have something that can dissipate the vis inertiae and give elasticity to the muscles As I imagine that the human body may be put by the operation of other substances into any state in which it has ever been and as I have experienced a state in which rising from bed was not disagreeable but easy nay sometimes agreeable I suppose that this state may be produced if we knew by what We can heat the body we can cool it we can give it tension or relaxation and surely it is possible to bring it into a state in which rising from bed will not be a pain Johnson observed that a man should take a sufficient quantity of sleep which doctor Mead says is between seven and nine hours I told him that doctor Cullen said to me that a man should not take more sleep than he can take at once JOHNSON This rule Sir cannot hold in all cases for many people have their sleep broken by sickness and surely Cullen would not have a man to get up after having slept but an hour Such a regimen would soon end in a long sleep four hundred seventy five doctor Taylor remarked I think very justly that a man who does not feel an inclination to sleep at the ordinary time instead of being stronger than other people must not be well for a man in health has all the natural inclinations to eat drink and sleep in a strong degree Johnson advised me to night not to refine in the education of my children Life said he will not bear refinement you must do as other people do four hundred seventy six As we drove back to Ashbourne doctor Johnson recommended to me as he had often done to drink water only For said he you are then sure not to get drunk whereas if you drink wine you are never sure I said drinking wine was a pleasure which I was unwilling to give up Why Sir said he there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life but it may be necessary He however owned that in his opinion a free use of wine did not shorten life four hundred seventy seven and said he would not give less for the life of a certain Scotch Lord four hundred seventy eight whom he named celebrated for hard drinking than for that of a sober man But stay said he with his usual intelligence and accuracy of enquiry does it take much wine to make him drunk I answered a great deal either of wine or strong punch Then said he that is the worse I presume to illustrate my friend s observation thus A fortress which soon surrenders has its walls less shattered than when a long and obstinate resistance is made I ventured to mention a person who was as violent a Scotsman as he was an Englishman and literally had the same contempt for an Englishman compared with a Scotsman that he had for a Scotsman compared with an Englishman and that he would say of doctor Johnson Damned rascal to talk as he does of the Scotch This seemed for a moment to give him pause four hundred seventy nine It perhaps presented his extreme prejudice against the Scotch in a point of view somewhat new to him by the effect of contrast By the time when we returned to Ashbourne doctor Taylor was gone to bed Johnson and I sat up a long time by ourselves He was much diverted with an article which I shewed him in the Critical Review of this year giving an account of a curious publication entitled A Spiritual Diary and Soliloquies by John Rutty M D doctor Rutty was one of the people called Quakers a physician of some eminence in Dublin and authour of several works four hundred eighty This Diary which was kept from seventeen fifty three to seventeen seventy five the year in which he died and was now published in two volumes octavo exhibited in the simplicity of his heart a minute and honest register of the state of his mind which though frequently laughable enough was not more so than the history of many men would be if recorded with equal fairness The following specimens were extracted by the Reviewers Tenth month seventeen fifty three twenty three Indulgence in bed an hour too long Twelfth month seventeen An hypochondriack obnubilation from wind and indigestion Ninth month twenty eight An over dose of whisky twenty nine A dull cross cholerick day First month seventeen fifty seven twenty two A little swinish at dinner and repast thirty one Dogged on provocation Second month five Very dogged or snappish fourteen Snappish on fasting twenty six Cursed snappishness to those under me on a bodily indisposition Third month eleven On a provocation exercised a dumb resentment for two days instead of scolding twenty two Scolded too vehemently twenty three Dogged again Fourth month twenty nine Mechanically and sinfully dogged Johnson laughed heartily at this good Quietist s self condemning minutes particularly at his mentioning with such a serious regret occasional instances of swinishness in eating and doggedness of temper four hundred eighty one He thought the observations of the Critical Reviewers upon the importance of a man to himself so ingenious and so well expressed that I shall here introduce them After observing that There are few writers who have gained any reputation by recording their own actions they say We may reduce the egotists to four classes In the first we have Julius Caesar he relates his own transactions but he relates them with peculiar grace and dignity and his narrative is supported by the greatness of his character and atchievements In the second class we have Marcus Antoninus this writer has given us a series of reflections on his own life but his sentiments are so noble his morality so sublime that his meditations are universally admired In the third class we have some others of tolerable credit who have given importance to their own private history by an intermixture of literary anecdotes and the occurrences of their own times the celebrated Huetius has published an entertaining volume upon this plan De rebus ad eum pertinentibus four hundred eighty two In the fourth class we have the journalists temporal and spiritual Elias Ashmole William Lilly George Whitefield John Wesley and a thousand other old women and fanatick writers of memoirs and meditations I mentioned to him that doctor Hugh Blair in his lectures on Rhetorick and Belles Lettres which I heard him deliver at Edinburgh had animadverted on the Johnsonian style as too pompous and attempted to imitate it by giving a sentence of Addison in The Spectator No four hundred eleven in the manner of Johnson When treating of the utility of the pleasures of imagination in preserving us from vice it is observed of those who know not how to be idle and innocent that their very first step out of business is into vice or folly which doctor Blair supposed would have been expressed in The Rambler thus Their very first step out of the regions of business is into the perturbation of vice or the vacuity of folly four hundred eighty three JOHNSON Sir these are not the words I should have used No Sir the imitators of my style have not hit it Miss Aikin has done it the best for she has imitated the sentiment as well as the diction four hundred eighty four I intend before this work is concluded four hundred eighty five to exhibit specimens of imitation of my friend s style in various modes some caricaturing or mimicking it and some formed upon it whether intentionally or with a degree of similarity to it of which perhaps the writers were not conscious In Baretti s Review which he published in Italy under the title of Frusta Letteraria four hundred eighty six it is observed that doctor Robertson the historian had formed his style upon that of Il celebre Samuele Johnson My friend himself was of that opinion for he once said to me in a pleasant humour Sir if Robertson s style be faulty he owes it to me that is having too many words and those too big ones four hundred eighty seven I read to him a letter which Lord Monboddo had written to me containing some critical remarks upon the style of his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland His Lordship praised the very fine passage upon landing at Icolmkill four hundred eighty eight but his own style being exceedingly dry and hard he disapproved of the richness of Johnson s language and of his frequent use of metaphorical expressions JOHNSON Why Sir this criticism would be just if in my style superfluous words or words too big for the thoughts could be pointed out four hundred eighty nine but this I do not believe can be done For instance in the passage which Lord Monboddo admires We were now treading that illustrious region four hundred ninety the word illustrious contributes nothing to the mere narration for the fact might be told without it but it is not therefore superfluous for it wakes the mind to peculiar attention where something of more than usual importance is to be presented Illustrious for what and then the sentence proceeds to expand the circumstances connected with Iona And Sir as to metaphorical expression that is a great excellence in style when it is used with propriety for it gives you two ideas for one conveys the meaning more luminously and generally with a perception of delight He told me that he had been asked to undertake the new edition of the Biographia Britannica but had declined it which he afterwards said to me he regretted four hundred ninety one In this regret many will join because it would have procured us more of Johnson s most delightful species of writing and although my friend doctor Kippis has hitherto discharged the task judiciously distinctly and with more impartiality than might have been expected from a Separatist it were to have been wished that the superintendence of this literary Temple of Fame had been assigned to a friend to the constitution in Church and State We should not then have had it too much crowded with obscure dissenting teachers doubtless men of merit and worth but not quite to be numbered amongst the most eminent persons who have flourished in Great Britain and Ireland four hundred ninety two On Saturday September thirty after breakfast when Taylor was gone out to his farm doctor Johnson and I had a serious conversation by ourselves on melancholy and madness which he was I always thought erroneously inclined to confound together four hundred ninety three Melancholy like great wit may be near allied to madness four hundred ninety four but there is in my opinion a distinct separation between them When he talked of madness he was to be understood as speaking of those who were in any great degree disturbed or as it is commonly expressed troubled in mind Some of the ancient philosophers held that all deviations from right reason were madness and whoever wishes to see the opinions both of ancients and moderns upon this subject collected and illustrated with a variety of curious facts may read doctor Arnold s very entertaining work four hundred ninety five Johnson said A madman loves to be with people whom he fears not as a dog fears the lash but of whom he stands in awe I was struck with the justice of this observation To be with those of whom a person whose mind is wavering and dejected stands in awe represses and composes an uneasy tumult of spirits and consoles him with the contemplation of something steady and at least comparatively great He added Madmen are all sensual in the lower stages of the distemper They are eager for gratifications to sooth their minds and divert their attention from the misery which they suffer but when they grow very ill pleasure is too weak for them and they seek for pain four hundred ninety six Employment Sir and hardships prevent melancholy I suppose in all our army in America there was not one man who went mad four hundred ninety seven We entered seriously upon a question of much importance to me which Johnson was pleased to consider with friendly attention I had long complained to him that I felt myself discontented in Scotland as too narrow a sphere and that I wished to make my chief residence in London the great scene of ambition instruction and amusement a scene which was to me comparatively speaking a heaven upon earth four hundred ninety eight JOHNSON Why Sir I never knew any one who had such a gust for London as you have and I cannot blame you for your wish to live there yet Sir were I in your father s place I should not consent to your settling there for I have the old feudal notions and I should be afraid that Auchinleck would be deserted as you would soon find it more desirable to have a country seat in a better climate I own however that to consider it as a duty to reside on a family estate is a prejudice for we must consider that working people get employment equally and the produce of land is sold equally whether a great family resides at home or not and if the rents of an estate be carried to London they return again in the circulation of commerce nay Sir we must perhaps allow that carrying the rents to a distance is a good because it contributes to that circulation We must however allow that a well regulated great family may improve a neighbourhood in civility and elegance and give an example of good order virtue and piety and so its residence at home may be of much advantage But if a great family be disorderly and vicious its residence at home is very pernicious to a neighbourhood There is not now the same inducement to live in the country as formerly the pleasures of social life are much better enjoyed in town and there is no longer in the country that power and influence in proprietors of land which they had in old times and which made the country so agreeable to them The Laird of Auchinleck now is not near so great a man as the Laird of Auchinleck was a hundred years ago four hundred ninety nine I told him that one of my ancestors never went from home without being attended by thirty men on horseback Johnson s shrewdness and spirit of enquiry were exerted upon every occasion Pray said he how did your ancestor support his thirty men and thirty horses when he went at a distance from home in an age when there was hardly any money in circulation I suggested the same difficulty to a friend who mentioned Douglas s going to the Holy Land with a numerous train of followers Douglas could no doubt maintain followers enough while living upon his own lands the produce of which supplied them with food but he could not carry that food to the Holy Land and as there was no commerce by which he could be supplied with money how could he maintain them in foreign countries I suggested a doubt that if I were to reside in London the exquisite zest with which I relished it in occasional visits might go off and I might grow tired of it JOHNSON Why Sir you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave London No Sir when a man is tired of London he is tired of life for there is in London all that life can afford five hundred To obviate his apprehension that by settling in London I might desert the seat of my ancestors I assured him that I had old feudal principles to a degree of enthusiasm and that I felt all the dulcedo of the natale solum five hundred one I reminded him that the Laird of Auchinleck had an elegant house in front of which he could ride ten miles forward upon his own territories upon which he had upwards of six hundred people attached to him that the family seat was rich in natural romantick beauties of rock wood and water and that in my morn of life five hundred two I had appropriated the finest descriptions in the ancient Classicks to certain scenes there which were thus associated in my mind That when all this was considered I should certainly pass a part of the year at home and enjoy it the more from variety and from bringing with me a share of the intellectual stores of the metropolis He listened to all this and kindly hoped it might be as I now supposed He said A country gentleman should bring his lady to visit London as soon as he can that they may have agreeable topicks for conversation when they are by themselves As I meditated trying my fortune in Westminster Hall our conversation turned upon the profession of the law in England JOHNSON You must not indulge too sanguine hopes should you be called to our bar I was told by a very sensible lawyer that there are a great many chances against any man s success in the profession of the law the candidates are so numerous and those who get large practice so few He said it was by no means true that a man of good parts and application is sure of having business though he indeed allowed that if such a man could but appear in a few causes his merit would be known and he would get forward but that the great risk was that a man might pass half a life time in the Courts and never have an opportunity of shewing his abilities five hundred three We talked of employment being absolutely necessary to preserve the mind from wearying and growing fretful especially in those who have a tendency to melancholy and I mentioned to him a saying which somebody had related of an American savage who when an European was expatiating on all the advantages of money put this question Will it purchase occupation JOHNSON Depend upon it Sir this saying is too refined for a savage And Sir money will purchase occupation it will purchase all the conveniences of life it will purchase variety of company it will purchase all sorts of entertainment I talked to him of Forster s Voyage to the South Seas which pleased me but I found he did not like it Sir said he there is a great affectation of fine writing in it BOSWELL But he carries you along with him JOHNSON No Sir he does not carry me along with him he leaves me behind him or rather indeed he sets me before him for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time On Sunday September twelve five hundred four we went to the church of Ashbourne which is one of the largest and most luminous that I have seen in any town of the same size I felt great satisfaction in considering that I was supported in my fondness for solemn publick worship by the general concurrence and munificence of mankind Johnson and Taylor were so different from each other that I wondered at their preserving an intimacy five hundred five Their having been at school and college together might in some degree account for this five hundred six but Sir Joshua Reynolds has furnished me with a stronger reason for Johnson mentioned to him that he had been told by Taylor he was to be his heir I shall not take upon me to animadvert upon this but certain it is that Johnson paid great attention to Taylor He now however said to me Sir I love him but I do not love him more my regard for him does not increase As it is said in the Apocrypha his talk is of bullocks five hundred seven I do not suppose he is very fond of my company five hundred eight His habits are by no means sufficiently clerical this he knows that I see and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual disapprobation I have no doubt that a good many sermons were composed for Taylor by Johnson At this time I found upon his table a part of one which he had newly begun to write and Concio pro Tayloro appears in one of his diaries When to these circumstances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and style in the collection which the Reverend mister Hayes has published with the significant title of Sermons left for publication by the Reverend John Taylor LL D our conviction will be complete five hundred nine I however would not have it thought that doctor Taylor though he could not write like Johnson as indeed who could did not sometimes compose sermons as good as those which we generally have from very respectable divines He showed me one with notes on the margin in Johnson s hand writing and I was present when he read another to Johnson that he might have his opinion of it and Johnson said it was very well These we may be sure were not Johnson s for he was above little arts or tricks of deception Johnson was by no means of opinion that every man of a learned profession should consider it as incumbent upon him or as necessary to his credit to appear as an authour When in the ardour of ambition for literary fame I regretted to him one day that an eminent Judge had nothing of it and therefore would leave no perpetual monument of himself to posterity five hundred ten Alas Sir said Johnson what a mass of confusion should we have if every Bishop and every Judge every Lawyer Physician and Divine were to write books I mentioned to Johnson a respectable person of a very strong mind who had little of that tenderness which is common to human nature as an instance of which when I suggested to him that he should invite his son who had been settled ten years in foreign parts five hundred eleven to come home and pay him a visit his answer was No no let him mind his business JOHNSON I do not agree with him Sir in this Getting money is not all a man s business to cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life In the evening Johnson being in very good spirits entertained us with several characteristical portraits I regret that any of them escaped my retention and diligence I found from experience that to collect my friend s conversation so as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavour it was necessary to write it down without delay To record his sayings after some distance of time was like preserving or pickling long kept and faded fruits or other vegetables which when in that state have little or nothing of their taste when fresh I shall present my readers with a series of what I gathered this evening from the Johnsonian garden My friend the late Earl of Corke had a great desire to maintain the literary character of his family five hundred twelve he was a genteel man but did not keep up the dignity of his rank He was so generally civil that nobody thanked him for it Did we not hear so much said of Jack Wilkes we should think more highly of his conversation Jack has great variety of talk Jack is a scholar and Jack has the manners of a gentleman five hundred thirteen But after hearing his name sounded from pole to pole as the phoenix of convivial felicity we are disappointed in his company He has always been at me but I would do Jack a kindness rather than not The contest is now over five hundred fourteen Garrick s gaiety of conversation has delicacy and elegance Foote makes you laugh more but Foote has the air of a buffoon paid for entertaining the company He indeed well deserves his hire five hundred fifteen Colley Cibber once consulted me as to one of his birth day Odes five hundred sixteen a long time before it was wanted I objected very freely to several passages Cibber lost patience and would not read his Ode to an end When we had done with criticism we walked over to Richardson s the authour of Clarissa and I wondered to find Richardson displeased that I did not treat Gibber with more respect Now Sir to talk of respect for a player smiling disdainfully BOSWELL There Sir you are always heretical you never will allow merit to a player five hundred seventeen JOHNSON Merit Sir what merit Do you respect a rope dancer or a ballad singer BOSWELL No Sir but we respect a great player as a man who can conceive lofty sentiments and can express them gracefully JOHNSON What Sir a fellow who claps a hump on his back and a lump on his leg and cries I am Richard the Third five hundred eighteen Nay Sir a ballad singer is a higher man for he does two things he repeats and he sings there is both recitation and musick in his performance the player only recites BOSWELL My dear Sir you may turn anything into ridicule I allow that a player of farce is not entitled to respect he does a little thing but he who can represent exalted characters and touch the noblest passions has very respectable powers and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the stage We must consider too that a great player does what very few are capable to do his art is a very rare faculty Who can repeat Hamlet s soliloquy To be or not to be as Garrick does it JOHNSON Any body may Jemmy there a boy about eight years old who was in the room will do it as well in a week five hundred nineteen BOSWELL No no Sir and as a proof of the merit of great acting and of the value which mankind set upon it Garrick has got a hundred thousand pounds JOHNSON Is getting a hundred thousand pounds a proof of excellence That has been done by a scoundrel commissary five hundred twenty This was most fallacious reasoning I was sure for once that I had the best side of the argument I boldly maintained the just distinction between a tragedian and a mere theatrical droll between those who rouse our terrour and pity and those who only make us laugh If said I Betterton and Foote were to walk into this room you would respect Betterton much more than Foote JOHNSON If Betterton were to walk into this room with Foote Foote would soon drive him out of it Foote Sir quatenus Foote has powers superiour to them all five hundred twenty one On Monday September twenty two when at breakfast I unguardedly said to doctor Johnson I wish I saw you and missus Macaulay five hundred twenty two together He grew very angry and after a pause while a cloud gathered on his brow he burst out No Sir you would not see us quarrel to make you sport Don t you know that it is very uncivil to pit five hundred twenty three two people against one another Then checking himself and wishing to be more gentle he added I do not say you should be hanged or drowned for this but it is very uncivil doctor Taylor thought him in the wrong and spoke to him privately of it but I afterwards acknowledged to Johnson that I was to blame for I candidly owned that I meant to express a desire to see a contest between missus Macaulay and him but then I knew how the contest would end so that I was to see him triumph JOHNSON Sir you cannot be sure how a contest will end and no man has a right to engage two people in a dispute by which their passions may be inflamed and they may part with bitter resentment against each other I would sooner keep company with a man from whom I must guard my pockets than with a man who contrives to bring me into a dispute with somebody that he may hear it This is the great fault of five hundred twenty four naming one of our friends endeavouring to introduce a subject upon which he knows two people in the company differ BOSWELL But he told me Sir he does it for instruction JOHNSON Whatever the motive be Sir the man who does so does very wrong He has no more right to instruct himself at such risk than he has to make two people fight a duel that he may learn how to defend himself He found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table five hundred twenty five Sir said he when a man is invited to dinner he is disappointed if he does not get something good I advised missus Thrale who has no card parties at her house to give sweet meats and such good things in an evening as are not commonly given and she would find company enough come to her for every body loves to have things which please the palate put in their way without trouble or preparation five hundred twenty six Such was his attention to the minutiae of life and manners He thus characterised the Duke of Devonshire five hundred twenty seven grandfather of the present representative of that very respectable family He was not a man of superiour abilities but he was a man strictly faithful to his word If for instance he had promised you an acorn and none had grown that year in his woods he would not have contented himself with that excuse he would have sent to Denmark for it So unconditional was he in keeping his word so high as to the point of honour This was a liberal testimony from the Tory Johnson to the virtue of a great Whig nobleman mister Burke s Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol on the affairs of America being mentioned Johnson censured the composition much five hundred twenty eight and he ridiculed the definition of a free government viz For any practical purpose it is what the people think so five hundred twenty nine I will let the King of France govern me on those conditions said he for it is to be governed just as I please And when doctor Taylor talked of a girl being sent to a parish workhouse and asked how much she could be obliged to work Why said Johnson as much as is reasonable and what is that as much as she thinks reasonable doctor Johnson obligingly proposed to carry me to see Islam a romantick scene now belonging to a family of the name of Port but formerly the seat of the Congreves five hundred thirty I suppose it is well described in some of the Tours Johnson described it distinctly and vividly at which I could not but express to him my wonder because though my eyes as he observed were better than his I could not by any means equal him in representing visible objects I said the difference between us in this respect was as that between a man who has a bad instrument but plays well on it and a man who has a good instrument on which he can play very imperfectly five hundred thirty one I recollect a very fine amphitheatre surrounded with hills covered with woods and walks neatly formed along the side of a rocky steep on the quarter next the house with recesses under projections of rock overshadowed with trees in one of which recesses we were told Congreve wrote his Old Bachelor five hundred thirty two We viewed a remarkable natural curiosity at Islam two rivers bursting near each other from the rock not from immediate springs but after having run for many miles under ground Plott in his History of Staffordshire five hundred thirty three gives an account of this curiosity but Johnson would not believe it though we had the attestation of the gardener who said he had put in corks where the river Manyfold sinks into the ground and had catched them in a net placed before one of the openings where the water bursts out Indeed such subterraneous courses of water are found in various parts of our globe five hundred thirty four Talking of doctor Johnson s unwillingness to believe extraordinary things five hundred thirty five I ventured to say Sir you come near Hume s argument against miracles That it is more probable witnesses should lie or be mistaken than that they should happen five hundred thirty six JOHNSON Why Sir Hume taking the proposition simply is right But the Christian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone but as connected with prophecies and with the doctrines in confirmation of which the miracles were wrought He repeated his observation that the differences among Christians are really of no consequence five hundred thirty seven For instance said he if a Protestant objects to a Papist You worship images the Papist can answer I do not insist on your doing it you may be a very good Papist without it I do it only as a help to my devotion I said the great article of Christianity is the revelation of immortality Johnson admitted it was In the evening a gentleman farmer who was on a visit at doctor Taylor s attempted to dispute with Johnson in favour of Mungo Campbell who shot Alexander Earl of Eglintoune five hundred thirty eight upon his having fallen when retreating from his Lordship who he believed was about to seize his gun as he had threatened to do He said he should have done just as Campbell did JOHNSON Whoever would do as Campbell did deserves to be hanged not that I could as a juryman have found him legally guilty of murder but I am glad they found means to convict him The gentleman farmer said A poor man has as much honour as a rich man and Campbell had that to defend Johnson exclaimed A poor man has no honour The English yeoman not dismayed proceeded Lord Eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon Campbell after being warned that Campbell would shoot him if he did Johnson who could not bear any thing like swearing five hundred thirty nine angrily replied He was not a damned fool he only thought too well of Campbell He did not believe Campbell would be such a damned scoundrel as to do so damned a thing His emphasis on damned accompanied with frowning looks reproved his opponent s want of decorum in his presence Talking of the danger of being mortified by rejection when making approaches to the acquaintance of the great I observed I am however generally for trying Nothing venture nothing have five hundred forty JOHNSON Very true Sir but I have always been more afraid of failing than hopeful of success And indeed though he had all just respect for rank no man ever less courted the favour of the great During this interview at Ashbourne Johnson seemed to be more uniformly social cheerful and alert than I had almost ever seen him He was prompt on great occasions and on small Taylor who praised every thing of his own to excess in short whose geese were all swans as the proverb says expatiated on the excellence of his bull dog which he told us was perfectly well shaped Johnson after examining the animal attentively thus repressed the vain glory of our host No Sir he is not well shaped for there is not the quick transition from the thickness of the fore part to the tenuity the thin part behind which a bull dog ought to have This tenuity was the only hard word that I heard him use during this interview and it will be observed he instantly put another expression in its place Taylor said a small bull dog was as good as a large one JOHNSON No Sir for in proportion to his size he has strength and your argument would prove that a good bull dog may be as small as a mouse It was amazing how he entered with perspicuity and keenness upon every thing that occurred in conversation Most men whom I know would no more think of discussing a question about a bull dog than of attacking a bull I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great subject of this work to be lost Though a small particular may appear trifling to some it will be relished by others while every little spark adds something to the general blaze and to please the true candid warm admirers of Johnson and in any degree increase the splendour of his reputation I bid defiance to the shafts of ridicule or even of malignity Showers of them have been discharged at my Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides yet it still sails unhurt along the stream of time and as an attendant upon Johnson Pursues the triumph and partakes the gale five hundred forty one One morning after breakfast when the sun shone bright we walked out together and pored five hundred forty two for some time with placid indolence upon an artificial water fall which doctor Taylor had made by building a strong dyke of stone across the river behind the garden five hundred forty three It was now somewhat obstructed by branches of trees and other rubbish which had come down the river and settled close to it Johnson partly from a desire to see it play more freely and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate at times the most inert and sluggish mortal took a long pole which was lying on a bank and pushed down several parcels of this wreck with painful assiduity while I stood quietly by wondering to behold the sage thus curiously employed and smiling with an humorous satisfaction each time when he carried his point He worked till he was quite out of breath and having found a large dead cat so heavy that he could not move it after several efforts Come said he throwing down the pole you shall take it now which I accordingly did and being a fresh man soon made the cat tumble over the cascade This may be laughed at as too trifling to record but it is a small characteristick trait in the Flemish picture which I give of my friend and in which therefore I mark the most minute particulars And let it be remembered that AEsop at play is one of the instructive apologues of antiquity I mentioned an old gentleman of our acquaintance whose memory was beginning to fail JOHNSON There must be a diseased mind where there is a failure of memory at seventy A man s head Sir must be morbid if he fails so soon five hundred forty four My friend being now himself sixty eight might think thus but I imagine that threescore and ten the Psalmist s period of sound human life in later ages may have a failure though there be no disease in the constitution Talking of Rochester s Poems he said he had given them to mister Steevens to castrate for the edition of the poets to which he was to write Prefaces doctor Taylor the only time I ever heard him say any thing witty five hundred forty five observed that if Rochester had been castrated himself his exceptionable poems would not have been written five hundred forty six I asked if Burnet had not given a good Life of Rochester JOHNSON We have a good Death there is not much Life five hundred forty seven I asked whether Prior s Poems were to be printed entire Johnson said they were I mentioned Lord Hailes s censure of Prior in his Preface to a collection of Sacred Poems by various hands published by him at Edinburgh a great many years ago where he mentions those impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious authour JOHNSON Sir Lord Hailes has forgot There is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdness If Lord Hailes thinks there is he must be more combustible than other people five hundred forty eight I instanced the tale of Paulo Purganti and his Wife JOHNSON Sir there is nothing there but that his wife wanted to be kissed when poor Paulo was out of pocket No Sir Prior is a lady s book No lady is ashamed to have it standing in her library The hypochondriack disorder being mentioned doctor Johnson did not think it so common as I supposed doctor Taylor said he is the same one day as another Burke and Reynolds are the same Beauclerk except when in pain is the same I am not so myself but this I do not mention commonly five hundred forty nine I complained of a wretched changefulness so that I could not preserve for any long continuance the same views of any thing It was most comfortable to me to experience in doctor Johnson s company a relief from this uneasiness His steady vigorous mind held firm before me those objects which my own feeble and tremulous imagination frequently presented in such a wavering state that my reason could not judge well of them doctor Johnson advised me to day to have as many books about me as I could that I might read upon any subject upon which I had a desire for instruction at the time What you read then said he you will remember but if you have not a book immediately ready and the subject moulds in your mind it is a chance if you again have a desire to study it He added If a man never has an eager desire for instruction he should prescribe a task for himself But it is better when a man reads from immediate inclination five hundred fifty He repeated a good many lines of Horace s Odes while we were in the chaise I remember particularly the Ode Eheu fugaces five hundred fifty one He said the dispute as to the comparative excellence of Homer or Virgil five hundred fifty two was inaccurate We must consider said he whether Homer was not the greatest poet though Virgil may have produced the finest poem Virgil was indebted to Homer for the whole invention of the structure of an epick poem and for many of his beauties He told me that Bacon was a favourite authour with him five hundred fifty three but he had never read his works till he was compiling the English Dictionary in which he said I might see Bacon very often quoted mister Seward recollects his having mentioned that a Dictionary of the English Language might be compiled from Bacon s writings alone five hundred fifty four and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of Bacon at least of his English works and writing the Life of that great man Had he executed this intention there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a most masterly manner Mallet s Life of Bacon has no inconsiderable merit as an acute and elegant dissertation relative to its subject but Mallet s mind was not comprehensive enough to embrace the vast extent of Lord Verulam s genius and research doctor Warburton therefore observed with witty justness that Mallet in his Life of Bacon had forgotten that he was a philosopher and if he should write the Life of the Duke of Marlborough which he had undertaken to do he would probably forget that he was a general five hundred fifty five 
7514-96429-0000	train-other-500	Wishing to be satisfied what degree of truth there was in a story which a friend of Johnson s and mine had told me to his disadvantage
none	none	 I mentioned it to him in direct terms and it was to this effect that a gentleman five hundred fifty six who had lived in great intimacy with him shewn him much kindness and even relieved him from a spunging house having afterwards fallen into bad circumstances 
7514-96429-0001	train-other-500	was one day when Johnson was at dinner with him seized for debt and carried to prison
none	none	 that Johnson sat still undisturbed and went on eating and drinking 
7514-96429-0002	train-other-500	upon which the gentleman s sister who was present could not suppress her indignation What Sir said she are you so unfeeling as not even to offer to go to my brother in his distress
7514-96429-0003	train-other-500	you who have been so much obliged to him And that Johnson answered Madam I owe him no obligation what he did for me he would have done for a dog
7514-96429-0004	train-other-500	Johnson assured me that the story was absolutely false but like a man conscious of being in the right and desirous of completely vindicating himself from such a charge
7514-96429-0005	train-other-500	he did not arrogantly rest on a mere denial and on his general character but proceeded thus
none	none	 Sir 
7514-96429-0006	train-other-500	I was very intimate with that gentleman and was once relieved by him from an arrest but I never was present when he was arrested never knew that he was arrested
7514-96429-0007	train-other-500	and I believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me I loved him much yet in talking of his general character I may have said though I do not remember that I ever did say so
7514-96429-0008	train-other-500	that as his generosity proceeded from no principle but was a part of his profusion he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend but I never applied this remark to any particular instance
7514-96429-0009	train-other-500	and certainly not to his kindness to me If a profuse man who does not value his money and gives a large sum to a whore
7514-96429-0010	train-other-500	gives half as much or an equally large sum to relieve a friend it cannot be esteemed as virtue
none	none	 This was all that I could say of that gentleman 
7514-96429-0011	train-other-500	and if said at all it must have been said after his death Sir I would have gone to the world s end to relieve him The remark about the dog if made by me was such a sally as might escape one when painting a man highly
none	none	 On Tuesday September twenty three Johnson was remarkably cordial to me It being necessary for me to return to Scotland soon I had fixed on the next day for my setting out 
7514-96429-0013	train-other-500	and I felt a tender concern at the thought of parting with him He had at this time frankly communicated to me many particulars which are inserted in this work in their proper places and once
7514-96429-0014	train-other-500	when I happened to mention that the expence of my jaunt would come to much more than I had computed he said Why Sir if the expence were to be an inconvenience you would have reason to regret it but if you have had the money to spend
7514-96429-0015	train-other-500	I know not that you could have purchased as much pleasure with it in any other way During this interview at Ashbourne Johnson and I frequently talked with wonderful pleasure of mere trifles
7514-96429-0016	train-other-500	which had occurred in our tour to the Hebrides for it had left a most agreeable and lasting impression upon his mind He found fault with me for using the phrase to make money
none	none	 Don t you see said he the impropriety of it To make money is to coin it you should say get money The phrase however is I think pretty current five hundred fifty seven But Johnson was at all times jealous of infractions upon the genuine English language and prompt to repress colloquial barbarisms such as pledging myself for undertaking line for department or branch as the civil line the banking line He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind five hundred fifty eight We may have an idea or image of a mountain a tree a building but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition 
7514-96429-0017	train-other-500	Yet we hear the sages of the law delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration and the first speakers in parliament entirely coinciding in the idea
7514-96429-0018	train-other-500	which has been ably stated by an honourable member or
none	none	 reprobating an idea unconstitutional and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country Johnson called this modern cant five hundred fifty nine I perceived that he pronounced the word heard as if spelt with a double e heerd instead of sounding it herd as is most usually done He said his reason was that if it was pronounced herd there would be a single exception 
7514-96429-0019	train-other-500	from the English pronunciation of the syllable ear and he thought it better not to have that exception He praised Grainger s Ode on Solitude in Dodsley s Collection
7514-96429-0020	train-other-500	and repeated with great energy the exordium
none	none	 O Solitude romantick maid Whether by nodding towers you tread Or haunt the desart s trackless gloom Or hover o er the yawning tomb 
7514-96429-0021	train-other-500	Or climb the Andes clifted side Or by the Nile s coy source abide Or starting from your half year s sleep From Hecla view the thawing deep
7514-96429-0022	train-other-500	Or at the purple dawn of day
none	none	 Tadnor s marble waste survey five hundred sixty observing This Sir is very noble In the evening our gentleman farmer and two others entertained themselves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle Johnson desired to have Let ambition fire thy mind five hundred sixty one played over again and appeared to give a patient attention to it though he owned to me that he was very insensible to the power of musick five hundred sixty two I told him that it affected me to such a degree as often to agitate my nerves painfully producing in my mind 
7514-96429-0023	train-other-500	alternate sensations of pathetick dejection so that I was ready to shed tears and of daring resolution so that I was inclined to rush into the thickest part of the battle Sir said he
7514-96429-0024	train-other-500	I should never hear it if it made me such a fool Much of the effect of musick I am satisfied is owing to the association of ideas That air which instantly and irresistibly excites in the Swiss
none	none	 when in a foreign land the maladie du pais 
7514-96429-0025	train-other-500	has I am told no intrinsick power of sound And I know from my own experience that Scotch reels though brisk make me melancholy because I used to hear them
7514-96429-0026	train-other-500	in my early years at a time when mister Pitt called for soldiers from the mountains of the north and numbers of brave Highlanders were going abroad never to return
none	none	 five hundred sixty three Whereas the airs in The Beggar s Opera 
7514-96429-0027	train-other-500	many of which are very soft never fail to render me gay because they are associated with the warm sensations and high spirits of London This evening
7514-96429-0028	train-other-500	while some of the tunes of ordinary composition were played with no great skill my frame was agitated and I was conscious of a generous attachment to doctor Johnson as my preceptor and friend
7514-96429-0029	train-other-500	mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man whom I should probably lose in a short time I thought I could defend him at the point of my sword
7514-96429-0030	train-other-500	My reverence and affection for him were in full glow I said to him My dear Sir we must meet every year if you don t quarrel with me JOHNSON Nay Sir you are more likely to quarrel with me than I with you
7514-96429-0031	train-other-500	My regard for you is greater almost than I have words to express but I do not choose to be always repeating it
none	none	 write it down in the first leaf of your pocket book and never doubt of it again I talked to him of misery being the doom of man in this life as displayed in his Vanity of Human Wishes five hundred sixty four Yet I observed that things were done upon the supposition of happiness grand houses were built fine gardens were made splendid places of publick amusement were contrived and crowded with company JOHNSON Alas Sir these are all only struggles for happiness When I first entered Ranelagh five hundred sixty five it gave an expansion and gay sensation to my mind such as I never experienced any where else But as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army and considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think but that the thoughts of each individual there would be distressing when alone This reflection was experimentally just The feeling of languor five hundred sixty six which succeeds the animation of gaiety is itself a very severe pain and when the mind is then vacant a thousand disappointments and vexations rush in and excruciate Will not many even of my fairest readers allow this to be true I suggested that being in love and flattered with hopes of success or having some favourite scheme in view for the next day might prevent that wretchedness of which we had been talking JOHNSON Why Sir it may sometimes be so as you suppose but my conclusion is in general but too true While Johnson and I stood in calm conference by ourselves in doctor Taylor s garden at a pretty late hour in a serene autumn night looking up to the heavens I directed the discourse to the subject of a future state My friend was in a placid and most benignant frame Sir said he I do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death but that the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually I ventured to ask him whether although the words of some texts of Scripture seemed strong in support of the dreadful doctrine of an eternity of punishment we might not hope that the denunciation was figurative and would not literally be executed JOHNSON Sir you are to consider the intention of punishment in a future state We have no reason to be sure that we shall then be no longer liable to offend against GOD We do not know that even the angels are quite in a state of security nay we know that some of them have fallen It may therefore perhaps be necessary in order to preserve both men and angels in a state of rectitude that they should have continually before them the punishment of those who have deviated from it but we may hope that by some other means a fall from rectitude may be prevented Some of the texts of Scripture upon this subject are as you observe indeed strong but they may admit of a mitigated interpretation He talked to me upon this awful and delicate question in a gentle tone and as if afraid to be decisive five hundred sixty seven After supper I accompanied him to his apartment and at my request he dictated to me an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty in an action in the Court of Session in Scotland five hundred sixty eight He had always been very zealous against slavery in every form in which I with all deference thought that he discovered a zeal without knowledge five hundred sixty nine Upon one occasion when in company with some very grave men at Oxford his toast was Here s to the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies five hundred seventy His violent prejudice against our West Indian and American settlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity five hundred seventy one Towards the conclusion of his Taxation no Tyranny he says how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes five hundred seventy two and in his conversation with mister Wilkes he asked Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn English five hundred seventy three That Trecothick could both speak and write good English is well known I myself was favoured with his correspondence concerning the brave Corsicans And that Beckford could speak it with a spirit of honest resolution even to his Majesty as his faithful Lord Mayor of London is commemorated by the noble monument erected to him in Guildhall five hundred seventy four The argument dictated by doctor Johnson was as follows It must be agreed that in most ages many countries have had part of their inhabitants in a state of slavery five hundred seventy five yet it may be doubted whether slavery can ever be supposed the natural condition of man It is impossible not to conceive that men in their original state were equal five hundred seventy six and very difficult to imagine how one would be subjected to another but by violent compulsion An individual may indeed forfeit his liberty by a crime but he cannot by that crime forfeit the liberty of his children five hundred seventy seven What is true of a criminal seems true likewise of a captive A man may accept life from a conquering enemy on condition of perpetual servitude but it is very doubtful whether he can entail that servitude on his descendants for no man can stipulate without commission for another The condition which he himself accepts his son or grandson perhaps would have rejected If we should admit what perhaps may with more reason be denied that there are certain relations between man and man which may make slavery necessary and just yet it can never be proved that he who is now suing for his freedom ever stood in any of those relations He is certainly subject by no law but that of violence to his present master who pretends no claim to his obedience but that he bought him from a merchant of slaves whose right to sell him never was examined It is said that according to the constitutions of Jamaica he was legally enslaved these constitutions are merely positive and apparently injurious to the rights of mankind because whoever is exposed to sale is condemned to slavery without appeal by whatever fraud or violence he might have been originally brought into the merchant s power In our own time Princes have been sold by wretches to whose care they were entrusted that they might have an European education but when once they were brought to a market in the plantations little would avail either their dignity or their wrongs The laws of Jamaica afford a Negro no redress His colour is considered as a sufficient testimony against him It is to be lamented that moral right should ever give way to political convenience But if temptations of interest are sometimes too strong for human virtue let us at least retain a virtue where there is no temptation to quit it In the present case there is apparent right on one side and no convenience on the other Inhabitants of this island can neither gain riches nor power by taking away the liberty of any part of the human species The sum of the argument is this No man is by nature the property of another The defendant is therefore by nature free The rights of nature must be some way forfeited before they can be justly taken away That the defendant has by any act forfeited the rights of nature we require to be proved and if no proof of such forfeiture can be given we doubt not but the justice of the court will declare him free I record doctor Johnson s argument fairly upon this particular case where perhaps he was in the right But I beg leave to enter my most solemn protest against his general doctrine with respect to the Slave Trade For I will resolutely say that his unfavourable notion of it was owing to prejudice and imperfect or false information The wild and dangerous attempt which has for some time been persisted in to obtain an act of our Legislature to abolish so very important and necessary a branch of commercial interest five hundred seventy eight must have been crushed at once had not the insignificance of the zealots who vainly took the lead in it made the vast body of Planters Merchants and others whose immense properties are involved in that trade reasonably enough suppose that there could be no danger The encouragement which the attempt has received excites my wonder and indignation and though some men of superiour abilities have supported it whether from a love of temporary popularity when prosperous or a love of general mischief when desperate my opinion is unshaken To abolish a status which in all ages GOD has sanctioned and man has continued would not only be robbery to an innumerable class of our fellow subjects but it would be extreme cruelty to the African Savages a portion of whom it saves from massacre or intolerable bondage in their own country and introduces into a much happier state of life especially now when their passage to the West Indies and their treatment there is humanely regulated To abolish that trade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind five hundred seventy nine Whatever may have passed elsewhere concerning it the HOUSE OF LORDS is wise and independent Intaminatis fulget honoribus Nec sumit aut ponit secures Arbitrio popularis aurae five hundred eighty I have read conversed and thought much upon the subject and would recommend to all who are capable of conviction an excellent Tract by my learned and ingenious friend John Ranby esquire entitled Doubts on the Abolition of the Slave Trade To mister Ranby s Doubts I will apply Lord Chancellor Hardwicke s expression in praise of a Scotch Law Book called Dirletons Doubts HIS Doubts said his Lordship are better than most people s Certainties five hundred eighty one When I said now to Johnson that I was afraid I kept him too late up No Sir said he I don t care though I sit all night with you five hundred eighty two This was an animated speech from a man in his sixty ninth year Had I been as attentive not to displease him as I ought to have been I know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled but I unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of Great Britain to tax America and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow subjects on the other side of the Atlantick five hundred eighty three I insisted that America might be very well governed and made to yield sufficient revenue by the means of influence five hundred eighty four as exemplified in Ireland while the people might be pleased with the imagination of their participating of the British constitution by having a body of representatives without whose consent money could not be exacted from them Johnson could not bear my thus opposing his avowed opinion which he had exerted himself with an extreme degree of heat to enforce and the violent agitation into which he was thrown while answering or rather reprimanding me alarmed me so that I heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the subject I myself however grew warm and the change was great from the calm state of philosophical discussion in which we had a little before been pleasingly employed I talked of the corruption of the British Parliament in which I alleged that any question however unreasonable or unjust might be carried by a venal majority and I spoke with high admiration of the Roman Senate as if composed of men sincerely desirous to resolve what they should think best for their country five hundred eighty five My friend would allow no such character to the Roman Senate and he maintained that the British Parliament was not corrupt and that there was no occasion to corrupt its members asserting that there was hardly ever any question of great importance before Parliament any question in which a man might not very well vote either upon one side or the other He said there had been none in his time except that respecting America We were fatigued by the contest which was produced by my want of caution and he was not then in the humour to slide into easy and cheerful talk It therefore so happened that we were after an hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed five hundred eighty six On Wednesday September twenty four I went into doctor Johnson s room before he got up and finding that the storm of the preceding night was quite laid I sat down upon his bed side and he talked with as much readiness and good humour as ever He recommended to me to plant a considerable part of a large moorish farm which I had purchased five hundred eighty seven and he made several calculations of the expence and profit for he delighted in exercising his mind on the science of numbers five hundred eighty eight He pressed upon me the importance of planting at the first in a very sufficient manner quoting the saying In bello non licet bis errare and adding this is equally true in planting I spoke with gratitude of doctor Taylor s hospitality and as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that Johnson visited him often I mentioned a little anecdote which had escaped my friend s recollection and at hearing which repeated he smiled One evening when I was sitting with him Frank delivered this message Sir doctor Taylor sends his compliments to you and begs you will dine with him to morrow He has got a hare My compliments said Johnson and I ll dine with him hare or rabbit After breakfast I departed and pursued my journey northwards five hundred eighty nine I took my post chaise from the Green Man a very good inn at Ashbourne the mistress of which a mighty civil gentlewoman courtseying very low presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house to which she had subjoined in her own hand writing an address in such singular simplicity of style that I have preserved it pasted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time and shall here insert it for the amusement of my readers M KILLINGLEY s duty waits upon mister Boswell is exceedingly obliged to him for this favour whenever he comes this way hopes for a continuance of the same Would mister Boswell name the house to his extensive acquaintance it would be a singular favour conferr d on one who has it not in her power to make any other return but her most grateful thanks and sincerest prayers for his happiness in time and in a blessed eternity Tuesday morn From this meeting at Ashbourne I derived a considerable accession to my Johnsonian store I communicated my original Journal to Sir William Forbes in whom I have always placed deserved confidence and what he wrote to me concerning it is so much to my credit as the biographer of Johnson that my readers will I hope grant me their indulgence for here inserting it five hundred ninety It is not once or twice going over it says Sir William that will satisfy me for I find in it a high degree of instruction as well as entertainment and I derive more benefit from doctor Johnson s admirable discussions than I should be able to draw from his personal conversation for I suppose there is not a man in the world to whom he discloses his sentiments so freely as to yourself I cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at Edensor inn close by Chatsworth to survey the magnificence of which I had gone a considerable way out of my road to Scotland The inn was then kept by a very jolly landlord whose name I think was Malton He happened to mention that the celebrated doctor Johnson had been in his house I inquired who this doctor Johnson was that I might hear mine host s notion of him Sir said he Johnson the great writer Oddity as they call him He s the greatest writer in England he writes for the ministry he has a correspondence abroad and lets them know what s going on five hundred ninety one My friend who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any embellishment five hundred ninety two as falsehood or fiction is too gently called laughed a good deal at this representation of himself mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Sept twenty nine seventeen seventy seven MY DEAR SIR By the first post I inform you of my safe arrival at my own house and that I had the comfort of finding my wife and children all in good health When I look back upon our late interview it appears to me to have answered expectation better than almost any scheme of happiness that I ever put in execution My Journal is stored with wisdom and wit five hundred ninety three and my memory is filled with the recollection of lively and affectionate feelings which now I think yield me more satisfaction than at the time when they were first excited I have experienced this upon other occasions I shall be obliged to you if you will explain it to me for it seems wonderful that pleasure should be more vivid at a distance than when near I wish you may find yourself in a humour to do me this favour but I flatter myself with no strong hope of it for I have observed that unless upon very serious occasions your letters to me are not answers to those which I write five hundred ninety four I then expressed much uneasiness that I had mentioned to him the name of the gentleman five hundred ninety five who had told me the story so much to his disadvantage the truth of which he had completely refuted for that my having done so might be interpreted as a breach of confidence and offend one whose society I valued therefore earnestly requesting that no notice might be taken of it to anybody till I should be in London and have an opportunity to talk it over with the gentleman To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR You will wonder or you have wondered why no letter has come from me What you wrote at your return had in it such a strain of cowardly caution as gave me no pleasure I could not well do what you wished I had no need to vex you with a refusal I have seen mister five hundred ninety six and as to him have set all right without any inconvenience so far as I know to you missus Thrale had forgot the story You may now be at ease And at ease I certainly wish you for the kindness that you showed in coming so long a journey to see me It was pity to keep you so long in pain but upon reviewing the matter I do not see what I could have done better than as I did I hope you found at your return my dear enemy five hundred ninety seven and all her little people quite well and had no reason to repent of your journey I think on it with great gratitude I was not well when you left me at the Doctor s and I grew worse yet I staid on and at Lichfield was very ill Travelling however did not make me worse and when I came to London I complied with a summons to go to Brighthelmston where I saw Beauclerk and staid three days Our CLUB has recommenced last Friday but I was not there Langton has another wench five hundred ninety eight missus Thrale is in hopes of a young brewer five hundred ninety nine They got by their trade last year a very large sum six hundred and their expenses are proportionate missus Williams s health is very bad And I have had for some time a very difficult and laborious respiration but I am better by purges abstinence and other methods I am yet however much behind hand in my health and rest doctor Blair s Sermons are now universally commended but let him think that I had the honour of first finding and first praising his excellencies I did not stay to add my voice to that of the publick six hundred one My dear friend let me thank you once more for your visit you did me great honour and I hope met with nothing that displeased you I staid long at Ashbourne not much pleased yet aukward at departing I then went to Lichfield where I found my friend at Stow hill six hundred two very dangerously diseased Such is life Let us try to pass it well whatever it be for there is surely something beyond it Well now I hope all is well write as soon as you can to dear Sir Your affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON London Nov twenty five seventeen seventy seven To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Nov twenty nine seventeen seventy seven My DEAR SIR This day s post has at length relieved me from much uneasiness by bringing me a letter from you I was indeed doubly uneasy on my own account and yours I was very anxious to be secured against any bad consequences from my imprudence in mentioning the gentleman s name who had told me a story to your disadvantage and as I could hardly suppose it possible that you would delay so long to make me easy unless you were ill I was not a little apprehensive about you You must not be offended when I venture to tell you that you appear to me to have been too rigid upon this occasion The cowardly caution which gave you no pleasure was suggested to me by a friend here to whom I mentioned the strange story and the detection of its falsity as an instance how one may be deceived by what is apparently very good authority But as I am still persuaded that as I might have obtained the truth without mentioning the gentleman s name it was wrong in me to do it I cannot see that you are just in blaming my caution But if you were ever so just in your disapprobation might you not have dealt more tenderly with me I went to Auchinleck about the middle of October and passed some time with my father very comfortably I am engaged in a criminal prosecution against a country schoolmaster for indecent behaviour to his female scholars There is no statute against such abominable conduct but it is punishable at common law I shall be obliged to you for your assistance in this extraordinary trial I ever am my dear Sir Your faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL About this time I wrote to Johnson giving him an account of the decision of the Negro cause by the court of Session which by those who hold even the mildest and best regulated slavery in abomination of which number I do not hesitate to declare that I am none should be remembered with high respect and to the credit of Scotland for it went upon a much broader ground than the case of Somerset which was decided in England six hundred three being truly the general question whether a perpetual obligation of service to one master in any mode should be sanctified by the law of a free country A negro then called Joseph Knight a native of Africa who having been brought to Jamaica in the usual course of the slave trade and purchased by a Scotch gentleman in that island had attended his master to Scotland where it was officiously suggested to him that he would be found entitled to his liberty without any limitation He accordingly brought his action in the course of which the advocates on both sides did themselves great honour mister Maclaurin has had the praise of Johnson for his argument six hundred four in favour of the negro and mister Macconochie distinguished himself on the same side by his ingenuity and extraordinary research mister Cullen on the part of the master discovered good information and sound reasoning in which he was well supported by mister James Ferguson remarkable for a manly understanding and a knowledge both of books and of the world But I cannot too highly praise the speech which mister Henry Dundas generously contributed to the cause of the sooty stranger mister Dundas s Scottish accent six hundred five which has been so often in vain obtruded as an objection to his powerful abilities in parliament was no disadvantage to him in his own country And I do declare that upon this memorable question he impressed me and I believe all his audience with such feelings as were produced by some of the most eminent orations of antiquity This testimony I liberally give to the excellence of an old friend with whom it has been my lot to differ very widely upon many political topicks yet I persuade myself without malice A great majority of the Lords of Session decided for the negro But four of their number the Lord President Lord Elliock Lord Monboddo and Lord Covington resolutely maintained the lawfulness of a status which has been acknowledged in all ages and countries and that when freedom flourished as in old Greece and Rome six hundred six To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR This is the time of the year in which all express their good wishes to their friends and I send mine to you and your family May your lives be long happy and good I have been much out of order but I hope do not grow worse The crime of the schoolmaster whom you are engaged to prosecute is very great and may be suspected to be too common In our law it would be a breach of the peace and a misdemeanour that is a kind of indefinite crime not capital but punishable at the discretion of the Court You cannot want matter all that needs to be said will easily occur mister Shaw six hundred seven the author of the Gaelick Grammar desires me to make a request for him to Lord Eglintoune that he may be appointed Chaplain to one of the new raised regiments All our friends are as they were little has happened to them of either good or bad missus Thrale ran a great black hair dressing pin into her eye but by great evacuation she kept it from inflaming and it is almost well Miss Reynolds has been out of order but is better missus Williams is in a very poor state of health If I should write on I should perhaps write only complaints and therefore I will content myself with telling you that I love to think on you and to hear from you and that I am dear Sir Yours faithfully SAM JOHNSON December twenty seven seventeen seventy seven To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Jan eight seventeen seventy eight DEAR SIR Your congratulations upon a new year are mixed with complaint mine must be so too My wife has for some time been very ill having been confined to the house these three months by a severe cold attended with alarming symptoms Here I gave a particular account of the distress which the person upon every account most dear to me suffered and of the dismal state of apprehension in which I now was adding that I never stood more in need of his consoling philosophy Did you ever look at a book written by Wilson a Scotchman under the Latin name of Volusenus according to the custom of literary men at a certain period It is entitled De Animi Tranquillitate six hundred eight I earnestly desire tranquillity Bona res quies but I fear I shall never attain it for when unoccupied I grow gloomy and occupation agitates me to feverishness I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR To a letter so interesting as your last it is proper to return some answer however little I may be disposed to write Your alarm at your lady s illness was reasonable and not disproportionate to the appearance of the disorder I hope your physical friend s conjecture is now verified and all fear of a consumption at an end a little care and exercise will then restore her London is a good air for ladies and if you bring her hither I will do for her what she did for me I will retire from my apartments for her accommodation six hundred nine Behave kindly to her and keep her cheerful You always seem to call for tenderness Know then that in the first month of the present year I very highly esteem and very cordially love you I hope to tell you this at the beginning of every year as long as we live and why should we trouble ourselves to tell or hear it oftener Tell Veronica Euphemia and Alexander that I wish them as well as their parents many happy years You have ended the negro s cause much to my mind Lord Auchinleck and dear Lord Hailes were on the side of liberty Lord Hailes s name reproaches me but if he saw my languid neglect of my own affairs he would rather pity than resent my neglect of his I hope to mend ut et mihi vivam et amicis I am dear Sir Your s affectionately SAM JOHNSON January twenty four seventeen seventy eight My service to my fellow traveller Joseph six hundred ten Johnson maintained a long and intimate friendship with mister Welch six hundred eleven who succeeded the celebrated Henry Fielding as one of his Majesty s Justices of the Peace for Westminster kept a regular office for the police six hundred twelve of that great district and discharged his important trust for many years faithfully and ably Johnson who had an eager and unceasing curiosity to know human life in all its variety told me that he attended mister Welch in his office for a whole winter to hear the examinations of the culprits but that he found an almost uniform tenor of misfortune wretchedness and profligacy mister Welch s health being impaired he was advised to try the effect of a warm climate and Johnson by his interest with mister Chamier six hundred thirteen procured him leave of absence to go to Italy and a promise that the pension or salary of two hundred pounds a year which Government allowed him six hundred fourteen should not be discontinued mister Welch accordingly went abroad accompanied by his daughter Anne a young lady of uncommon talents and literature TO SAUNDERS WELCH esquire AT THE ENGLISH COFFEE HOUSE ROME DEAR SIR To have suffered one of my best and dearest friends to pass almost two years in foreign countries without a letter has a very shameful appearance of inattention But the truth is that there was no particular time in which I had any thing particular to say and general expressions of good will I hope our long friendship is grown too solid to want Of publick affairs you have information from the news papers wherever you go for the English keep no secret and of other things missus Nollekens informs you My intelligence could therefore be of no use and Miss Nancy s letters made it unnecessary to write to you for information I was likewise for some time out of humour to find that motion and nearer approaches to the sun did not restore your health so fast as I expected Of your health the accounts have lately been more pleasing and I have the gratification of imaging to myself a length of years which I hope you have gained and of which the enjoyment will be improved by a vast accession of images and observations which your journeys and various residence have enabled you to make and accumulate You have travelled with this felicity almost peculiar to yourself that your companion is not to part from you at your journey s end but you are to live on together to help each other s recollection and to supply each other s omissions The world has few greater pleasures than that which two friends enjoy in tracing back at some distant time those transactions and events through which they have passed together One of the old man s miseries is that he cannot easily find a companion able to partake with him of the past You and your fellow traveller have this comfort in store that your conversation will be not easily exhausted one will always be glad to say what the other will always be willing to hear That you may enjoy this pleasure long your health must have your constant attention I suppose you purpose to return this year There is no need of haste do not come hither before the height of summer that you may fall gradually into the inconveniences of your native clime July seems to be the proper month August and September will prepare you for the winter After having travelled so far to find health you must take care not to lose it at home and I hope a little care will effectually preserve it Miss Nancy has doubtless kept a constant and copious journal She must not expect to be welcome when she returns without a great mass of information Let her review her journal often and set down what she finds herself to have omitted that she may trust to memory as little as possible for memory is soon confused by a quick succession of things and she will grow every day less confident of the truth of her own narratives unless she can recur to some written memorials If she has satisfied herself with hints instead of full representations let her supply the deficiencies now while her memory is yet fresh and while her father s memory may help her If she observes this direction she will not have travelled in vain for she will bring home a book with which she may entertain herself to the end of life If it were not now too late I would advise her to note the impression which the first sight of any thing new and wonderful made upon her mind Let her now set her thoughts down as she can recollect them for faint as they may already be they will grow every day fainter Perhaps I do not flatter myself unreasonably when I imagine that you may wish to know something of me I can gratify your benevolence with no account of health The hand of time or of disease is very heavy upon me I pass restless and uneasy nights harassed with convulsions of my breast and flatulencies at my stomach and restless nights make heavy days But nothing will be mended by complaints and therefore I will make an end When we meet we will try to forget our cares and our maladies and contribute as we can to the chearfulness of each other If I had gone with you I believe I should have been better but I do not know that it was in my power I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Feb three seventeen seventy eight This letter while it gives admirable advice how to travel to the best advantage and will therefore be of very general use is another eminent proof of Johnson s warm and affectionate heart six hundred fifteen TO doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb twenty six seventeen seventy eight MY DEAR SIR Why I have delayed for near a month to thank you for your last affectionate letter I cannot say for my mind has been in better health these three weeks than for some years past I believe I have evaded till I could send you a copy of Lord Hailes s opinion on the negro s cause which he wishes you to read and correct any errours that there may be in the language for says he we live in a critical though not a learned age and I seek to screen myself under the shield of Ajax I communicated to him your apology for keeping the sheets of his Annals so long He says I am sorry to see that doctor Johnson is in a state of languor Why should a sober Christian neither an enthusiast nor a fanatick be very merry or very sad I envy his Lordship s comfortable constitution but well do I know that languor and dejection will afflict the best however excellent their principles I am in possession of Lord Hailes s opinion in his own hand writing and have had it for some time My excuse then for procrastination must be that I wanted to have it copied and I have now put that off so long that it will be better to bring it with me than send it as I shall probably get you to look at it sooner when I solicit you in person My wife who is I thank GOD a good deal better is much obliged to you for your very polite and courteous offer of your apartment but if she goes to London it will be best for her to have lodgings in the more airy vicinity of Hyde Park I however doubt much if I shall be able to prevail with her to accompany me to the metropolis for she is so different from you and me that she dislikes travelling and she is so anxious about her children that she thinks she should be unhappy if at a distance from them She therefore wishes rather to go to some country place in Scotland where she can have them with her I purpose being in London about the twentieth of next month as I think it creditable to appear in the House of Lords as one of Douglas s Counsel in the great and last competition between Duke Hamilton and him six hundred sixteen I am sorry poor missus Williams is so ill though her temper is unpleasant she has always been polite and obliging to me I wish many happy years to good mister Levett who I suppose holds his usual place at your breakfast table six hundred seventeen I ever am my dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL TO THE SAME Edinburgh Feb twenty eight seventeen seventy eight MY DEAR SIR You are at present busy amongst the English poets preparing for the publick instruction and entertainment Prefaces biographical and critical It will not therefore be out of season to appeal to you for the decision of a controversy which has arisen between a lady and me concerning a passage in Parnell That poet tells us that his Hermit quitted his cell to know the world by sight To find if books or swains report it right For yet by swains alone the world he knew Whose feet came wand ring o er the nightly dew I maintain that there is an inconsistency here for as the Hermit s notions of the world were formed from the reports both of books and swains he could not justly be said to know by swains alone Be pleased to judge between us and let us have your reasons six hundred eighteen What do you say to Taxation no Tyranny now after Lord North s declaration or confession or whatever else his conciliatory speech should be called six hundred nineteen I never differed from you in politicks but upon two points the Middlesex Election six hundred twenty and the Taxation of the Americans by the British Houses of Representatives six hundred twenty one There is a charm in the word Parliament so I avoid it As I am a steady and a warm Tory I regret that the King does not see it to be better for him to receive constitutional supplies from his American subjects by the voice of their own assemblies where his Royal Person is represented than through the medium of his British subjects I am persuaded that the power of the Crown which I wish to increase would be greater when in contact with all its dominions than if the rays of regal bounty six hundred twenty two were to shine upon America through that dense and troubled body a modern British Parliament But enough of this subject for your angry voice at Ashbourne six hundred twenty three upon it still sounds aweful in my mind s ears six hundred twenty four I ever am my dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL TO THE SAME Edinburgh March twelve seventeen seventy eight MY DEAR SIR The alarm of your late illness distressed me but a few hours for on the evening of the day that it reached me I found it contradicted in The London Chronicle which I could depend upon as authentick concerning you mister Strahan being the printer of it I did not see the paper in which the approaching extinction of a bright luminary was announced Sir William Forbes told me of it and he says he saw me so uneasy that he did not give me the report in such strong terms as he read it He afterwards sent me a letter from mister Langton to him which relieved me much I am however not quite easy as I have not heard from you and now I shall not have that comfort before I see you for I set out for London to morrow before the post comes in I hope to be with you on Wednesday morning and I ever am with the highest veneration my dear Sir your much obliged faithful and affectionate Humble servant JAMES BOSWELL On Wednesday March eighteen I arrived in London and was informed by good mister Francis that his master was better and was gone to mister Thrale s at Streatham to which place I wrote to him begging to know when he would be in town He was not expected for some time but next day having called on doctor Taylor in Dean s yard Westminster I found him there and was told he had come to town for a few hours He met me with his usual kindness but instantly returned to the writing of something on which he was employed when I came in and on which he seemed much intent Finding him thus engaged I made my visit very short and had no more of his conversation except his expressing a serious regret that a friend of ours six hundred twenty five was living at too much expence considering how poor an appearance he made If said he a man has splendour from his expence if he spends his money in pride or in pleasure he has value but if he lets others spend it for him which is most commonly the case he has no advantage from it On Friday March twenty I found him at his own house sitting with missus Williams and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me six hundred twenty six was now appropriated to a charitable purpose missus Desmoulins six hundred twenty seven and I think her daughter and a Miss Carmichael being all lodged in it Such was his humanity and such his generosity that missus Desmoulins herself told me he allowed her half a guinea a week Let it be remembered that this was above a twelfth part of his pension His liberality indeed was at all periods of his life very remarkable mister Howard of Lichfield at whose father s house Johnson had in his early years been kindly received told me that when he was a boy at the Charter House his father wrote to him to go and pay a visit to mister Samuel Johnson which he accordingly did and found him in an upper room of poor appearance Johnson received him with much courteousness and talked a great deal to him as to a school boy of the course of his education and other particulars When he afterwards came to know and understand the high character of this great man he recollected his condescension with wonder He added that when he was going away mister Johnson presented him with half a guinea and this said mister Howard was at a time when he probably had not another We retired from missus Williams to another room Tom Davies soon after joined us He had now unfortunately failed in his circumstances and was much indebted to doctor Johnson s kindness for obtaining for him many alleviations of his distress six hundred twenty eight After he went away Johnson blamed his folly in quitting the stage by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year I said I believed it was owing to Churchill s attack upon him He mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone six hundred twenty nine JOHNSON I believe so too Sir But what a man is he who is to be driven from the stage by a line Another line would have driven him from his shop I told him that I was engaged as Counsel at the bar of the House of Commons to oppose a road bill in the county of Stirling and asked him what mode he would advise me to follow in addressing such an audience JOHNSON Why Sir you must provide yourself with a good deal of extraneous matter which you are to produce occasionally so as to fill up the time for you must consider that they do not listen much If you begin with the strength of your cause it may be lost before they begin to listen When you catch a moment of attention press the merits of the question upon them He said as to one point of the merits that he thought it would be a wrong thing to deprive the small landholders of the privilege of assessing themselves for making and repairing the high roads it was destroying a certain portion of liberty without a good reason which was always a bad thing When I mentioned this observation next day to mister Wilkes he pleasantly said What does he talk of liberty Liberty is as ridiculous in his mouth as Religion in mine mister Wilkes s advice as to the best mode of speaking at the bar of the House of Commons was not more respectful towards the senate than that of doctor Johnson Be as impudent as you can as merry as you can and say whatever comes uppermost Jack Lee six hundred thirty is the best heard there of any Counsel and he is the most impudent dog and always abusing us In my interview with doctor Johnson this evening I was quite easy quite as his companion upon which I find in my Journal the following reflection So ready is my mind to suggest matter for dissatisfaction that I felt a sort of regret that I was so easy I missed that aweful reverence with which I used to contemplate mister SAMUEL JOHNSON in the complex magnitude of his literary moral and religious character I have a wonderful superstitious love of mystery when perhaps the truth is that it is owing to the cloudy darkness of my own mind I should be glad that I am more advanced in my progress of being so that I can view doctor Johnson with a steadier and clearer eye My dissatisfaction to night was foolish Would it not be foolish to regret that we shall have less mystery in a future state That we now see in six hundred thirty one a glass darkly but shall then see face to face This reflection which I thus freely communicate will be valued by the thinking part of my readers who may have themselves experienced a similar state of mind He returned next day to Streatham to mister Thrale s where as mister Strahan once complained to me he was in a great measure absorbed from the society of his old friends six hundred thirty two I was kept in London by business and wrote to him on the twenty seventh that a separation from him for a week when we were so near was equal to a separation for a year when we were at four hundred miles distance I went to Streatham on Monday March thirty Before he appeared missus Thrale made a very characteristical remark I do not know for certain what will please doctor Johnson but I know for certain that it will displease him to praise any thing even what he likes extravagantly six hundred thirty three At dinner he laughed at querulous declamations against the age on account of luxury six hundred thirty four increase of London scarcity of provisions and other such topicks Houses said he will be built till rents fall and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was six hundred thirty five I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous story told me by an old man who had been a passenger with me in the stage coach to day missus Thrale having taken occasion to allude to it in talking to me called it The story told you by the old woman Now Madam said I give me leave to catch you in the fact it was not an old woman but an old man whom I mentioned as having told me this I presumed to take an opportunity in presence of Johnson of shewing this lively lady how ready she was unintentionally to deviate from exact authenticity of narration six hundred thirty six Thomas a Kempis he observed must be a good book as the world has opened its arms to receive it It is said to have been printed in one language or other as many times as there have been months since it first came out six hundred thirty seven I always was struck with this sentence in it Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be six hundred thirty eight He said I was angry with Hurd about Cowley for having published a selection of his works but upon better consideration I think there is no impropriety in a man s publishing as much as he chooses of any authour if he does not put the rest out of the way A man for instance may print the Odes of Horace alone He seemed to be in a more indulgent humour than when this subject was discussed between him and mister Murphy six hundred thirty nine When we were at tea and coffee there came in Lord Trimlestown in whose family was an ancient Irish peerage but it suffered by taking the generous side in the troubles of the last century six hundred forty He was a man of pleasing conversation and was accompanied by a young gentleman his son I mentioned that I had in my possession the Life of Sir Robert Sibbald the celebrated Scottish antiquary and founder of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh in the original manuscript in his own handwriting and that it was I believed the most natural and candid account of himself that ever was given by any man As an instance he tells that the Duke of Perth then Chancellor of Scotland pressed him very much to come over to the Roman Catholick faith that he resisted all his Grace s arguments for a considerable time till one day he felt himself as it were instantaneously convinced and with tears in his eyes ran into the Duke s arms and embraced the ancient religion that he continued very steady in it for some time and accompanied his Grace to London one winter and lived in his household that there he found the rigid fasting prescribed by the church very severe upon him that this disposed him to reconsider the controversy and having then seen that he was in the wrong he returned to Protestantism I talked of some time or other publishing this curious life missus THRALE I think you had as well let alone that publication To discover such weakness exposes a man when he is gone JOHNSON Nay it is an honest picture of human nature How often are the primary motives of our greatest actions as small as Sibbald s for his re conversion six hundred forty one missus THRALE But may they not as well be forgotten JOHNSON No Madam a man loves to review his own mind That is the use of a diary or journal six hundred forty two LORD TRIMLESTOWN True Sir As the ladies love to see themselves in a glass so a man likes to see himself in his journal BOSWELL A very pretty allusion JOHNSON Yes indeed BOSWELL And as a lady adjusts her dress before a mirror a man adjusts his character by looking at his journal I next year found the very same thought in Atterbury s Funeral Sermon on Lady Cutts where having mentioned her Diary he says In this glass she every day dressed her mind This is a proof of coincidence and not of plagiarism for I had never read that sermon before Next morning while we were at breakfast Johnson gave a very earnest recommendation of what he himself practised with the utmost conscientiousness I mean a strict attention to truth even in the most minute particulars Accustom your children said he constantly to this if a thing happened at one window and they when relating it say that it happened at another do not let it pass but instantly check them you do not know where deviation from truth will end BOSWELL It may come to the door and when once an account is at all varied in one circumstance it may by degrees be varied so as to be totally different from what really happened Our lively hostess whose fancy was impatient of the rein fidgeted at this and ventured to say Nay this is too much If mister Johnson should forbid me to drink tea I would comply as I should feel the restraint only twice a day but little variations in narrative must happen a thousand times a day if one is not perpetually watching JOHNSON Well Madam and you ought to be perpetually watching It is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying that there is so much falsehood in the world six hundred forty three In his review of doctor Warton s Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope Johnson has given the following salutary caution upon this subject Nothing but experience could evince the frequency of false information or enable any man to conceive that so many groundless reports should be propagated as every man of eminence may hear of himself Some men relate what they think as what they know some men of confused memories and habitual inaccuracy ascribe to one man what belongs to another and some talk on without thought or care A few men are sufficient to broach falsehoods which are afterwards innocently diffused by successive relaters six hundred forty four Had he lived to read what Sir John Hawkins and missus Piozzi have related concerning himself how much would he have found his observation illustrated He was indeed so much impressed with the prevalence of falsehood voluntary or unintentional that I never knew any person who upon hearing an extraordinary circumstance told discovered more of the incredulus odi six hundred forty five He would say with a significant look and decisive tone It is not so Do not tell this again six hundred forty six He inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance against the slightest degrees of falsehood the effect of which as Sir Joshua Reynolds observed to me has been that all who were of his school are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy which they would not have possessed in the same degree if they had not been acquainted with Johnson six hundred forty seven Talking of ghosts he said It is wonderful that five thousand years have now elapsed since the creation of the world and still it is undecided whether or not there has ever been an instance of the spirit of any person appearing after death All argument is against it but all belief is for it six hundred forty eight He said John Wesley s conversation is good six hundred forty nine but he is never at leisure He is always obliged to go at a certain hour six hundred fifty This is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk as I do On Friday April three I dined with him in London in a company six hundred fifty one where were present several eminent men whom I shall not name but distinguish their parts in the conversation by different letters F I have been looking at this famous antique marble dog of mister Jennings valued at a thousand guineas said to be Alcibiades s dog JOHNSON His tail then must be docked That was the mark of Alcibiades s dog six hundred fifty two E A thousand guineas The representation of no animal whatever is worth so much at this rate a dead dog would indeed be better than a living lion JOHNSON Sir it is not the worth of the thing but of the skill in forming it which is so highly estimated Every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers that shews man he can do what he thought he could not do is valuable The first man who balanced a straw upon his nose six hundred fifty three Johnson who rode upon three horses at a time six hundred fifty four in short all such men deserved the applause of mankind not on account of the use of what they did but of the dexterity which they exhibited BOSWELL Yet a misapplication of time and assiduity is not to be encouraged Addison in one of his Spectators commends the judgement of a King who as a suitable reward to a man that by long perseverance had attained to the art of throwing a barleycorn through the eye of a needle gave him a bushel of barley JOHNSON He must have been a King of Scotland where barley is scarce F One of the most remarkable antique figures of an animal is the boar at Florence JOHNSON The first boar that is well made in marble should be preserved as a wonder When men arrive at a facility of making boars well then the workmanship is not of such value but they should however be preserved as examples and as a greater security for the restoration of the art should it be lost E We hear prodigious six hundred fifty five complaints at present of emigration six hundred fifty six I am convinced that emigration makes a country more populous J That sounds very much like a paradox E Exportation of men like exportation of all other commodities makes more be produced JOHNSON But there would be more people were there not emigration provided there were food for more E No leave a few breeders and you ll have more people than if there were no emigration JOHNSON Nay Sir it is plain there will be more people if there are more breeders Thirty cows in good pasture will produce more calves than ten cows provided they have good bulls E There are bulls enough in Ireland JOHNSON smiling So Sir I should think from your argument BOSWELL You said exportation of men like exportation of other commodities makes more be produced But a bounty is given to encourage the exportation of corn six hundred fifty seven and no bounty is given for the exportation of men though indeed those who go gain by it R But the bounty on the exportation of corn is paid at home E That s the same thing JOHNSON No Sir R A man who stays at home gains nothing by his neighbours emigrating BOSWELL I can understand that emigration may be the cause that more people may be produced in a country but the country will not therefore be the more populous for the people issue from it It can only be said that there is a flow of people It is an encouragement to have children to know that they can get a living by emigration R Yes if there were an emigration of children under six years of age But they don t emigrate till they could earn their livelihood in some way at home C It is remarkable that the most unhealthy countries where there are the most destructive diseases such as Egypt and Bengal are the most populous JOHNSON Countries which are the most populous have the most destructive diseases That is the true state of the proposition C Holland is very unhealthy yet it is exceedingly populous JOHNSON I know not that Holland is unhealthy But its populousness is owing to an influx of people from all other countries Disease cannot be the cause of populousness for it not only carries off a great proportion of the people but those who are left are weakened and unfit for the purposes of increase R mister E I don t mean to flatter but when posterity reads one of your speeches in Parliament it will be difficult to believe that you took so much pains knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect that not one vote would be gained by it six hundred fifty eight E Waiving your compliment to me I shall say in general that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to speak well in Parliament A man who has vanity speaks to display his talents and if a man speaks well he gradually establishes a certain reputation and consequence in the general opinion which sooner or later will have its political reward Besides though not one vote is gained a good speech has its effect Though an act which has been ably opposed passes into a law yet in its progress it is modelled it is softened in such a manner that we see plainly the Minister has been told that the Members attached to him are so sensible of its injustice or absurdity from what they have heard that it must be altered six hundred fifty nine JOHNSON And Sir there is a gratification of pride Though we cannot out vote them we will out argue them They shall not do wrong without its being shown both to themselves and to the world E The House of Commons is a mixed body I except the Minority which I hold to be pure smiling but I take the whole House It is a mass by no means pure but neither is it wholly corrupt though there is a large proportion of corruption in it There are many members who generally go with the Minister who will not go all lengths There are many honest well meaning country gentleman who are in parliament only to keep up the consequence of their families Upon most of these a good speech will have influence JOHNSON We are all more or less governed by interest But interest will not make us do every thing In a case which admits of doubt we try to think on the side which is for our interest and generally bring ourselves to act accordingly But the subject must admit of diversity of colouring it must receive a colour on that side In the House of Commons there are members enough who will not vote what is grossly unjust or absurd No Sir there must always be right enough or appearance of right to keep wrong in countenance BOSWELL There is surely always a majority in parliament who have places or who want to have them and who therefore will be generally ready to support government without requiring any pretext E True Sir that majority will always follow Quo clamor vocat et turba faventium six hundred sixty BOSWELL Well now let us take the common phrase Place hunters I thought they had hunted without regard to any thing just as their huntsmen the Minister leads looking only to the prey six hundred sixty one J But taking your metaphor you know that in hunting there are few so desperately keen as to follow without reserve Some do not choose to leap ditches and hedges and risk their necks or gallop over steeps or even to dirty themselves in bogs and mire BOSWELL I am glad there are some good quiet moderate political hunters E I believe in any body of men in England I should have been in the Minority I have always been in the Minority P The House of Commons resembles a private company How seldom is any man convinced by another s argument passion and pride rise against it R What would be the consequence if a Minister sure of a majority in the House of Commons should resolve that there should be no speaking at all upon his side E He must soon go out That has been tried but it was found it would not do E The Irish language is not primitive it is Teutonick a mixture of the northern tongues it has much English in it JOHNSON It may have been radically Teutonick but English and High Dutch have no similarity to the eye though radically the same Once when looking into Low Dutch I found in a whole page only one word similar to English stroem like stream and it signified tide E I remember having seen a Dutch Sonnet in which I found this word roesnopies Nobody would at first think that this could be English but when we enquire we find roes rose and nopie knob so we have rosebuds JOHNSON I have been reading Thicknesse s Travels which I think are entertaining BOSWELL What Sir a good book JOHNSON Yes Sir to read once I do not say you are to make a study of it and digest it and I believe it to be a true book in his intention All travellers generally mean to tell truth though Thicknesse observes upon Smollet s account of his alarming a whole town in France by firing a blunderbuss six hundred sixty two and frightening a French nobleman till he made him tie on his portmanteau six hundred sixty three that he would be loth to say Smollet had told two lies in one page but he had found the only town in France where these things could have happened six hundred sixty four Travellers must often be mistaken In every thing except where mensuration can be applied they may honestly differ There has been of late a strange turn in travellers to be displeased six hundred sixty five E From the experience which I have had and I have had a great deal I have learnt to think better of mankind six hundred sixty six JOHNSON From my experience I have found them worse in commercial dealings more disposed to cheat than I had any notion of but more disposed to do one another good than I had conceived six hundred sixty seven J Less just and more beneficent JOHNSON And really it is wonderful considering how much attention is necessary for men to take care of themselves and ward off immediate evils which press upon them it is wonderful how much they do for others As it is said of the greatest liar that he tells more truth than falsehood so it may be said of the worst man that he does more good than evil six hundred sixty eight BOSWELL Perhaps from experience men may be found happier than we suppose JOHNSON No Sir the more we enquire we shall find men the less happy P As to thinking better or worse of mankind from experience some cunning people will not be satisfied unless they have put men to the test as they think There is a very good story told of Sir Godfrey Kneller in his character of a Justice of the peace A gentleman brought his servant before him upon an accusation of having stolen some money from him but it having come out that he had laid it purposely in the servant s way in order to try his honesty Sir Godfrey sent the master to prison six hundred sixty nine JOHNSON To resist temptation once is not a sufficient proof of honesty If a servant indeed were to resist the continued temptation of silver lying in a window as some people let it lye when he is sure his master does not know how much there is of it he would give a strong proof of honesty But this is a proof to which you have no right to put a man You know humanly speaking there is a certain degree of temptation which will overcome any virtue Now in so far as you approach temptation to a man you do him an injury and if he is overcome you share his guilt P And when once overcome it is easier for him to be got the better of again BOSWELL Yes you are his seducer you have debauched him I have known a man six hundred seventy resolved to put friendship to the test by asking a friend to lend him money merely with that view when he did not want it JOHNSON That is very wrong Sir Your friend may be a narrow man and yet have many good qualities narrowness may be his only fault Now you are trying his general character as a friend by one particular singly in which he happens to be defective when in truth his character is composed of many particulars E I understand the hogshead of claret which this society was favoured with by our friend the Dean six hundred seventy one is nearly out I think he should be written to to send another of the same kind Let the request be made with a happy ambiguity of expression so that we may have the chance of his sending it also as a present JOHNSON I am willing to offer my services as secretary on this occasion P As many as are for doctor Johnson being secretary hold up your hands Carried unanimously BOSWELL He will be our Dictator JOHNSON No the company is to dictate to me I am only to write for wine and I am quite disinterested as I drink none I shall not be suspected of having forged the application I am no more than humble scribe E Then you shall pre scribe BOSWELL Very well The first play of words to day J No no the bulls in Ireland JOHNSON Were I your Dictator you should have no wine It would be my business cavere ne quid detrimenti Respublica caperet and wine is dangerous Rome was ruined by luxury smiling E If you allow no wine as Dictator you shall not have me for your master of horse On Saturday April four I drank tea with Johnson at doctor Taylor s where he had dined He entertained us with an account of a tragedy written by a doctor Kennedy not the Lisbon physician The catastrophe of it said he was that a King who was jealous of his Queen with his prime minister castrated himself six hundred seventy two This tragedy was actually shewn about in manuscript to several people and amongst others to mister Fitzherbert who repeated to me two lines of the Prologue Our hero s fate we have but gently touch d The fair might blame us if it were less couch d It is hardly to be believed what absurd and indecent images men will introduce into their writings without being sensible of the absurdity and indecency I remember Lord Orrery told me that there was a pamphlet written against Sir Robert Walpole the whole of which was an allegory on the PHALLICK OBSCENITY The Duchess of Buckingham asked Lord Orrery who this person was He answered he did not know She said she would send to mister Pulteney who she supposed could inform her So then to prevent her from making herself ridiculous Lord Orrery sent her Grace a note in which he gave her to understand what was meant He was very silent this evening and read in a variety of books suddenly throwing down one and taking up another He talked of going to Streatham that night TAYLOR You ll be robbed if you do or you must shoot a highwayman six hundred seventy three Now I would rather be robbed than do that I would not shoot a highwayman JOHNSON But I would rather shoot him in the instant when he is attempting to rob me than afterwards swear against him at the Old Bailey to take away his life after he has robbed me six hundred seventy four I am surer I am right in the one case than in the other I may be mistaken as to the man when I swear I cannot be mistaken if I shoot him in the act Besides we feel less reluctance reluctance to take away a man s life when we are heated by the injury than to do it at a distance of time by an oath after we have cooled BOSWELL So Sir you would rather act from the motive of private passion than that of publick advantage JOHNSON Nay Sir when I shoot the highwayman I act from both BOSWELL Very well very well There is no catching him JOHNSON At the same time one does not know what to say For perhaps one may a year after hang himself from uneasiness for having shot a man six hundred seventy five Few minds are fit to be trusted with so great a thing BOSWELL Then Sir you would not shoot him JOHNSON But I might be vexed afterwards for that too six hundred seventy six Thrale s carriage not having come for him as he expected I accompanied him some part of the way home to his own house I told him that I had talked of him to mister Dunning six hundred seventy seven a few days before and had said that in his company we did not so much interchange conversation as listen to him and that Dunning observed upon this One is always willing to listen to doctor Johnson to which I answered That is a great deal from you Sir Yes Sir said Johnson a great deal indeed Here is a man willing to listen to whom the world is listening all the rest of the year BOSWELL I think Sir it is right to tell one man of such a handsome thing which has been said of him by another It tends to increase benevolence JOHNSON Undoubtedly it is right Sir six hundred seventy eight On Tuesday April seven I breakfasted with him at his house He said nobody was content I mentioned to him a respectable person six hundred seventy nine in Scotland whom he knew and I asserted that I really believed he was always content JOHNSON No Sir he is not content with the present he has always some new scheme some new plantation something which is future You know he was not content as a widower for he married again BOSWELL But he is not restless JOHNSON Sir he is only locally at rest A chymist is locally at rest but his mind is hard at work This gentleman has done with external exertions It is too late for him to engage in distant projects BOSWELL He seems to amuse himself quite well to have his attention fixed and his tranquillity preserved by very small matters I have tried this but it would not do with me JOHNSON laughing No Sir it must be born with a man to be contented to take up with little things Women have a great advantage that they may take up with little things without disgracing themselves a man cannot except with fiddling Had I learnt to fiddle I should have done nothing else six hundred eighty BOSWELL Pray Sir did you ever play on any musical instrument JOHNSON No Sir I once bought me a flagelet but I never made out a tune BOSWELL A flagelet Sir so small an instrument six hundred eighty one I should have liked to hear you play on the violoncello That should have been your instrument JOHNSON Sir I might as well have played on the violoncello as another but I should have done nothing else No Sir a man would never undertake great things could he be amused with small I once tried knotting Dempster s sister undertook to teach me but I could not learn it six hundred eighty two BOSWELL So Sir it will be related in pompous narrative Once for his amusement he tried knotting nor did this Hercules disdain the distaff JOHNSON Knitting of stockings is a good amusement As a freeman of Aberdeen six hundred eighty three I should be a knitter of stockings He asked me to go down with him and dine at mister Thrale s at Streatham to which I agreed I had lent him An Account of Scotland in seventeen oh two written by a man of various enquiry an English chaplain to a regiment stationed there JOHNSON It is sad stuff Sir miserably written as books in general then were There is now an elegance of style universally diffused six hundred eighty four No man now writes so ill as Martin s Account of the Hebrides is written A man could not write so ill if he should try Set a merchant s clerk now to write and he ll do better six hundred eighty five He talked to me with serious concern of a certain female friend s laxity of narration and inattention to truth I am as much vexed said he at the ease with which she hears it mentioned to her as at the thing itself I told her Madam you are contented to hear every day said to you what the highest of mankind have died for rather than bear You know Sir the highest of mankind have died rather than bear to be told they had uttered a falsehood Do talk to her of it six hundred eighty six I am weary BOSWELL Was not doctor John Campbell a very inaccurate man in his narrative Sir He once told me that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a sitting six hundred eighty seven JOHNSON Why Sir I do not know that Campbell ever lied with pen and ink but you could not entirely depend on any thing he told you in conversation if there was fact mixed with it However I loved Campbell he was a solid orthodox man he had a reverence for religion Though defective in practice he was religious in principle and he did nothing grossly wrong that I have heard six hundred eighty eight I told him that I had been present the day before when missus Montagu the literary lady six hundred eighty nine sat to Miss Reynolds for her picture and that she said she had bound up mister Gibbon s History without the last two offensive chapters six hundred ninety for that she thought the book so far good as it gave in an elegant manner the substance of the bad writers medii aevi which the late Lord Lyttelton advised her to read JOHNSON Sir she has not read them she shews none of this impetuosity to me she does not know Greek and I fancy knows little Latin She is willing you should think she knows them but she does not say she does six hundred ninety one BOSWELL mister Harris who was present agreed with her JOHNSON Harris was laughing at her Sir Harris is a sound sullen scholar he does not like interlopers Harris however is a prig and a bad prig six hundred ninety two I looked into his book six hundred ninety three and thought he did not understand his own system BOSWELL He says plain things in a formal and abstract way to be sure but his method is good for to have clear notions upon any subject we must have recourse to analytick arrangement JOHNSON Sir it is what every body does whether they will or no But sometimes things may be made darker by definition I see a cow I define her Animal quadrupes ruminans cornutum But a goat ruminates and a cow may have no horns Cow is plainer BOSWELL I think doctor Franklin s definition of Man a good one A tool making animal JOHNSON But many a man never made a tool and suppose a man without arms he could not make a tool Talking of drinking wine he said I did not leave off wine because I could not bear it I have drunk three bottles of port without being the worse for it University College has witnessed this six hundred ninety four BOSWELL Why then Sir did you leave it off JOHNSON Why Sir because it is so much better for a man to be sure that he is never to be intoxicated never to lose the power over himself six hundred ninety five I shall not begin to drink wine again till I grow old and want it BOSWELL I think Sir you once said to me that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life JOHNSON It is a diminution of pleasure to be sure but I do not say a diminution of happiness There is more happiness in being rational BOSWELL But if we could have pleasure always should not we be happy The greatest part of men would compound for pleasure JOHNSON Supposing we could have pleasure always an intellectual man would not compound for it The greatest part of men would compound because the greatest part of men are gross BOSWELL I allow there may be greater pleasure than from wine I have had more pleasure from your conversation I have indeed I assure you I have JOHNSON When we talk of pleasure we mean sensual pleasure When a man says he had pleasure with a woman he does not mean conversation but something of a very different nature Philosophers tell you that pleasure is contrary to happiness Gross men prefer animal pleasure So there are men who have preferred living among savages Now what a wretch must he be who is content with such conversation as can be had among savages You may remember an officer at Fort Augustus six hundred ninety six who had served in America told us of a woman whom they were obliged to bind in order to get her back from savage life BOSWELL She must have been an animal a beast JOHNSON Sir she was a speaking cat I mentioned to him that I had become very weary in a company where I heard not a single intellectual sentence except that a man who had been settled ten years in Minorca was become a much inferiour man to what he was in London because a man s mind grows narrow in a narrow place JOHNSON A man s mind grows narrow in a narrow place whose mind is enlarged only because he has lived in a large place but what is got by books and thinking is preserved in a narrow place as well as in a large place A man cannot know modes of life as well in Minorca as in London but he may study mathematicks as well in Minorca BOSWELL I don t know Sir if you had remained ten years in the Isle of colonel you would not have been the man that you now are JOHNSON Yes Sir if I had been there from fifteen to twenty five but not if from twenty five to thirty five BOSWELL I own Sir the spirits which I have in London make me do every thing with more readiness and vigour I can talk twice as much in London as any where else six hundred ninety seven Of Goldsmith he said He was not an agreeable companion for he talked always for fame six hundred ninety eight A man who does so never can be pleasing The man who talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you An eminent friend six hundred ninety nine of ours is not so agreeable as the variety of his knowledge would otherwise make him because he talks partly from ostentation Soon after our arrival at Thrale s I heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another to go to doctor Johnson I wondered what this could mean I afterwards learnt that it was to give her a Bible which he had brought from London as a present to her He was for a considerable time occupied in reading Memoires de Fontenelle leaning and swinging upon the low gate into the court without his hat I looked into Lord Kames s Sketches of the History of Man and mentioned to doctor Johnson his censure of Charles the Fifth for celebrating his funeral obsequies in his life time which I told him I had been used to think a solemn and affecting act seven hundred JOHNSON Why Sir a man may dispose his mind to think so of that act of Charles but it is so liable to ridicule that if one man out of ten thousand laughs at it he ll make the other nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine laugh too I could not agree with him in this Sir John Pringle had expressed a wish that I would ask doctor Johnson s opinion what were the best English sermons for style I took an opportunity to day of mentioning several to him Atterbury JOHNSON Yes Sir one of the best BOSWELL Tillotson JOHNSON Why not now I should not advise a preacher at this day to imitate Tillotson s style though I don t know I should be cautious of objecting to what has been applauded by so many suffrages South is one of the best if you except his peculiarities and his violence and sometimes coarseness of language Seed has a very fine style but he is not very theological Jortin s sermons are very elegant Sherlock s style too is very elegant though he has not made it his principal study And you may add Smallridge All the latter preachers have a good style Indeed nobody now talks much of style every body composes pretty well seven hundred one There are no such unharmonious periods as there were a hundred years ago I should recommend doctor Clarke s sermons were he orthodox seven hundred two However it is very well known where he was not orthodox which was upon the doctrine of the Trinity as to which he is a condemned heretick so one is aware of it BOSWELL I like Ogden s Sermons on Prayer very much both for neatness of style and subtilty of reasoning JOHNSON I should like to read all that Ogden has written seven hundred three BOSWELL What I wish to know is what sermons afford the best specimen of English pulpit eloquence JOHNSON We have no sermons addressed to the passions that are good for any thing if you mean that kind of eloquence A CLERGYMAN whose name I do not recollect Were not Dodd s sermons addressed to the passions JOHNSON They were nothing Sir be they addressed to what they may At dinner missus Thrale expressed a wish to go and see Scotland JOHNSON Seeing Scotland Madam is only seeing a worse England It is seeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk Seeing the Hebrides indeed is seeing quite a different scene Our poor friend mister Thomas Davies seven hundred four was soon to have a benefit at Drury lane theatre as some relief to his unfortunate circumstances We were all warmly interested for his success and had contributed to it However we thought there was no harm in having our joke when he could not be hurt by it I proposed that he should be brought on to speak a Prologue upon the occasion and I began to mutter fragments of what it might be as that when now grown old he was obliged to cry Poor Tom s a cold seven hundred five that he owned he had been driven from the stage by a Churchill but that this was no disgrace for a Churchill seven hundred six had beat the French that he had been satyrised as mouthing a sentence as curs mouth a bone but he was now glad of a bone to pick Nay said Johnson I would have him to say Mad Tom is come to see the world again seven hundred seven He and I returned to town in the evening Upon the road I endeavoured to maintain in argument that a landed gentleman is not under any obligation to reside upon his estate and that by living in London he does no injury to his country JOHNSON Why Sir he does no injury to his country in general because the money which he draws from it gets back again in circulation but to his particular district his particular parish he does an injury All that he has to give away is not given to those who have the first claim to it And though I have said that the money circulates back it is a long time before that happens Then Sir a man of family and estate ought to consider himself as having the charge of a district over which he is to diffuse civility and happiness seven hundred eight Next day I found him at home in the morning He praised Delany s Observations on Swift said that his book and Lord Orrery s might both be true though one viewed Swift more and the other less favourably and that between both we might have a complete notion of Swift seven hundred nine Talking of a man s resolving to deny himself the use of wine from moral and religious considerations he said He must not doubt about it When one doubts as to pleasure we know what will be the conclusion I now no more think of drinking wine than a horse does The wine upon the table is no more for me than for the dog that is under the table seven hundred ten On Thursday April nine I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds s with the Bishop of saint Asaph seven hundred eleven doctor Shipley mister Allan Ramsay seven hundred twelve mister Gibbon mister Cambridge and mister Langton mister Ramsay had lately returned from Italy and entertained us with his observations upon Horace s villa which he had examined with great care I relished this much as it brought fresh into my mind what I had viewed with great pleasure thirteen years before The Bishop doctor Johnson and mister Cambridge joined with mister Ramsay in recollecting the various lines in Horace relating to the subject Horace s journey to Brundusium being mentioned Johnson observed that the brook which he describes is to be seen now exactly as at that time seven hundred thirteen and that he had often wondered how it happened that small brooks such as this kept the same situation for ages notwithstanding earthquakes by which even mountains have been changed and agriculture which produces such a variation upon the surface of the earth CAMBRIDGE A Spanish writer has this thought in a poetical conceit After observing that most of the solid structures of Rome are totally perished while the Tiber remains the same he adds Lo que era Firme huio solamente Lo Fugitivo permanece y dura seven hundred fourteen JOHNSON Sir that is taken from Janus Vitalis seven hundred fifteen immota labescunt Et quae perpetuo sunt agitata manent seven hundred sixteen The Bishop said it appeared from Horace s writings that he was a cheerful contented man JOHNSON We have no reason to believe that my Lord Are we to think Pope was happy because he says so in his writings We see in his writings what he wished the state of his mind to appear doctor Young who pined for preferment talks with contempt of it in his writings and affects to despise every thing that he did not despise seven hundred seventeen BISHOP OF saint ASAPH He was like other chaplains looking for vacancies but that is not peculiar to the clergy I remember when I was with the army seven hundred eighteen after the battle of Lafeldt the officers seriously grumbled that no general was killed CAMBRIDGE We may believe Horace more when he says Romae Tibur amem ventosus Tibure Romam seven hundred nineteen than when he boasts of his consistency Me constare mihi scis et decedere tristem Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam seven hundred twenty BOSWELL How hard is it that man can never be at rest RAMSAY It is not in his nature to be at rest When he is at rest he is in the worst state that he can be in for he has nothing to agitate him He is then like the man in the Irish song There liv d a young man in Ballinacrazy Who wanted a wife for to make him un ai sy Goldsmith being mentioned Johnson observed that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged That he once complained to him in ludicrous terms of distress Whenever I write any thing the publick make a point to know nothing about it but that his Traveller brought him into high reputation seven hundred twenty one LANGTON There is not one bad line in that poem not one of Dryden s careless verses SIR JOSHUA I was glad to hear Charles Fox say it was one of the finest poems in the English language LANGTON Why was you glad You surely had no doubt of this before JOHNSON No the merit of The Traveller is so well established that mister Fox s praise cannot augment it nor his censure diminish it seven hundred twenty two SIR JOSHUA But his friends may suspect they had too great a partiality for him JOHNSON Nay Sir the partiality of his friends was always against him It was with difficulty we could give him a hearing Goldsmith had no settled notions upon any subject so he talked always at random seven hundred twenty three It seemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind and see what would become of it He was angry too when catched in an absurdity but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute I remember Chamier seven hundred twenty four after talking with him for some time said Well I do believe he wrote this poem himself and let me tell you that is believing a great deal Chamier once asked him what he meant by slow the last word in the first line of The Traveller Remote unfriended melancholy slow Did he mean tardiness of locomotion Goldsmith who would say something without consideration answered Yes I was sitting by and said No Sir you do not mean tardiness of locomotion you mean that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude seven hundred twenty five Chamier believed then that I had written the line as much as if he had seen me write it seven hundred twenty six Goldsmith however was a man who whatever he wrote did it better than any other man could do He deserved a place in Westminster Abbey and every year he lived would have deserved it better He had indeed been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge He transplanted it from one place to another and it did not settle in his mind so he could not tell what was in his own books We talked of living in the country JOHNSON No wise man will go to live in the country unless he has something to do which can be better done in the country For instance if he is to shut himself up for a year to study a science it is better to look out to the fields than to an opposite wall Then if a man walks out in the country there is nobody to keep him from walking in again but if a man walks out in London he is not sure when he shall walk in again A great city is to be sure the school for studying life and The proper study of mankind is man as Pope observes seven hundred twenty seven BOSWELL I fancy London is the best place for society though I have heard that the very first society of Paris is still beyond any thing that we have here JOHNSON Sir I question if in Paris such a company as is sitting round this table could be got together in less than half a year They talk in France of the felicity of men and women living together the truth is that there the men are not higher than the women they know no more than the women do and they are not held down in their conversation by the presence of women seven hundred twenty eight RAMSAY Literature is upon the growth it is in its spring in France Here it is rather passee JOHNSON Literature was in France long before we had it Paris was the second city for the revival of letters Italy had it first to be sure What have we done for literature equal to what was done by the Stephani and others in France Our literature came to us through France Caxton printed only two books Chaucer and Gower that were not translations from the French and Chaucer we know took much from the Italians No Sir if literature be in its spring in France it is a second spring it is after a winter We are now before the French in literature seven hundred twenty nine but we had it long after them In England any man who wears a sword and a powdered wig is ashamed to be illiterate seven hundred thirty I believe it is not so in France Yet there is probably a great deal of learning in France because they have such a number of religious establishments so many men who have nothing else to do but to study I do not know this but I take it upon the common principles of chance Where there are many shooters some will hit We talked of old age seven hundred thirty one Johnson now in his seventieth year said It is a man s own fault it is from want of use if his mind grows torpid in old age The Bishop asked if an old man does not lose faster than he gets JOHNSON I think not my Lord if he exerts himself One of the company rashly observed that he thought it was happy for an old man that insensibility comes upon him JOHNSON with a noble elevation and disdain No Sir I should never be happy by being less rational BISHOP OF saint ASAPH Your wish then Sir is Greek gaeraskein didaskomenos seven hundred thirty two JOHNSON Yes my Lord His Lordship mentioned a charitable establishment in Wales where people were maintained and supplied with every thing upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labour and he said they grew quite torpid for want of property JOHNSON They have no object for hope Their condition cannot be better It is rowing without a port One of the company asked him the meaning of the expression in Juvenal unius lacertae JOHNSON I think it clear enough as much ground as one may have a chance to find a lizard upon Commentators have differed as to the exact meaning of the expression by which the Poet intended to enforce the sentiment contained in the passage where these words occur It is enough that they mean to denote even a very small possession provided it be a man s own Est aliquid quocunque loco quocunque recessu Unius sese dominum fecisse lacertae seven hundred thirty three This season there was a whimsical fashion in the newspapers of applying Shakspeare s words to describe living persons well known in the world which was done under the title of Modern Characters from Shakspeare many of which were admirably adapted The fancy took so much that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet seven hundred thirty four Somebody said to Johnson across the table that he had not been in those characters Yes said he I have I should have been sorry to be left out He then repeated what had been applied to him I must borrow GARAGANTUA S mouth seven hundred thirty five Miss Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this he was obliged to explain it to her which had something of an aukward and ludicrous effect Why Madam it has a reference to me as using big words which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them Garagantua is the name of a giant in Rabelais BOSWELL But Sir there is another amongst them for you He would not flatter Neptune for his trident Or Jove for his power to thunder seven hundred thirty six JOHNSON There is nothing marked in that No Sir Garagantua is the best Notwithstanding this ease and good humour when I a little while afterwards repeated his sarcasm on Kenrick seven hundred thirty seven which was received with applause he asked Who said that and on my suddenly answering Garagantua he looked serious which was a sufficient indication that he did not wish it to be kept up When we went to the drawing room there was a rich assemblage Besides the company who had been at dinner there were mister Garrick mister Harris of Salisbury doctor Percy doctor Burney Honourable missus Cholmondeley Miss Hannah More c c After wandering about in a kind of pleasing distraction for some time I got into a corner with Johnson Garrick and Harris GARRICK to Harris Pray Sir have you read Potter s Aeschylus HARRIS Yes and think it pretty GARRICK to Johnson And what think you Sir of it JOHNSON I thought what I read of it verbiage seven hundred thirty eight but upon mister Harris s recommendation I will read a play To mister Harris Don t prescribe two mister Harris suggested one I do not remember which JOHNSON We must try its effect as an English poem that is the way to judge of the merit of a translation Translations are in general for people who cannot read the original I mentioned the vulgar saying seven hundred thirty nine that Pope s Homer was not a good representation of the original JOHNSON Sir it is the greatest work of the kind that has ever been produced seven hundred forty BOSWELL The truth is it is impossible perfectly to translate poetry seven hundred forty one In a different language it may be the same tune but it has not the same tone Homer plays it on a bassoon Pope on a flagelet HARRIS I think Heroick poetry is best in blank verse yet it appears that rhyme is essential to English poetry from our deficiency in metrical quantities In my opinion the chief excellence of our language is numerous prose JOHNSON Sir William Temple was the first writer who gave cadence to English prose seven hundred forty two Before his time they were careless of arrangement and did not mind whether a sentence ended with an important word or an insignificant word or with what part of speech it was concluded mister Langton who now had joined us commended Clarendon JOHNSON He is objected to for his parentheses his involved clauses and his want of harmony But he is supported by his matter It is indeed owing to a plethory of matter that his style is so faulty seven hundred forty three Every substance smiling to mister Harris seven hundred forty four has so many accidents To be distinct we must talk analytically If we analyse language we must speak of it grammatically if we analyse argument we must speak of it logically GARRICK Of all the translations that ever were attempted I think Elphinston s Martial the most extraordinary seven hundred forty five He consulted me upon it who am a little of an epigrammatist myself you know I told him freely You don t seem to have that turn I asked him if he was serious and finding he was I advised him against publishing Why his translation is more difficult to understand than the original I thought him a man of some talents but he seems crazy in this JOHNSON Sir you have done what I had not courage to do But he did not ask my advice and I did not force it upon him to make him angry with me GARRICK But as a friend Sir JOHNSON Why such a friend as I am with him no GARRICK But if you see a friend going to tumble over a precipice JOHNSON That is an extravagant case Sir You are sure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice but in the other case I should hurt his vanity and do him no good He would not take my advice His brother in law Strahan sent him a subscription of fifty pounds and said he would send him fifty more if he would not publish GARRICK What Is Strahan a good judge of an Epigram Is not he rather an obtuse man eh JOHNSON Why Sir he may not be a judge of an Epigram but you see he is a judge of what is not an Epigram BOSWELL It is easy for you mister Garrick to talk to an authour as you talked to Elphinston you who have been so long the manager of a theatre rejecting the plays of poor authours You are an old Judge who have often pronounced sentence of death You are a practiced surgeon who have often amputated limbs and though this may have been for the good of your patients they cannot like you Those who have undergone a dreadful operation are not very fond of seeing the operator again GARRICK Yes I know enough of that There was a reverend gentleman mister Hawkins who wrote a tragedy the SIEGE of something seven hundred forty six which I refused HARRIS So the siege was raised JOHNSON Ay he came to me and complained and told me that Garrick said his play was wrong in the concoction Now what is the concoction of a play Here Garrick started and twisted himself and seemed sorely vexed for Johnson told me he believed the story was true GARRICK I I I said first concoction seven hundred forty seven JOHNSON smiling Well he left out first And Rich seven hundred forty eight he said refused him in false English he could shew it under his hand GARRICK He wrote to me in violent wrath for having refused his play Sir this is growing a very serious and terrible affair I am resolved to publish my play I will appeal to the world and how will your judgement appear I answered Sir notwithstanding all the seriousness and all the terrours I have no objection to your publishing your play and as you live at a great distance Devonshire I believe if you will send it to me I will convey it to the press seven hundred forty nine I never heard more of it ha ha ha On Friday April ten I found Johnson at home in the morning We resumed the conversation of yesterday He put me in mind of some of it which had escaped my memory and enabled me to record it more perfectly than I otherwise could have done He was much pleased with my paying so great attention to his recommendation in seventeen sixty three the period when our acquaintance began that I should keep a journal seven hundred fifty and I could perceive he was secretly pleased to find so much of the fruit of his mind preserved and as he had been used to imagine and say that he always laboured when he said a good thing seven hundred fifty one it delighted him on a review to find that his conversation teemed with point and imagery seven hundred fifty two I said to him You were yesterday Sir in remarkably good humour seven hundred fifty three but there was nothing to offend you nothing to produce irritation or violence There was no bold offender There was not one capital conviction It was a maiden assize You had on your white gloves He found fault with our friend Langton for having been too silent Sir said I you will recollect that he very properly took up Sir Joshua for being glad that Charles Fox had praised Goldsmith s Traveller and you joined him JOHNSON Yes Sir I knocked Fox on the head without ceremony Reynolds is too much under Fox and Burke at present He is under the Fox star and the Irish constellation He is always under some planet seven hundred fifty four BOSWELL There is no Fox star JOHNSON But there is a dog star BOSWELL They say indeed a fox and a dog are the same animal I reminded him of a gentleman who missus Cholmondeley said was first talkative from affectation and then silent from the same cause that he first thought I shall be celebrated as the liveliest man in every company and then all at once O it is much more respectable to be grave and look wise He has reversed the Pythagorean discipline by being first talkative and then silent He reverses the course of Nature too he was first the gay butterfly and then the creeping worm Johnson laughed loud and long at this expansion and illustration of what he himself had told me We dined together with mister Scott now Sir William Scott seven hundred fifty five his Majesty s Advocate General at his chambers in the Temple nobody else there The company being small Johnson was not in such spirits as he had been the preceding day and for a considerable time little was said At last he burst forth Subordination is sadly broken down in this age No man now has the same authority which his father had except a gaoler No master has it over his servants it is diminished in our colleges nay in our grammar schools BOSWELL What is the cause of this Sir JOHNSON Why the coming in of the Scotch laughing sarcastically BOSWELL That is to say things have been turned topsy turvey But your serious cause JOHNSON Why Sir there are many causes the chief of which is I think the great increase of money No man now depends upon the Lord of a Manour when he can send to another country and fetch provisions The shoe black at the entry of my court does not depend on me I can deprive him but of a penny a day which he hopes somebody else will bring him and that penny I must carry to another shoe black seven hundred fifty six so the trade suffers nothing I have explained in my Journey to the Hebrides how gold and silver destroy feudal subordination seven hundred fifty seven But besides there is a general relaxation of reverence No son now depends upon his father as in former times Paternity used to be considered as of itself a great thing which had a right to many claims That is in general reduced to very small bounds My hope is that as anarchy produces tyranny this extreme relaxation will produce freni strictio seven hundred fifty eight Talking of fame for which there is so great a desire I observed how little there is of it in reality compared with the other objects of human attention Let every man recollect and he will be sensible how small a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of Shakspeare Voltaire or any of the most celebrated men that have ever lived or are now supposed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world Let this be extracted and compressed into what a narrow space will it go seven hundred fifty nine I then slily introduced mister Garrick s fame and his assuming the airs of a great man seven hundred sixty JOHNSON Sir it is wonderful how little Garrick assumes No Sir Garrick fortunam reverenter habet seven hundred sixty one Consider Sir celebrated men such as you have mentioned have had their applause at a distance but Garrick had it dashed in his face sounded in his ears and went home every night with the plaudits of a thousand in his cranium Then Sir Garrick did not find but made his way to the tables the levees and almost the bed chambers of the great Then Sir Garrick had under him a numerous body of people who from fear of his power and hopes of his favour and admiration of his talents were constantly submissive to him And here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profession Garrick has made a player a higher character SCOTT And he is a very sprightly writer too JOHNSON Yes Sir and all this supported by great wealth of his own acquisition If all this had happened to me I should have had a couple of fellows with long poles walking before me to knock down every body that stood in the way Consider if all this had happened to Cibber or Quin seven hundred sixty two they d have jumped over the moon Yet Garrick speaks to us seven hundred sixty three smiling BOSWELL And Garrick is a very good man a charitable man JOHNSON Sir a liberal man He has given away more money than any man in England seven hundred sixty four There may be a little vanity mixed but he has shewn that money is not his first object BOSWELL Yet Foote used to say of him that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action but turning the corner of a street he met with the ghost of a halfpenny which frightened him JOHNSON Why Sir that is very true too for I never knew a man of whom it could be said with less certainty to day what he will do to morrow than Garrick it depends so much on his humour at the time SCOTT I am glad to hear of his liberality He has been represented as very saving JOHNSON With his domestick saving we have nothing to do I remember drinking tea with him long ago when Peg Woffington made it and he grumbled at her for making it too strong seven hundred sixty five He had then begun to feel money in his purse and did not know when he should have enough of it seven hundred sixty six On the subject of wealth the proper use of it and the effects of that art which is called oeconomy he observed It is wonderful to think how men of very large estates not only spend their yearly incomes but are often actually in want of money It is clear they have not value for what they spend Lord Shelburne seven hundred sixty seven told me that a man of high rank who looks into his own affairs may have all that he ought to have all that can be of any use or appear with any advantage for five thousand pounds a year Therefore a great proportion must go in waste and indeed this is the case with most people whatever their fortune is BOSWELL I have no doubt Sir of this But how is it What is waste JOHNSON Why Sir breaking bottles and a thousand other things Waste cannot be accurately told though we are sensible how destructive it is OEconomy on the one hand by which a certain income is made to maintain a man genteely and waste on the other by which on the same income another man lives shabbily cannot be defined It is a very nice thing as one man wears his coat out much sooner than another we cannot tell how We talked of war JOHNSON Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier or not having been at sea BOSWELL Lord Mansfield does not JOHNSON Sir if Lord Mansfield were in a company of General Officers and Admirals who have been in service he would shrink he d wish to creep under the table BOSWELL No he d think he could try them all JOHNSON Yes if he could catch them but they d try him much sooner No Sir were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both present in any company and Socrates to say Follow me and hear a lecture on philosophy and Charles laying his hand on his sword to say Follow me and dethrone the Czar a man would be ashamed to follow Socrates Sir the impression is universal seven hundred sixty eight yet it is strange As to the sailor when you look down from the quarter deck to the space below you see the utmost extremity of human misery such crouding such filth such stench seven hundred sixty nine BOSWELL Yet sailors are happy JOHNSON They are happy as brutes are happy with a piece of fresh meat with the grossest sensuality But Sir the profession of soldiers and sailors has the dignity of danger Mankind reverence those who have got over fear seven hundred seventy which is so general a weakness SCOTT But is not courage mechanical and to be acquired JOHNSON Why yes Sir in a collective sense Soldiers consider themselves only as parts of a great machine seven hundred seventy one SCOTT We find people fond of being sailors JOHNSON I cannot account for that any more than I can account for other strange perversions of imagination His abhorrence of the profession of a sailor was uniformly violent seven hundred seventy two but in conversation he always exalted the profession of a soldier And yet I have in my large and various collection of his writings a letter to an eminent friend in which he expresses himself thus My god son called on me lately He is weary and rationally weary of a military life If you can place him in some other state I think you may increase his happiness and secure his virtue A soldier s time is passed in distress and danger or in idleness and corruption Such was his cool reflection in his study seven hundred seventy three but whenever he was warmed and animated by the presence of company he like other philosophers whose minds are impregnated with poetical fancy caught the common enthusiasm for splendid renown seven hundred seventy four He talked of mister Charles Fox of whose abilities he thought highly but observed that he did not talk much at our CLUB I have heard mister Gibbon remark that mister Fox could not be afraid of doctor Johnson yet he certainly was very shy of saying any thing in doctor Johnson s presence seven hundred seventy five mister Scott now quoted what was said of Alcibiades by a Greek poet seven hundred seventy six to which Johnson assented He told us that he had given missus Montagu a catalogue of all Daniel Defoe s works of imagination most if not all of which as well as of his other works he now enumerated allowing a considerable share of merit to a man who bred a tradesman had written so variously and so well Indeed his Robinson Crusoe is enough of itself to establish his reputation seven hundred seventy seven He expressed great indignation at the imposture of the Cocklane Ghost and related with much satisfaction how he had assisted in detecting the cheat and had published an account of it in the news papers seven hundred seventy eight Upon this subject I incautiously offended him by pressing him with too many questions and he shewed his displeasure I apologised saying that I asked questions in order to be instructed and entertained I repaired eagerly to the fountain but that the moment he gave me a hint the moment he put a lock upon the well I desisted But Sir said he that is forcing one to do a disagreeable thing and he continued to rate me Nay Sir said I when you have put a lock upon the well so that I can no longer drink do not make the fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me He sometimes could not bear being teazed with questions seven hundred seventy nine I was once present when a gentleman asked so many as What did you do Sir What did you say Sir that he at last grew enraged and said I will not be put to the question Don t you consider Sir that these are not the manners of a gentleman I will not be baited with what and why what is this what is that why is a cow s tail long why is a fox s tail bushy The gentleman who was a good deal out of countenance said Why Sir you are so good that I venture to trouble you JOHNSON Sir my being so good is no reason why you should be so ill Talking of the Justitia hulk at Woolwich in which criminals were punished by being confined to labour he said I do not see that they are punished by this they must have worked equally had they never been guilty of stealing seven hundred eighty They now only work so after all they have gained what they stole is clear gain to them the confinement is nothing Every man who works is confined the smith to his shop the tailor to his garret BOSWELL And Lord Mansfield to his Court JOHNSON Yes Sir you know the notion of confinement may be extended as in the song Every island is a prison seven hundred eighty one There is in Dodsley s Collection a copy of verses to the authour of that song seven hundred eighty two Smith s Latin verses on Pococke the great traveller seven hundred eighty three were mentioned He repeated some of them and said they were Smith s best verses He talked with an uncommon animation of travelling into distant countries that the mind was enlarged by it and that an acquisition of dignity of character was derived from it He expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of China I catched it for the moment seven hundred eighty four and said I really believed I should go and see the wall of China had I not children of whom it was my duty to take care Sir said he by doing so you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence There would be a lustre reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China I am serious Sir When we had left mister Scott s he said Will you go home with me Sir said I it is late but I ll go with you for three minutes JOHNSON Or four We went to missus Williams s room where we found mister Allen the printer who was the landlord of his house in Bolt court a worthy obliging man and his very old acquaintance and what was exceedingly amusing though he was of a very diminutive size he used even in Johnson s presence to imitate the stately periods and slow and solemn utterance of the great man seven hundred eighty five I this evening boasted that although I did not write what is called stenography or short hand in appropriated characters devised for the purpose I had a method of my own of writing half words and leaving out some altogether so as yet to keep the substance and language of any discourse which I had heard so much in view that I could give it very completely soon after I had taken it down He defied me as he had once defied an actual short hand writer seven hundred eighty six and he made the experiment by reading slowly and distinctly a part of Robertson s History of America while I endeavoured to write it in my way of taking notes It was found that I had it very imperfectly the conclusion from which was that its excellence was principally owing to a studied arrangement of words which could not be varied or abridged without an essential injury On Sunday April twelve I found him at home before dinner doctor Dodd s poem entitled Thoughts in Prison was lying upon his table This appearing to me an extraordinary effort by a man who was in Newgate for a capital crime I was desirous to hear Johnson s opinion of it to my surprize he told me he had not read a line of it I took up the book and read a passage to him JOHNSON Pretty well if you are previously disposed to like them I read another passage with which he was better pleased He then took the book into his own hands and having looked at the prayer at the end of it he said What evidence is there that this was composed the night before he suffered I do not believe it He then read aloud where he prays for the King c and observed Sir do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the succession of a royal family seven hundred eighty seven Though he may have composed this prayer then A man who has been canting all his life may cant to the last seven hundred eighty eight And yet a man who has been refused a pardon after so much petitioning would hardly be praying thus fervently for the King He and I and missus Williams went to dine with the Reverend doctor Percy Talking of Goldsmith Johnson said he was very envious seven hundred eighty nine I defended him by observing that he owned it frankly upon all occasions JOHNSON Sir you are enforcing the charge He had so much envy that he could not conceal it He was so full of it that he overflowed He talked of it to be sure often enough Now Sir what a man avows he is not ashamed to think though many a man thinks what he is ashamed to avow We are all envious naturally seven hundred ninety but by checking envy we get the better of it So we are all thieves naturally a child always tries to get at what it wants the nearest way by good instruction and good habits this is cured till a man has not even an inclination to seize what is another s has no struggle with himself about it And here I shall record a scene of too much heat between doctor Johnson and doctor Percy which I should have suppressed were it not that it gave occasion to display the truely tender and benevolent heart of Johnson who as soon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had said in his wrath was not only prompt and desirous to be reconciled but exerted himself to make ample reparation seven hundred ninety one Books of Travels having been mentioned Johnson praised Pennant very highly as he did at Dunvegan in the Isle of Sky seven hundred ninety two doctor Percy knowing himself to be the heir male of the ancient Percies seven hundred ninety three and having the warmest and most dutiful attachment to the noble House of Northumberland could not sit quietly and hear a man praised who had spoken disrespectfully of Alnwick Castle and the Duke s pleasure grounds especially as he thought meanly of his travels He therefore opposed Johnson eagerly JOHNSON Pennant in what he has said of Alnwick has done what he intended he has made you very angry PERCY He has said the garden is trim seven hundred ninety four which is representing it like a citizen s parterre when the truth is there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks JOHNSON According to your own account Sir Pennant is right It is trim Here is grass cut close and gravel rolled smooth Is not that trim The extent is nothing against that a mile may be as trim as a square yard Your extent puts me in mind of the citizen s enlarged dinner two pieces of roast beef and two puddings seven hundred ninety five There is no variety no mind exerted in laying out the ground no trees seven hundred ninety six PERCY He pretends to give the natural history of Northumberland and yet takes no notice of the immense number of trees planted there of late JOHNSON That Sir has nothing to do with the natural history that is civil history A man who gives the natural history of the oak is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that A man who gives the natural history of the cow is not to tell how many cows are milked at Islington The animal is the same whether milked in the Park or at Islington PERCY Pennant does not describe well a carrier who goes along the side of Lochlomond would describe it better JOHNSON I think he describes very well PERCY I travelled after him JOHNSON And I travelled after him PERCY But my good friend you are short sighted and do not see so well as I do I wondered at doctor Percy s venturing thus doctor Johnson said nothing at the time but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to burst In a little while doctor Percy said something more in disparagement of Pennant JOHNSON pointedly This is the resentment of a narrow mind because he did not find every thing in Northumberland PERCY feeling the stroke Sir you may be as rude as you please JOHNSON Hold Sir Don t talk of rudeness remember Sir you told me puffing hard with passion struggling for a vent I was short sighted seven hundred ninety seven We have done with civility We are to be as rude as we please PERCY Upon my honour Sir I did not mean to be uncivil JOHNSON I cannot say so Sir for I did mean to be uncivil thinking you had been uncivil doctor Percy rose ran up to him and taking him by the hand assured him affectionately that his meaning had been misunderstood upon which a reconciliation instantly took place JOHNSON My dear Sir I am willing you shall hang Pennant PERCY resuming the former subject Pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of hospitality seven hundred ninety eight Now I never heard that it was a custom to hang out a helmet seven hundred ninety nine JOHNSON Hang him up hang him up BOSWELL humouring the joke Hang out his skull instead of a helmet and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of Odin as he is your enemy that will be truly ancient There will be Northern Antiquities eight hundred JOHNSON He s a Whig Sir a sad dog smiling at his own violent expressions merely for political difference of opinion But he s the best traveller I ever read he observes more things than any one else does I could not help thinking that this was too high praise of a writer who had traversed a wide extent of country in such haste that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own and afterwards procured supplemental intelligence from parochial ministers and others not the best qualified or most impartial narrators whose ungenerous prejudice against the house of Stuart glares in misrepresentation a writer who at best treats merely of superficial objects and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners such as Johnson has exhibited in his masterly Journey over part of the same ground and who it should seem from a desire of ingratiating himself with the Scotch has flattered the people of North Britain so inordinately and with so little discrimination that the judicious and candid amongst them must be disgusted while they value more the plain just yet kindly report of Johnson Having impartially censured mister Pennant as a Traveller in Scotland let me allow him from authorities much better than mine his deserved praise as an able Zoologist and let me also from my own understanding and feelings acknowledge the merit of his London which though said to be not quite accurate in some particulars is one of the most pleasing topographical performances that ever appeared in any language mister Pennant like his countrymen in general eight hundred one has the true spirit of a Gentleman As a proof of it I shall quote from his London the passage in which he speaks of my illustrious friend I must by no means omit Bolt court the long residence of Doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON a man of the strongest natural abilities great learning a most retentive memory of the deepest and most unaffected piety and morality mingled with those numerous weaknesses and prejudices which his friends have kindly taken care to draw from their dread abode eight hundred two I brought on myself his transient anger by observing that in his tour in Scotland he once had long and woeful experience of oats being the food of men in Scotland as they were of horses in England It was a national reflection unworthy of him and I shot my bolt In return he gave me a tender hug eight hundred three Con amore he also said of me The dog is a Whig eight hundred four I admired the virtues of Lord Russell and pitied his fall I should have been a Whig at the Revolution There have been periods since in which I should have been what I now am a moderate Tory a supporter as far as my little influence extends of a well poised balance between the crown and people but should the scale preponderate against the Salus populi that moment may it be said The dog s a Whig We had a calm after the storm staid the evening and supped and were pleasant and gay But doctor Percy told me he was very uneasy at what had passed for there was a gentleman there who was acquainted with the Northumberland family to whom he hoped to have appeared more respectable by shewing how intimate he was with doctor Johnson and who might now on the contrary go away with an opinion to his disadvantage He begged I would mention this to doctor Johnson which I afterwards did His observation upon it was This comes of stratagem had he told me that he wished to appear to advantage before that gentleman he should have been at the top of the house all the time He spoke of doctor Percy in the handsomest terms Then Sir said I may I be allowed to suggest a mode by which you may effectually counteract any unfavourable report of what passed I will write a letter to you upon the subject of the unlucky contest of that day and you will be kind enough to put in writing as an answer to that letter what you have now said and as Lord Percy is to dine with us at General Paoli s soon I will take an opportunity to read the correspondence in his Lordship s presence This friendly scheme was accordingly carried into execution without doctor Percy s knowledge Johnson s letter placed doctor Percy s unquestionable merit in the fairest point of view and I contrived that Lord Percy should hear the correspondence by introducing it at General Paoli s as an instance of doctor Johnson s kind disposition towards one in whom his Lordship was interested Thus every unfavourable impression was obviated that could possibly have been made on those by whom he wished most to be regarded I breakfasted the day after with him and informed him of my scheme and its happy completion for which he thanked me in the warmest terms and was highly delighted with doctor Johnson s letter in his praise of which I gave him a copy He said I would rather have this than degrees from all the Universities in Europe It will be for me and my children and grand children doctor Johnson having afterwards asked me if I had given him a copy of it and being told I had was offended and insisted that I should get it back which I did As however he did not desire me to destroy either the original or the copy or forbid me to let it be seen I think myself at liberty to apply to it his general declaration to me concerning his other letters That he did not choose they should be published in his lifetime but had no objection to their appearing after his death eight hundred five I shall therefore insert this kindly correspondence having faithfully narrated the circumstances accompanying it eight hundred six To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON MY DEAR SIR I beg leave to address you in behalf of our friend doctor Percy who was much hurt by what you said to him that day we dined at his house eight hundred seven when in the course of the dispute as to Pennant s merit as a traveller you told Percy that he had the resentment of a narrow mind against Pennant because he did not find every thing in Northumberland Percy is sensible that you did not mean to injure him but he is vexed to think that your behaviour to him upon that occasion may be interpreted as a proof that he is despised by you which I know is not the case I have told him that the charge of being narrow minded was only as to the particular point in question and that he had the merit of being a martyr to his noble family Earl Percy is to dine with General Paoli next Friday and I should be sincerely glad to have it in my power to satisfy his Lordship how well you think of doctor Percy who I find apprehends that your good opinion of him may be of very essential consequence and who assures me that he has the highest respect and the warmest affection for you I have only to add that my suggesting this occasion for the exercise of your candour and generosity is altogether unknown to doctor Percy and proceeds from my good will towards him and my persuasion that you will be happy to do him an essential kindness I am more and more my dear Sir Your most faithful And affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire SIR The debate between doctor Percy and me is one of those foolish controversies which begin upon a question of which neither party cares how it is decided and which is nevertheless continued to acrimony by the vanity with which every man resists confutation eight hundred eight doctor Percy s warmth proceeded from a cause which perhaps does him more honour than he could have derived from juster criticism His abhorrence of Pennant proceeded from his opinion that Pennant had wantonly and indecently censured his patron His anger made him resolve that for having been once wrong he never should be right Pennant has much in his notions that I do not like but still I think him a very intelligent traveller If Percy is really offended I am sorry for he is a man whom I never knew to offend any one He is a man very willing to learn and very able to teach a man out of whose company I never go without having learned something It is sure that he vexes me sometimes but I am afraid it is by making me feel my own ignorance So much extension of mind and so much minute accuracy of enquiry if you survey your whole circle of acquaintance you will find so scarce if you find it at all that you will value Percy by comparison Lord Hailes is somewhat like him but Lord Hailes does not perhaps go beyond him in research and I do not know that he equals him in elegance Percy s attention to poetry has given grace and splendour to his studies of antiquity A mere antiquarian is a rugged being Upon the whole you see that what I might say in sport or petulance to him is very consistent with full conviction of his merit I am dear Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON April twenty three seventeen seventy eight TO THE REVEREND doctor PERCY NORTHUMBERLAND HOUSE DEAR SIR I wrote to doctor Johnson on the subject of the Pennantian controversy and have received from him an answer which will delight you I read it yesterday to doctor Robertson at the Exhibition and at dinner to Lord Percy General Oglethorpe c who dined with us at General Paoli s who was also a witness to the high testimony to your honour General Paoli desires the favour of your company next Tuesday to dinner to meet doctor Johnson If I can I will call on you to day I am with sincere regard Your most obedient humble servant JAMES BOSWELL eight hundred nine South Audley street April twenty five On Monday April thirteen I dined with Johnson at mister Langton s where were doctor Porteus then Bishop of Chester now of London and doctor Stinton eight hundred ten He was at first in a very silent mood Before dinner he said nothing but Pretty baby to one of the children Langton said very well to me afterwards that he could repeat Johnson s conversation before dinner as Johnson had said that he could repeat a complete chapter of The Natural History of Iceland from the Danish of Horrebow the whole of which was exactly thus CHAP LXXII Concerning snakes There are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island eight hundred eleven At dinner we talked of another mode in the newspapers eight hundred twelve of giving modern characters in sentences from the classicks and of the passage Pareus deorum cultor et infrequens Insanientis dum sapientiae Consultus erro nunc retrorsum Vela dare atque iterare cursus Cogor relictos eight hundred thirteen being well applied to Soame Jenyns who after having wandered in the wilds of infidelity had returned to the Christian faith eight hundred fourteen mister Langton asked Johnson as to the propriety of sapientiae consultus JOHNSON Though consultus was primarily an adjective like amicus it came to be used as a substantive So we have Juris consultus a consult in law We talked of the styles of different painters and how certainly a connoisseur could distinguish them I asked if there was as clear a difference of styles in language as in painting or even as in hand writing so that the composition of every individual may be distinguished JOHNSON Yes Those who have a style of eminent excellence such as Dryden and Milton can always be distinguished I had no doubt of this but what I wanted to know was whether there was really a peculiar style to every man whatever as there is certainly a peculiar handwriting a peculiar countenance not widely different in many yet always enough to be distinctive facies non omnibus una Nec diversa tamen eight hundred fifteen The Bishop thought not and said he supposed that many pieces in Dodsley s collection of poems though all very pretty had nothing appropriated in their style and in that particular could not be at all distinguished JOHNSON Why Sir I think every man whatever has a peculiar style eight hundred sixteen which may be discovered by nice examination and comparison with others but a man must write a great deal to make his style obviously discernible As logicians say this appropriation of style is infinite in potestate limited in actu mister Topham Beauclerk came in the evening and he and doctor Johnson and I staid to supper It was mentioned that doctor Dodd had once wished to be a member of THE LITERARY CLUB eight hundred seventeen JOHNSON I should be sorry if any of our Club were hanged I will not say but some of them deserve it eight hundred eighteen BEAUCLERK supposing this to be aimed at persons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy which however did not last long was irritated and eagerly said You Sir have a friend eight hundred nineteen naming him who deserves to be hanged for he speaks behind their backs against those with whom he lives on the best terms and attacks them in the newspapers He certainly ought to be kicked JOHNSON Sir we all do this in some degree Veniam petimus damusque vicissim eight hundred twenty To be sure it may be done so much that a man may deserve to be kicked BEAUCLERK He is very malignant JOHNSON No Sir he is not malignant He is mischievous if you will He would do no man an essential injury he may indeed love to make sport of people by vexing their vanity I however once knew an old gentleman who was absolutely malignant He really wished evil to others and rejoiced at it BOSWELL The gentleman mister Beauclerk against whom you are so violent is I know a man of good principles BEAUCLERK Then he does not wear them out in practice eight hundred twenty one doctor Johnson who as I have observed before delighted in discrimination of character and having a masterly knowledge of human nature was willing to take men as they are imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities eight hundred twenty two I suppose thought he had said enough in defence of his friend of whose merits notwithstanding his exceptional points he had a just value and added no more on the subject On Tuesday April fourteen I dined with him at General Oglethorpe s with General Paoli and mister Langton General Oglethorpe declaimed against luxury eight hundred twenty three JOHNSON Depend upon it Sir every state of society is as luxurious as it can be Men always take the best they can get OGLETHORPE But the best depends much upon ourselves and if we can be as well satisfied with plain things we are in the wrong to accustom our palates to what is high seasoned and expensive What says Addison in his Cato speaking of the Numidian Coarse are his meals the fortune of the chace Amid the running stream he slakes his thirst Toils all the day and at the approach of night On the first friendly bank he throws him down Or rests his head upon a rock till morn eight hundred twenty four And if the following day he chance to find A new repast or an untasted spring Blesses his stars and thinks it s luxury Let us have that kind of luxury Sir if you will JOHNSON But hold Sir to be merely satisfied is not enough It is in refinement and elegance that the civilized man differs from the savage A great part of our industry and all our ingenuity is exercised in procuring pleasure and Sir a hungry man has not the same pleasure in eating a plain dinner that a hungry man has in eating a luxurious dinner You see I put the case fairly A hungry man may have as much nay more pleasure in eating a plain dinner than a man grown fastidious has in eating a luxurious dinner But I suppose the man who decides between the two dinners to be equally a hungry man Talking of different governments JOHNSON The more contracted that power is the more easily it is destroyed A country governed by a despot is an inverted cone Government there cannot be so firm as when it rests upon a broad basis gradually contracted as the government of Great Britain which is founded on the parliament then is in the privy council then in the King BOSWELL Power when contracted into the person of a despot may be easily destroyed as the prince may be cut off So Caligula wished that the people of Rome had but one neck that he might cut them off at a blow OGLETHORPE It was of the Senate he wished that eight hundred twenty five The Senate by its usurpation controlled both the Emperour and the people And don t you think that we see too much of that in our own Parliament doctor Johnson endeavoured to trace the etymology of Maccaronick verses which he thought were of Italian invention from Maccaroni but on being informed that this would infer that they were the most common and easy verses maccaroni being the most ordinary and simple food he was at a loss for he said He rather should have supposed it to import in its primitive signification a composition of several things for Maccaronick verses are verses made out of a mixture of different languages that is of one language with the termination of another eight hundred twenty six I suppose we scarcely know of a language in any country where there is any learning in which that motley ludicrous species of composition may not be found It is particularly droll in Low Dutch The Polemomiddinia eight hundred twenty seven of Drummond of Hawthornden in which there is a jumble of many languages moulded as if it were all in Latin is well known mister Langton made us laugh heartily at one in the Grecian mould by Joshua Barnes in which are to be found such comical Anglo Ellenisms as Greek Klubboisin ebanchthen they were banged with clubs eight hundred twenty eight On Wednesday April fifteen I dined with doctor Johnson at mister Dilly s and was in high spirits for I had been a good part of the morning with mister Orme the able and eloquent historian of Hindostan who expressed a great admiration of Johnson I do not care said he on what subject Johnson talks but I love better to hear him talk than any body He either gives you new thoughts or a new colouring It is a shame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded Had I been George the Third and thought as he did about America I would have given Johnson three hundred a year for his Taxation no Tyranny alone I repeated this and Johnson was much pleased with such praise from such a man as Orme At mister Dilly s to day were missus Knowles eight hundred twenty nine the ingenious Quaker lady eight hundred thirty Miss Seward the poetess of Lichfield the Reverend doctor Mayo eight hundred thirty one and the reverend mister Beresford Tutor to the Duke of Bedford Before dinner doctor Johnson seized upon mister Charles Sheridan s Account of the late Revolution in Sweden eight hundred thirty two and seemed to read it ravenously as if he devoured it which was to all appearance his method of studying He knows how to read better than any one said missus Knowles he gets at the substance of a book directly he tears out the heart of it He kept it wrapt up in the tablecloth in his lap during the time of dinner from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness when he should have finished another resembling if I may use so coarse a simile a dog who holds a bone in his paws in reserve while he eats something else which has been thrown to him The subject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where Johnson who boasted of the niceness of his palate eight hundred thirty three owned that he always found a good dinner he said I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written it should be a book upon philosophical principles Pharmacy is now made much more simple Cookery may be made so too A prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients had formerly fifty in it So in cookery if the nature of the ingredients be well known much fewer will do Then as you cannot make bad meat good I would tell what is the best butcher s meat the best beef the best pieces how to choose young fowls the proper seasons of different vegetables and then how to roast and boil and compound DILLY missus Glasse s Cookery which is the best was written by doctor Hill Half the trade eight hundred thirty four know this JOHNSON Well Sir This shews how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher I doubt if the book be written by doctor Hill for in missus Glasse s Cookery which I have looked into salt petre and sal prunella are spoken of as different substances whereas sal prunella is only salt petre burnt on charcoal and Hill could not be ignorant of this However as the greatest part of such a book is made by transcription this mistake may have been carelessly adopted But you shall see what a Book of Cookery I shall make I shall agree with mister Dilly for the copy right Miss SEWARD That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed JOHNSON No Madam Women can spin very well but they cannot make a good book of Cookery JOHNSON O mister Dilly you must know that an English Benedictine Monk at Paris has translated The Duke of Berwick s Memoirs from the original French and has sent them to me to sell I offered them to Strahan who sent them back with this answer That the first book he had published was the Duke of Berwick s Life by which he had lost and he hated the name Now I honestly tell you that Strahan has refused them but I also honestly tell you that he did it upon no principle for he never looked into them DILLY Are they well translated Sir JOHNSON Why Sir very well in a style very current and very clear I have written to the Benedictine to give me an answer upon two points What evidence is there that the letters are authentick for if they are not authentick they are nothing And how long will it be before the original French is published For if the French edition is not to appear for a considerable time the translation will be almost as valuable as an original book They will make two volumes in octavo and I have undertaken to correct every sheet as it comes from the press mister Dilly desired to see them and said he would send for them He asked doctor Johnson if he would write a Preface to them JOHNSON No Sir The Benedictines were very kind to me eight hundred thirty five and I ll do what I undertook to do but I will not mingle my name with them I am to gain nothing by them I ll turn them loose upon the world and let them take their chance doctor MAYO Pray Sir are Ganganelli s letters authentick JOHNSON No Sir Voltaire put the same question to the editor of them that I did to Macpherson Where are the originals eight hundred thirty six missus Knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty allowed them than women JOHNSON Why Madam women have all the liberty they should wish to have We have all the labour and the danger and the women all the advantage We go to sea we build houses we do everything in short to pay our court to the women missus KNOWLES The Doctor reasons very wittily but not convincingly Now take the instance of building the mason s wife if she is ever seen in liquor is ruined the mason may get himself drunk as often as he pleases with little loss of character nay may let his wife and children starve JOHNSON Madam you must consider if the mason does get himself drunk and let his wife and children starve the parish will oblige him to find security for their maintenance We have different modes of restraining evil Stocks for the men a ducking stool for women eight hundred thirty seven and a pound for beasts If we require more perfection from women than from ourselves it is doing them honour And women have not the same temptations that we have they may always live in virtuous company men must mix in the world indiscriminately If a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong being secured from it is no restraint to her I am at liberty to walk into the Thames but if I were to try it my friends would restrain me in Bedlam and I should be obliged to them missus KNOWLES Still Doctor I cannot help thinking it a hardship that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women It gives a superiority to men to which I do not see how they are entitled JOHNSON It is plain Madam one or other must have the superiority As Shakspeare says If two men ride on a horse one must ride behind eight hundred thirty eight DILLY I suppose Sir missus Knowles would have them to ride in panniers one on each side JOHNSON Then Sir the horse would throw them both missus KNOWLES Well I hope that in another world the sexes will be equal BOSWELL That is being too ambitious Madam We might as well desire to be equal with the angels We shall all I hope be happy in a future state but we must not expect to be all happy in the same degree It is enough if we be happy according to our several capacities A worthy carman will get to heaven as well as Sir Isaac Newton Yet though equally good they will not have the same degrees of happiness JOHNSON Probably not Upon this subject I had once before sounded him by mentioning the late Reverend mister Brown of Utrecht s image that a great and small glass though equally full did not hold an equal quantity which he threw out to refute David Hume s saying eight hundred thirty nine that a little miss going to dance at a ball in a fine new dress was as happy as a great oratour after having made an eloquent and applauded speech After some thought Johnson said I come over to the parson As an instance of coincidence of thinking mister Dilly told me that doctor King a late dissenting minister in London said to him upon the happiness in a future state of good men of different capacities A pail does not hold so much as a tub but if it be equally full it has no reason to complain Every Saint in heaven will have as much happiness as he can hold mister Dilly thought this a clear though a familiar illustration of the phrase One star differeth from another in brightness eight hundred forty doctor Mayo having asked Johnson s opinion of Soame Jenyns s View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion eight hundred forty one JOHNSON I think it a pretty book not very theological indeed and there seems to be an affectation of ease and carelessness as if it were not suitable to his character to be very serious about the matter BOSWELL He may have intended this to introduce his book the better among genteel people who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatise There is a general levity in the age We have physicians now with bag wigs eight hundred forty two may we not have airy divines at least somewhat less solemn in their appearance than they used to be JOHNSON Jenyns might mean as you say eight hundred forty three BOSWELL You should like his book missus Knowles as it maintains as you friends do that courage is not a Christian virtue missus KNOWLES Yes indeed I like him there but I cannot agree with him that friendship is not a Christian virtue eight hundred forty four JOHNSON Why Madam strictly speaking he is right All friendship is preferring the interest of a friend to the neglect or perhaps against the interest of others so that an old Greek said He that has friends has no friend Now Christianity recommends universal benevolence to consider all men as our brethren eight hundred forty five which is contrary to the virtue of friendship as described by the ancient philosophers Surely Madam your sect must approve of this for you call all men friends missus KNOWLES We are commanded to do good to all men but especially to them who are of the household of Faith eight hundred forty six JOHNSON Well Madam The household of Faith is wide enough missus KNOWLES But Doctor our Saviour had twelve Apostles yet there was one whom he loved John was called the disciple whom JESUS loved eight hundred forty seven JOHNSON with eyes sparkling benignantly Very well indeed Madam You have said very well BOSWELL A fine application Pray Sir had you ever thought of it JOHNSON I had not Sir From this pleasing subject eight hundred forty eight he I know not how or why made a sudden transition to one upon which he was a violent aggressor for he said I am willing to love all mankind except an American and his inflammable corruption bursting into horrid fire he breathed out threatenings and slaughter eight hundred forty nine calling them Rascals Robbers Pirates and exclaiming he d burn and destroy them Miss Seward looking to him with mild but steady astonishment said Sir this is an instance that we are always most violent against those whom we have injured He was irritated still more by this delicate and keen reproach and roared out another tremendous volley which one might fancy could be heard across the Atlantick During this tempest I sat in great uneasiness lamenting his heat of temper till by degrees I diverted his attention to other topicks doctor MAYO to doctor Johnson Pray Sir have you read Edwards of New England on Grace JOHNSON No Sir BOSWELL It puzzled me so much as to the freedom of the human will by stating with wonderful acute ingenuity our being actuated by a series of motives which we cannot resist that the only relief I had was to forget it MAYO But he makes the proper distinction between moral and physical necessity BOSWELL Alas Sir they come both to the same thing You may be bound as hard by chains when covered by leather as when the iron appears The argument for the moral necessity of human actions is always I observe fortified by supposing universal prescience to be one of the attributes of the Deity JOHNSON You are surer that you are free than you are of prescience you are surer that you can lift up your finger or not as you please than you are of any conclusion from a deduction of reasoning But let us consider a little the objection from prescience It is certain I am either to go home to night or not that does not prevent my freedom BOSWELL That it is certain you are either to go home or not does not prevent your freedom because the liberty of choice between the two is compatible with that certainty But if one of these events be certain now you have no future power of volition If it be certain you are to go home to night you must go home JOHNSON If I am well acquainted with a man I can judge with great probability how he will act in any case without his being restrained by my judging GOD may have this probability increased to certainty BOSWELL When it is increased to certainty freedom ceases because that cannot be certainly foreknown which is not certain at the time but if it be certain at the time it is a contradiction in terms to maintain that there can be afterwards any contingency dependent upon the exercise of will or any thing else JOHNSON All theory is against the freedom of the will all experience for it eight hundred fifty I did not push the subject any farther I was glad to find him so mild in discussing a question of the most abstract nature involved with theological tenets which he generally would not suffer to be in any degree opposed eight hundred fifty one He as usual defended luxury eight hundred fifty two You cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to the poor Nay you do more good to them by spending it in luxury than by giving it for by spending it in luxury you make them exert industry whereas by giving it you keep them idle I own indeed there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity than in spending it in luxury though there may be a pride in that too Miss Seward asked if this was not Mandeville s doctrine of private vices publick benefits JOHNSON The fallacy of that book is that Mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits He reckons among vices everything that gives pleasure eight hundred fifty three He takes the narrowest system of morality monastick morality which holds pleasure itself to be a vice such as eating salt with our fish because it makes it eat better and he reckons wealth as a publick benefit which is by no means always true Pleasure of itself is not a vice Having a garden which we all know to be perfectly innocent is a great pleasure At the same time in this state of being there are many pleasures vices which however are so immediately agreeable that we can hardly abstain from them The happiness of Heaven will be that pleasure and virtue will be perfectly consistent Mandeville puts the case of a man who gets drunk in an alehouse and says it is a publick benefit because so much money is got by it to the publick But it must be considered that all the good gained by this through the gradation of alehouse keeper brewer maltster and farmer is overbalanced by the evil caused to the man and his family by his getting drunk eight hundred fifty four This is the way to try what is vicious by ascertaining whether more evil than good is produced by it upon the whole which is the case in all vice It may happen that good is produced by vice but not as vice for instance a robber may take money from its owner and give it to one who will make a better use of it Here is good produced but not by the robbery as robbery but as translation of property eight hundred fifty five I read Mandeville forty or I believe fifty years ago He did not puzzle me he opened my views into real life very much eight hundred fifty six No it is clear that the happiness of society depends on virtue In Sparta theft was allowed by general consent eight hundred fifty seven theft therefore was there not a crime but then there was no security and what a life must they have had when there was no security Without truth there must be a dissolution of society As it is there is so little truth that we are almost afraid to trust our ears but how should we be if falsehood were multiplied ten times Society is held together by communication and information and I remember this remark of Sir Thomas Brown s Do the devils lie No for then Hell could not subsist eight hundred fifty eight Talking of Miss eight hundred fifty nine a literary lady he said I was obliged to speak to Miss Reynolds to let her know that I desired she would not flatter me so much Somebody now observed She flatters Garrick JOHNSON She is in the right to flatter Garrick She is in the right for two reasons first because she has the world with her who have been praising Garrick these thirty years and secondly because she is rewarded for it by Garrick eight hundred sixty Why should she flatter me I can do nothing for her Let her carry her praise to a better market eight hundred sixty one Then turning to missus Knowles You Madam have been flattering me all the evening I wish you would give Boswell a little now If you knew his merit as well as I do you would say a great deal he is the best travelling companion in the world eight hundred sixty two Somebody mentioned the Reverend mister Mason s prosecution of mister Murray eight hundred sixty three the bookseller for having inserted in a collection of Gray s Poems only fifty lines of which mister Mason had still the exclusive property under the statute of Queen Anne and that mister Mason had persevered notwithstanding his being requested to name his own terms of compensation eight hundred sixty four Johnson signified his displeasure at mister Mason s conduct very strongly but added by way of shewing that he was not surprized at it Mason s a Whig missus KNOWLES not hearing distinctly What a Prig Sir JOHNSON Worse Madam a Whig But he is both I expressed a horrour at the thought of death missus KNOWLES Nay thou should saint not have a horrour for what is the gate of life JOHNSON standing upon the hearth rolling about with a serious solemn and somewhat gloomy air No rational man can die without uneasy apprehension missus KNOWLES The Scriptures tell us The righteous shall have hope in his death eight hundred sixty five JOHNSON Yes Madam that is he shall not have despair eight hundred sixty six But consider his hope of salvation must be founded on the terms on which it is promised that the mediation of our SAVIOUR shall be applied to us namely obedience and where obedience has failed then as suppletory to it repentance But what man can say that his obedience has been such as he would approve of in another or even in himself upon close examination or that his repentance has not been such as to require being repented of No man can be sure that his obedience and repentance will obtain salvation missus KNOWLES But divine intimation of acceptance may be made to the soul JOHNSON Madam it may but I should not think the better of a man who should tell me on his death bed he was sure of salvation A man cannot be sure himself that he has divine intimation of acceptance much less can he make others sure that he has it eight hundred sixty seven BOSWELL Then Sir we must be contented to acknowledge that death is a terrible thing JOHNSON Yes Sir I have made no approaches to a state which can look on it as not terrible eight hundred sixty eight missus KNOWLES seeming to enjoy a pleasing serenity in the persuasion of benignant divine light Does not saint Paul say I have fought the good fight of faith I have finished my course henceforth is laid up for me a crown of life eight hundred sixty nine JOHNSON Yes Madam but here was a man inspired a man who had been converted by supernatural interposition BOSWELL In prospect death is dreadful but in fact we find that people die easy JOHNSON Why Sir most people have not thought much of the matter so cannot say much and it is supposed they die easy Few believe it certain they are then to die and those who do set themselves to behave with resolution as a man does who is going to be hanged He is not the less unwilling to be hanged eight hundred seventy MISS SEWARD There is one mode of the fear of death which is certainly absurd and that is the dread of annihilation which is only a pleasing sleep without a dream JOHNSON It is neither pleasing nor sleep it is nothing Now mere existence is so much better than nothing that one would rather exist even in pain than not exist eight hundred seventy one BOSWELL If annihilation be nothing then existing in pain is not a comparative state but is a positive evil which I cannot think we should choose I must be allowed to differ here and it would lessen the hope of a future state founded on the argument that the Supreme Being who is good as he is great will hereafter compensate for our present sufferings in this life For if existence such as we have it here be comparatively a good we have no reason to complain though no more of it should be given to us But if our only state of existence were in this world then we might with some reason complain that we are so dissatisfied with our enjoyments compared with our desires JOHNSON The lady confounds annihilation which is nothing with the apprehension of it which is dreadful It is in the apprehension of it that the horrour of annihilation consists eight hundred seventy two Of John Wesley he said He can talk well on any subject eight hundred seventy three BOSWELL Pray Sir what has he made of his story of a ghost JOHNSON Why Sir he believes it but not on sufficient authority He did not take time enough to examine the girl It was at Newcastle where the ghost was said to have appeared to a young woman several times mentioning something about the right to an old house advising application to be made to an attorney which was done and at the same time saying the attorney would do nothing which proved to be the fact This says John is a proof that a ghost knows our thoughts eight hundred seventy four Now laughing it is not necessary to know our thoughts to tell that an attorney will sometimes do nothing Charles Wesley who is a more stationary man does not believe the story I am sorry that John did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it MISS SEWARD with an incredulous smile What Sir about a ghost JOHNSON with solemn vehemence Yes Madam this is a question which after five thousand years is yet undecided a question whether in theology or philosophy one of the most important that can come before the human understanding eight hundred seventy five missus Knowles mentioned as a proselyte to Quakerism Miss eight hundred seventy six a young lady well known to doctor Johnson for whom he had shewn much affection while she ever had and still retained a great respect for him missus Knowles at the same time took an opportunity of letting him know that the amiable young creature was sorry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the Church of England and embracing a simpler faith and in the gentlest and most persuasive manner solicited his kind indulgence for what was sincerely a matter of conscience JOHNSON frowning very angrily Madam she is an odious wench She could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion which is the most important of all subjects and should be studied with all care and with all the helps we can get She knew no more of the Church which she left and that which she embraced than she did of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaick systems missus KNOWLES She had the New Testament before her JOHNSON Madam she could not understand the New Testament the most difficult book in the world for which the study of a life is required missus KNOWLES It is clear as to essentials JOHNSON But not as to controversial points The heathens were easily converted because they had nothing to give up but we ought not without very strong conviction indeed to desert the religion in which we have been educated That is the religion given you the religion in which it may be said Providence has placed you If you live conscientiously in that religion you may be safe But errour is dangerous indeed if you err when you choose a religion for yourself eight hundred seventy seven missus KNOWLES Must we then go by implicit faith JOHNSON Why Madam the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith and as to religion have we heard all that a disciple of Confucius all that a Mahometan can say for himself He then rose again into passion and attacked the young proselyte in the severest terms of reproach so that both the ladies seemed to be much shocked eight hundred seventy eight We remained together till it was pretty late Notwithstanding occasional explosions of violence we were all delighted upon the whole with Johnson I compared him at this time to a warm West Indian climate where you have a bright sun quick vegetation luxuriant foliage luscious fruits but where the same heat sometimes produces thunder lightning earthquakes in a terrible degree April seventeen being Good Friday eight hundred seventy nine I waited on Johnson as usual I observed at breakfast that although it was a part of his abstemious discipline on this most solemn fast to take no milk in his tea yet when missus Desmoulins inadvertently poured it in he did not reject it I talked of the strange indecision of mind and imbecility in the common occurrences of life which we may observe in some people JOHNSON Why Sir I am in the habit of getting others to do things for me BOSWELL What Sir have you that weakness JOHNSON Yes Sir But I always think afterwards I should have done better for myself I told him that at a gentleman s house eight hundred eighty where there was thought to be such extravagance or bad management that he was living much beyond his income his lady had objected to the cutting of a pickled mango and that I had taken an opportunity to ask the price of it and found it was only two shillings so here was a very poor saving JOHNSON Sir that is the blundering oeconomy of a narrow understanding It is stopping one hole in a sieve I expressed some inclination to publish an account of my Travels upon the continent of Europe for which I had a variety of materials collected JOHNSON I do not say Sir you may not publish your travels but I give you my opinion that you would lessen yourself by it What can you tell of countries so well known as those upon the continent of Europe which you have visited BOSWELL But I can give an entertaining narrative with many incidents anecdotes jeux d esprit and remarks so as to make very pleasant reading JOHNSON Why Sir most modern travellers in Europe who have published their travels have been laughed at I would not have you added to the number eight hundred eighty one The world is now not contented to be merely entertained by a traveller s narrative they want to learn something eight hundred eighty two Now some of my friends asked me why I did not give some account of my travels in France The reason is plain intelligent readers had seen more of France than I had You might have liked my travels in France and THE CLUB might have liked them but upon the whole there would have been more ridicule than good produced by them BOSWELL I cannot agree with you Sir People would like to read what you say of any thing Suppose a face has been painted by fifty painters before still we love to see it done by Sir Joshua JOHNSON True Sir but Sir Joshua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it BOSWELL Sir a sketch of any sort by him is valuable And Sir to talk to you in your own style raising my voice and shaking my head you should have given us your travels in France I am sure I am right and there s an end on t I said to him that it was certainly true as my friend Dempster had observed in his letter to me upon the subject that a great part of what was in his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland had been in his mind before he left London JOHNSON Why yes Sir the topicks were and books of travels eight hundred eighty three will be good in proportion to what a man has previously in his mind his knowing what to observe his power of contrasting one mode of life with another As the Spanish proverb says He who would bring home the wealth of the Indies must carry the wealth of the Indies with him So it is in travelling a man must carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge BOSWELL The proverb I suppose Sir means he must carry a large stock with him to trade with JOHNSON Yes Sir It was a delightful day as we walked to saint Clement s church eight hundred eighty four I again remarked that Fleet street was the most cheerful scene in the world eight hundred eighty five Fleet street said I is in my mind more delightful than Tempe JOHNSON Ay Sir but let it be compared with Mull There was a very numerous congregation to day at saint Clement s church which doctor Johnson said he observed with pleasure And now I am to give a pretty full account of one of the most curious incidents in Johnson s life of which he himself has made the following minute on this day In my return from church I was accosted by Edwards eight hundred eighty six an old fellow collegian who had not seen me since seventeen twenty nine He knew me and asked if I remembered one Edwards I did not at first recollect the name but gradually as we walked along recovered it and told him a conversation that had passed at an alehouse between us My purpose is to continue our acquaintance eight hundred eighty seven It was in Butcher row that this meeting happened mister Edwards who was a decent looking elderly man in grey clothes and a wig of many curls accosted Johnson with familiar confidence knowing who he was while Johnson returned his salutation with a courteous formality as to a stranger But as soon as Edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at Pembroke College together nine and forty years ago he seemed much pleased asked where he lived and said he should be glad to see him in Bolt court EDWARDS Ah Sir we are old men now eight hundred eighty eight JOHNSON who never liked to think of being old eight hundred eighty nine Don t let us discourage one another EDWARDS Why Doctor you look stout and hearty I am happy to see you so for the newspapers told us you were very ill eight hundred ninety JOHNSON Ay Sir they are always telling lies of us old fellows Wishing to be present at more of so singular a conversation as that between two fellow collegians who had lived forty years in London without ever having chanced to meet I whispered to mister Edwards that doctor Johnson was going home and that he had better accompany him now So Edwards walked along with us I eagerly assisting to keep up the conversation mister Edwards informed doctor Johnson that he had practised long as a solicitor in Chancery but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm about sixty acres just by Stevenage in Hertfordshire and that he came to London to Barnard s Inn No six generally twice a week Johnson appearing to me in a reverie mister Edwards addressed himself to me and expatiated on the pleasure of living in the country BOSWELL I have no notion of this Sir What you have to entertain you is I think exhausted in half an hour EDWARDS What don t you love to have hope realized I see my grass and my corn and my trees growing Now for instance I am curious to see if this frost has not nipped my fruit trees JOHNSON who we did not imagine was attending You find Sir you have fears as well as hopes So well did he see the whole when another saw but the half of a subject When we got to doctor Johnson s house and were seated in his library the dialogue went on admirably EDWARDS Sir I remember you would not let us say prodigious at College eight hundred ninety one For even then Sir turning to me he was delicate in language and we all feared him eight hundred ninety two JOHNSON to Edwards From your having practised the law long Sir I presume you must be rich EDWARDS No Sir I got a good deal of money but I had a number of poor relations to whom I gave a great part of it JOHNSON Sir you have been rich in the most valuable sense of the word EDWARDS But I shall not die rich JOHNSON Nay sure Sir it is better to live rich than to die rich EDWARDS I wish I had continued at College JOHNSON Why do you wish that Sir EDWARDS Because I think I should have had a much easier life than mine has been I should have been a parson and had a good living like Bloxam and several others and lived comfortably JOHNSON Sir the life of a parson of a conscientious clergyman is not easy I have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain I would rather have Chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls No Sir I do not envy a clergyman s life as an easy life eight hundred ninety three nor do I envy the clergyman who makes it an easy life Here taking himself up all of a sudden he exclaimed O mister Edwards I ll convince you that I recollect you Do you remember our drinking together at an alehouse near Pembroke gate eight hundred ninety four At that time you told me of the Eton boy who when verses on our Saviour s turning water into wine were prescribed as an exercise brought up a single line which was highly admired Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica Deum eight hundred ninety five and I told you of another fine line in Camden s Remains an eulogy upon one of our Kings who was succeeded by his son a prince of equal merit Mira cano Sol occubuit nox nulla secuta est eight hundred ninety six EDWARDS You are a philosopher doctor Johnson I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher but I don t know how cheerfulness was always breaking in eight hundred ninety seven mister Burke Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Courtenay mister Malone and indeed all the eminent men to whom I have mentioned this have thought it an exquisite trait of character The truth is that philosophy like religion is too generally supposed to be hard and severe at least so grave as to exclude all gaiety EDWARDS I have been twice married Doctor You I suppose have never known what it was to have a wife JOHNSON Sir I have known what it was to have a wife and in a solemn tender faultering tone I have known what it was to lose a wife It had almost broke my heart EDWARDS How do you live Sir For my part I must have my regular meals and a glass of good wine I find I require it JOHNSON I now drink no wine Sir Early in life I drank wine for many years I drank none I then for some years drank a great deal EDWARDS Some hogsheads I warrant you JOHNSON I then had a severe illness and left it off eight hundred ninety eight and I have never begun it again I never felt any difference upon myself from eating one thing rather than another nor from one kind of weather rather than another eight hundred ninety nine There are people I believe who feel a difference but I am not one of them And as to regular meals I have fasted from the Sunday s dinner to the Tuesday s dinner without any inconvenience nine hundred I believe it is best to eat just as one is hungry but a man who is in business or a man who has a family must have stated meals I am a straggler I may leave this town and go to Grand Cairo without being missed here or observed there EDWARDS Don t you eat supper Sir JOHNSON No Sir EDWARDS For my part now I consider supper as a turnpike through which one must pass in order to get to bed nine hundred one JOHNSON You are a lawyer mister Edwards Lawyers know life practically A bookish man should always have them to converse with They have what he wants EDWARDS I am grown old I am sixty five JOHNSON I shall be sixty eight nine hundred two next birth day Come Sir drink water and put in for a hundred mister Edwards mentioned a gentleman who had left his whole fortune to Pembroke College JOHNSON Whether to leave one s whole fortune to a College be right must depend upon circumstances I would leave the interest of the fortune I bequeathed to a College to my relations or my friends for their lives nine hundred three It is the same thing to a College which is a permanent society whether it gets the money now or twenty years hence and I would wish to make my relations or friends feel the benefit of it This interview confirmed my opinion of Johnson s most humane and benevolent heart His cordial and placid behaviour to an old fellow collegian a man so different from himself and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and visit him showed a kindness of disposition very rare at an advanced age He observed how wonderful it was that they had both been in London forty years without having ever once met and both walkers in the street too mister Edwards when going away again recurred to his consciousness of senility and looking full in Johnson s face said to him You ll find in doctor Young O my coevals remnants of yourselves nine hundred four Johnson did not relish this at all but shook his head with impatience Edwards walked off seemingly highly pleased with the honour of having been thus noticed by doctor Johnson When he was gone I said to Johnson I thought him but a weak man JOHNSON Why yes Sir Here is a man who has passed through life without experience yet I would rather have him with me than a more sensible man who will not talk readily This man is always willing to say what he has to say Yet doctor Johnson had himself by no means that willingness which he praised so much and I think so justly for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void when there is a total silence in a company for any length of time or which is as bad or perhaps worse when the conversation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort Johnson once observed to me Tom Tyers described me the best Sir said he you are like a ghost you never speak till you are spoken to nine hundred five The gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was mister Thomas Tyers son of mister Jonathan Tyers the founder of that excellent place of publick amusement Vauxhall Gardens which must ever be an estate to its proprietor as it is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation there being a mixture of curious show gay exhibition musick vocal and instrumental not too refined for the general ear for all which only a shilling is paid nine hundred six and though last not least good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale nine hundred seven mister Thomas Tyers was bred to the law but having a handsome fortune vivacity of temper and eccentricity of mind he could not confine himself to the regularity of practice He therefore ran about the world with a pleasant carelessness amusing everybody by his desultory conversation nine hundred eight He abounded in anecdote but was not sufficiently attentive to accuracy I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical sketch of Johnson which he published being one among the various persons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend That sketch is however an entertaining little collection of fragments Those which he published of Pope and Addison are of higher merit but his fame must chiefly rest upon his Political Conferences in which he introduces several eminent persons delivering their sentiments in the way of dialogue and discovers a considerable share of learning various knowledge and discernment of character This much may I be allowed to say of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me and who lived with doctor Johnson in as easy a manner as almost any of his very numerous acquaintance mister Edwards had said to me aside that doctor Johnson should have been of a profession nine hundred nine I repeated the remark to Johnson that I might have his own thoughts on the subject JOHNSON Sir it would have been better that I had been of a profession I ought to have been a lawyer BOSWELL I do not think Sir it would have been better for we should not have had the English Dictionary JOHNSON But you would have had Reports BOSWELL Ay but there would not have been another who could have written the Dictionary There have been many very good Judges Suppose you had been Lord Chancellor you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind and in a more ornamented manner than perhaps any Chancellor ever did or ever will do But I believe causes have been as judiciously decided as you could have done JOHNSON Yes Sir Property has been as well settled Johnson however had a noble ambition floating in his mind and had undoubtedly often speculated on the possibility of his supereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the highest honours of the state Sir William Scott informs me that upon the death of the late Lord Lichfield who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford he said to Johnson What a pity it is Sir that you did not follow the profession of the law nine hundred ten You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great Britain and attained to the dignity of the peerage and now that the title of Lichfield your native city is extinct you might have had it nine hundred eleven Johnson upon this seemed much agitated and in an angry tone exclaimed Why will you vex me by suggesting this when it is too late nine hundred twelve But he did not repine at the prosperity of others The late doctor Thomas Leland told mister Courtenay that when mister Edmund Burke shewed Johnson his fine house and lands near Beaconsfield Johnson coolly said Non equidem invideo miror magis nine hundred thirteen Yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than Johnson or was more determined in maintaining the respect which he justly considered as due to it Of this besides the general tenor of his conduct in society some characteristical instances may be mentioned He told Sir Joshua Reynolds that once when he dined in a numerous company of booksellers where the room being small the head of the table at which he sat was almost close to the fire he persevered in suffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat rather than quit his place and let one of them sit above him Goldsmith in his diverting simplicity complained one day in a mixed company of Lord Camden I met him said he at Lord Clare s house nine hundred fourteen in the country and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man The company having laughed heartily Johnson stood forth in defence of his friend Nay Gentleman said he doctor Goldsmith is in the right A nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as Goldsmith and I think it is much against Lord Camden that he neglected him nine hundred fifteen Nor could he patiently endure to hear that such respect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities should be bestowed on men of slighter though perhaps more amusing talents I told him that one morning when I went to breakfast with Garrick who was very vain of his intimacy with Lord Camden nine hundred sixteen he accosted me thus Pray now did you did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner eh No Sir said I Pray what do you mean by the question Why replied Garrick with an affected indifference yet as if standing on tip toe Lord Camden has this moment left me We have had a long walk together JOHNSON Well Sir Garrick talked very properly Lord Camden was a little lawyer to be associating so familiarly with a player Sir Joshua Reynolds observed with great truth that Johnson considered Garrick to be as it were his property He would allow no man either to blame or to praise Garrick in his presence without contradicting him nine hundred seventeen Having fallen into a very serious frame of mind in which mutual expressions of kindness passed between us such as would be thought too vain in me to repeat I talked with regret of the sad inevitable certainty that one of us must survive the other JOHNSON Yes Sir that is an affecting consideration I remember Swift in one of his letters to Pope says I intend to come over that we may meet once more and when we must part it is what happens to all human beings nine hundred eighteen BOSWELL The hope that we shall see our departed friends nine hundred nineteen again must support the mind JOHNSON Why yes Sir BOSWELL There is a strange unwillingness to part with life independent of serious fears as to futurity A reverend friend of ours naming him tells me that he feels an uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his house his study his books JOHNSON This is foolish in nine hundred twenty A man need not be uneasy on these grounds for as he will retain his consciousness he may say with the philosopher Omnia mea mecum porto nine hundred twenty one BOSWELL True Sir we may carry our books in our heads but still there is something painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us pleasure I remember many years ago when my imagination was warm and I happened to be in a melancholy mood it distressed me to think of going into a state of being in which Shakspeare s poetry did not exist A lady whom I then much admired a very amiable woman humoured my fancy and relieved me by saying The first thing you will meet in the other world will be an elegant copy of Shakspeare s works presented to you doctor Johnson smiled benignantly at this and did not appear to disapprove of the notion We went to saint Clement s church again in the afternoon nine hundred twenty two and then returned and drank tea and coffee in missus Williams s room missus Desmoulins doing the honours of the tea table I observed that he would not even look at a proof sheet of his Life of Waller on Good Friday mister Allen the printer brought a book on agriculture which was printed and was soon to be published nine hundred twenty three It was a very strange performance the authour having mixed in it his own thoughts upon various topicks along with his remarks on ploughing sowing and other farming operations He seemed to be an absurd profane fellow and had introduced in his book many sneers at religion with equal ignorance and conceit doctor Johnson permitted me to read some passages aloud One was that he resolved to work on Sunday and did work but he owned he felt some weak compunction and he had this very curious reflection I was born in the wilds of Christianity and the briars and thorns still hang about me doctor Johnson could not help laughing at this ridiculous image yet was very angry at the fellow s impiety However said he the Reviewers will make him hang himself He however observed that formerly there might have been a dispensation obtained for working on Sunday in the time of harvest nine hundred twenty four Indeed in ritual observances were all the ministers of religion what they should be and what many of them are such a power might be wisely and safely lodged with the Church On Saturday April fourteen nine hundred twenty five I drank tea with him He praised the late mister Buncombe nine hundred twenty six of Canterbury as a pleasing man He used to come to me I did not seek much after him Indeed I never sought much after any body BOSWELL Lord Orrery nine hundred twenty seven I suppose JOHNSON No Sir I never went to him but when he sent for me BOSWELL Richardson nine hundred twenty eight JOHNSON Yes Sir But I sought after George Psalmanazar the most I used to go and sit with him at an alehouse in the city nine hundred twenty nine I am happy to mention another instance which I discovered of his seeking after a man of merit Soon after the Honourable Daines Barrington had published his excellent Observations on the Statutes Johnson waited on that worthy and learned gentleman and having told him his name courteously said I have read your book Sir with great pleasure and wish to be better known to you Thus began an acquaintance which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson lived Talking of a recent seditious delinquent nine hundred thirty he said They should set him in the pillory that he may be punished in a way that would disgrace him I observed that the pillory does not always disgrace And I mentioned an instance of a gentleman nine hundred thirty one who I thought was not dishonoured by it JOHNSON Ay but he was Sir He could not mouth and strut as he used to do after having been there People are not willing to ask a man to their tables who has stood in the pillory The Gentleman who had dined with us at doctor Percy s nine hundred thirty two came in Johnson attacked the Americans with intemperate vehemence of abuse I said something in their favour and added that I was always sorry when he talked on that subject This it seems exasperated him though he said nothing at the time The cloud was charged with sulphureous vapour which was afterwards to burst in thunder We talked of a gentleman nine hundred thirty three who was running out his fortune in London and I said We must get him out of it All his friends must quarrel with him and that will soon drive him away JOHNSON Nay Sir we ll send you to him If your company does not drive a man out of his house nothing will This was a horrible shock for which there was no visible cause I afterwards asked him why he had said so harsh a thing JOHNSON Because Sir you made me angry about the Americans BOSWELL But why did you not take your revenge directly JOHNSON smiling Because Sir I had nothing ready A man cannot strike till he has his weapons This was a candid and pleasant confession He shewed me to night his drawing room very genteelly fitted up and said missus Thrale sneered when I talked of my having asked you and your lady to live at my house nine hundred thirty four I was obliged to tell her that you would be in as respectable a situation in my house as in hers Sir the insolence of wealth will creep out BOSWELL She has a little both of the insolence of wealth and the conceit of parts JOHNSON The insolence of wealth is a wretched thing but the conceit of parts has some foundation nine hundred thirty five To be sure it should not be But who is without it BOSWELL Yourself Sir JOHNSON Why I play no tricks I lay no traps BOSWELL No Sir You are six feet high and you only do not stoop We talked of the numbers of people that sometimes have composed the household of great families I mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the present Earl of Eglintoune s father doctor Johnson seeming to doubt it I began to enumerate Let us see my Lord and my Lady two JOHNSON Nay Sir if you are to count by twos you may be long enough BOSWELL Well but now I add two sons and seven daughters and a servant for each that will make twenty so we have the fifth part already JOHNSON Very true You get at twenty pretty readily but you will not so easily get further on We grow to five feet pretty readily but it is not so easy to grow to seven On Sunday April nineteen being Easter day after the solemnities of the festival in saint Paul s Church I visited him but could not stay to dinner I expressed a wish to have the arguments for Christianity always in readiness that my religious faith might be as firm and clear as any proposition whatever so that I need not be under the least uneasiness when it should be attacked JOHNSON Sir you cannot answer all objections You have demonstration for a First Cause you see he must be good as well as powerful because there is nothing to make him otherwise and goodness of itself is preferable Yet you have against this what is very certain the unhappiness of human life This however gives us reason to hope for a future state of compensation that there may be a perfect system But of that we were not sure till we had a positive revelation I told him that his Rasselas had often made me unhappy for it represented the misery of human life so well and so convincingly to a thinking mind that if at any time the impression wore off and I felt myself easy I began to suspect some delusion On Monday April twenty nine hundred thirty six I found him at home in the morning We talked of a gentleman nine hundred thirty seven who we apprehended was gradually involving his circumstances by bad management JOHNSON Wasting a fortune is evaporation by a thousand imperceptible means If it were a stream they d stop it You must speak to him It is really miserable Were he a gamester it could be said he had hopes of winning Were he a bankrupt in trade he might have grown rich but he has neither spirit to spend nor resolution to spare He does not spend fast enough to have pleasure from it He has the crime of prodigality and the wretchedness of parsimony If a man is killed in a duel he is killed as many a one has been killed but it is a sad thing for a man to lie down and die to bleed to death because he has not fortitude enough to sear the wound or even to stitch it up I cannot but pause a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy and choice of language which in this instance and indeed on almost all occasions he displayed It was well observed by doctor Percy now Bishop of Dromore The conversation of Johnson is strong and clear and may be compared to an antique statue where every vein and muscle is distinct and bold Ordinary conversation resembles an inferiour cast On Saturday April twenty five I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds s with the learned doctor Musgrave nine hundred thirty eight Counsellor Leland of Ireland son to the historian missus Cholmondeley and some more ladies The Project nine hundred thirty nine a new poem was read to the company by doctor Musgrave JOHNSON Sir it has no power Were it not for the well known names with which it is filled it would be nothing the names carry the poet not the poet the names MUSGRAVE A temporary poem always entertains us JOHNSON So does an account of the criminals hanged yesterday entertain us He proceeded Demosthenes Taylor as he was called that is the Editor of Demosthenes was the most silent man the merest statue of a man that I have ever seen I once dined in company with him and all he said during the whole time was no more than Richard How a man should say only Richard it is not easy to imagine But it was thus doctor Douglas was talking of doctor Zachary Grey and ascribing to him something that was written by doctor Richard Grey So to correct him Taylor said imitating his affected sententious emphasis and nod Richard missus Cholmondeley in a high flow of spirits exhibited some lively sallies of hyperbolical compliment to Johnson with whom she had been long acquainted and was very easy nine hundred forty He was quick in catching the manner of the moment and answered her somewhat in the style of the hero of a romance Madam you crown me with unfading laurels I happened I know not how to say that a pamphlet meant a prose piece JOHNSON No Sir A few sheets of poetry unbound are a pamphlet nine hundred forty one as much as a few sheets of prose MUSGRAVE A pamphlet may be understood to mean a poetical piece in Westminster Hall that is in formal language but in common language it is understood to mean prose JOHNSON and here was one of the many instances of his knowing clearly and telling exactly how a thing is A pamphlet is understood in common language to mean prose only from this that there is so much more prose written than poetry as when we say a book prose is understood for the same reason though a book may as well be in poetry as in prose We understand what is most general and we name what is less frequent We talked of a lady s verses on Ireland MISS REYNOLDS Have you seen them Sir JOHNSON No Madam I have seen a translation from Horace by one of her daughters She shewed it me MISS REYNOLDS And how was it Sir JOHNSON Why very well for a young Miss s verses that is to say compared with excellence nothing but very well for the person who wrote them I am vexed at being shewn verses in that manner MISS REYNOLDS But if they should be good why not give them hearty praise JOHNSON Why Madam because I have not then got the better of my bad humour from having been shewn them You must consider Madam beforehand they may be bad as well as good Nobody has a right to put another under such a difficulty that he must either hurt the person by telling the truth or hurt himself by telling what is not true nine hundred forty two BOSWELL A man often shews his writings to people of eminence to obtain from them either from their good nature or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly a commendation of which he may afterwards avail himself JOHNSON Very true Sir Therefore the man who is asked by an authour what he thinks of his work is put to the torture and is not obliged to speak the truth so that what he says is not considered as his opinion yet he has said it and cannot retract it and this authour when mankind are hunting him with a cannister at his tail can say I would not have published had not Johnson or Reynolds or Musgrave or some other good judge commended the work Yet I consider it as a very difficult question in conscience whether one should advise a man not to publish a work if profit be his object for the man may say Had it not been for you I should have had the money Now you cannot be sure for you have only your own opinion and the publick may think very differently SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS You must upon such an occasion have two judgments one as to the real value of the work the other as to what may please the general taste at the time JOHNSON But you can be sure of neither and therefore I should scruple much to give a suppressive vote Both Goldsmith s comedies were once refused his first by Garrick nine hundred forty three his second by Colman who was prevailed on at last by much solicitation nay a kind of force to bring it on nine hundred forty four His Vicar of Wakefield I myself did not think would have had much success It was written and sold to a bookseller before his Traveller but published after so little expectation had the bookseller from it Had it been sold after the Traveller he might have had twice as much money for it though sixty guineas was no mean price The bookseller had the advantage of Goldsmith s reputation from The Traveller in the sale though Goldsmith had it not in selling the copy nine hundred forty five SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS The Beggar s Opera affords a proof how strangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance Burke thinks it has no merit JOHNSON It was refused by one of the houses nine hundred forty six but I should have thought it would succeed not from any great excellence in the writing but from the novelty and the general spirit and gaiety of the piece which keeps the audience always attentive and dismisses them in good humour We went to the drawing room where was a considerable increase of company Several of us got round doctor Johnson and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works that there might be a complete edition He smiled and evaded our entreaties That he intended to do it I have no doubt because I have heard him say so and I have in my possession an imperfect list fairly written out which he entitles Historia Studiorum I once got from one of his friends a list which there was pretty good reason to suppose was accurate for it was written down in his presence by this friend who enumerated each article aloud and had some of them mentioned to him by mister Levett in concert with whom it was made out and Johnson who heard all this did not contradict it But when I shewed a copy of this list to him and mentioned the evidence for its exactness he laughed and said I was willing to let them go on as they pleased and never interfered Upon which I read it to him article by article and got him positively to own or refuse and then having obtained certainty so far I got some other articles confirmed by him directly and afterwards from time to time made additions under his sanction nine hundred forty seven His friend Edward Cave having been mentioned he told us Cave used to sell ten thousand of The Gentleman s Magazine yet such was then his minute attention and anxiety that the sale should not suffer the smallest decrease that he would name a particular person who he heard had talked of leaving off the Magazine and would say Let us have something good next month It was observed that avarice was inherent in some dispositions JOHNSON No man was born a miser because no man was born to possession Every man is born cupidus desirous of getting but not avarus desirous of keeping BOSWELL I have heard old mister Sheridan maintain with much ingenuity that a complete miser is a happy man a miser who gives himself wholly to the one passion of saving JOHNSON That is flying in the face of all the world who have called an avaricious man a miser because he is miserable nine hundred forty eight No Sir a man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man because he has both enjoyments The conversation having turned on Bon Mots he quoted from one of the Ana an exquisite instance of flattery in a maid of honour in France who being asked by the Queen what o clock it was answered What your Majesty pleases nine hundred forty nine He admitted that mister Burke s classical pun upon mister Wilkes s being carried on the shoulders of the mob Numerisque fertur Lege solutus nine hundred fifty was admirable and though he was strangely unwilling to allow to that extraordinary man the talent of wit nine hundred fifty one he also laughed with approbation at another of his playful conceits which was that Horace has in one line given a description of a good desirable manour Est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines nine hundred fifty two that is to say a modus nine hundred fifty three as to the tithes and certain fines nine hundred fifty four He observed A man cannot with propriety speak of himself except he relates simple facts as I was at Richmond or what depends on mensuration as I am six feet high He is sure he has been at Richmond he is sure he is six feet high but he cannot be sure he is wise or that he has any other excellence Then all censure of a man s self is oblique praise It is in order to shew how much he can spare It has all the invidiousness of self praise and all the reproach of falsehood BOSWELL Sometimes it may proceed from a man s strong consciousness of his faults being observed He knows that others would throw him down and therefore he had better lye down softly of his own accord On Tuesday April twenty eight he was engaged to dine at General Paoli s where as I have already observed nine hundred fifty five I was still entertained in elegant hospitality and with all the ease and comfort of a home I called on him and accompanied him in a hackney coach We stopped first at the bottom of Hedge lane into which he went to leave a letter with good news for a poor man in distress as he told me nine hundred fifty six I did not question him particularly as to this He himself often resembled Lady Bolingbroke s lively description of Pope that he was un politique aux choux et aux raves nine hundred fifty seven He would say I dine to day in Grosvenor square this might be with a Duke nine hundred fifty eight or perhaps I dine to day at the other end of the town or A gentleman of great eminence called on me yesterday He loved thus to keep things floating in conjecture Omne ignotum pro magnifico est nine hundred fifty nine I believe I ventured to dissipate the cloud to unveil the mystery more freely and frequently than any of his friends We stopped again at Wirgman s the well known toy shop nine hundred sixty in saint James s street at the corner of saint James s place to which he had been directed but not clearly for he searched about some time and could not find it at first and said To direct one only to a corner shop is toying with one I suppose he meant this as a play upon the word toy it was the first time that I knew him stoop to such sport nine hundred sixty one After he had been some time in the shop he sent for me to come out of the coach and help him to choose a pair of silver buckles as those he had were too small Probably this alteration in dress had been suggested by missus Thrale by associating with whom his external appearance was much improved He got better cloaths and the dark colour from which he never deviated was enlivened by metal buttons His wigs too were much better and during their travels in France he was furnished with a Paris made wig of handsome construction nine hundred sixty two This choosing of silver buckles was a negociation Sir said he I will not have the ridiculous large ones now in fashion and I will give no more than a guinea for a pair Such were the principles of the business and after some examination he was fitted As we drove along I found him in a talking humour of which I availed myself BOSWELL I was this morning in Ridley s shop Sir and was told that the collection called Johnsoniana nine hundred sixty three has sold very much JOHNSON Yet the Journey to the Hebrides has not had a great sale nine hundred sixty four BOSWELL That is strange JOHNSON Yes Sir for in that book I have told the world a great deal that they did not know before BOSWELL I drank chocolate Sir this morning with mister Eld and to my no small surprize found him to be a Staffordshire Whig nine hundred sixty five a being which I did not believe had existed JOHNSON Sir there are rascals in all countries BOSWELL Eld said a Tory was a creature generated between a non juring parson and one s grandmother JOHNSON And I have always said the first Whig was the Devil nine hundred sixty six BOSWELL He certainly was Sir The Devil was impatient of subordination he was the first who resisted power Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven nine hundred sixty seven At General Paoli s were Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Langton Marchese Gherardi of Lombardy and mister John Spottiswoode the younger of Spottiswoode nine hundred sixty eight the solicitor At this time fears of an invasion were circulated to obviate which mister Spottiswoode observed that mister Fraser the engineer who had lately come from Dunkirk said that the French had the same fears of us JOHNSON It is thus that mutual cowardice keeps us in peace Were one half of mankind brave and one half cowards the brave would be always beating the cowards Were all brave they would lead a very uneasy life all would be continually fighting but being all cowards we go on very well nine hundred sixty nine We talked of drinking wine JOHNSON I require wine only when I am alone I have then often wished for it and often taken it nine hundred seventy SPOTTISWOODE What by way of a companion Sir JOHNSON To get rid of myself to send myself away Wine gives great pleasure and every pleasure is of itself a good It is a good unless counterbalanced by evil A man may have a strong reason not to drink wine and that may be greater than the pleasure Wine makes a man better pleased with himself I do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others Sometimes it does But the danger is that while a man grows better pleased with himself he may be growing less pleasing to others nine hundred seventy one Wine gives a man nothing It neither gives him knowledge nor wit it only animates a man and enables him to bring out what a dread of the company has repressed It only puts in motion what has been locked up in frost But this may be good or it may be bad nine hundred seventy two SPOTTISWOODE So Sir wine is a key which opens a box but this box may be either full or empty JOHNSON Nay Sir conversation is the key wine is a pick lock which forces open the box and injures it A man should cultivate his mind so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine which wine gives BOSWELL The great difficulty of resisting wine is from benevolence For instance a good worthy man asks you to taste his wine which he has had twenty years in his cellar JOHNSON Sir all this notion about benevolence arises from a man s imagining himself to be of more importance to others than he really is They don t care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS Yes they do for the time JOHNSON For the time If they care this minute they forget it the next And as for the good worthy man how do you know he is good and worthy No good and worthy man will insist upon another man s drinking wine As to the wine twenty years in the cellar of ten men three say this merely because they must say something three are telling a lie when they say they have had the wine twenty years three would rather save the wine one perhaps cares I allow it is something to please one s company and people are always pleased with those who partake pleasure with them But after a man has brought himself to relinquish the great personal pleasure which arises from drinking wine any other consideration is a trifle To please others by drinking wine is something only if there be nothing against it I should however be sorry to offend worthy men Curst be the verse how well so e er it flow That tends to make one worthy man my foe nine hundred seventy three BOSWELL Curst be the spring the water JOHNSON But let us consider what a sad thing it would be if we were obliged to drink or do any thing else that may happen to be agreeable to the company where we are LANGTON By the same rule you must join with a gang of cut purses JOHNSON Yes Sir but yet we must do justice to wine we must allow it the power it possesses To make a man pleased with himself let me tell you is doing a very great thing nine hundred seventy four Si patriae volumus si Nobis vivere cari nine hundred seventy five I was at this time myself a water drinker upon trial by Johnson s recommendation nine hundred seventy six JOHNSON Boswell is a bolder combatant than Sir Joshua he argues for wine without the help of wine but Sir Joshua with it SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS But to please one s company is a strong motive JOHNSON who from drinking only water supposed every body who drank wine to be elevated I won t argue any more with you Sir You are too far gone nine hundred seventy seven SIR JOSHUA I should have thought so indeed Sir had I made such a speech as you have now done JOHNSON drawing himself in and I really thought blushing Nay don t be angry I did not mean to offend you SIR JOSHUA At first the taste of wine was disagreeable to me but I brought myself to drink it that I might be like other people The pleasure of drinking wine is so connected with pleasing your company that altogether there is something of social goodness in it JOHNSON Sir this is only saying the same thing over again SIR JOSHUA No this is new JOHNSON You put it in new words but it is an old thought This is one of the disadvantages of wine It makes a man mistake words for thoughts BOSWELL I think it is a new thought at least it is in a new attitude JOHNSON Nay Sir it is only in a new coat or an old coat with a new facing Then laughing heartily It is the old dog in a new doublet An extraordinary instance however may occur where a man s patron will do nothing for him unless he will drink there may be a good reason for drinking I mentioned a nobleman nine hundred seventy eight who I believed was really uneasy if his company would not drink hard JOHNSON That is from having had people about him whom he has been accustomed to command BOSWELL Supposing I should be tete a tete with him at table JOHNSON Sir there is no more reason for your drinking with him than his being sober with you BOSWELL Why that is true for it would do him less hurt to be sober than it would do me to get drunk JOHNSON Yes Sir and from what I have heard of him one would not wish to sacrifice himself to such a man If he must always have somebody to drink with him he should buy a slave and then he would be sure to have it They who submit to drink as another pleases make themselves his slaves BOSWELL But Sir you will surely make allowance for the duty of hospitality A gentleman who loves drinking comes to visit me JOHNSON Sir a man knows whom he visits he comes to the table of a sober man BOSWELL But Sir you and I should not have been so well received in the Highlands and Hebrides if I had not drunk with our worthy friends Had I drunk water only as you did they would not have been so cordial JOHNSON Sir William Temple mentions that in his travels through the Netherlands he had two or three gentlemen with him and when a bumper was necessary he put it on them nine hundred seventy nine Were I to travel again through the islands I would have Sir Joshua with me to take the bumpers BOSWELL But Sir let me put a case Suppose Sir Joshua should take a jaunt into Scotland he does me the honour to pay me a visit at my house in the country I am overjoyed at seeing him we are quite by ourselves shall I unsociably and churlishly let him sit drinking by himself No no my dear Sir Joshua you shall not be treated so I will take a bottle with you The celebrated missus Rudd being mentioned JOHNSON Fifteen years ago I should have gone to see her SPOTTISWOODE Because she was fifteen years younger JOHNSON No Sir but now they have a trick of putting every thing into the newspapers nine hundred eighty He begged of General Paoli to repeat one of the introductory stanzas of the first book of Tasso s Jerusalem which he did and then Johnson found fault with the simile of sweetening the edges of a cup for a child being transferred from Lucretius into an epick poem nine hundred eighty one The General said he did not imagine Homer s poetry was so ancient as is supposed because he ascribes to a Greek colony circumstances of refinement not found in Greece itself at a later period when Thucydides wrote JOHNSON I recollect but one passage quoted by Thucydides from Homer which is not to be found in our copies of Homer s works I am for the antiquity of Homer and think that a Grecian colony by being nearer Persia might be more refined than the mother country On Wednesday April twenty nine I dined with him at mister Allan Ramsay s where were Lord Binning doctor Robertson the historian Sir Joshua Reynolds and the Honourable missus Boscawen widow of the Admiral and mother of the present Viscount Falmouth of whom if it be not presumptuous in me to praise her I would say that her manners are the most agreeable and her conversation the best of any lady with whom I ever had the happiness to be acquainted Before Johnson came we talked a good deal of him Ramsay said he had always found him a very polite man and that he treated him with great respect which he did very sincerely I said I worshipped him ROBERTSON But some of you spoil him you should not worship him you should worship no man BOSWELL I cannot help worshipping him he is so much superiour to other men ROBERTSON In criticism and in wit in conversation he is no doubt very excellent but in other respects he is not above other men he will believe any thing nine hundred eighty two and will strenuously defend the most minute circumstance connected with the Church of England BOSWELL Believe me Doctor you are much mistaken as to this for when you talk with him calmly in private nine hundred eighty three he is very liberal in his way of thinking ROBERTSON He and I have been always very gracious nine hundred eighty four the first time I met him was one evening at Strahan s when he had just had an unlucky altercation with Adam Smith nine hundred eighty five to whom he had been so rough that Strahan after Smith was gone had remonstrated with him and told him that I was coming soon and that he was uneasy to think that he might behave in the same manner to me No no Sir said Johnson I warrant you Robertson and I shall do very well Accordingly he was gentle and good humoured and courteous with me the whole evening and he has been so upon every occasion that we have met since I have often said laughing that I have been in a great measure indebted to Smith for my good reception BOSWELL His power of reasoning is very strong and he has a peculiar art of drawing characters which is as rare as good portrait painting SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS He is undoubtedly admirable in this but in order to mark the characters which he draws he overcharges them and gives people more than they really have whether of good or bad No sooner did he of whom we had been thus talking so easily arrive than we were all as quiet as a school upon the entrance of the head master nine hundred eighty six and were very soon set down to a table covered with such variety of good things as contributed not a little to dispose him to be pleased RAMSAY I am old enough to have been a contemporary of Pope His poetry was highly admired in his life time more a great deal than after his death nine hundred eighty seven JOHNSON Sir it has not been less admired since his death no authours ever had so much fame in their own life time as Pope and Voltaire and Pope s poetry has been as much admired since his death as during his life it has only not been as much talked of but that is owing to its being now more distant and people having other writings to talk of Virgil is less talked of than Pope and Homer is less talked of than Virgil but they are not less admired We must read what the world reads at the moment It has been maintained that this superfoetation this teeming of the press in modern times is prejudicial to good literature because it obliges us to read so much of what is of inferiour value in order to be in the fashion so that better works are neglected for want of time because a man will have more gratification of his vanity in conversation from having read modern books than from having read the best works of antiquity But it must be considered that we have now more knowledge generally diffused all our ladies read now which is a great extension nine hundred eighty eight Modern writers are the moons of literature they shine with reflected light with light borrowed from the ancients Greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge Rome of elegance RAMSAY I suppose Homer s Iliad to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time I should like to see a translation of it in poetical prose like the book of Ruth or Job ROBERTSON Would you doctor Johnson who are master of the English language but try your hand upon a part of it JOHNSON Sir you could not read it without the pleasure of verse nine hundred eighty nine We talked of antiquarian researches JOHNSON All that is really known of the ancient state of Britain is contained in a few pages We can know no more than what the old writers have told us yet what large books have we upon it the whole of which excepting such parts as are taken from those old writers is all a dream such as Whitaker s Manchester nine hundred ninety I have heard Henry s History of Britain well spoken of I am told it is carried on in separate divisions as the civil the military the religious history I wish much to have one branch well done and that is the history of manners of common life ROBERTSON Henry should have applied his attention to that alone which is enough for any man and he might have found a great deal scattered in various books had he read solely with that view Henry erred in not selling his first volume at a moderate price to the booksellers that they might have pushed him on till he had got reputation nine hundred ninety one I sold my History of Scotland at a moderate price nine hundred ninety two as a work by which the booksellers might either gain or not and Cadell has told me that Millar and he have got six thousand pounds by it I afterwards received a much higher price for my writings An authour should sell his first work for what the booksellers will give till it shall appear whether he is an authour of merit or which is the same thing as to purchase money an authour who pleases the publick doctor Robertson expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman nine hundred ninety three that he was one of the strongest minded men that ever lived that he would sit in company quite sluggish while there was nothing to call forth his intellectual vigour but the moment that any important subject was started for instance how this country is to be defended against a French invasion he would rouse himself and shew his extraordinary talents with the most powerful ability and animation JOHNSON Yet this man cut his own throat The true strong and sound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and small Now I am told the King of Prussia will say to a servant Bring me a bottle of such a wine which came in such a year it lies in such a corner of the cellars I would have a man great in great things and elegant in little things He said to me afterwards when we were by ourselves Robertson was in a mighty romantick humour nine hundred ninety four he talked of one whom he did not know but I downed nine hundred ninety five him with the King of Prussia Yes Sir said I you threw a bottle at his head An ingenious gentleman was mentioned concerning whom both Robertson and Ramsay agreed that he had a constant firmness of mind for after a laborious day and amidst a multiplicity of cares and anxieties he would sit down with his sisters and be quite cheerful and good humoured Such a disposition it was observed was a happy gift of nature JOHNSON I do not think so a man has from nature a certain portion of mind the use he makes of it depends upon his own free will That a man has always the same firmness of mind I do not say because every man feels his mind less firm at one time than another but I think a man s being in a good or bad humour depends upon his will I however could not help thinking that a man s humour is often uncontroulable by his will Johnson harangued against drinking wine nine hundred ninety six A man said he may choose whether he will have abstemiousness and knowledge or claret and ignorance doctor Robertson who is very companionable was beginning to dissent as to the proscription of claret nine hundred ninety seven JOHNSON with a placid smile Nay Sir you shall not differ with me as I have said that the man is most perfect who takes in the most things I am for knowledge and claret ROBERTSON holding a glass of generous claret in his hand Sir I can only drink your health JOHNSON Sir I should be sorry if you should be ever in such a state as to be able to do nothing more ROBERTSON doctor Johnson allow me to say that in one respect I have the advantage of you when you were in Scotland you would not come to hear any of our preachers nine hundred ninety eight whereas when I am here I attend your publick worship without scruple and indeed with great satisfaction JOHNSON Why Sir that is not so extraordinary the King of Siam sent ambassadors to Louis the Fourteenth but Louis the Fourteenth sent none to the King of Siam nine hundred ninety nine Here my friend for once discovered a want of knowledge or forgetfulness for Louis the Fourteenth did send an embassy to the King of Siam and the Abbe Choisi who was employed in it published an account of it in two volumes one thousand Next day Thursday April thirty I found him at home by himself JOHNSON Well Sir Ramsay gave us a splendid dinner I love Ramsay You will not find a man in whose conversation there is more instruction more information and more elegance than in Ramsay s BOSWELL What I admire in Ramsay is his continuing to be so young JOHNSON Why yes Sir it is to be admired I value myself upon this that there is nothing of the old man in my conversation I am now sixty eight and I have no more of it than at twenty eight ten oh one BOSWELL But Sir would not you wish to know old age He who is never an old man does not know the whole of human life for old age is one of the divisions of it JOHNSON Nay Sir what talk is this BOSWELL I mean Sir the Sphinx s description of it morning noon and night I would know night as well as morning and noon JOHNSON What Sir would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age Would you have the gout Would you have decrepitude Seeing him heated I would not argue any farther but I was confident that I was in the right I would in due time be a Nestor an elder of the people and there should be some difference between the conversation of twenty eight and sixty eight A grave picture should not be gay There is a serene solemn placid old age JOHNSON missus Thrale s mother said of me what flattered me much A clergyman was complaining of want of society in the country where he lived and said They talk of runts that is young cows Sir said missus Salusbury mister Johnson would learn to talk of runts meaning that I was a man who would make the most of my situation whatever it was He added I think myself a very polite man ten oh two On Saturday May two I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds s where there was a very large company and a great deal of conversation but owing to some circumstance which I cannot now recollect I have no record of any part of it except that there were several people there by no means of the Johnsonian school so that less attention was paid to him than usual which put him out of humour and upon some imaginary offence from me he attacked me with such rudeness that I was vexed and angry because it gave those persons an opportunity of enlarging upon his supposed ferocity and ill treatment of his best friends I was so much hurt and had my pride so much roused that I kept away from him for a week and perhaps might have kept away much longer nay gone to Scotland without seeing him again had not we fortunately met and been reconciled To such unhappy chances are human friendships liable ten oh three On Friday May eight I dined with him at mister Langton s I was reserved and silent which I suppose he perceived and might recollect the cause After dinner when mister Langton was called out of the room and we were by ourselves he drew his chair near to mine and said in a tone of conciliating courtesy ten oh four Well how have you done BOSWELL Sir you have made me very uneasy by your behaviour to me when we were last at Sir Joshua Reynolds s You know my dear Sir no man has a greater respect and affection for you or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve you Now to treat me so He insisted that I had interrupted him which I assured him was not the case and proceeded But why treat me so before people who neither love you nor me JOHNSON Well I am sorry for it I ll make it up to you twenty different ways as you please BOSWELL I said to day to Sir Joshua when he observed that you tossed ten oh five me sometimes I don t care how often or how high he tosses me when only friends are present for then I fall upon soft ground but I do not like falling on stones which is the case when enemies are present I think this a pretty good image Sir JOHNSON Sir it is one of the happiest I have ever heard The truth is there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time unless they were irritated by some malignant infusion by other hands We were instantly as cordial again as ever and joined in hearty laugh at some ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends ten oh six BOSWELL Do you think Sir it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face JOHNSON Why Sir that depends upon the man and the thing If it is a slight man and a slight thing you may for you take nothing valuable from him He said I read yesterday doctor Blair s sermon ten oh seven on Devotion from the text Cornelius a devout man ten oh eight His doctrine is the best limited the best expressed there is the most warmth without fanaticism the most rational transport There is one part of it which I disapprove and I d have him correct it which is that he who does not feel joy in religion is far from the kingdom of heaven There are many good men whose fear of GOD predominates over their love It may discourage It was rashly said A noble sermon it is indeed I wish Blair would come over to the Church of England When mister Langton returned to us the flow of talk went on An eminent author ten oh nine being mentioned JOHNSON He is not a pleasant man His conversation is neither instructive nor brilliant He does not talk as if impelled by any fulness of knowledge or vivacity of imagination His conversation is like that of any other sensible man He talks with no wish either to inform or to hear but only because he thinks it does not become to sit in a company and say nothing mister Langton having repeated the anecdote of Addison having distinguished between his powers in conversation and in writing by saying I have only nine pence in my pocket but I can draw for a thousand pounds ten ten JOHNSON He had not that retort ready Sir he had prepared it before hand LANGTON turning to me A fine surmise Set a thief to catch a thief Johnson called the East Indians barbarians BOSWELL You will except the Chinese Sir JOHNSON No Sir BOSWELL Have they not arts JOHNSON They have pottery BOSWELL What do you say to the written characters of their language JOHNSON Sir they have not an alphabet They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed BOSWELL There is more learning in their language than in any other from the immense number of their characters JOHNSON It is only more difficult from its rudeness as there is more labour in hewing down a tree with a stone than with an axe He said I have been reading Lord Kames s Sketches of the History of Man In treating of severity of punishment he mentions that of Madame Lapouchin in Russia but he does not give it fairly for I have looked at Chappe D Auteroche ten eleven from whom he has taken it He stops where it is said that the spectators thought her innocent and leaves out what follows that she nevertheless was guilty Now this is being as culpable as one can conceive to misrepresent fact in a book and for what motive It is like one of those lies which people tell one cannot see why The woman s life was spared and no punishment was too great for the favourite of an Empress who had conspired to dethrone her mistress BOSWELL He was only giving a picture of the lady in her sufferings JOHNSON Nay don t endeavour to palliate this Guilt is a principal feature in the picture Kames is puzzled with a question that puzzled me when I was a very young man Why is it that the interest of money is lower when money is plentiful for five pounds has the same proportion of value to a hundred pounds when money is plentiful as when it is scarce A lady explained it to me It is said she because when money is plentiful there are so many more who have money to lend that they bid down one another Many have then a hundred pounds and one says Take mine rather than another s and you shall have it at four per cent BOSWELL Does Lord Kames decide the question JOHNSON I think he leaves it as he found it ten twelve BOSWELL This must have been an extraordinary lady who instructed you Sir May I ask who she was JOHNSON Molly Aston ten thirteen Sir the sister of those ladies with whom you dined at Lichfield ten fourteen I shall be at home to morrow BOSWELL Then let us dine by ourselves at the Mitre to keep up the old custom the custom of the manor the custom of the mitre JOHNSON Sir so it shall be On Saturday May nine we fulfilled our purpose of dining by ourselves at the Mitre according to old custom There was on these occasions a little circumstance of kind attention to missus Williams which must not be omitted Before coming out and leaving her to dine alone he gave her choice of a chicken a sweetbread or any other little nice thing which was carefully sent to her from the tavern ready drest Our conversation to day I know not how turned I think for the only time at any length during our long acquaintance upon the sensual intercourse between the sexes the delight of which he ascribed chiefly to imagination Were it not for imagination Sir said he a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess But such is the adventitious charm of fancy that we find men who have violated the best principles of society and ruined their fame and their fortune that they might possess a woman of rank It would not be proper to record the particulars of such a conversation in moments of unreserved frankness when nobody was present on whom it could have any hurtful effect That subject when philosophically treated may surely employ the mind in as curious discussion and as innocently as anatomy provided that those who do treat it keep clear of inflammatory incentives From grave to gay from lively to severe ten fifteen we were soon engaged in very different speculation humbly and reverently considering and wondering at the universal mystery of all things as our imperfect faculties can now judge of them There are said he innumerable questions to which the inquisitive mind can in this state receive no answer Why do you and I exist Why was this world created Since it was to be created why was it not created sooner On Sunday May ten I supped with him at mister Hoole s with Sir Joshua Reynolds I have neglected the memorial of this evening so as to remember no more of it than two particulars one that he strenuously opposed an argument by Sir Joshua that virtue was preferable to vice considering this life only and that a man would be virtuous were it only to preserve his character and that he expressed much wonder at the curious formation of the bat a mouse with wings saying that it was almost as strange a thing in physiology as if the fabulous dragon could be seen On Tuesday May twelve I waited on the Earl of Marchmont to know if his Lordship would favour doctor Johnson with information concerning Pope whose Life he was about to write Johnson had not flattered himself with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman for he said to me when I mentioned Lord Marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about Pope Sir he will tell me nothing I had the honour of being known to his Lordship and applied to him of myself without being commissioned by Johnson His Lordship behaved in the most polite and obliging manner promised to tell all he recollected about Pope and was so very courteous as to say Tell doctor Johnson I have a great respect for him and am ready to shew it in any way I can I am to be in the city to morrow and will call at his house as I return His Lordship however asked Will he write the Lives of the Poets impartially He was the first that brought Whig and Tory into a Dictionary ten sixteen And what do you think of his definition of Excise Do you know the history of his aversion to the word transpire ten seventeen Then taking down the folio Dictionary he shewed it with this censure on its secondary sense To escape from secrecy to notice a sense lately innovated from France without necessity ten eighteen The truth was Lord Bolingbroke who left the Jacobites first used it therefore it was to be condemned He should have shewn what word would do for it if it was unnecessary I afterwards put the question to Johnson Why Sir said he get abroad BOSWELL That Sir is using two words ten nineteen JOHNSON Sir there is no end of this You may as well insist to have a word for old age BOSWELL Well Sir Senectus JOHNSON Nay Sir to insist always that there should be one word to express a thing in English because there is one in another language is to change the language I availed myself of this opportunity to hear from his Lordship many particulars both of Pope and Lord Bolingbroke which I have in writing ten twenty I proposed to Lord Marchmont that he should revise Johnson s Life of Pope So said his Lordship you would put me in a dangerous situation You know he knocked down Osborne the bookseller ten twenty one Elated with the success of my spontaneous exertion to procure material and respectable aid to Johnson for his very favourite work The Lives of the Poets I hastened down to mister Thrale s at Streatham where he now was that I might insure his being at home next day and after dinner when I thought he would receive the good news in the best humour I announced it eagerly I have been at work for you to day Sir I have been with Lord Marchmont He bade me tell you he has a great respect for you and will call on you to morrow at one o clock and communicate all he knows about Pope Here I paused in full expectation that he would be pleased with this intelligence would praise my active merit and would be alert to embrace such an offer from a nobleman But whether I had shewn an over exultation which provoked his spleen or whether he was seized with a suspicion that I had obtruded him on Lord Marchmont and humbled him too much or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill humour I know not but to my surprize the result was JOHNSON I shall not be in town to morrow I don t care to know about Pope missus THRALE surprized as I was and a little angry I suppose Sir mister Boswell thought that as you are to write Pope s Life you would wish to know about him JOHNSON Wish why yes If it rained knowledge I d hold out my hand but I would not give myself the trouble to go in quest of it There was no arguing with him at the moment Some time afterwards he said Lord Marchmont will call on me and then I shall call on Lord Marchmont mister Thrale was uneasy at his unaccountable caprice ten twenty two and told me that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting between Lord Marchmont and him it would never take place which would be a great pity I sent a card to his Lordship to be left at Johnson s house acquainting him that doctor Johnson could not be in town next day but would do himself the honour of waiting on him at another time I give this account fairly as a specimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occasionally to struggle from something morbid in his constitution Let the most censorious of my readers suppose himself to have a violent fit of the tooth ach or to have received a severe stroke on the shin bone and when in such a state to be asked a question and if he has any candour he will not be surprized at the answers which Johnson sometimes gave in moments of irritation which let me assure them is exquisitely painful But it must not be erroneously supposed that he was in the smallest degree careless concerning any work which he undertook or that he was generally thus peevish It will be seen that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with Lord Marchmont at his Lordship s house ten twenty three and this very afternoon he soon forgot any fretfulness and fell into conversation as usual I mentioned a reflection having been thrown out against four Peers for having presumed to rise in opposition to the opinion of the twelve Judges in a cause in the House of Lords ten twenty four as if that were indecent JOHNSON Sir there is no ground for censure The Peers are Judges themselves and supposing them really to be of a different opinion they might from duty be in opposition to the Judges who were there only to be consulted In this observation I fully concurred with him for unquestionably all the Peers are vested with the highest judicial powers and when they are confident that they understand a cause are not obliged nay ought not to acquiesce in the opinion of the ordinary Law Judges or even in that of those who from their studies and experience are called the Law Lords I consider the Peers in general as I do a Jury who ought to listen with respectful attention to the sages of the law but if after hearing them they have a firm opinion of their own are bound as honest men to decide accordingly Nor is it so difficult for them to understand even law questions as is generally thought provided they will bestow sufficient attention upon them This observation was made by my honoured relation the late Lord Cathcart who had spent his life in camps and courts yet assured me that he could form a clear opinion upon most of the causes that came before the House of Lords as they were so well enucleated ten twenty five in the Cases missus Thrale told us that a curious clergyman of our acquaintance had discovered a licentious stanza which Pope had originally in his Universal Prayer before the stanza What conscience dictates to be done Or warns us ten twenty six not to do c It was thus Can sins of moment claim the rod Of everlasting fires And that offend great Nature s GOD Which Nature s self inspires ten twenty seven and that doctor Johnson observed it had been borrowed from Guarini There are indeed in Pastor Fido many such flimsy superficial reasonings as that in the last two lines of this stanza BOSWELL In that stanza of Pope s rod of fires is certainly a bad metaphor missus THRALE And sins of moment is a faulty expression for its true import is momentous which cannot be intended JOHNSON It must have been written of moments Of moment is momentous of moments momentary I warrant you however Pope wrote this stanza and some friend struck it out Boileau wrote some such thing and Arnaud ten twenty eight struck it out saying Vous gagnerez deux ou trois impies et perdrez je ne scais combien des honnettes gens These fellows want to say a daring thing and don t know how to go about it Mere poets know no more of fundamental principles than Here he was interrupted somehow missus Thrale mentioned Dryden JOHNSON He puzzled himself about predestination How foolish was it in Pope to give all his friendship to Lords who thought they honoured him by being with him and to choose such Lords as Burlington and Cobham and Bolingbroke Bathurst was negative a pleasing man and I have heard no ill of Marchmont and then always saying I do not value you for being a Lord which was a sure proof that he did ten twenty nine I never say I do not value Boswell more for being born to an estate because I do not care BOSWELL Nor for being a Scotchman JOHNSON Nay Sir I do value you more for being a Scotchman You are a Scotchman without the faults of a Scotchman You would not have been so valuable as you are had you not been a Scotchman Talking of divorces I asked if Othello s doctrine was not plausible He that is robb d not wanting what is stolen Let him not know t and he s not robb d at all ten thirty doctor Johnson and missus Thrale joined against this JOHNSON Ask any man if he d wish not to know of such an injury BOSWELL Would you tell your friend to make him unhappy JOHNSON Perhaps Sir I should not but that would be from prudence on my own account A man would tell his father BOSWELL Yes because he would not have spurious children to get any share of the family inheritance missus THRALE Or he would tell his brother BOSWELL Certainly his elder brother JOHNSON You would tell your friend of a woman s infamy to prevent his marrying a whore there is the same reason to tell him of his wife s infidelity when he is married to prevent the consequences of imposition It is a breach of confidence not to tell a friend BOSWELL Would you tell mister ten thirty one naming a gentleman who assuredly was not in the least danger of such a miserable disgrace though married to a fine woman JOHNSON No Sir because it would do no good he is so sluggish he d never go to parliament and get through a divorce He said of one of our friends ten thirty two He is ruining himself without pleasure A man who loses at play or who runs out his fortune at court makes his estate less in hopes of making it bigger I am sure of this word which was often used by him but it is a sad thing to pass through the quagmire of parsimony to the gulph of ruin To pass over the flowery path of extravagance is very well Amongst the numerous prints pasted ten thirty three on the walls of the dining room at Streatham was Hogarth s Modern Midnight Conversation I asked him what he knew of Parson Ford ten thirty four who makes a conspicuous figure in the riotous group JOHNSON Sir he was my acquaintance and relation my mother s nephew He had purchased a living in the country but not simoniacally I never saw him but in the country I have been told he was a man of great parts very profligate but I never heard he was impious BOSWELL Was there not a story of his ghost having appeared JOHNSON Sir it was believed A waiter at the Hummums ten thirty five in which house Ford died had been absent for some time and returned not knowing that Ford was dead Going down to the cellar according to the story he met him going down again he met him a second time When he came up he asked some of the people of the house what Ford could be doing there They told him Ford was dead The waiter took a fever in which he lay for some time When he recovered he said he had a message to deliver to some women from Ford but he was not to tell what or to whom He walked out he was followed but somewhere about saint Paul s they lost him He came back and said he had delivered the message and the women exclaimed Then we are all undone doctor Pellet who was not a credulous man inquired into the truth of this story and he said the evidence was irresistible My wife went to the Hummums it is a place where people get themselves cupped I believe she went with intention to hear about this story of Ford At first they were unwilling to tell her but after they had talked to her she came away satisfied that it was true To be sure the man had a fever and this vision may have been the beginning of it But if the message to the women and their behaviour upon it were true as related there was something supernatural That rests upon his word and there it remains After missus Thrale was gone to bed Johnson and I sat up late We resumed Sir Joshua Reynolds s argument on the preceding Sunday that a man would be virtuous though he had no other motive than to preserve his character JOHNSON Sir it is not true for as to this world vice does not hurt a man s character BOSWELL Yes Sir debauching a friend s wife will JOHNSON No Sir Who thinks the worse of ten thirty six for it BOSWELL Lord ten thirty seven was not his friend JOHNSON That is only a circumstance Sir a slight distinction He could not get into the house but by Lord A man is chosen Knight of the shire not the less for having debauched ladies BOSWELL What Sir if he debauched the ladies of gentlemen in the county will not there be a general resentment against him JOHNSON No Sir He will lose those particular gentlemen but the rest will not trouble their heads about it warmly BOSWELL Well Sir I cannot think so JOHNSON Nay Sir there is no talking with a man who will dispute what every body knows angrily Don t you know this BOSWELL No Sir and I wish to think better of your country than you represent it I knew in Scotland a gentleman obliged to leave it for debauching a lady and in one of our counties an Earl s brother lost his election because he had debauched the lady of another Earl in that county and destroyed the peace of a noble family Still he would not yield He proceeded Will you not allow Sir that vice does not hurt a man s character so as to obstruct his prosperity in life when you know that ten thirty eight was loaded with wealth and honours a man who had acquired his fortune by such crimes that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat BOSWELL You will recollect Sir that doctor Robertson said he cut his throat because he was weary of still life little things not being sufficient to move his great mind JOHNSON very angry Nay Sir what stuff is this You had no more this opinion after Robertson said it than before I know nothing more offensive than repeating what one knows to be foolish things by way of continuing a dispute to see what a man will answer to make him your butt angrier still BOSWELL My dear Sir I had no such intentions as you seem to suspect I had not indeed Might not this nobleman have felt every thing weary stale flat and unprofitable ten thirty nine as Hamlet says JOHNSON Nay if you are to bring in gabble I ll talk no more I will not upon my honour My readers will decide upon this dispute Next morning I stated to missus Thrale at breakfast before he came down the dispute of last night as to the influence of character upon success in life She said he was certainly wrong and told me that a Baronet lost an election in Wales because he had debauched the sister of a gentleman in the county whom he made one of his daughters invite as her companion at his seat in the country when his lady and his other children were in London But she would not encounter Johnson upon the subject I staid all this day with him at Streatham He talked a great deal in very good humour Looking at Messrs Dilly s splendid edition of Lord Chesterfield s miscellaneous works he laughed and said Here now are two speeches ascribed to him both of which were written by me and the best of it is they have found out that one is like Demosthenes and the other like Cicero ten forty He censured Lord Kames s Sketches of the History of Man ten forty one for misrepresenting Clarendon s account of the appearance of Sir George Villiers s ghost as if Clarendon were weakly credulous when the truth is that Clarendon only says that the story was upon a better foundation of credit than usually such discourses are founded upon ten forty two nay speaks thus of the person who was reported to have seen the vision the poor man if he had been at all waking which Lord Kames has omitted He added in this book it is maintained that virtue is natural to man and that if we would but consult our own hearts we should be virtuous ten forty three Now after consulting our own hearts all we can and with all the helps we have we find how few of us are virtuous This is saying a thing which all mankind know not to be true BOSWELL Is not modesty natural JOHNSON I cannot say Sir as we find no people quite in a state of nature but I think the more they are taught the more modest they are The French are a gross ill bred untaught people a lady there will spit on the floor and rub it with her foot ten forty four What I gained by being in France was learning to be better satisfied with my own country Time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twenty four almost in any way than in travelling when you set travelling against mere negation against doing nothing it is better to be sure but how much more would a young man improve were he to study during those years Indeed if a young man is wild and must run after women and bad company it is better this should be done abroad as on his return he can break off such connections and begin at home a new man with a character to form and acquaintances to make ten forty five How little does travelling supply to the conversation of any man who has travelled how little to Beauclerk BOSWELL What say you to Lord JOHNSON I never but once heard him talk of what he had seen and that was of a large serpent in one of the Pyramids of Egypt BOSWELL Well I happened to hear him tell the same thing which made me mention him ten forty six I talked of a country life JOHNSON Were I to live in the country I would not devote myself to the acquisition of popularity I would live in a much better way much more happily I would have my time at my own command ten forty seven BOSWELL But Sir is it not a sad thing to be at a distance from all our literary friends JOHNSON Sir you will by and by have enough of this conversation which now delights you so much ten forty eight As he was a zealous friend of subordination he was at all times watchful to repress the vulgar cant against the manners of the great ten forty nine High people Sir said he are the best take a hundred ladies of quality you ll find them better wives better mothers more willing to sacrifice their own pleasure to their children than a hundred other women Tradeswomen I mean the wives of tradesmen in the city who are worth from ten to fifteen thousand pounds are the worst creatures upon the earth grossly ignorant and thinking viciousness fashionable Farmers I think are often worthless fellows ten fifty Few lords will cheat and if they do they ll be ashamed of it farmers cheat and are not ashamed of it they have all the sensual vices too of the nobility with cheating into the bargain There is as much fornication and adultery among farmers as amongst noblemen BOSWELL The notion of the world Sir however is that the morals of women of quality are worse than those in lower stations JOHNSON Yes Sir the licentiousness of one woman of quality makes more noise than that of a number of women in lower stations then Sir you are to consider the malignity of women in the city against women of quality which will make them believe any thing of them such as that they call their coachmen to bed No Sir so far as I have observed the higher in rank the richer ladies are they are the better instructed and the more virtuous This year the Reverend mister Horne published his Letter to mister Dunning on the English Particle Johnson read it and though not treated in it with sufficient respect ten fifty one he had candour enough to say to mister Seward Were I to make a new edition of my Dictionary I would adopt several ten fifty two of mister Horne s etymologies I hope they did not put the dog in the pillory for his libel he has too much literature for that ten fifty three On Saturday May sixteen I dined with him at mister Beauclerk s with mister Langton mister Steevens doctor Higgins and some others I regret very feelingly every instance of my remissness in recording his memorabilia I am afraid it is the condition of humanity as mister Windham of Norfolk once observed to me after having made an admirable speech in the House of Commons which was highly applauded but which he afterwards perceived might have been better that we are more uneasy from thinking of our wants than happy in thinking of our acquisitions This is an unreasonable mode of disturbing our tranquillity and should be corrected let me then comfort myself with the large treasure of Johnson s conversation which I have preserved for my own enjoyment and that of the world and let me exhibit what I have upon each occasion whether more or less whether a bulse ten fifty four or only a few sparks of a diamond He said doctor Mead lived more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any man ten fifty five The disaster of General Burgoyne s army was then the common topic of conversation It was asked why piling their arms was insisted upon as a matter of such consequence when it seemed to be a circumstance so inconsiderable in itself ten fifty six JOHNSON Why Sir a French authour says Il y a beaucoup de puerilites dans la guerre All distinctions are trifles because great things can seldom occur and those distinctions are settled by custom A savage would as willingly have his meat sent to him in the kitchen as eat it at the table here as men become civilized various modes of denoting honourable preference are invented He this day made the observations upon the similarity between Rasselas and Candide which I have inserted in its proper place ten fifty seven when considering his admirable philosophical Romance He said Candide he thought had more power in it than any thing that Voltaire had written He said the lyrical part of Horace never can be perfectly translated so much of the excellence is in the numbers and the expression Francis has done it the best I ll take his five out of six against them all On Sunday May seventeen I presented to him mister Fullarton of Fullarton who has since distinguished himself so much in India ten fifty eight to whom he naturally talked of travels as mister Brydone accompanied him in his tour to Sicily and Malta He said The information which we have from modern travellers is much more authentick than what we had from ancient travellers ancient travellers guessed modern travellers measure ten fifty nine The Swiss admit that there is but one errour in Stanyan ten sixty If Brydone were more attentive to his Bible he would be a good traveller ten sixty one He said Lord Chatham was a Dictator he possessed the power of putting the State in motion now there is no power all order is relaxed BOSWELL Is there no hope of a change to the better JOHNSON Why yes Sir when we are weary of this relaxation So the City of London will appoint its Mayors again by seniority ten sixty two BOSWELL But is not that taking a mere chance for having a good or a bad Mayor JOHNSON Yes Sir but the evil of competition is greater than that of the worst Mayor that can come besides there is no more reason to suppose that the choice of a rabble will be right than that chance will be right On Tuesday May nineteen I was to set out for Scotland in the evening He was engaged to dine with me at mister Dilly s I waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither he gave me some salutary counsel and recommended vigorous resolution against any deviation from moral duty BOSWELL But you would not have me to bind myself by a solemn obligation JOHNSON much agitated What a vow O no Sir a vow is a horrible thing it is a snare for sin ten sixty three The man who cannot go to Heaven without a vow may go Here standing erect in the middle of his library and rolling grand his pause was truly a curious compound of the solemn and the ludicrous he half whistled in his usual way when pleasant and he paused as if checked by religious awe Methought he would have added to Hell but was restrained I humoured the dilemma What Sir said I In caelum jusseris ibit ten sixty four alluding to his imitation of it And bid him go to Hell to Hell he goes I had mentioned to him a slight fault in his noble Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal a too near recurrence of the verb spread in his description of the young Enthusiast at College Through all his veins the fever of renown Spreads from the strong contagion of the gown O er Bodley s dome his future labours spread And Bacon s mansion trembles o er his head ten sixty five He had desired me to change spreads to burns but for perfect authenticity I now had it done with his own hand ten sixty six I thought this alteration not only cured the fault but was more poetical as it might carry an allusion to the shirt by which Hercules was inflamed We had a quiet comfortable meeting at mister Dilly s nobody there but ourselves mister Dilly mentioned somebody having wished that Milton s Tractate on Education should be printed along with his Poems in the edition of The English Poets then going on JOHNSON It would be breaking in upon the plan but would be of no great consequence So far as it would be any thing it would be wrong Education in England has been in danger of being hurt by two of its greatest men Milton and Locke Milton s plan is impracticable and I suppose has never been tried Locke s I fancy has been tried often enough but is very imperfect it gives too much to one side and too little to the other it gives too little to literature ten sixty seven I shall do what I can for doctor Watts but my materials are very scanty His poems are by no means his best works I cannot praise his poetry itself highly but I can praise its design ten sixty eight My illustrious friend and I parted with assurances of affectionate regard I wrote to him on the twenty fifth of May from Thorpe in Yorkshire one of the seats of mister Bosville ten sixty nine and gave him an account of my having passed a day at Lincoln unexpectedly and therefore without having any letters of introduction but that I had been honoured with civilities from the Reverend mister Simpson an acquaintance of his and Captain Broadley of the Lincolnshire Militia but more particularly from the Reverend doctor Gordon the Chancellor who first received me with great politeness as a stranger and when I informed him who I was entertained me at his house with the most flattering attention I also expressed the pleasure with which I had found that our worthy friend Langton was highly esteemed in his own county town To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh June eighteen seventeen seventy eight MY DEAR SIR Since my return to Scotland I have been again at Lanark and have had more conversation with Thomson s sister It is strange that Murdoch who was his intimate friend should have mistaken his mother s maiden name which he says was Hume whereas Hume was the name of his grandmother by the mother s side His mother s name was Beatrix Trotter ten seventy a daughter of mister Trotter of Fogo a small proprietor of land Thomson had one brother whom he had with him in England as his amanuensis but he was seized with a consumption and having returned to Scotland to try what his native air would do for him died young He had three sisters one married to mister Bell minister of the parish of Strathaven one to mister Craig father of the ingenious architect who gave the plan of the New Town of Edinburgh and one to mister Thomson master of the grammar school at Lanark He was of a humane and benevolent disposition not only sent valuable presents to his sisters but a yearly allowance in money and was always wishing to have it in his power to do them more good Lord Lyttelton s observation that he loathed much to write was very true His letters to his sister missus Thomson were not frequent and in one of them he says All my friends who know me know how backward I am to write letters and never impute the negligence of my hand to the coldness of my heart I send you a copy of the last letter which she had from him ten seventy one she never heard that he had any intention of going into holy orders From this late interview with his sister I think much more favourably of him as I hope you will I am eager to see more of your Prefaces to the Poets I solace myself with the few proof sheets which I have I send another parcel of Lord Hailes s Annals ten seventy two which you will please to return to me as soon as you conveniently can He says he wishes you would cut a little deeper but he may be proud that there is so little occasion to use the critical knife I ever am my dear Sir Your faithful and affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL mister Langton has been pleased at my request to favour me with some particulars of doctor Johnson s visit to Warley camp where this gentleman was at the time stationed as a Captain in the Lincolnshire militia ten seventy three I shall give them in his own words in a letter to me It was in the summer of the year seventeen seventy eight ten seventy four that he complied with my invitation to come down to the Camp at Warley and he staid with me about a week the scene appeared notwithstanding a great degree of ill health that he seemed to labour under to interest and amuse him as agreeing with the disposition that I believe you know he constantly manifested towards enquiring into subjects of the military kind He sate with a patient degree of attention to observe the proceedings of a regimental court martial that happened to be called in the time of his stay with us and one night as late as at eleven o clock he accompanied the Major of the regiment in going what are styled the Rounds where he might observe the forms of visiting the guards for the seeing that they and their sentries are ready in their duty on their several posts He took occasion to converse at times on military topicks one in particular that I see the mention of in your Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides which lies open before me ten seventy five as to gun powder which he spoke of to the same effect in part that you relate On one occasion when the regiment were going through their exercise he went quite close to the men at one of the extremities of it and watched all their practices attentively and when he came away his remark was The men indeed do load their muskets and fire with wonderful celerity He was likewise particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the musquet balls in use and within what distance they might be expected to take effect when fired off In walking among the tents and observing the difference between those of the officers and private men he said that the superiority of accommodation of the better conditions of life to that of the inferiour ones was never exhibited to him in so distinct a view The civilities paid to him in the camp were from the gentlemen of the Lincolnshire regiment one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he slept and from General Hall who very courteously invited him to dine with him where he appeared to be very well pleased with his entertainment and the civilities he received on the part of the General ten seventy six the attention likewise of the General s aid de camp Captain Smith seemed to be very welcome to him as appeared by their engaging in a great deal of discourse together The gentlemen of the East York regiment likewise on being informed of his coming solicited his company at dinner but by that time he had fixed his departure so that he could not comply with the invitation To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have received two letters from you of which the second complains of the neglect shewn to the first You must not tye your friends to such punctual correspondence You have all possible assurances of my affection and esteem and there ought to be no need of reiterated professions When it may happen that I can give you either counsel or comfort I hope it will never happen to me that I should neglect you but you must not think me criminal or cold if I say nothing when I have nothing to say You are now happy enough missus Boswell is recovered and I congratulate you upon the probability of her long life If general approbation will add anything to your enjoyment I can tell you that I have heard you mentioned as a man whom everybody likes ten seventy seven I think life has little more to give ten seventy eight has gone to his regiment He has laid down his coach and talks of making more contractions of his expence how he will succeed I know not It is difficult to reform a household gradually it may be better done by a system totally new I am afraid he has always something to hide When we pressed him to go to ten seventy nine he objected the necessity of attending his navigation ten eighty yet he could talk of going to Aberdeen a place not much nearer his navigation I believe he cannot bear the thought of living at ten eighty one in a state of diminution and of appearing among the gentlemen of the neighbourhood shorn of his beams ten eighty two This is natural but it is cowardly What I told him of the encreasing expence of a growing family seems to have struck him He certainly had gone on with very confused views and we have I think shewn him that he is wrong though with the common deficiency of advisers we have not shewn him how to do right ten eighty three I wish you would a little correct or restrain your imagination and imagine that happiness such as life admits may be had at other places as well as London Without asserting Stoicism it may be said that it is our business to exempt ourselves as much as we can from the power of external things There is but one solid basis of happiness and that is the reasonable hope of a happy futurity ten eighty four This may be had every where I do not blame your preference of London to other places for it is really to be preferred if the choice is free but few have the choice of their place or their manner of life and mere pleasure ought not to be the prime motive of action missus Thrale poor thing has a daughter ten eighty five mister Thrale dislikes the times ten eighty six like the rest of us missus Williams is sick missus Desmoulins is poor I have miserable nights Nobody is well but mister Levett I am dear Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON London July three seventeen seventy eight In the course of this year there was a difference between him and his friend mister Strahan ten eighty seven the particulars of which it is unnecessary to relate Their reconciliation was communicated to me in a letter from mister Strahan in the following words The notes I shewed you that passed between him and me were dated in March last The matter lay dormant till July twenty seven ten eighty eight when he wrote to me as follows To William Strahan esquire Sir It would be very foolish for us to continue strangers any longer You can never by persistency make wrong right If I resented too acrimoniously I resented only to yourself Nobody ever saw or heard what I wrote You saw that my anger was over for in a day or two I came to your house I have given you longer time and I hope you have made so good use of it as to be no longer on evil terms with Sir Your c Sam Johnson On this I called upon him and he has since dined with me After this time the same friendship as formerly continued between doctor Johnson and mister Strahan My friend mentioned to me a little circumstance of his attention which though we may smile at it must be allowed to have its foundation in a nice and true knowledge of human life When I write to Scotland said he I employ Strahan to frank my letters that he may have the consequence of appearing a Parliament man among his countrymen To CAPTAIN LANGTON ten eighty nine WARLEY CAMP DEAR SIR When I recollect how long ago I was received with so much kindness at Warley Common I am ashamed that I have not made some enquiries after my friends Pray how many sheep stealers did you convict and how did you punish them When are you to be cantoned in better habitations The air grows cold and the ground damp Longer stay in the camp cannot be without much danger to the health of the common men if even the officers can escape You see that doctor Percy is now Dean of Carlisle about five hundred a year with a power of presenting himself to some good living He is provided for The session of the CLUB is to commence with that of the Parliament mister Banks ten ninety desires to be admitted he will be a very honourable accession Did the King please you ten ninety one The Coxheath men I think have some reason to complain ten ninety two Reynolds says your camp is better than theirs I hope you find yourself able to encounter this weather Take care of your own health and as you can of your men Be pleased to make my compliments to all the gentlemen whose notice I have had and whose kindness I have experienced I am dear Sir Your most humble servant Sam Johnson October thirty one seventeen seventy eight I wrote to him on the eighteenth of August the eighteenth of September and the sixth of November informing him of my having had another son born whom I had called James ten ninety three that I had passed some time at Auchinleck that the Countess of Loudoun now in her ninety ninth year was as fresh as when he saw her ten ninety four and remembered him with respect and that his mother by adoption the Countess of Eglintoune ten ninety five had said to me Tell mister Johnson I love him exceedingly that I had again suffered much from bad spirits and that as it was very long since I heard from him I was not a little uneasy The continuance of his regard for his friend doctor Burney appears from the following letters To THE REVEREND doctor WHEELER ten ninety six OXFORD DEAR SIR doctor Burney who brings this paper is engaged in a History of Musick and having been told by doctor Markham of some MSS relating to his subject which are in the library of your College is desirous to examine them He is my friend and therefore I take the liberty of intreating your favour and assistance in his enquiry and can assure you with great confidence that if you knew him he would not want any intervenient solicitation to obtain the kindness of one who loves learning and virtue as you love them I have been flattering myself all the summer with the hope of paying my annual visit to my friends but something has obstructed me I still hope not to be long without seeing you I should be glad of a little literary talk and glad to shew you by the frequency of my visits how eagerly I love it when you talk it I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON London November two seventeen seventy eight TO THE REVEREND doctor EDWARDS ten ninety seven OXFORD SIR The bearer doctor BURNEY has had some account of a Welsh Manuscript in the Bodleian library from which he hopes to gain some materials for his History of Musick but being ignorant of the language is at a loss where to find assistance I make no doubt but you Sir can help him through his difficulties and therefore take the liberty of recommending him to your favour as I am sure you will find him a man worthy of every civility that can be shewn and every benefit that can be conferred But we must not let Welsh drive us from Greek What comes of Xenophon ten ninety eight If you do not like the trouble of publishing the book do not let your commentaries be lost contrive that they may be published somewhere I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON London November two seventeen seventy eight These letters procured doctor Burney great kindness and friendly offices from both of these gentleman not only on that occasion but in future visits to the university ten ninety nine The same year doctor Johnson not only wrote to doctor Joseph Warton in favour of doctor Burney s youngest son who was to be placed in the college of Winchester but accompanied him when he went thither eleven hundred We surely cannot but admire the benevolent exertions of this great and good man especially when we consider how grievously he was afflicted with bad health and how uncomfortable his home was made by the perpetual jarring of those whom he charitably accommodated under his roof He has sometimes suffered me to talk jocularly of his group of females and call them his Seraglio He thus mentions them together with honest Levett in one of his letters to missus Thrale eleven oh one Williams hates every body Levett hates Desmoulins and does not love Williams Desmoulins hates them both Poll eleven oh two loves none of them eleven oh three To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR It is indeed a long time since I wrote and I think you have some reason to complain however you must not let small things disturb you when you have such a fine addition to your happiness as a new boy and I hope your lady s health restored by bringing him It seems very probable that a little care will now restore her if any remains of her complaints are left You seem if I understand your letter to be gaining ground at Auchinleck eleven oh four an incident that would give me great delight When any fit of anxiety or gloominess or perversion of mind lays hold upon you make it a rule not to publish it by complaints but exert your whole care to hide it by endeavouring to hide it you will drive it away Be always busy eleven oh five The CLUB is to meet with the Parliament we talk of electing Banks the traveller he will be a reputable member Langton has been encamped with his company of militia on Warley common I spent five days amongst them he signalized himself as a diligent officer and has very high respect in the regiment He presided when I was there at a court martial he is now quartered in Hertfordshire his lady and little ones are in Scotland Paoli came to the camp and commended the soldiers Of myself I have no great matter to say my health is not restored my nights are restless and tedious The best night that I have had these twenty years was at Fort Augustus eleven oh six I hope soon to send you a few lines to read I am dear Sir Your most affectionate SAM JOHNSON November twenty one seventeen seventy eight About this time the reverend mister John Hussey who had been some time in trade and was then a clergyman of the Church of England being about to undertake a journey to Aleppo and other parts of the East which he accomplished doctor Johnson who had long been in habits of intimacy with him honoured him with the following letter To mister JOHN HUSSEY DEAR SIR I have sent you the Grammar and have left you two books more by which I hope to be remembered write my name in them we may perhaps see each other no more you part with my good wishes nor do I despair of seeing you return Let no opportunities of vice corrupt you let no bad example seduce you let the blindness of Mahometans confirm you in Christianity GOD bless you I am dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON December twenty nine seventeen seventy eight Johnson this year expressed great satisfaction at the publication of the first volume of Discourses to the Royal Academy eleven oh seven by Sir Joshua Reynolds whom he always considered as one of his literary school eleven oh eight Much praise indeed is due to those excellent Discourses which are so universally admired and for which the authour received from the Empress of Russia a gold snuff box adorned with her profile in bas relief set in diamonds and containing what is infinitely more valuable a slip of paper on which are written with her Imperial Majesty s own hand the following words Pour le Chevalier Reynolds en temoignage du contentement que j ai ressentie eleven oh nine a la lecture de ses excellens discours sur la peinture In seventeen seventy nine Johnson gave the world a luminous proof that the vigour of his mind in all its faculties whether memory judgement or imagination was not in the least abated for this year came out the first four volumes of his Prefaces biographical and critical to the most eminent of the English Poets published by the booksellers of London The remaining volumes came out in the year seventeen eighty eleven ten The Poets were selected by the several booksellers who had the honorary copy right which is still preserved among them by mutual compact notwithstanding the decision of the House of Lords against the perpetuity of Literary Property eleven eleven We have his own authority eleven twelve that by his recommendation the poems of Blackmore eleven thirteen Watts eleven fourteen Pomfret eleven fifteen and Yalden eleven sixteen were added to the collection Of this work I shall speak more particularly hereafter On the twenty second of January I wrote to him on several topicks and mentioned that as he had been so good as to permit me to have the proof sheets of his Lives of the Poets I had written to his servant Francis to take care of them for me mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb two seventeen seventy nine MY DEAR SIR Garrick s death is a striking event not that we should be surprised with the death of any man who has lived sixty two years but because there was a vivacity in our late celebrated friend which drove away the thoughts of death from any association with him I am sure you will be tenderly affected with his departure eleven seventeen and I would wish to hear from you upon the subject I was obliged to him in my days of effervescence in London when poor Derrick was my governour eleven eighteen and since that time I received many civilities from him Do you remember how pleasing it was when I received a letter from him at Inverary eleven nineteen upon our first return to civilized living after our Hebridean journey I shall always remember him with affection as well as admiration On Saturday last being the thirtieth of January eleven twenty I drank coffee and old port and had solemn conversation with the Reverend mister Falconer a nonjuring bishop a very learned and worthy man He gave two toasts which you will believe I drank with cordiality doctor Samuel Johnson and Flora Macdonald I sat about four hours with him and it was really as if I had been living in the last century The Episcopal Church of Scotland though faithful to the royal house of Stuart has never accepted of any conge d lire since the Revolution it is the only true Episcopal Church in Scotland as it has its own succession of bishops For as to the episcopal clergy who take the oaths to the present government they indeed follow the rites of the Church of England but as Bishop Falconer observed they are not Episcopals for they are under no bishop as a bishop cannot have authority beyond his diocese This venerable gentleman did me the honour to dine with me yesterday and he laid his hands upon the heads of my little ones We had a good deal of curious literary conversation particularly about mister Thomas Ruddiman eleven twenty one with whom he lived in great friendship Any fresh instance of the uncertainty of life makes one embrace more closely a valuable friend My dear and much respected Sir may GOD preserve you long in this world while I am in it I am ever Your much obliged And affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL On the twenty third of February I wrote to him again complaining of his silence as I had heard he was ill and had written to mister Thrale for information concerning him and I announced my intention of soon being again in London TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Why should you take such delight to make a bustle to write to mister Thrale that I am negligent and to Francis to do what is so very unnecessary Thrale you may be sure cared not about it and I shall spare Francis the trouble by ordering a set both of the Lives and Poets to dear missus Boswell eleven twenty two in acknowledgement of her marmalade Persuade her to accept them and accept them kindly If I thought she would receive them scornfully I would send them to Miss Boswell who I hope has yet none of her mamma s ill will to me I would send sets of Lives four volumes to some other friends to Lord Hailes first His second volume lies by my bed side a book surely of great labour and to every just thinker of great delight Write me word to whom I shall send besides eleven twenty three would it please Lord Auchinleck missus Thrale waits in the coach I am dear Sir c SAM JOHNSON March thirteen seventeen seventy nine This letter crossed me on the road to London where I arrived on Monday March fifteen and next morning at a late hour found doctor Johnson sitting over his tea attended by missus Desmoulins mister Levett and a clergyman who had come to submit some poetical pieces to his revision It is wonderful what a number and variety of writers some of them even unknown to him prevailed on his good nature to look over their works and suggest corrections and improvements eleven twenty four My arrival interrupted for a little while the important business of this true representative of Bayes eleven twenty five upon its being resumed I found that the subject under immediate consideration was a translation yet in manuscript of the Carmen Seculare of Horace which had this year been set to musick and performed as a publick entertainment in London for the joint benefit of Monsieur Philidor and Signer Baretti eleven twenty six When Johnson had done reading the authour asked him bluntly If upon the whole it was a good translation Johnson whose regard for truth was uncommonly strict seemed to be puzzled for a moment what answer to make as he certainly could not honestly commend the performance with exquisite address he evaded the question thus Sir I do not say that it may not be made a very good translation eleven twenty seven Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed and yet the writer was not shocked A printed Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain came next in review the bard eleven twenty eight was a lank bony figure with short black hair he was writhing himself in agitation while Johnson read and shewing his teeth in a grin of earnestness exclaimed in broken sentences and in a keen sharp tone Is that poetry Sir Is it Pindar JOHNSON Why Sir there is here a great deal of what is called poetry Then turning to me the poet cried My muse has not been long upon the town and pointing to the Ode it trembles under the hand of the great critick eleven twenty nine Johnson in a tone of displeasure asked him Why do you praise Anson eleven thirty I did not trouble him by asking his reason for this question He proceeded Here is an errour Sir you have made Genius feminine eleven thirty one Palpable Sir cried the enthusiast I know it But in a lower tone it was to pay a compliment to the Duchess of Devonshire with which her Grace was pleased She is walking across Coxheath in the military uniform and I suppose her to be the Genius of Britain eleven thirty two JOHNSON Sir you are giving a reason for it but that will not make it right You may have a reason why two and two should make five but they will still make but four Although I was several times with him in the course of the following days such it seems were my occupations or such my negligence that I have preserved no memorial of his conversation till Friday March twenty six when I visited him He said he expected to be attacked on account of his Lives of the Poets However said he I would rather be attacked than unnoticed For the worst thing you can do to an authour is to be silent as to his works eleven thirty three An assault upon a town is a bad thing but starving it is still worse an assault may be unsuccessful you may have more men killed than you kill but if you starve the town you are sure of victory Talking of a friend of ours associating with persons of very discordant principles and characters I said he was a very universal man quite a man of the world eleven thirty four JOHNSON Yes Sir but one may be so much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world I remember a passage in Goldsmith s Vicar of Wakefield which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing BOSWELL That was a fine passage JOHNSON Yes Sir there was another fine passage too which he struck out When I was a young man being anxious to distinguish myself I was perpetually starting new propositions But I soon gave this over for I found that generally what was new was false eleven thirty five I said I did not like to sit with people of whom I had not a good opinion JOHNSON But you must not indulge your delicacy too much or you will be a tete a tete man all your life During my stay in London this spring I find I was unaccountably eleven thirty six negligent in preserving Johnson s sayings more so than at any time when I was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wisdom and wit There is no help for it now I must content myself with presenting such scraps as I have But I am nevertheless ashamed and vexed to think how much has been lost It is not that there was a bad crop this year but that I was not sufficiently careful in gathering it in I therefore in some instances can only exhibit a few detached fragments Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters signed Junius eleven thirty seven he said I should have believed Burke to be Junius because I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing these letters eleven thirty eight but Burke spontaneously denied it to me The case would have been different had I asked him if he was the authour a man so questioned as to an anonymous publication may think he has a right to deny it eleven thirty nine He observed that his old friend mister Sheridan had been honoured with extraordinary attention in his own country by having had an exception made in his favour in an Irish Act of Parliament concerning insolvent debtors eleven forty Thus to be singled out said he by a legislature as an object of publick consideration and kindness is a proof of no common merit At Streatham on Monday March twenty nine at breakfast he maintained that a father had no right to control the inclinations of his daughters in marriage eleven forty one On Wednesday March thirty one when I visited him and confessed an excess of which I had very seldom been guilty that I had spent a whole night in playing at cards and that I could not look back on it with satisfaction instead of a harsh animadversion he mildly said Alas Sir on how few things can we look back with satisfaction On Thursday April one he commended one of the Dukes of Devonshire for a dogged veracity eleven forty two He said too London is nothing to some people but to a man whose pleasure is intellectual London is the place And there is no place where oeconomy can be so well practised as in London More can be had here for the money even by ladies than any where else You cannot play tricks with your fortune in a small place you must make an uniform appearance Here a lady may have well furnished apartments and elegant dress without any meat in her kitchen I was amused by considering with how much ease and coolness he could write or talk to a friend exhorting him not to suppose that happiness was not to be found as well in other places as in London eleven forty three when he himself was at all times sensible of its being comparatively speaking a heaven upon earth eleven forty four The truth is that by those who from sagacity attention and experience have learnt the full advantage of London its preeminence over every other place not only for variety of enjoyment but for comfort will be felt with a philosophical exultation eleven forty five The freedom from remark and petty censure with which life may be passed there is a circumstance which a man who knows the teazing restraint of a narrow circle must relish highly mister Burke whose orderly and amiable domestic habits might make the eye of observation less irksome to him than to most men said once very pleasantly in my hearing Though I have the honour to represent Bristol I should not like to live there I should be obliged to be so much upon my good behaviour In London a man may live in splendid society at one time and in frugal retirement at another without animadversion There and there alone a man s own house is truly his castle in which he can be in perfect safety from intrusion whenever he pleases I never shall forget how well this was expressed to me one day by mister Meynell eleven forty six The chief advantage of London said he is that a man is always so near his burrow eleven forty seven He said of one of his old acquaintances He is very fit for a travelling governour He knows French very well He is a man of good principles and there would be no danger that a young gentleman should catch his manner for it is so very bad that it must be avoided In that respect he would be like the drunken Helot eleven forty eight A gentleman has informed me that Johnson said of the same person Sir he has the most inverted understanding of any man whom I have ever known On Friday April two being Good Friday I visited him in the morning as usual and finding that we insensibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends a very worthy man eleven forty nine I by way of a check quoted some good admonition from The Government of the Tongue eleven fifty that very pious book It happened also remarkably enough that the subject of the sermon preached to us to day by doctor Burrows the rector of saint Clement Danes was the certainty that at the last day we must give an account of the deeds done in the body eleven fifty one and amongst various acts of culpability he mentioned evil speaking As we were moving slowly along in the crowd from church Johnson jogged my elbow and said Did you attend to the sermon Yes Sir said I it was very applicable to us He however stood upon the defensive Why Sir the sense of ridicule is given us and may be lawfully used eleven fifty two The authour of The Government of the Tongue would have us treat all men alike In the interval between morning and evening service he endeavoured to employ himself earnestly in devotional exercises and as he has mentioned in his Prayers and Meditations eleven fifty three gave me Les Pensees de Paschal that I might not interrupt him I preserve the book with reverence His presenting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand and I have found in it a truly divine unction We went to church again in the afternoon eleven fifty four On Saturday April three I visited him at night and found him sitting in missus Williams s room with her and one who he afterwards told me was a natural son eleven fifty five of the second Lord Southwell The table had a singular appearance being covered with a heterogeneous assemblage of oysters and porter for his company and tea for himself I mentioned my having heard an eminent physician who was himself a Christian argue in favour of universal toleration and maintain that no man could be hurt by another man s differing from him in opinion JOHNSON Sir you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe eleven fifty six On Easter day after solemn service at saint Paul s I dined with him mister Allen the printer was also his guest He was uncommonly silent and I have not written down any thing except a single curious fact which having the sanction of his inflexible veracity may be received as a striking instance of human insensibility and inconsideration As he was passing by a fishmonger who was skinning an eel alive he heard him curse it because it would not lye still eleven fifty seven On Wednesday April seven I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds s I have not marked what company was there Johnson harangued upon the qualities of different liquors and spoke with great contempt of claret as so weak that a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk eleven fifty eight He was persuaded to drink one glass of it that he might judge not from recollection which might be dim but from immediate sensation He shook his head and said Poor stuff No Sir claret is the liquor for boys port for men but he who aspires to be a hero smiling must drink brandy In the first place the flavour of brandy is most grateful to the palate and then brandy will do soonest for a man what drinking can do for him eleven fifty nine There are indeed few who are able to drink brandy That is a power rather to be wished for than attained And yet proceeded he as in all pleasure hope is a considerable part I know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy Florence wine I think the worst it is wine only to the eye it is wine neither while you are drinking it nor after you have drunk it it neither pleases the taste nor exhilarates the spirits I reminded him how heartily he and I used to drink wine together when we were first acquainted and how I used to have a head ache after sitting up with him eleven sixty He did not like to have this recalled or perhaps thinking that I boasted improperly resolved to have a witty stroke at me Nay Sir it was not the wine that made your head ache but the sense that I put into it BOSWELL What Sir will sense make the head ache JOHNSON Yes Sir with a smile when it is not used to it No man who has a true relish of pleasantry could be offended at this especially if Johnson in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good estimation I used to say that as he had given me a thousand pounds in praise he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me On Thursday April eight I dined with him at mister Allan Ramsay s with Lord Graham eleven sixty one and some other company We talked of Shakspeare s witches JOHNSON They are beings of his own creation they are a compound of malignity and meanness without any abilities and are quite different from the Italian magician King James says in his Daemonology Magicians command the devils witches are their servants The Italian magicians are elegant beings RAMSAY Opera witches not Drury lane witches Johnson observed that abilities might be employed in a narrow sphere as in getting money which he said he believed no man could do without vigorous parts though concentrated to a point eleven sixty two RAMSAY Yes like a strong horse in a mill he pulls better Lord Graham while he praised the beauty of Lochlomond on the banks of which is his family seat complained of the climate and said he could not bear it JOHNSON Nay my Lord don t talk so you may bear it well enough Your ancestors have borne it more years than I can tell This was a handsome compliment to the antiquity of the House of Montrose His Lordship told me afterwards that he had only affected to complain of the climate lest if he had spoken as favourably of his country as he really thought doctor Johnson might have attacked it Johnson was very courteous to Lady Margaret Macdonald Madam said he when I was in the Isle of Sky I heard of the people running to take the stones off the road lest Lady Margaret s horse should stumble eleven sixty three Lord Graham commended doctor Drummond eleven sixty four at Naples as a man of extraordinary talents and added that he had a great love of liberty JOHNSON He is young my Lord looking to his Lordship with an arch smile all boys love liberty till experience convinces them they are not so fit to govern themselves as they imagined We are all agreed as to our own liberty we would have as much of it as we can get but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others for in proportion as we take others must lose I believe we hardly wish that the mob should have liberty to govern us When that was the case some time ago no man was at liberty not to have candles in his windows RAMSAY The result is that order is better than confusion JOHNSON The result is that order cannot be had but by subordination On Friday April sixteen I had been present at the trial of the unfortunate mister Hackman who in a fit of frantick jealous love had shot Miss Ray the favourite of a nobleman eleven sixty five Johnson in whose company I dined to day with some other friends was much interested by my account of what passed and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven eleven sixty six He said in a solemn fervid tone I hope he shall find mercy This day eleven sixty seven a violent altercation arose between Johnson and Beauclerk eleven sixty eight which having made much noise at the time I think it proper in order to prevent any future misrepresentation to give a minute account of it In talking of Hackman Johnson argued as Judge Blackstone had done that his being furnished with two pistols was a proof that he meant to shoot two persons mister Beauclerk said No for that every wise man who intended to shoot himself took two pistols that he might be sure of doing it at once Lord s cook shot himself with one pistol and lived ten days in great agony mister who loved buttered muffins but durst not eat them because they disagreed with his stomach resolved to shoot himself and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfast before shooting himself knowing that he should not be troubled with indigestion eleven sixty nine he had two charged pistols one was found lying charged upon the table by him after he had shot himself with the other Well said Johnson with an air of triumph you see here one pistol was sufficient Beauclerk replied smartly Because it happened to kill him And either then or a very little afterwards being piqued at Johnson s triumphant remark added This is what you don t know and I do There was then a cessation of the dispute and some minutes intervened during which dinner and the glass went on cheerfully when Johnson suddenly and abruptly exclaimed mister Beauclerk how came you to talk so petulantly to me as This is what you don t know but what I know One thing I know which you don t seem to know that you are very uncivil BEAUCLERK Because you began by being uncivil which you always are The words in parenthesis were I believe not heard by doctor Johnson Here again there was a cessation of arms Johnson told me that the reason why he waited at first some time without taking any notice of what mister Beauclerk said was because he was thinking whether he should resent it But when he considered that there were present a young Lord and an eminent traveller two men of the world with whom he had never dined before he was apprehensive that they might think they had a right to take such liberties with him as Beauclerk did and therefore resolved he would not let it pass adding that he would not appear a coward A little while after this the conversation turned on the violence of Hackman s temper Johnson then said It was his business to command his temper as my friend mister Beauclerk should have done some time ago BEAUCLERK I should learn of you Sir JOHNSON Sir you have given me opportunities enough of learning when I have been in your company No man loves to be treated with contempt BEAUCLERK with a polite inclination towards Johnson Sir you have known me twenty years and however I may have treated others you may be sure I could never treat you with contempt JOHNSON Sir you have said more than was necessary Thus it ended and Beauclerk s coach not having come for him till very late doctor Johnson and another gentleman sat with him a long time after the rest of the company were gone and he and I dined at Beauclerk s on the Saturday se nnight following After this tempest had subsided I recollect the following particulars of his conversation I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning for that is a sure good I would let him at first read any English book which happens to engage his attention because you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book He ll get better books afterwards eleven seventy Mallet I believe never wrote a single line of his projected life of the Duke of Marlborough eleven seventy one He groped for materials and thought of it till he had exhausted his mind Thus it sometimes happens that men entangle themselves in their own schemes To be contradicted in order to force you to talk is mighty unpleasing You shine indeed but it is by being ground Of a gentleman who made some figure among the Literati of his time mister Fitzherbert eleven seventy two he said What eminence he had was by a felicity of manner he had no more learning than what he could not help On Saturday April twenty four I dined with him at mister Beauclerk s with Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Jones afterwards Sir William mister Langton mister Steevens mister Paradise and doctor Higgins I mentioned that mister Wilkes had attacked Garrick to me as a man who had no friend I believe he is right Sir Greek Oi philoi ou philos He had friends but no friend eleven seventy three Garrick was so diffused he had no man to whom he wished to unbosom himself He found people always ready to applaud him and that always for the same thing so he saw life with great uniformity I took upon me for once to fight with Goliath s weapons and play the sophist Garrick did not need a friend as he got from every body all he wanted What is a friend One who supports you and comforts you while others do not Friendship you know Sir is the cordial drop to make the nauseous draught of life go down eleven seventy four but if the draught be not nauseous if it be all sweet there is no occasion for that drop JOHNSON Many men would not be content to live so I hope I should not They would wish to have an intimate friend with whom they might compare minds and cherish private virtues One of the company mentioned Lord Chesterfield as a man who had no friend JOHNSON There were more materials to make friendship in Garrick had he not been so diffused BOSWELL Garrick was pure gold but beat out to thin leaf Lord Chesterfield was tinsel JOHNSON Garrick was a very good man the cheerfullest man of his age eleven seventy five a decent liver in a profession which is supposed to give indulgence to licentiousness and a man who gave away freely money acquired by himself He began the world with a great hunger for money the son of a half pay officer bred in a family whose study was to make four pence do as much as others made four pence halfpenny do But when he had got money he was very liberal eleven seventy six I presumed to animadvert on his eulogy on Garrick in his Lives of the Poets eleven seventy seven You say Sir his death eclipsed the gaiety of nations eleven seventy eight JOHNSON I could not have said more nor less It is the truth eclipsed not extinguished and his death did eclipse it was like a storm BOSWELL But why nations Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation JOHNSON Why Sir some exaggeration must be allowed eleven seventy nine Besides nations may be said if we allow the Scotch to be a nation and to have gaiety which they have not You are an exception though Come gentlemen let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful BEAUCLERK But he is a very unnatural Scotchman I however continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue His acting had ceased some time before his death at any rate he had acted in Ireland but a short time at an early period of his life eleven eighty and never in Scotland I objected also to what appears an anticlimax of praise when contrasted with the preceding panegyrick and diminished eleven eighty one the public stock of harmless pleasure Is not harmless pleasure very tame JOHNSON Nay Sir harmless pleasure is the highest praise Pleasure is a word of dubious import pleasure is in general dangerous and pernicious to virtue to be able therefore to furnish pleasure that is harmless pleasure pure and unalloyed is as great a power as man can possess This was perhaps as ingenious a defence as could be made still however I was not satisfied A celebrated wit eleven eighty two being mentioned he said One may say of him as was said of a French wit Il n a de l esprit que contre Dieu I have been several times in company with him but never perceived any strong power of wit He produces a general effect by various means he has a cheerful countenance and a gay voice Besides his trade is wit It would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment as for a highwayman to take the road without his pistols Talking of the effects of drinking he said Drinking may be practised with great prudence a man who exposes himself when he is intoxicated has not the art of getting drunk a sober man who happens occasionally to get drunk readily enough goes into a new company which a man who has been drinking should never do Such a man will undertake any thing he is without skill in inebriation I used to slink home when I had drunk too much eleven eighty three A man accustomed to self examination will be conscious when he is drunk though an habitual drunkard will not be conscious of it I knew a physician who for twenty years was not sober yet in a pamphlet which he wrote upon fevers he appealed to Garrick and me for his vindication from a charge of drunkenness eleven eighty four A bookseller naming him who got a large fortune by trade eleven eighty five was so habitually and equably drunk that his most intimate friends never perceived that he was more sober at one time than another Talking of celebrated and successful irregular practisers in physick he said Taylor eleven eighty six was the most ignorant man I ever knew but sprightly Ward eleven eighty seven the dullest Taylor challenged me once to talk Latin with him laughing I quoted some of Horace which he took to be a part of my own speech He said a few words well enough BEAUCLERK I remember Sir you said that Taylor was an instance how far impudence could carry ignorance mister Beauclerk was very entertaining this day and told us a number of short stories in a lively elegant manner and with that air of the world which has I know not what impressive effect as if there were something more than is expressed or than perhaps we could perfectly understand eleven eighty eight As Johnson and I accompanied Sir Joshua Reynolds in his coach Johnson said There is in Beauclerk a predominance over his company that one does not like But he is a man who has lived so much in the world that he has a short story on every occasion he is always ready to talk and is never exhausted Johnson and I passed the evening at Miss Reynolds s Sir Joshua s sister I mentioned that an eminent friend of ours eleven eighty nine talking of the common remark that affection descends said that this was wisely contrived for the preservation of mankind for which it was not so necessary that there should be affection from children to parents as from parents to children nay there would be no harm in that view though children should at a certain age eat their parents JOHNSON But Sir if this were known generally to be the case parents would not have affection for children BOSWELL True Sir for it is in expectation of a return that parents are so attentive to their children and I know a very pretty instance of a little girl of whom her father was very fond who once when he was in a melancholy fit and had gone to bed persuaded him to rise in good humour by saying My dear papa please to get up and let me help you on with your clothes that I may learn to do it when you are an old man Soon after this time a little incident occurred which I will not suppress because I am desirous that my work should be as much as is consistent with the strictest truth an antidote to the false and injurious notions of his character which have been given by others and therefore I infuse every drop of genuine sweetness into my biographical cup TO doctor JOHNSON MY DEAR SIR I am in great pain with an inflamed foot and obliged to keep my bed so am prevented from having the pleasure to dine at mister Ramsay s to day which is very hard and my spirits are sadly sunk Will you be so friendly as to come and sit an hour with me in the evening I am ever Your most faithful And affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL South Audley street eleven ninety Monday April twenty six TO mister BOSWELL mister Johnson laments the absence of mister Boswell and will come to him Harley street eleven ninety one He came to me in the evening and brought Sir Joshua Reynolds I need scarcely say that their conversation while they sat by my bedside was the most pleasing opiate to pain that could have been administered eleven ninety two Johnson being now better disposed to obtain information concerning Pope than he was last year eleven ninety three sent by me to my Lord Marchmont a present of those volumes of his Lives of the Poets which were at this time published with a request to have permission to wait on him and his Lordship who had called on him twice obligingly appointed Saturday the first of May for receiving us On that morning Johnson came to me from Streatham and after drinking chocolate at General Paoli s in South Audley street we proceeded to Lord Marchmont s in Curzon street His Lordship met us at the door of his library and with great politeness said to Johnson I am not going to make an encomium upon myself by telling you the high respect I have for you Sir Johnson was exceedingly courteous and the interview which lasted about two hours during which the Earl communicated his anecdotes of Pope was as agreeable as I could have wished eleven ninety four When we came out I said to Johnson that considering his Lordship s civility I should have been vexed if he had again failed to come Sir said he I would rather have given twenty pounds than not have come I accompanied him to Streatham where we dined and returned to town in the evening On Monday May three I dined with him at mister Dilly s eleven ninety five I pressed him this day for his opinion on the passage in Parnell concerning which I had in vain questioned him in several letters and at length obtained it in due form of law CASE for doctor JOHNSON S Opinion third of May seventeen seventy nine PARNELL in his Hermit has the following passage To clear this doubt to know the world by sight To find if books and eleven ninety six swains report it right For yet by swains alone the world he knew Whose feet came wand ring o er the nightly dew Is there not a contradiction in its being first supposed that the Hermit knew both what books and swains reported of the world yet afterwards said that he knew it by swains alone I think it an inaccuracy He mentions two instructors in the first line and says he had only one in the next eleven ninety seven This evening I set out for Scotland To missus LUCY PORTER IN LICHFIELD DEAR MADAM mister Green has informed me that you are much better I hope I need not tell you that I am glad of it I cannot boast of being much better my old nocturnal complaint still pursues me and my respiration is difficult though much easier than when I left you the summer before last mister and missus Thrale are well Miss has been a little indisposed but she is got well again They have since the loss of their boy had two daughters but they seem likely to want a son I hope you had some books which I sent you I was sorry for poor missus Adey s death and am afraid you will be sometimes solitary but endeavour whether alone or in company to keep yourself cheerful My friends likewise die very fast but such is the state of man I am dear love Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May four seventeen seventy nine He had before I left London resumed the conversation concerning the appearance of a ghost at Newcastle upon Tyne which mister John Wesley believed but to which Johnson did not give credit eleven ninety eight I was however desirous to examine the question closely and at the same time wished to be made acquainted with mister John Wesley for though I differed from him in some points I admired his various talents and loved his pious zeal At my request therefore doctor Johnson gave me a letter of introduction to him To THE REVEREND mister JOHN WESLEY SIR mister Boswell a gentleman who has been long known to me is desirous of being known to you and has asked this recommendation which I give him with great willingness because I think it very much to be wished that worthy and religious men should be acquainted with each other I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May three seventeen seventy nine mister Wesley being in the course of his ministry at Edinburgh I presented this letter to him and was very politely received I begged to have it returned to me which was accordingly done His state eleven ninety nine of the evidence as to the ghost did not satisfy me I did not write to Johnson as usual upon my return to my family but tried how he would be affected by my silence mister Dilly sent me a copy of a note which he received from him on the thirteenth of July in these words TO mister DILLY SIR Since mister Boswell s departure I have never heard from him please to send word what you know of him and whether you have sent my books to his lady I am c SAM JOHNSON My readers will not doubt that his solicitude about me was very flattering To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR What can possibly have happened that keeps us two such strangers to each other I expected to have heard from you when you came home I expected afterwards I went into the country and returned twelve hundred and yet there is no letter from mister Boswell No ill I hope has happened and if ill should happen why should it be concealed from him who loves you Is it a fit of humour that has disposed you to try who can hold out longest without writing If it be you have the victory But I am afraid of something bad set me free from my suspicions My thoughts are at present employed in guessing the reason of your silence you must not expect that I should tell you any thing if I had any thing to tell Write pray write to me and let me know what is or what has been the cause of this long interruption I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON July thirteen seventeen seventy nine To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh July seventeen seventeen seventy nine MY DEAR SIR What may be justly denominated a supine indolence of mind has been my state of existence since I last returned to Scotland In a livelier state I had often suffered severely from long intervals of silence on your part and I had even been chided by you for expressing my uneasiness I was willing to take advantage of my insensibility and while I could bear the experiment to try whether your affection for me would after an unusual silence on my part make you write first This afternoon I have had very high satisfaction by receiving your kind letter of inquiry for which I most gratefully thank you I am doubtful if it was right to make the experiment though I have gained by it I was beginning to grow tender and to upbraid myself especially after having dreamt two nights ago that I was with you I and my wife and my four children are all well I would not delay one post to answer your letter but as it is late I have not time to do more You shall soon hear from me upon many and various particulars and I shall never again put you to any test twelve oh one I am with veneration my dear Sir Your much obliged And faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL On the twenty second of July I wrote to him again and gave him an account of my last interview with my worthy friend mister Edward Dilly at his brother s house at Southill in Bedfordshire where he died soon after I parted from him twelve oh two leaving me a very kind remembrance of his regard I informed him that Lord Hailes who had promised to furnish him with some anecdotes for his Lives of the Poets had sent me three instances of Prior s borrowing from Gombauld in Recueil des Poetes tome three Epigram To John I owed great obligation p twenty five To the Duke of Noailles p thirty two Sauntering Jack and Idle Joan p twenty five My letter was a pretty long one and contained a variety of particulars but he it should seem had not attended to it for his next to me was as follows To JAMES BOSWELL esquire MY DEAR SIR Are you playing the same trick again and trying who can keep silence longest Remember that all tricks are either knavish or childish and that it is as foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity of a wife What can be the cause of this second fit of silence I cannot conjecture but after one trick I will not be cheated by another nor will harass my thoughts with conjectures about the motives of a man who probably acts only by caprice I therefore suppose you are well and that missus Boswell is well too and that the fine summer has restored Lord Auchinleck I am much better than you left me I think I am better than when I was in Scotland twelve oh three I forgot whether I informed you that poor Thrale has been in great danger twelve oh four missus Thrale likewise has miscarried and been much indisposed Every body else is well Langton is in camp I intend to put Lord Hailes s description of Dryden twelve oh five into another edition and as I know his accuracy wish he would consider the dates which I could not always settle to my own mind mister Thrale goes to Brighthelmston about Michaelmas to be jolly and ride a hunting I shall go to town or perhaps to Oxford Exercise and gaiety or rather carelessness will I hope dissipate all remains of his malady and I likewise hope by the change of place to find some opportunities of growing yet better myself I am dear Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Streatham Sept nine twelve oh six seventeen seventy nine My readers will not be displeased at being told every slight circumstance of the manner in which doctor Johnson contrived to amuse his solitary hours He sometimes employed himself in chymistry sometimes in watering and pruning a vine twelve oh seven sometimes in small experiments at which those who may smile should recollect that there are moments which admit of being soothed only by trifles twelve oh eight On the twentieth of September I defended myself against his suspicion of me which I did not deserve and added Pray let us write frequently A whim strikes me that we should send off a sheet once a week like a stage coach whether it be full or not nay though it should be empty The very sight of your handwriting would comfort me and were a sheet to be thus sent regularly we should much oftener convey something were it only a few kind words My friend Colonel James Stuart twelve oh nine second son of the Earl of Bute who had distinguished himself as a good officer of the Bedfordshire militia twelve ten had taken a publick spirited resolution to serve his country in its difficulties by raising a regular regiment and taking the command of it himself This in the heir of the immense property of Wortley was highly honourable twelve eleven Having been in Scotland recruiting he obligingly asked me to accompany him to Leeds then the head quarters of his corps from thence to London for a short time and afterwards to other places to which the regiment might be ordered Such an offer at a time of the year when I had full leisure was very pleasing especially as I was to accompany a man of sterling good sense information discernment and conviviality and was to have a second crop in one year of London and Johnson Of this I informed my illustrious friend in characteristical warm terms in a letter dated the thirtieth of September from Leeds On Monday October four I called at his house before he was up He sent for me to his bedside and expressed his satisfaction at this incidental meeting with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth He called briskly Frank go and get coffee and let us breakfast in splendour During this visit to London I had several interviews with him which it is unnecessary to distinguish particularly I consulted him as to the appointment of guardians to my children in case of my death Sir said he do not appoint a number of guardians When there are many they trust one to another and the business is neglected I would advise you to choose only one let him be a man of respectable character who for his own credit will do what is right let him be a rich man so that he may be under no temptation to take advantage and let him be a man of business who is used to conduct affairs with ability and expertness to whom therefore the execution of the trust will not be burdensome twelve twelve On Sunday October ten we dined together at mister Strahan s The conversation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the East Indies in quest of wealth JOHNSON A man had better have ten thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in England than twenty thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in India because you must compute what you give for money and a man who has lived ten years in India has given up ten years of social comfort and all those advantages which arise from living in England The ingenious mister Brown distinguished by the name of Capability Brown twelve thirteen told me that he was once at the seat of Lord Clive who had returned from India with great wealth and that he shewed him at the door of his bed chamber a large chest which he said he had once had full of gold upon which Brown observed I am glad you can bear it so near your bed chamber twelve fourteen We talked of the state of the poor in London JOHNSON Saunders Welch twelve fifteen the Justice who was once High Constable of Holborn and had the best opportunities of knowing the state of the poor told me that I under rated the number when I computed that twenty a week that is above a thousand a year died of hunger not absolutely of immediate hunger but of the wasting and other diseases which are the consequences of hunger twelve sixteen This happens only in so large a place as London where people are not known What we are told about the great sums got by begging is not true the trade is overstocked And you may depend upon it there are many who cannot get work A particular kind of manufacture fails those who have been used to work at it can for some time work at nothing else You meet a man begging you charge him with idleness he says I am willing to labour Will you give me work I cannot Why then you have no right to charge me with idleness twelve seventeen We left mister Strahan s at seven as Johnson had said he intended to go to evening prayers As we walked along he complained of a little gout in his toe and said I shan t go to prayers to night I shall go to morrow Whenever I miss church on a Sunday I resolve to go another day But I do not always do it twelve eighteen This was a fair exhibition of that vibration between pious resolutions and indolence which many of us have too often experienced I went home with him and we had a long quiet conversation I read him a letter from doctor Hugh Blair concerning Pope in writing whose life he was now employed which I shall insert as a literary curiosity twelve nineteen TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR In the year seventeen sixty three being at London I was carried by doctor John Blair Prebendary of Westminster to dine at old Lord Bathurst s where we found the late mister Mallet Sir James Porter who had been Ambassadour at Constantinople the late doctor Macaulay and two or three more The conversation turning on mister Pope Lord Bathurst told us that The Essay on Man was originally composed by Lord Bolingbroke in prose and that mister Pope did no more than put it into verse that he had read Lord Bolingbroke s manuscript in his own hand writing and remembered well that he was at a loss whether most to admire the elegance of Lord Bolingbroke s prose or the beauty of mister Pope s verse When Lord Bathurst told this mister Mallet bade me attend and remember this remarkable piece of information as by the course of Nature I might survive his Lordship and be a witness of his having said so The conversation was indeed too remarkable to be forgotten A few days after meeting with you who were then also in London you will remember that I mentioned to you what had passed on this subject as I was much struck with this anecdote But what ascertains twelve twenty my recollection of it beyond doubt is that being accustomed to keep a journal of what passed when I was in London which I wrote out every evening I find the particulars of the above information just as I have now given them distinctly marked and am thence enabled to fix this conversation to have passed on Friday the twenty twod of April seventeen sixty three I remember also distinctly though I have not for this the authority of my journal that the conversation going on concerning mister Pope I took notice of a report which had been sometimes propagated that he did not understand Greek twelve twenty one Lord Bathurst said to me that he knew that to be false for that part of the Iliad was translated by mister Pope in his house in the country and that in the mornings when they assembled at breakfast mister Pope used frequently to repeat with great rapture the Greek lines which he had been translating and then to give them his version of them and to compare them together If these circumstances can be of any use to doctor Johnson you have my full liberty to give them to him I beg you will at the same time present to him my most respectful compliments with best wishes for his success and fame in all his literary undertakings I am with great respect my dearest Sir Your most affectionate And obliged humble servant HUGH BLAIR Broughton Park Sept twenty one seventeen seventy nine JOHNSON Depend upon it Sir this is too strongly stated Pope may have had from Bolingbroke the philosophick stamina of his Essay and admitting this to be true Lord Bathurst did not intentionally falsify But the thing is not true in the latitude that Blair seems to imagine we are sure that the poetical imagery which makes a great part of the poem was Pope s own twelve twenty two It is amazing Sir what deviations there are from precise truth in the account which is given of almost every thing twelve twenty three I told missus Thrale You have so little anxiety about truth that you never tax your memory with the exact thing twelve twenty four Now what is the use of the memory to truth if one is careless of exactness Lord Hailes s Annals of Scotland are very exact but they contain mere dry particulars twelve twenty five They are to be considered as a Dictionary You know such things are there and may be looked at when you please Robertson paints but the misfortune is you are sure he does not know the people whom he paints so you cannot suppose a likeness twelve twenty six Characters should never be given by an historian unless he knew the people whom he describes or copies from those who knew them twelve twenty seven BOSWELL Why Sir do people play this trick which I observe now when I look at your grate putting the shovel against it to make the fire burn JOHNSON They play the trick but it does not make the fire burn There is a better setting the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate In days of superstition they thought as it made a cross with the bars it would drive away the witch BOSWELL By associating with you Sir I am always getting an accession of wisdom But perhaps a man after knowing his own character the limited strength of his own mind should not be desirous of having too much wisdom considering quid valeant humeri twelve twenty eight how little he can carry twelve twenty nine JOHNSON Sir be as wise as you can let a man be aliis laetus sapiens sibi Though pleas d to see the dolphins play I mind my compass and my way twelve thirty You may be wise in your study in the morning and gay in company at a tavern in the evening Every man is to take care of his own wisdom and his own virtue without minding too much what others think He said Dodsley first mentioned to me the scheme of an English Dictionary twelve thirty one but I had long thought of it BOSWELL You did not know what you were undertaking JOHNSON Yes Sir I knew very well what I was undertaking and very well how to do it and have done it very well twelve thirty two BOSWELL An excellent climax and it has availed you In your Preface you say What would it avail me in this gloom of solitude twelve thirty three You have been agreeably mistaken In his Life of Milton twelve thirty four he observes I cannot but remark a kind of respect perhaps unconsciously paid to this great man by his biographers every house in which he resided is historically mentioned as if it were an injury to neglect naming any place that he honoured by his presence I had before I read this observation been desirous of shewing that respect to Johnson by various inquiries Finding him this evening in a very good humour I prevailed on him to give me an exact list of his places of residence since he entered the metropolis as an authour which I subjoin in a note twelve thirty five I mentioned to him a dispute between a friend of mine and his lady concerning conjugal infidelity which my friend had maintained was by no means so bad in the husband as in the wife JOHNSON Your friend was in the right Sir Between a man and his Maker it is a different question but between a man and his wife a husband s infidelity is nothing They are connected by children by fortune by serious considerations of community Wise married women don t trouble themselves about the infidelity in their husbands BOSWELL To be sure there is a great difference between the offence of infidelity in a man and that of his wife JOHNSON The difference is boundless The man imposes no bastards upon his wife twelve thirty six Here it may be questioned whether Johnson was entirely in the right I suppose it will not be controverted that the difference in the degree of criminality is very great on account of consequences but still it may be maintained that independent of moral obligation infidelity is by no means a light offence in a husband because it must hurt a delicate attachment in which a mutual constancy is implied with such refined sentiments as Massinger has exhibited in his play of The Picture Johnson probably at another time would have admitted this opinion And let it be kept in remembrance that he was very careful not to give any encouragement to irregular conduct A gentleman twelve thirty seven not adverting to the distinction made by him upon this subject supposed a case of singular perverseness in a wife and heedlessly said That then he thought a husband might do as he pleased with a safe conscience JOHNSON Nay Sir this is wild indeed smiling you must consider that fornication is a crime twelve thirty eight in a single man and you cannot have more liberty by being married He this evening expressed himself strongly against the Roman Catholics observing In every thing in which they differ from us they are wrong He was even against the invocation of saints twelve thirty nine in short he was in the humour of opposition Having regretted to him that I had learnt little Greek as is too generally the case in Scotland that I had for a long time hardly applied at all to the study of that noble language and that I was desirous of being told by him what method to follow he recommended to me as easy helps Sylvanus s First Book of the Iliad Dawson s Lexicon to the Greek New Testament and Hesiod with Pasoris Lexicon at the end of it On Tuesday October thirteen I dined with him at mister Ramsay s with Lord Newhaven twelve forty and some other company none of whom I recollect but a beautiful Miss Graham twelve forty one a relation of his Lordship s who asked doctor Johnson to hob or nob with her He was flattered by such pleasing attention and politely told her he never drank wine but if she would drink a glass of water he was much at her service She accepted Oho Sir said Lord Newhaven you are caught JOHNSON Nay I do not see how I am caught but if I am caught I don t want to get free again If I am caught I hope to be kept Then when the two glasses of water were brought smiling placidly to the young lady he said Madam let us reciprocate Lord Newhaven and Johnson carried on an argument for some time concerning the Middlesex election twelve forty two Johnson said Parliament may be considered as bound by law as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot As it is clear that the House of Commons may expel and expel again and again why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament rather than have a perpetual contest kept up between parliament and the people Lord Newhaven took the opposite side but respectfully said I speak with great deference to you doctor Johnson I speak to be instructed This had its full effect on my friend He bowed his head almost as low as the table to a complimenting nobleman and called out My Lord my Lord I do not desire all this ceremony let us tell our minds to one another quietly After the debate was over he said I have got lights on the subject to day which I had not before This was a great deal from him especially as he had written a pamphlet upon it twelve forty three He observed The House of Commons was originally not a privilege of the people but a check for the Crown on the House of Lords I remember Henry the Eighth wanted them to do something they hesitated in the morning but did it in the afternoon He told them It is well you did or half your heads should have been upon Temple bar twelve forty four But the House of Commons is now no longer under the power of the crown and therefore must be bribed He added I have no delight in talking of publick affairs twelve forty five Of his fellow collegian twelve forty six the celebrated mister George Whitefield he said Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does he did not draw attention by doing better than others but by doing what was strange twelve forty seven Were Astley twelve forty eight to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a horse s back he would collect a multitude to hear him but no wise man would say he had made a better sermon for that I never treated Whitefield s ministry with contempt I believe he did good He had devoted himself to the lower classes of mankind and among them he was of use twelve forty nine But when familiarity and noise claim the praise due to knowledge art and elegance we must beat down such pretensions What I have preserved of his conversation during the remainder of my stay in London at this time is only what follows I told him that when I objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel twelve fifty a celebrated friend twelve fifty one of ours said to me I do not think that men who live laxly in the world as you and I do can with propriety assume such an authority doctor Johnson may who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct But it is not very consistent to shun an infidel to day and get drunk to morrow JOHNSON Nay Sir this is sad reasoning Because a man cannot be right in all things is he to be right in nothing Because a man sometimes gets drunk is he therefore to steal This doctrine would very soon bring a man to the gallows After all however it is a difficult question how far sincere Christians should associate with the avowed enemies of religion for in the first place almost every man s mind may be more or less corrupted by evil communications twelve fifty two secondly the world may very naturally suppose that they are not really in earnest in religion who can easily bear its opponents and thirdly if the profane find themselves quite well received by the pious one of the checks upon an open declaration of their infidelity and one of the probable chances of obliging them seriously to reflect which their being shunned would do is removed He I know not why shewed upon all occasions an aversion to go to Ireland where I proposed to him that we should make a tour JOHNSON It is the last place where I should wish to travel BOSWELL Should you not like to see Dublin Sir JOHNSON No Sir Dublin is only a worse capital BOSWELL Is not the Giant s Causeway worth seeing JOHNSON Worth seeing yes but not worth going to see Yet he had a kindness for the Irish nation and thus generously expressed himself to a gentleman from that country on the subject of an UNION which artful Politicians have often had in view Do not make an union with us Sir We should unite with you only to rob you We should have robbed the Scotch if they had had any thing of which we could have robbed them twelve fifty three Of an acquaintance of ours whose manners and every thing about him though expensive were coarse he said Sir you see in him vulgar prosperity A foreign minister of no very high talents who had been in his company for a considerable time quite overlooked happened luckily to mention that he had read some of his Rambler in Italian and admired it much This pleased him greatly he observed that the title had been translated Il Genio errante though I have been told it was rendered more ludicrously Il Vagabondo twelve fifty four and finding that this minister gave such a proof of his taste he was all attention to him and on the first remark which he made however simple exclaimed The Ambassadour says well His Excellency observes And then he expanded and enriched the little that had been said in so strong a manner that it appeared something of consequence twelve fifty five This was exceedingly entertaining to the company who were present and many a time afterwards it furnished a pleasant topick of merriment The Ambassadeur says well became a laughable term of applause when no mighty matter had been expressed I left London on Monday October eighteen and accompanied Colonel Stuart to Chester where his regiment was to lye for some time mister Boswell to doctor Johnson Chester October twenty two seventeen seventy nine My Dear Sir It was not till one o clock on Monday morning that Colonel Stuart and I left London for we chose to bid a cordial adieu to Lord Mountstuart who was to set out on that day on his embassy to Turin We drove on excellently and reached Lichfield in good time enough that night The Colonel had heard so preferable a character of the George that he would not put up at the Three Crowns so that I did not see our host Wilkins twelve fifty six We found at the George as good accommodation as we could wish to have and I fully enjoyed the comfortable thought that I was in Lichfield again Next morning it rained very hard and as I had much to do in a little time I ordered a post chaise and between eight and nine sallied forth to make a round of visits I first went to mister Green hoping to have had him to accompany me to all my other friends but he was engaged to attend the Bishop of Sodor and Man who was then lying at Lichfield very ill of the gout Having taken a hasty glance at the additions to Green s museum twelve fifty seven from which it was not easy to break away I next went to the Friery twelve fifty eight where I at first occasioned some tumult in the ladies who were not prepared to receive company so early but my name which has by wonderful felicity come to be closely associated with yours soon made all easy and missus Cobb and Miss Adye re assumed their seats at the breakfast table which they had quitted with some precipitation They received me with the kindness of an old acquaintance and after we had joined in a cordial chorus to your praise missus Cobb gave me the high satisfaction of hearing that you said Boswell is a man who I believe never left a house without leaving a wish for his return And she afterwards added that she bid you tell me that if ever I came to Lichfield she hoped I would take a bed at the Friery From thence I drove to Peter Garrick s where I also found a very flattering welcome He appeared to me to enjoy his usual chearfulness and he very kindly asked me to come when I could and pass a week with him From mister Garrick s I went to the Palace to wait on mister Seward twelve fifty nine I was first entertained by his lady and daughter he himself being in bed with a cold according to his valetudinary custom But he desired to see me and I found him drest in his black gown with a white flannel night gown above it so that he looked like a Dominican friar He was good humoured and polite and under his roof too my reception was very pleasing I then proceeded to Stow hill and first paid my respects to missus Gastrell twelve sixty whose conversation I was not willing to quit But my sand glass was now beginning to run low as I could not trespass too long on the Colonel s kindness who obligingly waited for me so I hastened to missus Aston s twelve sixty one whom I found much better than I feared I should and there I met a brother in law of these ladies who talked much of you and very well too as it appeared to me It then only remained to visit missus Lucy Porter which I did I really believe with sincere satisfaction on both sides I am sure I was glad to see her again and as I take her to be very honest I trust she was glad to see me again for she expressed herself so that I could not doubt of her being in earnest What a great key stone of kindness my dear Sir were you that morning for we were all held together by our common attachment to you I cannot say that I ever passed two hours with more self complacency than I did those two at Lichfield Let me not entertain any suspicion that this is idle vanity Will not you confirm me in my persuasion that he who finds himself so regarded has just reason to be happy We got to Chester about midnight on Tuesday and here again I am in a state of much enjoyment Colonel Stuart and his officers treat me with all the civility I could wish and I play my part admirably Laetus aliis sapiens sibi twelve sixty two the classical sentence which you I imagine invented the other day is exemplified in my present existence The Bishop twelve sixty three to whom I had the honour to be known several years ago shews me much attention and I am edified by his conversation I must not omit to tell you that his Lordship admires very highly your Prefaces to the Poets I am daily obtaining an extension of agreeable acquaintance so that I am kept in animated variety and the study of the place itself by the assistance of books and of the Bishop is sufficient occupation Chester pleases my fancy more than any town I ever saw But I will not enter upon it at all in this letter How long I shall stay here I cannot yet say I told a very pleasing young lady twelve sixty four niece to one of the Prebendaries at whose house I saw her I have come to Chester Madam I cannot tell how and far less can I tell how I am to get away from it Do not think me too juvenile I beg it of you my dear Sir to favour me with a letter while I am here and add to the happiness of a happy friend who is ever with affectionate veneration Most sincerely yours James Boswell twelve sixty five If you do not write directly so as to catch me here I shall be disappointed Two lines from you will keep my lamp burning bright To James Boswell esquire Dear Sir Why should you importune me so earnestly to write Of what importance can it be to hear of distant friends to a man who finds himself welcome wherever he goes and makes new friends faster than he can want them If to the delight of such universal kindness of reception any thing can be added by knowing that you retain my good will you may indulge yourself in the full enjoyment of that small addition I am glad that you made the round of Lichfield with so much success the oftener you are seen the more you will be liked It was pleasing to me to read that missus Aston was so well and that Lucy Porter was so glad to see you In the place where you now are there is much to be observed and you will easily procure yourself skilful directors But what will you do to keep away the black dog twelve sixty six that worries you at home If you would in compliance with your father s advice enquire into the old tenures and old charters of Scotland you would certainly open to yourself many striking scenes of the manners of the middle ages twelve sixty seven The feudal system in a country half barbarous is naturally productive of great anomalies in civil life The knowledge of past times is naturally growing less in all cases not of publick record and the past time of Scotland is so unlike the present that it is already difficult for a Scotchman to image the oeconomy of his grandfather Do not be tardy nor negligent but gather up eagerly what can yet be found twelve sixty eight We have I think once talked of another project a History of the late insurrection in Scotland with all its incidents twelve sixty nine Many falsehoods are passing into uncontradicted history Voltaire who loved a striking story has told what he twelve seventy could not find to be true twelve seventy one You may make collections for either of these projects or for both as opportunities occur and digest your materials at leisure The great direction which Burton has left to men disordered like you is this Be not solitary be not idle twelve seventy two which I would thus modify If you are idle be not solitary if you are solitary be not idle There is a letter for you from Your humble servant Sam Johnson twelve seventy three London October twenty seven seventeen seventy nine To doctor Samuel Johnson Carlisle Nov seven seventeen seventy nine My dear Sir That I should importune you to write to me at Chester is not wonderful when you consider what an avidity I have for delight and that the amor of pleasure like the amor nummi twelve seventy four increases in proportion with the quantity which we possess of it Your letter so full of polite kindness and masterly counsel came like a large treasure upon me while already glittering with riches I was quite enchanted at Chester so that I could with difficulty quit it But the enchantment was the reverse of that of Circe for so far was there from being any thing sensual in it that I was all mind I do not mean all reason only for my fancy was kept finely in play And why not If you please I will send you a copy or an abridgement of my Chester journal which is truly a log book of felicity The Bishop treated me with a kindness which was very flattering I told him that you regretted you had seen so little of Chester twelve seventy five His Lordship bade me tell you that he should be glad to shew you more of it I am proud to find the friendship with which you honour me is known in so many places I arrived here late last night Our friend the Dean twelve seventy six has been gone from hence some months but I am told at my inn that he is very populous popular However I found mister Law the Archdeacon son to the Bishop twelve seventy seven and with him I have breakfasted and dined very agreeably I got acquainted with him at the assizes here about a year and a half ago he is a man of great variety of knowledge uncommon genius and I believe sincere religion I received the holy sacrament in the Cathedral in the morning this being the first Sunday in the month and was at prayers there in the evening It is divinely cheering to me to think that there is a Cathedral so near Auchinleck and I now leave Old England in such a state of mind as I am thankful to GOD for granting me The black dog that worries me at home I cannot but dread yet as I have been for some time past in a military train I trust I shall repulse him To hear from you will animate me like the sound of a trumpet I therefore hope that soon after my return to the northern field I shall receive a few lines from you Colonel Stuart did me the honour to escort me in his carriage to shew me Liverpool and from thence back again to Warrington where we parted twelve seventy eight In justice to my valuable wife I must inform you she wrote to me that as I was so happy she would not be so selfish as to wish me to return sooner than business absolutely required my presence She made my clerk write to me a post or two after to the same purpose by commission from her and this day a kind letter from her met me at the Post Office here acquainting me that she and the little ones were well and expressing all their wishes for my return home I am more and more my dear Sir Your affectionate And obliged humble servant JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Your last letter was not only kind but fond But I wish you to get rid of all intellectual excesses and neither to exalt your pleasures nor aggravate your vexations beyond their real and natural state twelve seventy nine Why should you not be as happy at Edinburgh as at Chester In culpa est animus qui se non effugit usquam twelve eighty Please yourself with your wife and children and studies and practice I have sent a petition twelve eighty one from Lucy Porter with which I leave it to your discretion whether it is proper to comply Return me her letter which I have sent that you may know the whole case and not be seduced to any thing that you may afterwards repent Miss Doxy perhaps you know to be mister Garrick s niece If Dean Percy can be popular at Carlisle he may be very happy He has in his disposal two livings each equal or almost equal in value to the deanery he may take one himself and give the other to his son How near is the Cathedral to Auchinleck that you are so much delighted with it It is I suppose at least an hundred and fifty miles off twelve eighty two However if you are pleased it is so far well Let me know what reception you have from your father and the state of his health Please him as much as you can and add no pain to his last years Of our friends here I can recollect nothing to tell you I have neither seen nor heard of Langton Beauclerk is just returned from Brighthelmston I am told much better mister Thrale and his family are still there and his health is said to be visibly improved he has not bathed but hunted twelve eighty three At Bolt court there is much malignity but of late little open hostility twelve eighty four I have had a cold but it is gone Make my compliments to missus Boswell c I am Sir Your humble servant London Nov thirteen seventeen seventy nine SAM JOHNSON On November twenty two and December twenty one I wrote to him from Edinburgh giving a very favourable report of the family of Miss Doxy s lover that after a good deal of enquiry I had discovered the sister of mister Francis Stewart twelve eighty five one of his amanuenses when writing his Dictionary that I had as desired by him paid her a guinea for an old pocket book of her brother s which he had retained and that the good woman who was in very moderate circumstances but contented and placid wondered at his scrupulous and liberal honesty and received the guinea as if sent her by Providence twelve eighty six That I had repeatedly begged of him to keep his promise to send me his letter to Lord Chesterfield and that this memento like Delenda est Carthago must be in every letter that I should write to him till I had obtained my object twelve eighty seven seventeen eighty AETAT seventy one In seventeen eighty the world was kept in impatience for the completion of his Lives of the Poets upon which he was employed so far as his indolence allowed him to labour twelve eighty eight I wrote to him on January one and March thirteen sending him my notes of Lord Marchmont s information concerning Pope complaining that I had not heard from him for almost four months though he was two letters in my debt that I had suffered again from melancholy hoping that he had been in so much better company the Poets that he had not time to think of his distant friends for if that were the case I should have some recompence for my uneasiness that the state of my affairs did not admit of my coming to London this year and begging he would return me Goldsmith s two poems with his lines marked twelve eighty nine His friend doctor Lawrence having now suffered the greatest affliction to which a man is liable and which Johnson himself had felt in the most severe manner Johnson wrote to him in an admirable strain of sympathy and pious consolation To doctor LAWRENCE DEAR SIR At a time when all your friends ought to shew their kindness and with a character which ought to make all that know you your friends you may wonder that you have yet heard nothing from me I have been hindered by a vexatious and incessant cough for which within these ten days I have been bled once fasted four or five times taken physick five times and opiates I think six This day it seems to remit The loss dear Sir which you have lately suffered I felt many years ago and know therefore how much has been taken from you and how little help can be had from consolation He that outlives a wife whom he has long loved sees himself disjoined from the only mind that has the same hopes and fears and interest from the only companion with whom he has shared much good or evil and with whom he could set his mind at liberty to retrace the past or anticipate the future The continuity of being is lacerated twelve ninety the settled course of sentiment and action is stopped and life stands suspended and motionless till it is driven by external causes into a new channel But the time of suspense is dreadful Our first recourse in this distressed solitude is perhaps for want of habitual piety to a gloomy acquiescence in necessity Of two mortal beings one must lose the other but surely there is a higher and better comfort to be drawn from the consideration of that Providence which watches over all and a belief that the living and the dead are equally in the hands of GOD who will reunite those whom he has separated or who sees that it is best not to reunite I am dear Sir Your most affectionate And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON January twenty seventeen eighty To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Well I had resolved to send you the Chesterfield letter but I will write once again without it Never impose tasks upon mortals To require two things is the way to have them both undone For the difficulties which you mention in your affairs I am sorry but difficulty is now very general it is not therefore less grievous for there is less hope of help I pretend not to give you advice not knowing the state of your affairs and general counsels about prudence and frugality would do you little good You are however in the right not to increase your own perplexity by a journey hither and I hope that by staying at home you will please your father Poor dear Beauclerk twelve ninety one nec ut soles dabis joca twelve ninety two His wit and his folly his acuteness and maliciousness his merriment and reasoning are now over Such another will not often be found among mankind He directed himself to be buried by the side of his mother an instance of tenderness which I hardly expected twelve ninety three He has left his children to the care of Lady Di and if she dies of mister Langton and of mister Leicester his relation and a man of good character His library has been offered to sale to the Russian ambassador twelve ninety four doctor Percy notwithstanding all the noise of the newspapers has had no literary loss twelve ninety five Clothes and moveables were burnt to the value of about one hundred pounds but his papers and I think his books were all preserved Poor mister Thrale has been in extreme danger from an apoplectical disorder and recovered beyond the expectation of his physicians he is now at Bath that his mind may be quiet and missus Thrale and Miss are with him Having told you what has happened to your friends let me say something to you of yourself You are always complaining of melancholy and I conclude from those complaints that you are fond of it No man talks of that which he is desirous to conceal and every man desires to conceal that of which he is ashamed twelve ninety six Do not pretend to deny it manifestum habemus furem make it an invariable and obligatory law to yourself never to mention your own mental diseases if you are never to speak of them you will think on them but little and if you think little of them they will molest you rarely When you talk of them it is plain that you want either praise or pity for praise there is no room and pity will do you no good therefore from this hour speak no more think no more about them twelve ninety seven Your transaction with missus Stewart gave me great satisfaction I am much obliged to you for your attention Do not lose sight of her your countenance may be of great credit and of consequence of great advantage to her The memory of her brother is yet fresh in my mind he was an ingenious and worthy man Please to make my compliments to your lady and to the young ladies I should like to see them pretty loves I am dear Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON April eight seventeen eighty missus Thrale being now at Bath with her husband the correspondence between Johnson and her was carried on briskly I shall present my readers with one of her original letters to him at this time which will amuse them probably more than those well written but studied epistles which she has inserted in her collection because it exhibits the easy vivacity of their literary intercourse It is also of value as a key to Johnson s answer which she has printed by itself and of which I shall subjoin extracts missus THRALE TO doctor JOHNSON I had a very kind letter from you yesterday dear Sir with a most circumstantial date twelve ninety eight You took trouble with my circulating letter twelve ninety nine mister Evans writes me word and I thank you sincerely for so doing one might do mischief else not being on the spot Yesterday s evening was passed at missus Montagu s there was mister Melmoth thirteen hundred I do not like him though nor he me it was expected we should have pleased each other he is however just Tory enough to hate the Bishop of Peterborough thirteen oh one for Whiggism and Whig enough to abhor you for Toryism missus Montagu flattered him finely so he had a good afternoon on t This evening we spend at a concert Poor Queeney s thirteen oh two sore eyes have just released her she had a long confinement and could neither read nor write so my master thirteen oh three treated her very good naturedly with the visits of a young woman in this town a taylor s daughter who professes musick and teaches so as to give six lessons a day to ladies at five and threepence a lesson Miss Burney says she is a great performer and I respect the wench for getting her living so prettily she is very modest and pretty mannered and not seventeen years old You live in a fine whirl indeed if I did not write regularly you would half forget me and that would be very wrong for I felt my regard for you in my face last night when the criticisms were going on This morning it was all connoisseurship we went to see some pictures painted by a gentleman artist mister Taylor of this place my master makes one every where and has got a good dawling thirteen oh four companion to ride with him now He looks well enough but I have no notion of health for a man whose mouth cannot be sewed up thirteen oh five Burney thirteen oh six and I and Queeney teize him every meal he eats and missus Montagu is quite serious with him but what can one do He will eat I think and if he does eat I know he will not live it makes me very unhappy but I must bear it Let me always have your friendship I am most sincerely dear Sir Your faithful servant H L T Bath Friday April twenty eight doctor JOHNSON TO missus THRALE DEAREST MADAM mister Thrale never will live abstinently till he can persuade himself to live by rule thirteen oh seven Encourage as you can the musical girl Nothing is more common than mutual dislike where mutual approbation is particularly expected There is often on both sides a vigilance not over benevolent and as attention is strongly excited so that nothing drops unheeded any difference in taste or opinion and some difference where there is no restraint will commonly appear immediately generates dislike Never let criticisms operate upon your face or your mind it is very rarely that an authour is hurt by his criticks The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out but it often dies in the socket thirteen oh eight a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed From the authour of Fitzosborne s Letters I cannot think myself in much danger I met him only once about thirty years ago and in some small dispute reduced him to whistle having not seen him since that is the last impression Poor Moore the fabulist thirteen oh nine was one of the company missus Montagu s long stay against her own inclination is very convenient You would by your own confession want a companion and she is par pluribus conversing with her you may find variety in one thirteen ten London May one seventeen eighty On the and of May I wrote to him and requested that we might have another meeting somewhere in the North of England in the autumn of this year From mister Langton I received soon after this time a letter of which I extract a passage relative both to mister Beauclerk and doctor Johnson The melancholy information you have received concerning mister Beauclerk s death is true Had his talents been directed in any sufficient degree as they ought I have always been strongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illustrious figure and that opinion as it had been in part formed upon doctor Johnson s judgment receives more and more confirmation by hearing what since his death doctor Johnson has said concerning them a few evenings ago he was at mister Vesey s thirteen eleven where Lord Althorpe thirteen twelve who was one of a numerous company there addressed doctor Johnson on the subject of mister Beauclerk s death saying Our CLUB has had a great loss since we met last He replied A loss that perhaps the whole nation could not repair The Doctor then went on to speak of his endowments and particularly extolled the wonderful ease with which he uttered what was highly excellent He said that no man ever was so free when he was going to say a good thing from a look that expressed that it was coming or when he had said it from a look that expressed that it had come At mister Thrale s some days before when we were talking on the same subject he said referring to the same idea of his wonderful facility That Beauclerk s talents were those which he had felt himself more disposed to envy than those of any whom he had known thirteen thirteen On the evening I have spoken of above at mister Vesey s you would have been much gratified as it exhibited an instance of the high importance in which doctor Johnson s character is held I think even beyond any I ever before was witness to The company consisted chiefly of ladies among whom were the Duchess Dowager of Portland thirteen fourteen the Duchess of Beaufort whom I suppose from her rank I must name before her mother missus Boscawen and her elder sister missus Lewson who was likewise there Lady Lucan thirteen fifteen Lady Clermont and others of note both for their station and understandings Among the gentlemen were Lord Althorpe whom I have before named Lord Macartney Sir Joshua Reynolds Lord Lucan mister Wraxal thirteen sixteen whose book you have probably seen The Tour to the Northern Parts of Europe a very agreeable ingenious man doctor Warren mister Pepys the Master in Chancery whom I believe you know and doctor Barnard the Provost of Eton thirteen seventeen As soon as doctor Johnson was come in and had taken a chair thirteen eighteen the company began to collect round him till they became not less than four if not five deep those behind standing and listening over the heads of those that were sitting near him thirteen nineteen The conversation for some time was chiefly between doctor Johnson and the Provost of Eton while the others contributed occasionally their remarks Without attempting to detail the particulars of the conversation which perhaps if I did I should spin my account out to a tedious length I thought my dear Sir this general account of the respect with which our valued friend was attended to might be acceptable thirteen twenty To THE REVEREND doctor FARMER May twenty five seventeen eighty Sir I know your disposition to second any literary attempt and therefore venture upon the liberty of entreating you to procure from College or University registers all the dates or other informations which they can supply relating to Ambrose Philips Broome and Gray who were all of Cambridge and of whose lives I am to give such accounts as I can gather Be pleased to forgive this trouble from Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON While Johnson was thus engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world the tranquillity of the metropolis of Great Britain was unexpectedly disturbed by the most horrid series of outrage that ever disgraced a civilised country A relaxation of some of the severe penal provisions against our fellow subjects of the Catholic communion had been granted by the legislature with an opposition so inconsiderable that the genuine mildness of Christianity united with liberal policy seemed to have become general in this island thirteen twenty one But a dark and malignant spirit of persecution soon shewed itself in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wise and humane statute That petition was brought forward by a mob with the evident purpose of intimidation and was justly rejected But the attempt was accompanied and followed by such daring violence as is unexampled in history Of this extraordinary tumult doctor Johnson has given the following concise lively and just account in his Letters to missus Thrale thirteen twenty two On Friday thirteen twenty three the good Protestants met in Saint George s Fields at the summons of Lord George Gordon and marching to Westminster insulted the Lords and Commons who all bore it with great tameness At night the outrages began by the demolition of the mass house by Lincoln s Inn An exact journal of a week s defiance of government I cannot give you On Monday mister Strahan thirteen twenty four who had been insulted spoke to Lord Mansfield who had I think been insulted too of the licentiousness of the populace and his Lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity On Tuesday night thirteen twenty five they pulled down Fielding s house and burnt his goods in the street They had gutted on Monday Sir George Savile s house but the building was saved On Tuesday evening leaving Fielding s ruins they went to Newgate to demand their companions who had been seized demolishing the chapel The keeper could not release them but by the Mayor s permission which he went to ask at his return he found all the prisoners released and Newgate in a blaze They then went to Bloomsbury and fastened upon Lord Mansfield s house which they pulled down and as for his goods they totally burnt them thirteen twenty six They have since gone to Caen wood but a guard was there before them They plundered some Papists I think and burnt a mass house thirteen twenty seven in Moorfields the same night On Wednesday I walked with doctor Scott to look at Newgate and found it in ruins with the fire yet glowing As I went by the Protestants were plundering the Sessions house at the Old Bailey There were not I believe a hundred but they did their work at leisure in full security without sentinels without trepidation as men lawfully employed in full day Such is the cowardice of a commercial place On Wednesday they broke open the Fleet and the King s Bench and the Marshalsea and Wood street Compter and Clerkenwell Bridewell and released all the prisoners thirteen twenty eight At night they set fire to the Fleet and to the King s Bench and I know not how many other places and one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts The sight was dreadful Some people were threatened mister Strahan advised me to take care of myself Such a time of terrour you have been happy in not seeing The King said in Council That the magistrates had not done their duty but that he would do his own and a proclamation was published directing us to keep our servants within doors as the peace was now to be preserved by force The soldiers were sent out to different parts and the town is now June nine at quiet The soldiers thirteen twenty nine are stationed so as to be every where within call there is no longer any body of rioters and the individuals are hunted to their holes and led to prison Lord George was last night sent to the Tower mister John Wilkes was this day thirteen thirty in my neighbourhood to seize the publisher of a seditious paper Several chapels have been destroyed and several inoffensive Papists have been plundered but the high sport was to burn the gaols This was a good rabble trick The debtors and the criminals were all set at liberty but of the criminals as has always happened many are already retaken and two pirates have surrendered themselves and it is expected that they will be pardoned Government now acts again with its proper force and we are all thirteen thirty one under the protection of the King and the law I thought that it would be agreeable to you and my master to have my testimony to the publick security and that you would sleep more quietly when I told you that you are safe There has indeed been an universal panick from which the King was the first that recovered Without the concurrence of his ministers or the assistance of the civil magistrate he put the soldiers in motion and saved the town from calamities such as a rabble s government must naturally produce The publick thirteen thirty two has escaped a very heavy calamity The rioters attempted the Bank on Wednesday night but in no great number and like other thieves with no great resolution Jack Wilkes headed the party that drove them away It is agreed that if they had seized the Bank on Tuesday at the height of the panick when no resistance had been prepared they might have carried irrecoverably away whatever they had found Jack who was always zealous for order and decency thirteen thirty three declares that if he be trusted with power he will not leave a rioter alive There is however now no longer any need of heroism or bloodshed no blue ribband thirteen thirty four is any longer worn thirteen thirty five Such was the end of this miserable sedition from which London was delivered by the magnanimity of the Sovereign himself Whatever some may maintain I am satisfied that there was no combination or plan either domestic or foreign but that the mischief spread by a gradual contagion of frenzy augmented by the quantities of fermented liquors of which the deluded populace possessed themselves in the course of their depredations I should think myself very much to blame did I here neglect to do justice to my esteemed friend mister Akerman the keeper of Newgate who long discharged a very important trust with an uniform intrepid firmness and at the same time a tenderness and a liberal charity which entitle him to be recorded with distinguished honour thirteen thirty six Upon this occasion from the timidity and negligence of magistracy on the one hand and the almost incredible exertions of the mob on the other the first prison of this great country was laid open and the prisoners set free but that mister Akerman whose house was burnt would have prevented all this had proper aid been sent to him in due time there can be no doubt Many years ago a fire broke out in the brick part which was built as an addition to the old gaol of Newgate The prisoners were in consternation and tumult calling out We shall be burnt we shall be burnt Down with the gate down with the gate mister Akerman hastened to them shewed himself at the gate and having after some confused vociferation of Hear him hear him obtained a silent attention he then calmly told them that the gate must not go down that they were under his care and that they should not be permitted to escape but that he could assure them they need not be afraid of being burnt for that the fire was not in the prison properly so called which was strongly built with stone and that if they would engage to be quiet he himself would come in to them and conduct them to the further end of the building and would not go out till they gave him leave To this proposal they agreed upon which mister Akerman having first made them fall back from the gate went in and with a determined resolution ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to open the gate even though the prisoners though he trusted they would not should break their word and by force bring himself to order it Never mind me said he should that happen The prisoners peaceably followed him while he conducted them through passages of which he had the keys to the extremity of the gaol which was most distant from the fire Having by this very judicious conduct fully satisfied them that there was no immediate risk if any at all he then addressed them thus Gentlemen you are now convinced that I told you true I have no doubt that the engines will soon extinguish this fire if they should not a sufficient guard will come and you shall all be taken out and lodged in the Compters thirteen thirty seven I assure you upon my word and honour that I have not a farthing insured I have left my house that I might take care of you I will keep my promise and stay with you if you insist upon it but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property I shall thirteen thirty eight be obliged to you Struck with his behaviour they called out Master Akerman you have done bravely it was very kind in you by all means go and take care of your own concerns He did so accordingly while they remained and were all preserved Johnson has been heard to relate the substance of this story with high praise in which he was joined by mister Burke My illustrious friend speaking of mister Akerman s kindness to his prisoners pronounced this eulogy upon his character He who has long had constantly in his view the worst of mankind and is yet eminent for the humanity of his disposition must have had it originally in a great degree and continued to cultivate it very carefully thirteen thirty nine In the course of this month my brother David waited upon doctor Johnson with the following letter of introduction which I had taken care should be lying ready on his arrival in London To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh April twenty nine seventeen eighty MY DEAR SIR This will be delivered to you by my brother David on his return from Spain You will be glad to see the man who vowed to stand by the old castle of Auchinleck with heart purse and sword that romantick family solemnity devised by me of which you and I talked with complacency upon the spot I trust that twelve years of absence have not lessened his feudal attachment and that you will find him worthy of being introduced to your acquaintance I have the honour to be With affectionate veneration My dear Sir Your most faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL Johnson received him very politely and has thus mentioned him in a letter to missus Thrale thirteen forty I have had with me a brother of Boswell s a Spanish merchant thirteen forty one whom the war has driven from his residence at Valentia he is gone to see his friends and will find Scotland but a sorry place after twelve years residence in a happier climate He is a very agreeable man and speaks no Scotch To doctor BEATTIE AT ABERDEEN Sir More years thirteen forty two than I have any delight to reckon have past since you and I saw one another of this however there is no reason for making any reprehensory complaint Sic fata ferunt thirteen forty three But methinks there might pass some small interchange of regard between us If you say that I ought to have written I now write and I write to tell you that I have much kindness for you and missus Beattie and that I wish your health better and your life long Try change of air and come a few degrees Southwards a softer climate may do you both good winter is coming on and London will be warmer and gayer and busier and more fertile of amusement than Aberdeen My health is better but that will be little in the balance when I tell you that missus Montagu has been very ill and is I doubt now but weakly mister Thrale has been very dangerously disordered but is much better and I hope will totally recover He has withdrawn himself from business the whole summer Sir Joshua and his sister are well and mister Davies has got great success as an authour thirteen forty four generated by the corruption of a bookseller thirteen forty five More news I have not to tell you and therefore you must be contented with hearing what I know not whether you much wish to hear thirteen forty six that I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Bolt court Fleet street August twenty one seventeen eighty To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I find you have taken one of your fits of taciturnity and have resolved not to write till you are written to it is but a peevish humour but you shall have your way I have sat at home in Bolt court all the summer thinking to write the Lives and a great part of the time only thinking Several of them however are done and I still think to do the rest mister Thrale and his family have since his illness passed their time first at Bath and then at Brighthelmston but I have been at neither place I would have gone to Lichfield if I could have had time and I might have had time if I had been active but I have missed much and done little In the late disturbances mister Thrale s house and stock were in great danger the mob was pacified at their first invasion with about fifty pounds in drink and meat and at their second were driven away by the soldiers thirteen forty seven mister Strahan got a garrison into his house and maintained them a fortnight he was so frighted that he removed part of his goods missus Williams took shelter in the country I know not whether I shall get a ramble this autumn thirteen forty eight it is now about the time when we were travelling I have however better health than I had then and hope you and I may yet shew ourselves on some part of Europe Asia or Africa thirteen forty nine In the mean time let us play no trick but keep each other s kindness by all means in our power The bearer of this is doctor Dunbar of Aberdeen who has written and published a very ingenious book thirteen fifty and who I think has a kindness for me and will when he knows you have a kindness for you I suppose your little ladies are grown tall and your son is become a learned young man I love them all and I love your naughty lady whom I never shall persuade to love me When the Lives are done I shall send them to complete her collection but must send them in paper as for want of a pattern I cannot bind them to fit the rest I am Sir Yours most affectionately SAM JOHNSON London Aug twenty one seventeen eighty This year he wrote to a young clergyman thirteen fifty one in the country the following very excellent letter which contains valuable advice to Divines in general Dear Sir Not many days ago doctor Lawrence shewed me a letter in which you make mention of me I hope therefore you will not be displeased that I endeavour to preserve your good will by some observations which your letter suggested to me You are afraid of falling into some improprieties in the daily service by reading to an audience that requires no exactness Your fear I hope secures you from danger They who contract absurd habits are such as have no fear It is impossible to do the same thing very often without some peculiarity of manner but that manner may be good or bad and a little care will at least preserve it from being bad to make it good there must I think be something of natural or casual felicity which cannot be taught Your present method of making your sermons seems very judicious Few frequent preachers can be supposed to have sermons more their own than yours will be Take care to register somewhere or other the authours from whom your several discourses are borrowed and do not imagine that you shall always remember even what perhaps you now think it impossible to forget My advice however is that you attempt from time to time an original sermon and in the labour of composition do not burthen your mind with too much at once do not exact from yourself at one effort of excogitation propriety of thought and elegance of expression Invent first and then embellish The production of something where nothing was before is an act of greater energy than the expansion or decoration of the thing produced Set down diligently your thoughts as they rise in the first words that occur and when you have matter you will easily give it form nor perhaps will this method be always necessary for by habit your thoughts and diction will flow together thirteen fifty two The composition of sermons is not very difficult the divisions not only help the memory of the hearer but direct the judgement of the writer they supply sources of invention and keep every part in its proper place What I like least in your letter is your account of the manners of your parish from which I gather that it has been long neglected by the parson The Dean of Carlisle thirteen fifty three who was then a little rector in Northamptonshire thirteen fifty four told me that it might be discerned whether or no there was a clergyman resident in a parish by the civil or savage manner of the people Such a congregation as yours stands in need of much reformation and I would not have you think it impossible to reform them A very savage parish was civilised by a decayed gentlewoman who came among them to teach a petty school My learned friend doctor Wheeler thirteen fifty five of Oxford when he was a young man had the care of a neighbouring parish for fifteen pounds a year which he was never paid but he counted it a convenience that it compelled him to make a sermon weekly One woman he could not bring to the communion and when he reproved or exhorted her she only answered that she was no scholar He was advised to set some good woman or man of the parish a little wiser than herself to talk to her in a language level to her mind Such honest I may call them holy artifices must be practised by every clergyman for all means must be tried by which souls may be saved thirteen fifty six Talk to your people however as much as you can and you will find that the more frequently you converse with them upon religious subjects the more willingly they will attend and the more submissively they will learn A clergyman s diligence always makes him venerable I think I have now only to say that in the momentous work you have undertaken I pray GOD to bless you I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Bolt court Aug thirty seventeen eighty My next letters to him were dated August twenty four September six and October one and from them I extract the following passages My brother David and I find the long indulged fancy of our comfortable meeting again at Auchinleck so well realised that it in some degree confirms the pleasing hope of O preclarum diem thirteen fifty seven in a future state I beg that you may never again harbour a suspicion of my indulging a peevish humour or playing tricks you will recollect that when I confessed to you that I had once been intentionally silent to try your regard I gave you my word and honour that I would not do so again thirteen fifty eight I rejoice to hear of your good state of health I pray GOD to continue it long I have often said that I would willingly have ten years added to my life to have ten taken from yours I mean that I would be ten years older to have you ten years younger But let me be thankful for the years during which I have enjoyed your friendship and please myself with the hopes of enjoying it many years to come in this state of being trusting always that in another state we shall meet never to be separated Of this we can form no notion but the thought though indistinct is delightful when the mind is calm and clear thirteen fifty nine The riots in London were certainly horrible but you give me no account of your own situation during the barbarous anarchy A description of it by doctor JOHNSON would be a great painting thirteen sixty you might write another London a Poem I am charmed with your condescending affectionate expression let us keep each other s kindness by all the means in our power my revered Friend how elevating is it to my mind that I am found worthy to be a companion to doctor Samuel Johnson All that you have said in grateful praise of mister Walmsley thirteen sixty one I have long thought of you but we are both Tories thirteen sixty two which has a very general influence upon our sentiments I hope that you will agree to meet me at York about the end of this month or if you will come to Carlisle that would be better still in case the Dean be there Please to consider that to keep each other s kindness we should every year have that free and intimate communication of mind which can be had only when we are together We should have both our solemn and our pleasant talk I write now for the third time to tell you that my desire for our meeting this autumn is much increased I wrote to Squire Godfrey Bosville thirteen sixty three my Yorkshire chief that I should perhaps pay him a visit as I was to hold a conference with doctor Johnson at York I give you my word and honour that I said not a word of his inviting you but he wrote to me as follows I need not tell you I shall be happy to see you here the latter end of this month as you propose and I shall likewise be in hopes that you will persuade doctor Johnson to finish the conference here It will add to the favour of your own company if you prevail upon such an associate to assist your observations I have often been entertained with his writings and I once belonged to a club of which he was a member and I never spent an evening there but I heard something from him well worth remembering We have thus my dear Sir good comfortable quarters in the neighbourhood of York where you may be assured we shall be heartily welcome I pray you then resolve to set out and let not the year seventeen eighty be a blank in our social calendar and in that record of wisdom and wit which I keep with so much diligence to your honour and the instruction and delight of others mister Thrale had now another contest for the representation in parliament of the borough of Southwark and Johnson kindly lent him his assistance by writing advertisements and letters for him I shall insert one as a specimen TO THE WORTHY ELECTORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK GENTLEMEN A new Parliament being now called I again solicit the honour of being elected for one of your representatives and solicit it with the greater confidence as I am not conscious of having neglected my duty or of having acted otherwise than as becomes the independent representative of independent constituents superiour to fear hope and expectation who has no private purposes to promote and whose prosperity is involved in the prosperity of his country As my recovery from a very severe distemper is not yet perfect I have declined to attend the Hall and hope an omission so necessary will not be harshly censured I can only send my respectful wishes that all your deliberations may tend to the happiness of the kingdom and the peace of the borough I am Gentlemen Your most faithful And obedient servant HENRY THRALE Southwark Sept five seventeen eighty On his birth day Johnson has this note I am now beginning the seventy second year of my life with more strength of body and greater vigour of mind than I think is common at that age thirteen sixty four But still he complains of sleepless nights and idle days and forgetfulness or neglect of resolutions He thus pathetically expresses himself Surely I shall not spend my whole life with my own total disapprobation thirteen sixty five mister Macbean whom I have mentioned more than once as one of Johnson s humble friends a deserving but unfortunate man being now oppressed by age and poverty Johnson solicited the Lord Chancellor Thurlow to have him admitted into the Charterhouse I take the liberty to insert his Lordship s answer thirteen sixty six as I am eager to embrace every occasion of augmenting the respectable notion which should ever be entertained of my illustrious friend To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON London October twenty four seventeen eighty SIR I have this moment received your letter dated the nineteenth and returned from Bath In the beginning of the summer I placed one in the Chartreux thirteen sixty seven without the sanction of a recommendation so distinct and so authoritative as yours of Macbean and I am afraid that according to the establishment of the House the opportunity of making the charity so good amends will not soon recur But whenever a vacancy shall happen if you ll favour me with notice of it I will try to recommend him to the place even though it should not be my turn to nominate I am Sir with great regard Your most faithful And obedient servant THURLOW thirteen sixty eight To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I am sorry to write you a letter that will not please you and yet it is at last what I resolve to do This year must pass without an interview the summer has been foolishly lost like many other of my summers and winters I hardly saw a green field but staid in town to work without working much mister Thrale s loss of health has lost him the election thirteen sixty nine he is now going to Brighthelmston and expects me to go with him and how long I shall stay I cannot tell I do not much like the place but yet I shall go and stay while my stay is desired We must therefore content ourselves with knowing what we know as well as man can know the mind of man that we love one another and that we wish each other s happiness and that the lapse of a year cannot lessen our mutual kindness I was pleased to be told that I accused missus Boswell unjustly in supposing that she bears me ill will I love you so much that I would be glad to love all that love you and that you love and I have love very ready for missus Boswell if she thinks it worthy of acceptance I hope all the young ladies and gentlemen are well I take a great liking to your brother He tells me that his father received him kindly but not fondly however you seem to have lived well enough at Auchinleck while you staid Make your father as happy as you can You lately told me of your health I can tell you in return that my health has been for more than a year past better than it has been for many years before Perhaps it may please GOD to give us some time together before we are parted I am dear Sir Yours most affectionately SAM JOHNSON October seventeen seventeen eighty APPENDIX A Page three hundred fourteen The alehouse in the city where Johnson used to go and sit with George Psalmanazar was no doubt the club in Old Street where he met also the metaphysical tailor the uncle of Hoole the poet post under March thirty seventeen eighty three Psalmanazar is mentioned a third time by Boswell post May fifteen seventeen eighty four in a passage borrowed from Hawkins s edition of Johnson s Works xi two hundred six where it is stated that Johnson said He had never seen the close of the life of any one that he wished so much his own to resemble as that of him for its purity and devotion He was asked whether he ever contradicted him I should as soon said he have thought of contradicting a bishop When he was asked whether he had ever mentioned Formosa before him he said he was afraid to mention even China We learn from Hawkins s Life of Johnson p five hundred forty seven that Psalmanazar lived in Ironmonger Row Old Street in the neighbourhood whereof he was so well known and esteemed that as doctor Hawkesworth once told me scarce any person even children passed him without shewing him the usual signs of respect In the list of the writers of the Universal History that Johnson drew up a few days before his death his name is given as the historian of the Jews Gauls and Spaniards post November seventeen eighty four According to missus Piozzi Anecdotes p one hundred seventy five His pious and patient endurance of a tedious illness ending in an exemplary death confirmed the strong impression his merit had made upon the mind of mister Johnson It is so very difficult said he always for a sick man not to be a scoundrel Johnson in Prayers and Meditations p one hundred two mentions him as a man whose life was I think uniform Smollett in Humphry Clinker in Melford s Letter of June ten describes him as one who after having drudged half a century in the literary mill in all the simplicity and abstinence of an Asiatic subsists upon the charity of a few booksellers just sufficient to keep him from the parish A writer in the Annual Register for seventeen sixty four ii seventy one speaking of the latter part of his life says He was concerned in compiling and writing works of credit and lived exemplarily for many years He died a few days before that memorable sixteenth day of May seventeen sixty three when Boswell first met Johnson It is a pity that no record has been kept of the club meetings in Ironmonger Row for then we should have seen Johnson in a new light Johnson in an alehouse club with a metaphysical tailor on one side of him and an aged writer on the other side of him who spoke English with the city accent and coarsely enough thirteen seventy and whom he would never venture to contradict is a Johnson that we cannot easily imagine Of the greater part of Psalmanazar s life we know next to nothing little I believe beyond the few facts that I have here gathered together His early years he has described in his Memoirs That he started as one of the most shameless impostors and that he remained a hypocrite and a cheat till he was fully forty if not indeed longer his own narrative shows That for many years he lived laboriously frugally and honestly seems to be no less certain How far his Memoirs are truthful is somewhat doubtful In them he certainly confesses the impudent trick which he had played in his youth when he passed himself off as a Formosan convert He wished he writes to undeceive the world by unravelling that whole mystery of iniquity p five He lays bare roguery enough and in a spirit it seems of real sorrow Nevertheless there are passages which are not free from the leaven of hypocrisy and there are I suspect statements which are at least partly false Johnson indeed looked upon him as little less than a saint but then as Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us though Johnson was not easily imposed upon by professions to honesty and candour he appeared to have little suspicion of hypocrisy in religion thirteen seventy one It was in the year seventeen oh four that Psalmanazar published his Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa So gross is the forgery that it almost passes belief that it was widely accepted as a true narrative He gave himself out as a native of that island and a convert to Christianity He lied so foolishly as to maintain that in the Academies of Formosa Greek was studied p two hundred ninety He asserted also that in an island that is only about half as large as Ireland eighteen thousand boys were sacrificed every year p one hundred seventy six But his readers were for the most part only too willing to be deceived for in Protestant England his abuse of the Jesuits covered a multitude of lies Ere he had been three months in London he was he writes Memoirs p one hundred seventy nine cried up for a prodigy and not only the domestic but even the foreign papers had helped to blaze forth many things in his praise He was aided in his fraud by the reverend doctor Innes or Innys a clergyman of the English Church who by means of his interesting convert pushed himself into the notice of Compton Bishop of London and before long was made chaplain general to the English forces in Portugal Memoirs p one hundred ninety one The same man as Boswell tells us ante i three hundred fifty nine by another impudent cheat a second time obtained considerable promotion Psalmanazar s book soon reached a second edition besides the several versions it had abroad p five Yet it is very dull reading just such a piece of work as might be looked for from a young man of little fancy but gifted with a strong memory Nevertheless the author s credit lasted so long that for many years he lived on a subscription which was founded on a belief of his being a Formosan and a real convert to the Church of England p two hundred eight He was even sent to Oxford to study and had rooms in one of the colleges Christ Church if I mistake not p one hundred eighty six It was not only as a student that he was sent by his dupes to that ancient seat of learning the Bishop of London hoped that he would teach the Formosan language to a set of gentlemen who were afterwards to go with him to convert those people to Christianity p one hundred sixty one While he was living the life of a lying scoundrel he was he says p one hundred ninety two happily restrained by Divine Grace so that all sense of remorse was not extinguished and there was no fall into downright infidelity At length he picked up Law s Serious Call which moved him as later on it moved better men ante i sixty eight Step by step he got into a way of steady work and lived henceforth a laborious and honest life It was in the year seventeen twenty eight thirty five years before his death that he began he says to write the narrative of his imposture p fifty nine A dangerous illness and the dread of death had deeply moved him and filled him with the desire of leaving behind a faithful narrative which would undeceive the world Nineteen years later though he did not publish his narrative he made a public confession of his guilt In the unsigned article on Formosa which he wrote in seventeen forty seven for Bowen s Complete System of Geography ii two hundred fifty one he says Psalmanaazaar so he had at one time written his name hath long since ingenuously owned the contrary of the truthfulness of his narrative though not in so public a manner as he might perhaps have done had not such an avowment been likely to have affected some few persons who for private ends took advantage of his youthful vanity to encourage him in an imposture which he might otherwise never had the thought much less the confidence to have carried on These persons being now dead and out of all danger of being hurt by it he now gives us leave to assure the world that the greatest part of that account was fabulous and that he designs to leave behind him a faithful account of that unhappy step and other particulars of his life leading to it to be published after his death In his Memoirs he will not he writes p fifty nine give any account of his real country or family Yet it is quite clear from his own narrative that he was born in the south of France His pronunciation of French had it was said a spice of the Gascoin accent and in that provincial dialect he was so masterly that none but those born in the country could excel him Preface p one If a town can be found that answers to all that he tells of his birth place his whole account may be true but the circumstances that he mentions seem inconsistent The city in which he was born was twenty four miles from an archiepiscopal city in which there was a college of Jesuits p sixty seven and about sixty miles from a noble great city full of gentry and nobility of coaches and all kinds of grandeur the seat of a great university pp seventy six eighty three When he left the great city for Avignon he speaks of himself as going down to Avignon p eighty seven Thence he started on a pilgrimage to Rome and in order to avoid his native place after he had gone no great way he wheeled about to the left to leave the place at some twenty or thirty miles distance p one hundred one He changed his mind however and returned home Thence he set off to join his father who was near five hundred miles off in Germany p sixty The direct route was through the great university city and Lyons p one hundred four His birth place then if his account is true was on the road from Avignon to Rome sixty miles from a great university city and southwards of it for through this university city passed the direct road from his home to Lyons It was moreover sixty miles from an archiepiscopal city I do not think that such a place can be found He says p fifty nine that he thought himself obliged out of respect to his country and family to conceal both it being but too common though unjust to censure them for the crimes of private persons The excuse seems unsatisfactory for he tells enough to shew that he came from the South of France while for his family there was no need of care It was he writes ancient but decayed and he was the only surviving child Of his father and mother he had heard nothing since he started on the career of a pious rogue They must have been dead very many years by the time his Memoirs were given to the world His story shews that at all events for the first part of his life he had been one of the vainest of men and vanity is commonly found joined with a love of mystery He is not consistent moreover in his dates On April twenty three seventeen fifty two he was in the seventy third year of his age p seven so that he was born in either sixteen seventy nine or sixteen eighty When he joined his father he was hardly full sixteen years old p one hundred twelve yet it was a few years after the Peace of Ryswick which was signed on September twenty two sixteen ninety seven He was he says but near twenty when he wrote his History of Formosa p one hundred eighty four This was in the year seventeen oh four With his father he stayed but a short time and then set out rambling northwards At Avignon by shameless lying he had obtained a pass as a young student in theology of Irish extract sic who had left his country for the sake of religion p ninety eight It was wonderful that his fraud had escaped detection there for he had kept his own name because it had something of quality in it p ninety nine He now resolved on a more impudent pretence for passing as an Irishman and a sufferer for religion did not only he writes expose me to the danger of being discovered but came short of the merit and admiration I had expected from it p one hundred twelve He thereupon gave himself out as a Japanese convert and forged a fresh pass clapping to it the old seal p one hundred sixteen He went through different adventures and at last enlisted in the army of the Elector of Cologne an unhappy herd destitute of all sense of religion and shamefacedness He got his discharge but enlisted a second time passing himself off for a Japanese and a heathen under the name of Salmanazar pp one hundred thirty three one hundred forty one Later on he altered it he says by the addition of a letter or two to make it somewhat different from that mentioned in the Book of Kings Shalmaneser II Kings xvii three In his Description of Formosa he wrote it Psalmanaazaar and in later life Psalmanazar In his vanity he invented an awkward show of worship turning his face to the rising or setting sun and pleased to be taken notice of for so doing p one hundred forty four He had moreover the ambition of passing for a moral heathen p one hundred forty seven By way of singularity he next took to living altogether upon raw flesh roots and herbs p one hundred sixty three It was when he was on garrison duty at Sluys that he became acquainted with Innes who was chaplain to a Scotch regiment that was in the pay of the Dutch p one hundred forty eight This man found in him a tool ready made to his hand He had at once seen through his roguery but he used his knowledge only to plunge him deeper in his guilt By working on his fears and his vanity and by small bribes he induced him to profess himself a convert to the Church of England and to submit to baptism p one hundred fifty eight He brought him over to London and introduced him to the Bishop of London and to Tenison Archbishop of Canterbury pp one hundred sixty four one hundred seventy nine Psalmanazar spoke Latin fluently but his Grace had either forgotten his or being unused to the foreign pronunciation was forced to have it interpreted to him by doctor Innes in English p one hundred seventy eight The young impostor everywhere gave himself out as a Formosan who had been entrapped by a Jesuit priest and brought to Avignon There I could expect he wrote no mercy from the Inquisitors if I had not in hypocrisy professed their religion History of Formosa p twenty five He was kept he says in a kind of custody but I trusted under God to my heels p twenty four It was Innes who made him write this History In the confession of his fraud Psalmanazar seems to keep back nothing His repentance appears to be sincere and his later life there can be little question was regular Yet as I have said even his confessions apparently are not free from the old leaven of hypocrisy It is indeed very hard if not altogether impossible for a man who has passed forty years and more as a lying hypocrite altogether to clear his mind of cant In writing of the time when he was still living the life of a lying scoundrel he says I have great reason to acknowledge it the greatest mercy that could befall me that I was so well grounded in the principles and evidence of the Christian religion that neither the conversation of the then freethinkers as they loved to stile themselves and by many of whom I was severely attacked nor the writings of Hobbes Spinosa c against the truth of Divine revelation could appear to me in any other light than as the vain efforts of a dangerous set of men to overturn a religion the best founded and most judiciously calculated to promote the peace and happiness of mankind both temporal and eternal Memoirs p one hundred ninety two Two pages further on he writes a little boastfully it seems of having had some sort of gallantry with the fair sex with many of whom even persons of fortune and character of sense wit and learning I was become he continues a great favourite and might if I could have overcome my natural sheepishness and fear of a repulse have been more successful either by way of matrimony or intrigue He goes on I may truly say that hardly any man who might have enjoyed so great a variety ever indulged himself in so few instances of the unlawful kind as I have done He concludes this passage in his writings by thankfully acknowledging that there must have been some secret providence that kept me from giving such way to unlawful amours as I might otherwise have done to the ruin of my health circumstances c When he came to wish for an honest way of life he was beset with difficulties What a deadly wound he writes must such an unexpected confession have given to my natural vanity and what a mortification would it have been to such sincere honest people as my friends to hear it from my mouth p two hundred thirteen This was natural enough That he long hesitated like a coward on the brink is not to be cast in his teeth seeing that at last he took the plunge But then in speaking of the time when he weakly repeated and to use his own words as it were confirmed anew his old falsehoods he should not have written that as the assurance of God s mercy gave me good grounds to hope so that hope inspired me with a design to use all proper means to obtain it and leave the issue of it to his Divine Providence p two hundred fourteen The only proper means to obtain God s mercy was at once to own to all the world that he had lied It is only the Tartuffes and the Holy Willies who whilst they persist in their guilt talk of leaving the issue to the Divine Providence of God Since this Appendix was in type I have learnt through the kindness of mister C E Doble the editor of Hearne s Remarks and Collections ed eighteen

Psalmanazar lately arrived from Formosa The whole Supper being set to Kettle drums APPENDIX B JOHNSON S TRAVELS AND LOVE OF TRAVELLING Page three hundred fifty two On the passage in the text Macaulay in his Review of Croker s Edition of Boswell s Life of Johnson partly founds the following criticism Johnson s visit to the Hebrides introduced him to a state of society completely new to him and a salutary suspicion of his own deficiencies seems on that occasion to have crossed his mind for the first time He confessed in the last paragraph of his Journey that his thoughts on national manners were the thoughts of one who had seen but little of one who had passed his time almost wholly in cities This feeling however soon passed away It is remarkable that to the last he entertained a fixed contempt for all those modes of life and those studies which tend to emancipate the mind from the prejudices of a particular age or a particular nation Of foreign travel and of history he spoke with the fierce and boisterous contempt of ignorance What does a man learn by travelling Is Beauclerk the better for travelling What did Lord Charlemont learn in his travels except that there was a snake in one of the pyramids of Egypt Macaulay s Essays ed eighteen forty three i four hundred three In another passage p four hundred Macaulay says Johnson was no master of the great science of human nature He had studied not the genus man but the species Londoner Nobody was ever so thoroughly conversant with all the forms of life and all the shades of moral and intellectual character which were to be seen from Islington to the Thames and from Hyde Park corner to Mile end green But his philosophy stopped at the first turnpike gate Of the rural life of England he knew nothing and he took it for granted that everybody who lived in the country was either stupid or miserable Of the two assertions that Macaulay makes in these two passages while one is for the most part true the other is utterly and grossly false Johnson had no contempt for foreign travel That curiosity which animated his eager mind in so many parts of learning did not fail him when his thoughts turned to the great world outside our narrow seas It was his poverty that confined him so long to the neighbourhood of Temple Bar He must in these early days have sometimes felt with Arviragus when he says What should we speak of When we are old as you when we shall hear The rain and wind beat dark December how In this our pinching cave shall we discourse The freezing hours away We have seen nothing With his pension his wanderings at once began His friendship with the Thrales gave them a still wider range His curiosity which in itself was always eager was checked in his more prosperous circumstances by his years his natural unwillingness at any one moment to make an effort and by the want of travelling companions who were animated by a spirit of inquiry and of enterprise equal to his own He did indeed travel much more than is commonly thought and was far less frequently to be seen rolling along Fleet street or stemming the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross than his biographers would have us believe The following table imperfect though it must necessarily be shows how large a part of his life he passed outside the first turnpike gate and beyond the smoke of London seventeen oh nine

know how often this great rhetorician was by the stream of his own mighty rhetoric swept far away from the unadorned strand of naked truth To his unjust and insulting attack I shall content myself with opposing the following extracts which with some trouble I have collected seventeen twenty eight or seventeen twenty nine Johnson in his undergraduate days was one day overheard saying I have a mind to see what is done in other places of learning I ll go and visit the Universities abroad I ll go to France and Italy I ll go to Padua Ante i seventy three seventeen thirty four A generous and elevated mind is distinguished by nothing more certainly than an eminent degree of curiosity nor is that curiosity ever more agreeably or usefully employed than in examining the laws and customs of foreign nations Ante i eighty nine seventeen fifty one Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristicks of a vigorous intellect Rambler No one hundred three Curiosity is in great and generous minds the first passion and the last and perhaps always predominates in proportion to the strength of the contemplative faculties Ib No one hundred fifty seventeen fifty two Francis Barber

Johnson in a letter to the wife of the poet Smart says we have often talked of a voyage to Iceland Post iv three hundred fifty nine note missus Thrale wrote to him when he was in the Hebrides in

have already been in Wales for I wish to see it Ante iii one hundred thirty four Four days later Johnson wrote to missus Thrale Boswell shrinks from the Baltick expedition which I think is the best scheme in our power what we shall substitute I know not He wants to see Wales but except the woods of Bachycraigh post v four hundred thirty six what is there in Wales that can fill the hunger of ignorance or quench the thirst of curiosity We may perhaps form some scheme or other but in the phrase of Hockley in the Hole it is a pity he has not a better bottom Ib note one Boswell writes Martin s account of the Hebrides had impressed us with a notion that we might there contemplate a system of life almost totally different from what we had been accustomed to see doctor Johnson told me that his father put Martin s account into his hands when he was very young and that he was much pleased with it Post v thirteen From the Hebrides Johnson wrote to missus Thrale I have a desire to instruct myself in the whole system of pastoral life but I know not whether I shall be able to perfect the idea However I have many pictures in my mind which I could not have had without this journey and should have passed it with great pleasure had you and Master and Queeney been in the party We should have excited the attention and enlarged the observation of each other and obtained many pleasing topicks of future conversation Piozzi Letters i one hundred fifty nine We travelled with very little light in a storm of wind and rain we passed about fifty five streams that crossed our way and fell into a river that for a very great part of our road foamed and roared beside us all the rougher powers of nature except thunder were in motion but there was no danger I should have been sorry to have missed any of the inconveniencies to have had more light or less rain for their company operation crowded the scene and filled the mind Ib p one hundred seventy seven See post v three hundred thirty four for the splendid passage in which describing the emotions raised in his mind by the sight of Iona he says Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses whatever makes the past the distant or the future predominate over the present advances us in the dignity of thinking beings That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona Macaulay seems to have had the echo of these lines still in his ear when he described imagination as that noble faculty whereby man is able to live in the past and in the future in the distant and in the unreal Essays ed eighteen fifty three iii one hundred sixty seven seventeen seventy four When he saw some copper and iron works in Wales he wrote I have enlarged my notions Post v four hundred forty two See also ante iii one hundred sixty four His letter to Warren Hastings shows his curiosity about India Ante iv sixty eight seventeen seventy five The Thrales had just received a sum of Lfourteen thousand Johnson wrote to missus Thrale If I had money enough what would I do Perhaps if you and master did not hold me I might go to Cairo and down the Red Sea to Bengal and take a ramble to India Would this be better than building and planting It would surely give more variety to the eye and more amplitude to the mind Half fourteen thousand would send me out to see other forms of existence and bring me back to describe them Piozzi Letters i two hundred sixty six Regions mountainous and wild thinly inhabited and little cultivated make a great part of the earth and he that has never seen them must live unacquainted with much of the face of nature and with one of the great scenes of human existence Johnson s Works ix thirty six All travel has its advantages If the traveller visits better countries he may learn to improve his own and if fortune carries him to worse he may learn to enjoy it Ib p one hundred thirty six To doctor Taylor he wrote I came back last Tuesday from France Is not mine a kind of life turned upside down Fixed to a spot when I was young and roving the world when others are contriving to sit still I am wholly unsettled I am a kind of ship with a wide sail and without an anchor Ante ii three hundred eighty seven note two seventeen seventy six In the spring of this year everything was settled for his journey to Italy with the Thrales Hannah More wrote Memoirs i seventy four Johnson and mister Boswell have this day set out for Oxford Lichfield c that the Doctor may take leave of all his old friends previous to his great expedition across the Alps I lament his undertaking such a journey at his time of life with beginning infirmities I hope he will not leave his bones on classic grounds Boswell tells how Speaking with a tone of animation Johnson said We must to be sure see Rome Naples Florence and Venice and as much more as we can Ante iii nineteen When the journey was put off by the sudden death of mister Thrale s son Boswell wrote I perceived that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes that he could not easily part with the scheme for he said I shall probably contrive to get to Italy some other way Ib p twenty eight A day later Boswell wrote A journey to Italy was still in his thoughts He said A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see The grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the Mediterranean Ib p thirty six Johnson s desire to go abroad particularly to see Italy was very great and he had a longing wish too to leave some Latin verses at the Grand Chartreux He loved indeed the very act of travelling He was in some respects an admirable companion on the road as he piqued himself upon feeling no inconvenience and on despising no accommodations Piozzi s Anec p one hundred sixty eight Johnson this same year speaking of a friend who had gone to the East Indies said I had some intention of accompanying him Had I thought then as I do now I should have gone Ante iii twenty According to mister Tyers he once offered to attend another friend to India Moreover he talked much of travelling into Poland to observe the life of the Palatines the account of which struck his curiosity very much Johnsoniana ed eighteen thirty six p one hundred fifty seven seventeen seventy seven Boswell wrote to Johnson this year ante iii one hundred seven You have I believe seen all the cathedrals in England except that of Carlisle This was not the case yet most of them he had already seen or lived to see With Lichfield Oxford and London he was familiar Winchester and Exeter he had seen in seventeen sixty two on his tour to Devonshire ante i

seventeen eighty three post iv two hundred thirty three Wells he might easily have seen when he was at Bath in seventeen seventy six ante iii forty four and possibly Gloucester Through Norwich he perhaps came on his return from Lincolnshire in seventeen sixty four ante i four hundred seventy six Hereford I think he could not have visited When in the September of this year Johnson and Boswell were driving in doctor Taylor s chaise to Derby Johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a post chaise If said he I had no duties and no reference to futurity I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post chaise with a pretty woman but she should be one who could understand me and would add something to the conversation ante iii one hundred sixty two He had previously said ante ii four hundred fifty three as he was driven rapidly along in a post chaise Life has not many things better than this seventeen seventy eight Boswell wrote to Johnson My wife is so different from you and me that she dislikes travelling Ante iii two hundred nineteen Later on in the year Boswell records doctor Johnson expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of China I catched it for the moment and said I really believed I should go and see the wall of China had I not children of whom it was my duty to take care Sir said he by doing so you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence There would be a lustre reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China I am serious Sir Ante iii two hundred sixty nine seventeen eighty In August he wrote to Boswell I know not whether I shall get a ramble this summer I hope you and I may yet shew ourselves on some part of Europe Asia or Africa Ante iii four hundred thirty five In the same year Johnson wrote to missus Thrale I hope you have no design of stealing away to Italy before the election nor of leaving me behind you though I am not only seventy but seventy one Piozzi Letters ii one hundred seventy seven On Oct seventeen he wrote The summer has been foolishly lost like many other of my summers and winters I hardly saw a green field but staid in town to work without working much Ante iii four hundred forty one seventeen eighty four Johnson s wish to go to Italy in the last year of his life was caused by the hope that it might be good for his health I do not he wrote travel for pleasure or curiosity yet if I should recover he added curiosity would revive Post iv three hundred forty eight missus Piozzi without however giving the year records doctor Johnson was very angry with a gentleman at our house for not being better company and urged that he had travelled into Bohemia and seen Prague Surely added he the man who has seen Prague might tell us something new and something strange and not sit silent for want of matter to put his lips in motion Piozzi s Journey ii three hundred seventeen All these passages shew what indeed is evident enough from the text that it was not travelling in general but travelling between the ages of nineteen and twenty four with a character unformed a memory unstored and a judgment untrained that Johnson attacked It was a common habit in his day to send young men of fortune to make the tour of Europe as it was called at an age when they would now be sent to either Oxford or Cambridge Lord Charlemont was but eighteen when he left England Locke at the end of his work on Education said in sixteen ninety two much the same as Johnson said in seventeen seventy eight The ordinary time of travel he wrote is from sixteen to one and twenty He would send any one either at a younger age than sixteen under a tutor or at an older age than twenty one without a tutor when he is of age to govern himself and make observations of what he finds in other countries worthy his notice and when too being thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fashions the natural and moral advantages and defects of his own country he has something to exchange with those abroad from whose conversation he hoped to reap any knowledge Goldsmith in his Present State of Polite Learning ch xiii wrote in seventeen fifty nine We see more of the world by travel but more of human nature by remaining at home A youth just landed at the Brille resembles a clown at a puppet show carries his amazement from one miracle to another from this cabinet of curiosities to that collection of pictures but wondering is not the way to grow wise The greatest advantages which result to youth from travel are an easy address the shaking off national prejudices and the finding nothing ridiculous in national peculiarities The time spent in these acquisitions could have been more usefully employed at home Gibbon Misc Works i one hundred ninety seven says that the previous and indispensable requisites of foreign travel are age judgment a competent knowledge of men and books and a freedom from domestic prejudices When he was only eighteen years old he saw the evils of early travelling I never liked young travellers they go too raw to make any great remarks and they lose a time which is in my opinion the most precious part of a man s life Ib p ninety eight Cowper in his Progress of Error ed seventeen eighty two i sixty describes how His stock a few French phrases got by heart With much to learn and nothing to impart The youth obedient to his sire s commands Sets off a wanderer into foreign lands Returning he proclaims by many a grace By shrugs and strange contortions of his face How much a dunce that has been sent to roam Excels a dunce that has been kept at home APPENDIX C ELECTION OF LORD MAYORS OF LONDON Page three hundred fifty

seventeen sixty five inclusive if there was in any year a contest yet in each case the senior Alderman nominated was chosen From seventeen sixty six to seventeen seventy five inclusive there was in every year a departure from the order of seniority In seventeen seventy six eight the order of seniority was again observed so that two years before Johnson made his remark the irregularity had come to an end This information I owe to the kindness of mister Scott the excellent Chamberlain of the City Sir George Champion had been passed over in the year seventeen thirty nine also In an address to the Liverymen he says that the disorders and great disturbance to the peace of the city which in former times had been occasioned by the over eagerness of some too ambitious and impatient to obtain this great honour had been quieted by the adoption of the order of seniority Gent Mag seventeen thirty nine p five hundred ninety five Among the Lord Mayors from seventeen sixty nine seventeen seventy

this struggle the Whigs and what are now called Radicals became two distinct sections of the Liberal party Townshend who in this followed the lead of Lord Shelburne headed the more moderate men against Wilkes The result was that in seventeen seventy one each section running a candidate for the Mayoralty a third man Nash who was opposed to both was returned Walpole s Memoirs of the Reign of

other place to go to their animosity does not force them to separate mister T And pray who is clerk of your kitchen Sir doctor J Why Sir I am afraid there is none a general anarchy prevails in my kitchen as I am told by mister Levett who says it is not now what it used to be missus T mister Levett I suppose Sir has the office of keeping the hospital in health for he is an apothecary doctor J Levett Madam is a brutal fellow but I have a good regard for him for his brutality is in his manners not his mind mister T But how do you get your dinners drest doctor J Why Desmoulins has the chief management of the kitchen but our roasting is not magnificent for we have no jack mister T No jack Why how do they manage without doctor J Small joints I believe they manage with a string and larger are done at the tavern I have some thoughts with a profound gravity of buying a jack because I think a jack is some credit to a house mister T Well but you ll have a spit too doctor J No Sir no that would be superfluous for we shall never use it and if a jack is seen a spit will be presumed missus T But pray Sir who is the Poll you talk of She that you used to abet in her quarrels with missus Williams and call out At her again Poll Never flinch Poll doctor J Why I took to Poll very well at first but she won t do upon a nearer examination missus T How came she among you Sir doctor J Why I don t rightly remember but we could spare her very well from us Poll is a stupid slut I had some hopes of her at first but when I talked to her tightly and closely I could make nothing of her she was wiggle waggle and I could never persuade her to be categorical Mme D Arblay s Diary i one hundred fourteen More than a year later Johnson wrote to missus Thrale Discord keeps her residence in this habitation but she has for some time been silent We have much malice but no mischief Levett is rather a friend to Williams because he hates Desmoulins more A thing that he should hate more than Desmoulins is not to be found Piozzi Letters ii eighty missus Piozzi Anec p two hundred thirteen says He really was oftentimes afraid of going home because he was so sure to be met at the door with numberless complaints and he used to lament pathetically to me that they made his life miserable from the impossibility he found of making theirs happy when every favour he bestowed on one was wormwood to the rest If however I ventured to blame their ingratitude and condemn their conduct he would instantly set about softening the one and justifying the other and finished commonly by telling me that I knew not how to make allowances for situations I never experienced Hawkins Life p four hundred four says Almost throughout Johnson s life poverty and distressed circumstances seemed to be the strongest of all recommendations to his favour When asked by one of his most intimate friends how he could bear to be surrounded by such necessitous and undeserving people as he had about him his answer was If I did not assist them no one else would and they must be lost for want His humanity and generosity in proportion to his slender income were writes Murphy Life p one hundred forty six

satires even on dead Kings were punishable Adieu veracity and history if the King s bench is to appreciate your expressions Memoirs of the Reign of George II iii one hundred fifty three forty seven What doctor Johnson has here said is undoubtedly good sense yet I am afraid that law though defined by Lord Coke the perfection of reason is not altogether with him for it is held in the books that an attack on the reputation even of a dead man may be punished as a libel because tending to a breach of the peace There is however I believe no modern decided case to that effect In the King s Bench Trinity Term seventeen ninety the question occurred on occasion of an indictment The King v Topham who as a proprietor of a news paper entitled The World was found guilty of a libel against Earl Cowper deceased because certain injurious charges against his Lordship were published in that paper An arrest of Judgment having been moved for the case was afterwards solemnly argued My friend mister Const whom I delight in having an opportunity to praise not only for his abilities but his manners a gentleman whose ancient German blood has been mellowed in England and who may be truely said to unite the Baron and the Barrister was one of the Counsel for mister Topham He displayed much learning and ingenuity upon the general question which however was not decided as the Court granted an arrest chiefly on the informality of the indictment No man has a higher reverence for the law of England than I have but with all deference I cannot help thinking that prosecution by indictment if a defendant is never to be allowed to justify must often be very oppressive unless Juries whom I am more and more confirmed in holding to be judges of law as well as of fact resolutely interpose Of late an act of Parliament has passed declaratory of their full right to one as well as the other in matter of libel and the bill having been brought in by a popular gentleman many of his party have in most extravagant terms declaimed on the wonderful acquisition to the liberty of the press For my own part I ever was clearly of opinion that this right was inherent in the very constitution of a Jury and indeed in sense and reason inseparable from their important function To establish it therefore by Statute is I think narrowing its foundation which is the broad and deep basis of Common Law Would it not rather weaken the right of primo geniture or any other old and universally acknowledged right should the legislature pass an act in favour of it In my Letter to the People of Scotland against diminishing the number of the Lords of Session published in seventeen eighty five there is the following passage which as a concise and I hope a fair and rational state of the matter I presume to quote The Juries of England are Judges of law as well as of fact in many civil and in all criminals trials That my principles of resistance may not be misapprehended and more than my principles of submission I protest that I should be the last man in the world to encourage Juries to contradict rashly wantonly or perversely the opinion of the Judges On the contrary I would have them listen respectfully to the advise they receive from the Bench by which they may be often well directed in forming their own opinion which and not anothers is the opinion they are to return upon their oaths But where after due attention to all that the judge has said they are decidedly of a different opinion from him they have not only a power and a right but they are bound in conscience to bring in a verdict accordingly BOWELL The World is described by Gifford in his Baviad and Marviad as a paper set up by a knot of fantastic coxcombs to direct the taste of the town Lowndes Bibl Man ed eighteen

be true in every material circumstance Shiels was the principal collector and digester of the materials for the work but as he was very raw in authourship an indifferent writer in prose and his language full of Scotticisms Cibber who was a clever lively fellow and then soliciting employment among the booksellers was engaged to correct the style and diction of the whole work then intended to make only four volumes with power to alter expunge or add as he liked He was also to supply notes occasionally especially concerning those dramatick poets with whom he had been chiefly conversant He also engaged to write several of the Lives which as we are told he accordingly performed He was farther useful in striking out the Jacobitical and Tory sentiments which Shiels had industriously interspersed wherever he could bring them in and as the success of the work appeared after all very doubtful he was content with twenty one pounds for his labour beside a few sets of the books to disperse among his friends Shiels had nearly seventy pounds beside the advantage of many of the best Lives in the work being communicated by friends to the undertaking and for which mister Shiels had the same consideration as for the rest being paid by the sheet for the whole He was however so angry with his Whiggish supervisor He like his father being a violent stickler for the political principles which prevailed in the Reign of George the Second for so unmercifully mutilating his copy and scouting his politicks that he wrote Cibber a challenge but was prevented from sending it by the publisher who fairly laughed him out of his fury The proprietors too were discontented in the end on account of mister Cibber s unexpected industry for his corrections and alterations in the proof sheets were so numerous and considerable that the printer made for them a grievous addition to his bill and in fine all parties were dissatisfied On the whole the work was productive of no profit to the undertakers who had agreed in case of success to make Cibber a present of some addition to the twenty guineas which he had received and for which his receipt is now in the booksellers hands We are farther assured that he actually obtained an additional sum when he soon after in the year seventeen fifty eight unfortunately embarked for Dublin on an engagement for one of the theatres there but the ship was cast away and every person on board perished There were about sixty passengers among whom was the Earl of Drogheda with many other persons of consequence and property Gent Mag seventeen fifty eight p five hundred fifty five As to the alledged design of making the compilement pass for the work of old mister Cibber the charges seem to have been founded on a somewhat uncharitable construction We are assured that the thought was not harboured by some of the proprietors who are still living and we hope that it did not occur to the first designer of the work who was also the printer of it and who bore a respectable character We have been induced to enter thus circumstantially into the foregoing detail of facts relating to The Lives of the Poets compiled by Messrs Cibber and Shiels from a sincere regard to that sacred principle of Truth to which doctor Johnson so rigidly adhered according to the best of his knowledge and which we believe no consideration would have prevailed on him to violate In regard to the matter which we now dismiss he had no doubt been misled by partial and wrong information Shiels was the Doctor s amanuensis he had quarrelled with Cibber it is natural to suppose that he told his story in his own way and it is certain that he was not a very sturdy moralist The quotation is from Johnson s Works ix one hundred sixteen This explanation appears to me very satisfactory It is however to be observed that the story told by Johnson does not rest solely upon my record of his conversation for he himself has published it in his Life of Hammond ib viii ninety where he says the manuscript of Shiels is now in my possession Very probably he had trusted to Shiels s word and never looked at it so as to compare it with The Lives of the Poets as published under mister Cibber s name What became of that manuscript I know not I should have liked much to examine it I suppose it was thrown into the fire in that impetuous combustion of papers which Johnson I think rashly executed when moribundus BOSWELL mister Croker quoting a letter by Griffiths the publisher says The question is now decided by this letter in opposition to doctor

Swinney and Cibber doctor Warton who had written on Pope found in one of the poet s female cousins a still more ignorant survivor He had been taught to believe that she could furnish him with valuable

who remember old stories will no doubt be surprised when I observe that John Wilkes here shews himself to be of the WARBURTONIAN SCHOOL It is nevertheless true as appears from doctor Hurd the Bishop of Worcester s very elegant commentary and notes on the Epistola ad Pisones It is necessary to a fair consideration of the question that the whole passage in which the words occur should be kept in view Si quid inexpertum scenae committis et audes Personam formare novam servetur ad imum Qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet Difficile est proprie communia dicere tuque Rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus Quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus Publica materies privati juris erit si Non circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus Interpres nee desilies imitator in artum Unde pedem proferre pudor vetat aut operis lex The Commentary thus illustrates it But the formation of quite new characters is a work of great difficulty and hazard For here there is no generally received and fixed archetype to work after but every one judges of common right according to the extent and comprehension of his own idea therefore he advises to labour and refit old characters and subjects particularly those made known and authorised by the practice of Homer and the Epick writers The Note is Difficile EST PROPRIE COMMUNIA DICERE Lambin s Comment is Communia hoc loco appellat Horatius argumenta fabularum a nullo adhuc tractata et ita quae cuivis exposita sunt et in medio quodammodo posita quasi vacua et a nemine occupata And that this is the true meaning of communia is evidently fixed by the words ignota indictaque which are explanatory of it so that the sense given it in the commentary is unquestionably the right one Yet notwithstanding the clearness of the case a late critick has this strange passage Difficile quidem esse proprie communia dicere hoc est materiam vulgarem notam et e medio petitam ita immutare atque exornare ut nova et scriptori propria videatur ultra concedimus et maximi procul dubio ponderis ista est observatio Sed omnibus utrinque collatis et tum difficilis tum venusti tam judicii quam ingenii ratione habita major videtur esse gloria fabulam formare penitus novam quam veterem utcunque mutatam de novo exhibere Poet Prael v ii p one hundred sixty four Where having first put a wrong construction on the word comnmnia he employs it to introduce an impertinent criticism For where does the poet prefer the glory of refitting old subjects to that of inventing new ones The contrary is implied in what he urges about the superiour difficulty of the latter from which he dissuades his countrymen only in respect of their abilities and inexperience in these matters and in order to cultivate in them which is the main view of the Epistle a spirit of correctness by sending them to the old subjects treated by the Greek writers For my own part with all deference for doctor Hurd who thinks the case clear I consider the passage Difficile est proprie communia dicere to be a crux for the criticks on Horace The explication which My Lord of Worcester treats with so much contempt is nevertheless countenanced by authority which I find quoted by the learned Baxter in his edition of Horace Difficile est proprie communia dicere h e res vulgares disertis verbis enarrare vel humile thema cum dignitate tractare Difficile est communes res propriis explicare verbis Vet Schol I was much disappointed to find that the great critick doctor Bentley has no note upon this very difficult passage as from his vigorous and illuminated mind I should have expected to receive more satisfaction than I have yet had Sanadon thus treats of it Proprie communia dicere c est a dire qu il n est pas aise de former a ces personnages d imagination des caracteres particuliers et cependant vraisemblables Comme l on a ete le maitre de les former tels qu on a voulu les fautes que l on fait en cela sont moins pardonnables C est pourquoi Horace conseille de prendre toujours des sujets connus tels que sont par exemple ceux que l on peut tirer des poemes d Homere And Dacier observes upon it Apres avoir marque les deux qualites qu il faut donner aux personnages qu on invente il conseille aux Poetes tragiques de n user pas trop facilement de cette liberte quils ont d en inventer car il est tres difficile de reussir dans ces nouveaux caracteres Il est mal aise dit Horace de traiter proprement c saint a dire convenablement des sujets communs c est a dire des sujets inventes et qui n ont aucun fondement ni dans l Histoire ni dans la Fable et il les appelle communs parce qu ils sont en disposition a tout le monde et que tout le monde a le droit de les inventer et qu ils sont comme on dit au premier occupant See his observations at large on this expression and the following After all I cannot help entertaining some doubt whether the words Difficile est proprie communia dicere may not have been thrown in by Horace to form a separate article in a choice of difficulties which a poet has to encounter who chooses a new subject in which case it must be uncertain which of the various explanations is the true one and every reader has a right to decide as it may strike his own fancy And even should the words be understood as they generally are to be connected both with what goes before and what comes after the exact sense cannot be absolutely ascertained for instance whether proprie is meant to signify in an appropriated manner as doctor Johnson here understands it or as it is often used by Cicero with propriety or elegantly In short it is a rare instance of a defect in perspicuity in an admirable writer who with almost every species of excellence is peculiarly remarkable for that quality The length of this note perhaps requires an apology Many of my readers I doubt not will admit that a critical discussion of a passage in a favourite classick is very engaging BOSWELL Boswell s French in this tedious note is left as he printed it two hundred twenty Johnson after describing Settle s attack on Dryden continues Works vii two hundred seventy seven Such are the revolutions of fame or such is

engraved upon doctor Goldsmith s monument without any alteration At another time when somebody endeavoured to argue in favour of its being in English Johnson said The language of the country of which a learned man was a native is not the language fit for his epitaph which should be in ancient and permanent language Consider Sir how you should feel were you to find at Rotterdam an epitaph upon Erasmus in Dutch For my own part I think it would be best to have Epitaphs written both in a learned language and in the language of the country so that they might have the advantage of being more universally understood and at the same time be secured of classical stability I cannot however but be of opinion that it is not sufficiently discriminative Applying to Goldsmith equally the epithets of Poetae Historici Physici is surely not right for as to his claim to the last of those epithets I have heard Johnson himself say Goldsmith Sir will give us a very fine book upon the subject but if he can distinguish a cow from a horse that I believe may be the extent of his knowledge of natural history His book is indeed an excellent performance though in some instances he appears to have trusted too much to Buffon who with all his theoretical ingenuity and extraordinary eloquence I suspect had little actual information in the science on which he wrote so admirably For instance he tells us that the cow sheds her horns every two years a most palpable errour which Goldsmith has faithfully transferred into his book It is wonderful that Buffon who lived so much in the country at his noble seat should have fallen into such a blunder I suppose he has confounded the cow with the deer BOSWELL Goldsmith says At three years old the cow sheds its horns and new ones arise in their

State Trials xx seventy nine and Lofft s Reports seventeen seventy two p one Lord Mansfield writes Lord Campbell Lives of the Chief Justices ii four hundred eighteen first established the grand doctrine that the air of England is too pure to be breathed by a slave According to Lord Campbell Mansfield s judgment thus ended The air of England has long been too pure for a slave and every man is free who breathes it Every man who comes into England is entitled to the protection of English law whatever oppression he may heretofore have suffered and whatever may be the colour of his skin Quamvis ille niger quamvis tu candidus esses Let the negro be discharged Where Lord Campbell found this speech that is to say if he did not put it together himself I cannot guess Mansfield s judgment was very brief He says in the conclusion The only question before us is whether the cause on the return to the writ of habeas corpus is sufficient If it is the negro must be remanded if it is not he must be discharged Accordingly the return states that the slave departed and refused to serve whereupon he was kept to be sold abroad So high an act of dominion must be recognised by the law of the country where it is used The power of a master over his slave has been extremely different in different countries The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons moral or political It is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law Whatever inconveniences therefore may follow from a decision I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England and therefore the black must be discharged Lofft s Reports seventeen seventy two p nineteen The judgment of the court says Broom Constitutional Law eighteen

the bookseller surviving partner of F Newbery and Carnan being a most impracticable man and at variance with all his brethren in the words of Malone to the Bishop he refused his assent and the project

rigorous scale The Common Council had presented a petition for mercy to the king Lord Mansfield who hated the popular party as much as he loved severity was not likely to be moved by such intercessors

that his Majesty might have an option of pardoning Hence it was seriously doubted whether a recorder s report need or indeed could be made at Windsor All his Majesty did on these occasions was to express verbally his assent or dissent to or from the execution of the sentence and though the King was on such occasions attended by his Ministers and the great legal Privy Councillors the business was not technically a council business but the individual act of the King On the accession of Queen Victoria the nature of some cases that it might be necessary to report to her Majesty occasioned the abrogation of a practice which was certainly so far unreasonable that it made a difference between London and all the rest of the kingdom CROKER I was exceedingly shocked said Lord Eldon the first time I attended to hear the Recorder s report at the careless manner in which as it appeared to me it was conducted We were called upon to decide on sentences affecting no less than the lives of men and yet there was nothing laid before us to enable us to judge whether there had or had not been any extenuating circumstances it was merely a recapitulation of the judge s opinion and the sentence I

idea one had imbibed by haranguing entirely in the French style and very eloquently and touchingly He apostrophised the lost sheep who sobbed and cried from their souls so did my Lady Hertford and Fanny Pelham till I believe the city dames took them both for Jane Shores The confessor then turned to the audience and addressed himself to his Royal Highness whom he called most illustrious prince

roughly and loud listens to no man s opinions thoroughly pertinacious of his own Good sense flows from him in all he utters and he seems possessed of a prodigious fund of knowledge which he is not at all reserved in communicating but in a manner so obstinate ungenteel and boorish as renders it disagreeable and dissatisfactory In short it is impossible for words to describe him He seems often inattentive to what passes in company and then looks like a person possessed by some superior spirit I have been reflecting on him ever since I saw him He is a man of most universal and surprising

example of diligence in his calling and as we have reason to believe has exercised his ministry with great fidelity and efficacy which in many instances has produced the most happy effect That he has been the first institutor or and a very earnest and active promoter of several modes of useful charity and that therefore he may be considered as having been on many occasions a benefactor to the publick That when they consider his past life they are willing to suppose his late crime to have been not the consequence of habitual depravity but the suggestion of some sudden and violent temptation

censure which has been carelessly uttered I carelessly joined But in justice to doctor Kippis who with that manly candid good temper which marks his character set me right I now with pleasure retract it and I desire it may be particularly observed as pointed out by him to me that The new lives of dissenting Divines in the first four volumes of the second edition of the Biographia Brittanica are those of John Abernethy Thomas Amory George Benson Hugh Broughton the learned Puritan Simon Browne Joseph Boyse of Dublin Thomas Cartwright the learned Puritan and Samuel Chandler The only doubt I have ever heard suggested is whether there should have been an article of doctor Amory But I was convinced and am still convinced that he was entitled to one from the reality of his learning and the excellent and candid nature of his practical writings The new lives of clergymen of the Church of England in the same four volumes are as follows John Balguy Edward Bentham George Berkley Bishop of Cloyne William Berriman Thomas Birch William Borlase Thomas Bott James Bradley Thomas Broughton John Brown John Burton Joseph Butler Bishop of Durham Thomas Carte Edmund Castell Edmund Chishull Charles Churchill William Clarke Robert Clayton Bishop of Clogher John Conybeare Bishop of Bristol George Costard and Samuel Croxall I am not conscious says doctor Kippis of any partiality in conducting the work I would not willingly insert a Dissenting Minister that does not justly deserve to be noticed or omit an established Clergyman that does At the same time I shall not be deterred from introducing Dissenters into the Biographia when I am satisfied that they are entitled to that distinction from their writings learning and merit Let me add that the expression A friend to the Constitution in Church and State was not meant by me as any reflection upon this reverend gentleman as if he were an enemy to the political constitution of his country as established at the revolution

writers both members of THE LITERARY CLUB when therefore doctor Johnson saw mister Burke in a situation so much more splendid than that to which he himself had attained he did not mean to express that he thought it a disproportionate prosperity but while he as a philosopher asserted an exemption from envy non equidem invideo he went on in the words of the poet miror magis thereby signifying either that he was occupied in admiring what he was glad to see or perhaps that considering the general lot of men of superiour abilities he wondered that Fortune who is represented as blind should in this
