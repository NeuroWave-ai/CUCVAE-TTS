PUPPYHOOD AND OTHER INTERESTING MATTERS The dog Crusoe was once a pup Now do not courteous reader toss your head contemptuously and exclaim Of course he was I could have told you that You know very well that you have often seen a man above six feet high broad and powerful as a lion with a bronzed shaggy visage and the stern glance of an eagle of whom you have said or thought or heard others say It is scarcely possible to believe that such a man was once a squalling baby If you had seen our hero in all the strength and majesty of full grown doghood you would have experienced a vague sort of surprise had we told you as we now repeat that the dog Crusoe was once a pup a soft round sprawling squeaking pup as fat as a tallow candle and as blind as a bat But we draw particular attention to the fact of Crusoe s having once been a pup because in connection with the days of his puppyhood there hangs a tale This peculiar dog may thus be said to have had two tails one in connection with his body the other with his career This tale though short is very harrowing and as it is intimately connected with Crusoe s subsequent history we will relate it here But before doing so we must beg our reader to accompany us beyond the civilised portions of the United States of America beyond the frontier settlements of the far west into those wild prairies which are watered by the great Missouri river the Father of Waters and his numerous tributaries Here dwell the Pawnees the Sioux the Delawares the Crows the Blackfeet and many other tribes of Red Indians who are gradually retreating step by step towards the Rocky Mountains as the advancing white man cuts down their trees and ploughs up their prairies Here too dwell the wild horse and the wild ass the deer the buffalo and the badger all men and brutes alike wild as the power of untamed and ungovernable passion can make them and free as the wind that sweeps over their mighty plains There is a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the banks of one of the tributaries above referred to a long stretch of mingled woodland and meadow with a magnificent lake lying like a gem in its green bosom which goes by the name of the Mustang Valley This remote vale even at the present day is but thinly peopled by white men and is still a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl curiously and from which the startled deer bounds terrified away At the period of which we write the valley had just been taken possession of by several families of squatters who tired of the turmoil and the squabbles of the then frontier settlements had pushed boldly into the far west to seek a new home for themselves where they could have elbow room regardless alike of the dangers they might encounter in unknown lands and of the Red skins who dwelt there The squatters were well armed with axes rifles and ammunition Most of the women were used to dangers and alarms and placed implicit reliance in the power of their fathers husbands and brothers to protect them and well they might for a bolder set of stalwart men than these backwoodsmen never trod the wilderness Each had been trained to the use of the rifle and the axe from infancy and many of them had spent so much of their lives in the woods that they were more than a match for the Indian in his own peculiar pursuits of hunting and war When the squatters first issued from the woods bordering the valley an immense herd of wild horses or mustangs were browsing on the plain These no sooner beheld the cavalcade of white men than uttering a wild neigh they tossed their flowing manes in the breeze and dashed away like a whirlwind This incident procured the valley its name The newcomers gave one satisfied glance at their future home and then set to work to erect log huts forthwith Soon the axe was heard ringing through the forests and tree after tree fell to the ground while the occasional sharp ring of a rifle told that the hunters were catering successfully for the camp In course of time the Mustang Valley began to assume the aspect of a thriving settlement with cottages and waving fields clustered together in the midst of it Of course the savages soon found it out and paid it occasional visits These dark skinned tenants of the woods brought furs of wild animals with them which they exchanged with the white men for knives and beads and baubles and trinkets of brass and tin But they hated the Pale faces with bitter hatred because their encroachments had at this time materially curtailed the extent of their hunting grounds and nothing but the numbers and known courage of the squatters prevented these savages from butchering and scalping them all The leader of this band of pioneers was a Major Hope a gentleman whose love for nature in its wildest aspects determined him to exchange barrack life for a life in the woods The major was a first rate shot a bold fearless man and an enthusiastic naturalist He was past the prime of life and being a bachelor was unencumbered with a family His first act on reaching the site of the new settlement was to commence the erection of a block house to which the people might retire in case of a general attack by the Indians In this block house Major Hope took up his abode as the guardian of the settlement and here the dog Crusoe was born here he sprawled in the early morn of life here he leaped and yelped and wagged his shaggy tail in the excessive glee of puppyhood and from the wooden portals of this block house he bounded forth to the chase in all the fire and strength and majesty of full grown doghood Crusoe s father and mother were magnificent Newfoundlanders There was no doubt as to their being of the genuine breed for Major Hope had received them as a parting gift from a brother officer who had brought them both from Newfoundland itself The father s name was Crusoe the mother s name was Fan Why the father had been so called no one could tell The man from whom Major Hope s friend had obtained the pair was a poor illiterate fisherman who had never heard of the celebrated Robinson in all his life All he knew was that Fan had been named after his own wife As for Crusoe he had got him from a friend who had got him from another friend whose cousin had received him as a marriage gift from a friend of his and that each had said to the other that the dog s name was Crusoe without reasons being asked or given on either side On arriving at New York the major s friend as we have said made him a present of the dogs Not being much of a dog fancier he soon tired of old Crusoe and gave him away to a gentleman who took him down to Florida and that was the end of him He was never heard of more When Crusoe junior was born he was born of course without a name That was given to him afterwards in honour of his father He was also born in company with a brother and two sisters all of whom drowned themselves accidentally in the first month of their existence by falling into the river which flowed past the block house a calamity which occurred doubtless in consequence of their having gone out without their mother s leave Little Crusoe was with his brother and sisters at the time and fell in along with them but was saved from sharing their fate by his mother who seeing what had happened dashed with an agonised howl into the water and seizing him in her mouth brought him ashore in a half drowned condition She afterwards brought the others ashore one by one but the poor little things were dead And now we come to the harrowing part of our tale for the proper understanding of which the foregoing dissertation was needful One beautiful afternoon in that charming season of the American year called the Indian summer there came a family of Sioux Indians to the Mustang Valley and pitched their tent close to the block house A young hunter stood leaning against the gate post of the palisades watching the movements of the Indians who having just finished a long palaver or talk with Major Hope were now in the act of preparing supper A fire had been kindled on the green sward in front of the tent and above it stood a tripod from which depended a large tin camp kettle Over this hung an ill favoured Indian woman or squaw who besides attending to the contents of the pot bestowed sundry cuffs and kicks upon her little child which sat near to her playing with several Indian curs that gambolled round the fire The master of the family and his two sons reclined on buffalo robes smoking their stone pipes or calumets in silence There was nothing peculiar in their appearance Their faces were neither dignified nor coarse in expression but wore an aspect of stupid apathy which formed a striking contrast to the countenance of the young hunter who seemed an amused spectator of their proceedings The youth referred to was very unlike in many respects to what we are accustomed to suppose a backwoods hunter should be He did not possess that quiet gravity and staid demeanour which often characterise these men True he was tall and strongly made but no one would have called him stalwart and his frame indicated grace and agility rather than strength But the point about him which rendered him different from his companions was his bounding irrepressible flow of spirits strangely coupled with an intense love of solitary wandering in the woods None seemed so well fitted for social enjoyment as he none laughed so heartily or expressed such glee in his mischief loving eye yet for days together he went off alone into the forest and wandered where his fancy led him as grave and silent as an Indian warrior After all there was nothing mysterious in this The boy followed implicitly the dictates of nature within him He was amiable straightforward sanguine and intensely earnest When he laughed he let it out as sailors have it with a will When there was good cause to be grave no power on earth could make him smile We have called him boy but in truth he was about that uncertain period of life when a youth is said to be neither a man nor a boy His face was good looking every earnest candid face is and masculine his hair was reddish brown and his eye bright blue He was costumed in the deerskin cap leggings moccasins and leathern shirt common to the western hunter You seem tickled wi the Injuns Dick Varley said a man who at that moment issued from the block house That s just what I am Joe Blunt replied the youth turning with a broad grin to his companion Have a care lad do not laugh at em too much They soon take offence an them Red skins never forgive But I m only laughing at the baby returned the youth pointing to the child which with a mixture of boldness and timidity was playing with a pup wrinkling up its fat visage into a smile when its playmate rushed away in sport and opening wide its jet black eyes in grave anxiety as the pup returned at full gallop It ud make an owl laugh continued young Varley to see such a queer pictur o itself He paused suddenly and a dark frown covered his face as he saw the Indian woman stoop quickly down catch the pup by its hind leg with one hand seize a heavy piece of wood with the other and strike it several violent blows on the throat Without taking the trouble to kill the poor animal outright the savage then held its still writhing body over the fire in order to singe off the hair before putting it into the pot to be cooked The cruel act drew young Varley s attention more closely to the pup and it flashed across his mind that this could be no other than young Crusoe which neither he nor his companion had before seen although they had often heard others speak of and describe it Had the little creature been one of the unfortunate Indian curs the two hunters would probably have turned from the sickening sight with disgust feeling that however much they might dislike such cruelty it would be of no use attempting to interfere with Indian usages But the instant the idea that it was Crusoe occurred to Varley he uttered a yell of anger and sprang towards the woman with a bound that caused the three Indians to leap to their feet and grasp their tomahawks Blunt did not move from the gate but threw forward his rifle with a careless motion but an expressive glance that caused the Indians to resume their seats and pipes with an emphatic Wah of disgust at having been startled out of their propriety by a trifle while Dick Varley snatched poor Crusoe from his dangerous and painful position scowled angrily in the woman s face and turning on his heel walked up to the house holding the pup tenderly in his arms Joe Blunt gazed after his friend with a grave solemn expression of countenance till he disappeared then he looked at the ground and shook his head Joe was one of the regular out and out backwoods hunters both in appearance and in fact broad tall massive lion like gifted with the hunting stalking running and trail following powers of the savage and with a superabundance of the shooting and fighting powers the daring and dash of the Anglo Saxon He was grave too seldom smiled and rarely laughed His expression almost at all times was a compound of seriousness and good humour With the rifle he was a good steady shot but by no means a crack one His ball never failed to hit but it often failed to kill After meditating a few seconds Joe Blunt again shook his head and muttered to himself The boy s bold enough but he s too reckless for a hunter There was no need for that yell now none at all Having uttered this sagacious remark he threw his rifle into the hollow of his left arm turned round and strode off with a long slow step towards his own cottage Blunt was an American by birth but of Irish extraction and to an attentive ear there was a faint echo of the brogue in his tone which seemed to have been handed down to him as a threadbare and almost worn out heirloom Poor Crusoe was singed almost naked His wretched tail seemed little better than a piece of wire filed off to a point and he vented his misery in piteous squeaks as the sympathetic Varley confided him tenderly to the care of his mother How Fan managed to cure him no one can tell but cure him she did for in the course of a few weeks Crusoe was as well and sleek and fat as ever CHAPTER TWO A SHOOTING MATCH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES NEW FRIENDS INTRODUCED TO THE READER CRUSOE AND HIS MOTHER CHANGE MASTERS Shortly after the incident narrated in the last chapter the squatters of the Mustang Valley lost their leader Major Hope suddenly announced his intention of quitting the settlement and returning to the civilised world Private matters he said required his presence there matters which he did not choose to speak of but which would prevent his returning again to reside among them Go he must and being a man of determination go he did but before going he distributed all his goods and chattels among the settlers He even gave away his rifle and Fan and Crusoe These last however he resolved should go together and as they were well worth having he announced that he would give them to the best shot in the valley He stipulated that the winner should escort him to the nearest settlement eastward after which he might return with the rifle on his shoulder Accordingly a long level piece of ground on the river s bank with a perpendicular cliff at the end of it was selected as the shooting ground and on the appointed day at the appointed hour the competitors began to assemble Well lad first as usual exclaimed Joe Blunt as he reached the ground and found Dick Varley there before him I ve bin here more than an hour lookin for a new kind o flower that Jack Morgan told me he d seen And I ve found it too Look here did you ever see one like it before Blunt leaned his rifle against a tree and carefully examined the flower Why yes I ve seed a many o them up about the Rocky Mountains but never one here away It seems to have gone lost itself The last I seed if I remimber rightly wos near the head waters o the Yellowstone River it wos jest where I shot a grizzly bar Was that the bar that gave you the wipe on the cheek asked Varley forgetting the flower in his interest about the bear It was I put six balls in that bar s carcase and stuck my knife into its heart ten times afore it gave out an it nearly ripped the shirt off my back afore I was done with it I would give my rifle to get a chance at a grizzly exclaimed Varley with a sudden burst of enthusiasm Whoever got it wouldn t have much to brag of remarked a burly young backwoodsman as he joined them His remark was true for poor Dick s weapon was but a sorry affair It missed fire and it hung fire and even when it did fire it remained a matter of doubt in its owner s mind whether the slight deviations from the direct line made by his bullets were the result of his or its bad shooting Further comment upon it was checked by the arrival of a dozen or more hunters on the scene of action They were a sturdy set of bronzed bold fearless men and one felt on looking at them that they would prove more than a match for several hundreds of Indians in open fight A few minutes after the major himself came on the ground with the prize rifle on his shoulder and Fan and Crusoe at his heels the latter tumbling scrambling and yelping after its mother fat and clumsy and happy as possible having evidently quite forgotten that it had been nearly roasted alive only a few weeks before Immediately all eyes were on the rifle and its merits were discussed with animation And well did it deserve discussion for such a piece had never before been seen on the western frontier It was shorter in the barrel and larger in the bore than the weapons chiefly in vogue at that time and besides being of beautiful workmanship was silver mounted But the grand peculiarity about it and that which afterwards rendered it the mystery of mysteries to the savages was that it had two sets of locks one percussion the other flint so that when caps failed by taking off the one set of locks and affixing the others it was converted into a flint rifle The major however took care never to run short of caps so that the flint locks were merely held as a reserve in case of need Now lads cried Major Hope stepping up to the point whence they were to shoot remember the terms He who first drives the nail obtains the rifle Fan and her pup and accompanies me to the nearest settlements Each man shoots with his own gun and draws lots for the chance Agreed cried the men Well then wipe your guns and draw lots Henri will fix the nail Here it is The individual who stepped or rather plunged forward to receive the nail was a rare and remarkable specimen of mankind Like his comrades he was half a farmer and half a hunter Like them too he was clad in deerskin and was tall and strong nay more he was gigantic But unlike them he was clumsy awkward loose jointed and a bad shot Nevertheless Henri was an immense favourite in the settlement for his good humour knew no bounds No one ever saw him frown Even when fighting with the savages as he was sometimes compelled to do in self defence he went at them with a sort of jovial rage that was almost laughable Inconsiderate recklessness was one of his chief characteristics so that his comrades were rather afraid of him on the war trail or in the hunt where caution and frequently soundless motion were essential to success or safety But when Henri had a comrade at his side to check him he was safe enough being humble minded and obedient Men used to say he must have been born under a lucky star for notwithstanding his natural inaptitude for all sorts of backwoods life he managed to scramble through everything with safety often with success and sometimes with credit To see Henri stalk a deer was worth a long day s journey Joe Blunt used to say he was all jints together from the top of his head to the sole of his moccasin He threw his immense form into the most inconceivable contortions and slowly wound his way sometimes on hands and knees sometimes flat through bush and brake as if there was not a bone in his body and without the slightest noise This sort of work was so much against his plunging nature that he took long to learn it but when through hard practice and the loss of many a fine deer he came at length to break himself in to it he gradually progressed to perfection and ultimately became the best stalker in the valley This and this alone enabled him to procure game for being short sighted he could hit nothing beyond fifty yards except a buffalo or a barn door Yet that same lithe body which seemed as though totally unhinged could no more be bent when the muscles were strung than an iron post No one wrestled with Henri unless he wished to have his back broken Few could equal and none could beat him at running or leaping except Dick Varley When Henri ran a race even Joe Blunt laughed outright for arms and legs went like independent flails When he leaped he hurled himself into space with a degree of violence that seemed to insure a somersault yet he always came down with a crash on his feet Plunging was Henri s forte He generally lounged about the settlement when unoccupied with his hands behind his back apparently in a reverie and when called on to act he seemed to fancy he must have lost time and could only make up for it by plunging This habit got him into many awkward scrapes but his herculean power as often got him out of them He was a French Canadian and a particularly bad speaker of the English language We offer no apology for this elaborate introduction of Henri for he was as good hearted a fellow as ever lived and deserves special notice But to return The sort of rifle practice called driving the nail by which this match was to be decided was and we believe still is common among the hunters of the far west It consisted in this an ordinary large headed nail was driven a short way into a plank or a tree and the hunters standing at a distance of fifty yards or so fired at it until they succeeded in driving it home On the present occasion the major resolved to test their shooting by making the distance seventy yards Some of the older men shook their heads It s too far said one ye might as well try to snuff the nose o a mosquito Jim Scraggs is the only man as ll hit that said another The man referred to was a long lank lantern jawed fellow with a cross grained expression of countenance He used the long heavy Kentucky rifle which from the ball being little larger than a pea was called a pea rifle Jim was no favourite and had been named Scraggs by his companions on account of his appearance In a few minutes the lots were drawn and the shooting began Each hunter wiped out the barrel of his piece with his ramrod as he stepped forward then placing a ball in the palm of his left hand he drew the stopper of his powder horn with his teeth and poured out as much powder as sufficed to cover the bullet This was the regular measure among them Little time was lost in firing for these men did not hang on their aim The point of the rifle was slowly raised to the object and the instant the sight covered it the ball sped to its mark In a few minutes the nail was encircled by bullet holes scarcely two of which were more than an inch distant from the mark and one fired by Joe Blunt entered the tree close beside it Ah Joe said the major I thought you would have carried off the prize So did not I sir returned Blunt with a shake of his head Had it a bin a half dollar at a hundred yards I d ha done better but I never could hit the nail It s too small to see That s cos ye ve got no eyes remarked Jim Scraggs with a sneer as he stepped forward All tongues were now hushed for the expected champion was about to fire The sharp crack of the rifle was followed by a shout for Jim had hit the nail head on the edge and part of the bullet stuck to it That wins if there s no better said the major scarce able to conceal his disappointment Who comes next To this question Henri answered by stepping up to the line straddling his legs and executing preliminary movements with his rifle that seemed to indicate an intention on his part to throw the weapon bodily at the mark He was received with a shout of mingled laughter and applause After gazing steadily at the mark for a few seconds a broad grin overspread his countenance and looking round at his companions he said Ha mes boys I cannot behold de nail at all Can ye behold the tree shouted a voice when the laugh that followed this announcement had somewhat abated Oh oui replied Henri quite coolly I can see him an a goot small bit of de forest beyond Fire at it then If ye hit the tree ye desarve the rifle leastwise ye ought to get the pup Henri grinned again and fired instantly without taking aim The shot was followed by an exclamation of surprise for the bullet was found close beside the nail It s more be good luck than good shootin remarked Jim Scraggs Possiblement answered Henri modestly as he retreated to the rear and wiped out his rifle mais I have kill most of my deer by dat same goot luck Bravo Henri said Major Hope as he passed you deserve to win anyhow Who s next Dick Varley cried several voices where s Varley Come on youngster an take yer shot The youth came forward with evident reluctance It s of no manner o use he whispered to Joe Blunt as he passed I can t depend on my old gun Never give in whispered Blunt encouragingly Poor Varley s want of confidence in his rifle was merited for on pulling the trigger the faithless lock missed fire Lend him another gun cried several voices Gainst rules laid down by Major Hope said Scraggs Well so it is try again Varley did try again and so successfully too that the ball hit the nail on the head leaving a portion of the lead sticking to its edge Of course this was greeted with a cheer and a loud dispute began as to which was the better shot of the two There are others to shoot yet cried the major Make way Look out The men fell back and the few hunters who had not yet fired took their shots but without coming nearer the mark It was now agreed that Jim Scraggs and Dick Varley being the two best shots should try over again and it was also agreed that Dick should have the use of Blunt s rifle Lots were again drawn for the first shot and it fell to Dick who immediately stepped out aimed somewhat hastily and fired Hit again shouted those who had run forward to examine the mark Half the bullet cut off by the nail head Some of the more enthusiastic of Dick s friends cheered lustily but the most of the hunters were grave and silent for they knew Jim s powers and felt that he would certainly do his best Jim now stepped up to the line and looking earnestly at the mark threw forward his rifle At that moment our friend Crusoe tired of tormenting his mother waddled stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of men and in so doing received Henri s heel and the full weight of his elephantine body on its fore paw The horrible and electric yell that instantly issued from his agonised throat could only be compared as Joe Blunt expressed it to the last dyin screech o a bustin steam biler We cannot say that the effect was startling for these backwoodsmen had been born and bred in the midst of alarms and were so used to them that a bustin steam biler itself unless it had blown them fairly off their legs would not have startled them But the effect such as it was was sufficient to disconcert the aim of Jim Scraggs who fired at the same instant and missed the nail by a hair s breadth Turning round in towering wrath Scraggs aimed a kick at the poor pup which had it taken effect would certainly have terminated the innocent existence of that remarkable dog on the spot but quick as lightning Henri interposed the butt of his rifle and Jim s shin met it with a violence that caused him to howl with rage and pain Oh pardon me broder cried Henri shrinking back with the drollest expression of mingled pity and glee Jim s discretion on this occasion was superior to his valour he turned away with a coarse expression of anger and left the ground Meanwhile the major handed the silver rifle to young Varley It couldn t have fallen into better hands he said You ll do it credit lad I know that full well and let me assure you it will never play you false Only keep it clean don t overcharge it aim true and it will never miss the mark While the hunters crowded round Dick to congratulate him and examine the piece he stood with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at his unexpected good fortune Recovering himself suddenly he seized his old rifle and dropping quietly to the outskirts of the crowd while the men were still busy handling and discussing the merits of the prize went up unobserved to a boy of about thirteen years of age and touched him on the shoulder Here Marston you know I often said ye should have the old rifle when I was rich enough to get a new one Take it now lad It s come to ye sooner than either o us expected Dick said the boy grasping his friend s hand warmly yer true as heart of oak It s good of ee that s a fact Not a bit boy it costs me nothin to give away an old gun that I ve no use for an s worth little but it makes me right glad to have the chance to do it Marston had longed for a rifle ever since he could walk but his prospects of obtaining one were very poor indeed at that time and it is a question whether he did not at that moment experience as much joy in handling the old piece as his friend felt in shouldering the prize A difficulty now occurred which had not before been thought of This was no less than the absolute refusal of Dick Varley s canine property to follow him Fan had no idea of changing masters without her consent being asked or her inclination being consulted You ll have to tie her up for a while I fear said the major No fear answered the youth Dog natur s like human natur Saying this he seized Crusoe by the neck stuffed him comfortably into the bosom of his hunting shirt and walked rapidly away with the prize rifle on his shoulder Fan had not bargained for this She stood irresolute gazing now to the right and now to the left as the major retired in one direction and Dick with Crusoe in another Suddenly Crusoe who although comfortable in body was ill at ease in spirit gave utterance to a melancholy howl The mother s love instantly prevailed For one moment she pricked up her ears at the sound and then lowering them trotted quietly after her new master and followed him to his cottage on the margin of the lake CHAPTER THREE SPECULATIVE REMARKS WITH WHICH THE READER MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE AN OLD WOMAN HOPES AND WISHES COMMINGLED WITH HARD FACTS THE DOG CRUSOE S EDUCATION BEGUN It is pleasant to look upon a serene quiet humble face On such a face did Richard Varley look every night when he entered his mother s cottage missus Varley was a widow and she had followed the fortunes of her brother Daniel Hood ever since the death of her husband Love for her only brother induced her to forsake the peaceful village of Maryland and enter upon the wild life of a backwoods settlement Dick s mother was thin and old and wrinkled but her face was stamped with a species of beauty which never fades the beauty of a loving look Ah the brow of snow and the peach bloom cheek may snare the heart of man for a time but the loving look alone can forge that adamantine chain that time age eternity shall never break Mistake us not reader and bear with us if we attempt to analyse this look which characterised missus Varley A rare diamond is worth stopping to glance at even when one is in a hurry The brightest jewel in the human heart is worth a thought or two By a loving look we do not mean a look of love bestowed on a beloved object That is common enough and thankful should we be that it is so common in a world that s over full of hatred Still less do we mean that smile and look of intense affection with which some people good people too greet friends and foe alike and by which effort to work out their beau ideal of the expression of Christian love they do signally damage their cause by saddening the serious and repelling the gay Much less do we mean that perpetual smile of good will which argues more of personal comfort and self love than anything else No the loving look we speak of is as often grave as gay Its character depends very much on the face through which it beams And it cannot be counterfeited Its ring defies imitation Like the clouded sun of April it can pierce through tears of sorrow like the noontide sun of summer it can blaze in warm smiles like the northern lights of winter it can gleam in depths of woe but it is always the same modified doubtless and rendered more or less patent to others according to the natural amiability of him or her who bestows it No one can put it on Still less can any one put it off Its range is universal it embraces all mankind though of course it is intensified on a few favoured objects its seat is in the depths of a renewed heart and its foundation lies in love to God Young Varley s mother lived in a cottage which was of the smallest possible dimensions consistent with comfort It was made of logs as indeed were all the other cottages in the valley The door was in the centre and a passage from it to the back of the dwelling divided it into two rooms One of these was subdivided by a thin partition the inner room being missus Varley s bedroom the outer Dick s Daniel Hood s dormitory was a corner of the kitchen which apartment served also as a parlour The rooms were lighted by two windows one on each side of the door which gave to the house the appearance of having a nose and two eyes Houses of this kind have literally got a sort of expression on if we may use the word their countenances Square windows give the appearance of easy going placidity longish ones that of surprise missus Varley s was a surprised cottage and this was in keeping with the scene in which it stood for the clear lake in front studded with islands and the distant hills beyond composed a scene so surprisingly beautiful that it never failed to call forth an expression of astonished admiration from every new visitor to the Mustang Valley My boy exclaimed missus Varley as her son entered the cottage with a bound why so hurried to day Deary me where got you the grand gun Won it mother Won it my son Ay won it mother Druve the nail almost and would ha druve it altogether had I bin more used to Joe Blunt s rifle missus Varley s heart beat high and her face flushed with pride as she gazed at her son who laid the rifle on the table for her inspection while he rattled off an animated and somewhat disjointed account of the match Deary me now that was good that was cliver But what s that scraping at the door Oh that s Fan I forgot her Here here Fan Come in good dog he cried rising and opening the door Fan entered and stopped short evidently uncomfortable My boy what do ye with the major s dog Won her too mother Won her my son Ay won her and the pup too see here it is and he plucked Crusoe from his bosom Crusoe having found his position to be one of great comfort had fallen into a profound slumber and on being thus unceremoniously awakened he gave forth a yelp of discontent that brought Fan in a state of frantic sympathy to his side There you are Fan take it to a corner and make yourself at home Ay that s right mother give her somethin to eat she s hungry I know by the look o her eye Deary me Dick said missus Varley who now proceeded to spread the youth s mid day meal before him did ye drive the nail three times No only once and that not parfetly Brought em all down at one shot rifle Fan an pup Well well now that was cliver but Here the old woman paused and looked grave But what mother You ll be wantin to go off to the mountains now I fear me boy Wantin now exclaimed the youth earnestly I m always wantin I ve bin wantin ever since I could walk but I won t go till you let me mother that I won t And he struck the table with his fist so forcibly that the platters rung again You re a good boy Dick but you re too young yit to ventur among the Red skins An yit if I don t ventur young I d better not ventur at all You know mother dear I don t want to leave you but I was born to be a hunter and everybody in them parts is a hunter and I can t hunt in the kitchen you know mother At this point the conversation was interrupted by a sound that caused young Varley to spring up and seize his rifle and Fan to show her teeth and growl Hist mother that s like horses hoofs he whispered opening the door and gazing intently in the direction whence the sound came Louder and louder it came until an opening in the forest showed the advancing cavalcade to be a party of white men In another moment they were in full view a band of about thirty horsemen clad in the leathern costume and armed with the long rifle of the far west Some wore portions of the gaudy Indian dress which gave to them a brilliant dashing look They came on straight for the block house and saluted the Varleys with a jovial cheer as they swept past at full speed Dick returned the cheer with compound interest and calling out They re trappers mother I ll be back in an hour bounded off like a deer through the woods taking a short cut in order to reach the block house before them He succeeded for just as he arrived at the house the cavalcade wheeled round the bend in the river dashed up the slope and came to a sudden halt on the green Vaulting from their foaming steeds they tied them to the stockades of the little fortress which they entered in a body Hot haste was in every motion of these men They were trappers they said on their way to the Rocky Mountains to hunt and trade furs But one of their number had been treacherously murdered and scalped by a Pawnee chief and they resolved to revenge his death by an attack on one of the Pawnee villages They would teach these red reptiles to respect white men they would come of it what might and they had turned aside here to procure an additional supply of powder and lead In vain did the major endeavour to dissuade these reckless men from their purpose They scoffed at the idea of returning good for evil and insisted on being supplied The log hut was a store as well as a place of defence and as they offered to pay for it there was no refusing their request at least so the major thought The ammunition was therefore given to them and in half an hour they were away again at full gallop over the plains on their mission of vengeance Vengeance is Mine I will repay saith the Lord But these men knew not what God said because they never read His Word and did not own His sway Young Varley s enthusiasm was considerably damped when he learned the errand on which the trappers were bent From that time forward he gave up all desire to visit the mountains in company with such men but he still retained an intense longing to roam at large among their rocky fastnesses and gallop out upon the wide prairies Meanwhile he dutifully tended his mother s cattle and sheep and contented himself with an occasional deer hunt in the neighbouring forests He devoted himself also to the training of his dog Crusoe an operation which at first cost him many a deep sigh Every one has heard of the sagacity and almost reasoning capabilities of the Newfoundland dog Indeed some have even gone the length of saying that what is called instinct in these animals is neither more nor less than reason And in truth many of the noble heroic and sagacious deeds that have actually been performed by Newfoundland dogs incline us almost to believe that like man they are gifted with reasoning powers But every one does not know the trouble and patience that is required in order to get a juvenile dog to understand what its master means when he is endeavouring to instruct it Crusoe s first lesson was an interesting but not a very successful one We may remark here that Dick Varley had presented Fan to his mother to be her watch dog resolving to devote all his powers to the training of the pup We may also remark in reference to Crusoe s appearance and we did not remark it sooner chiefly because up to this period in his eventful history he was little better than a ball of fat and hair that his coat was mingled jet black and pure white and remarkably glossy curly and thick A week after the shooting match Crusoe s education began Having fed him for that period with his own hand in order to gain his affection Dick took him out one sunny forenoon to the margin of the lake to give him his first lesson And here again we must pause to remark that although a dog s heart is generally gained in the first instance through his mouth yet after it is thoroughly gained his affection is noble and disinterested He can scarcely be driven from his master s side by blows and even when thus harshly repelled is always ready on the shortest notice and with the slightest encouragement to make it up again Well Dick Varley began by calling out Crusoe Crusoe come here pup Of course Crusoe knew his name by this time for it had been so often used as a prelude to his meals that he naturally expected a feed whenever he heard it This portal to his brain had already been open for some days but all the other doors were fast locked and it required a great deal of careful picking to open them Now Crusoe come here Crusoe bounded clumsily to his master s side cocked his ears and wagged his tail so far his education was perfect We say he bounded clumsily for it must be remembered that he was still a very young pup with soft flabby muscles Now I m goin to begin yer edication pup think o that Whether Crusoe thought of that or not we cannot say but he looked up in his master s face as he spoke cocked his ears very high and turned his head slowly to one side until it could not turn any further in that direction then he turned it as much to the other side whereat his master burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter and Crusoe immediately began barking vociferously Come come said Dick suddenly checking his mirth we mustn t play pup we must work Drawing a leathern mitten from his belt the youth held it to Crusoe s nose and then threw it a yard away at the same time exclaiming in a loud distinct tone Fetch it Crusoe entered at once into the spirit of this part of his training he dashed gleefully at the mitten and proceeded to worry it with intense gratification As for Fetch it he neither understood the words nor cared a straw about them Dick Varley rose immediately and rescuing the mitten resumed his seat on a rock Come here Crusoe he repeated Oh certainly by all means said Crusoe no he didn t exactly say it but really he looked these words so evidently that we think it right to let them stand as they are written If he could have finished the sentence he would certainly have said Go on with that game over again old boy it s quite to my taste the jolliest thing in life I assure you At least if we may not positively assert that he would have said that no one else can absolutely affirm that he wouldn t Well Dick Varley did do it over again and Crusoe worried the mitten over again utterly regardless of Fetch it Then they did it again and again and again but without the slightest apparent advancement in the path of canine knowledge and then they went home During all this trying operation Dick Varley never once betrayed the slightest feeling of irritability or impatience He did not expect success at first he was not therefore disappointed at failure Next day he had him out again and the next and the next and the next again with the like unfavourable result In short it seemed at last as if Crusoe s mind had been deeply imbued with the idea that he had been born expressly for the purpose of worrying that mitten and he meant to fulfil his destiny to the letter Young Varley had taken several small pieces of meat in his pocket each day with the intention of rewarding Crusoe when he should at length be prevailed on to fetch the mitten but as Crusoe was not aware of the treat that awaited him of course the mitten never was fetched At last Dick Varley saw that this system would never do so he changed his tactics and the next morning gave Crusoe no breakfast but took him out at the usual hour to go through his lesson This new course of conduct seemed to perplex Crusoe not a little for on his way down to the beach he paused frequently and looked back at the cottage and then expressively up at his master s face But the master was inexorable he went on and Crusoe followed for true love had now taken possession of the pup s young heart and he preferred his master s company to food Varley now began by letting the learner smell a piece of meat which he eagerly sought to devour but was prevented to his immense disgust Then the mitten was thrown as heretofore and Crusoe made a few steps towards it but being in no mood for play he turned back Fetch it said the teacher I won t replied the learner mutely by means of that expressive sign not doing it Hereupon Dick Varley rose took up the mitten and put it into the pup s mouth Then retiring a couple of yards he held out the piece of meat and said Fetch it Crusoe instantly spat out the glove and bounded towards the meat once more to be disappointed This was done a second time and Crusoe came forward with the mitten in his mouth It seemed as if it had been done accidentally for he dropped it before coming quite up If so it was a fortunate accident for it served as the tiny fulcrum on which to place the point of that mighty lever which was destined ere long to raise him to the pinnacle of canine erudition Dick Varley immediately lavished upon him the tenderest caresses and gave him a lump of meat But he quickly tried it again lest he should lose the lesson The dog evidently felt that if he did not fetch that mitten he should have no meat or caresses In order however to make sure that there was no mistake Dick laid the mitten down beside the pup instead of putting it into his mouth and retiring a few paces cried Fetch it Crusoe looked uncertain for a moment then he picked up the mitten and laid it at his master s feet The lesson was learned at last Dick Varley tumbled all the meat out of his pocket on the ground and while Crusoe made a hearty breakfast he sat down on a rock and whistled with glee at having fairly picked the lock and opened another door into one of the many chambers of his dog s intellect CHAPTER FOUR OUR HERO ENLARGED UPON GRUMPS Two years passed away the Mustang Valley settlement advanced prosperously despite one or two attacks made upon it by the savages who were however firmly repelled Dick Varley had now become a man and his pup Crusoe had become a full grown dog The silver rifle as Dick s weapon had come to be named was well known among the hunters and the Red skins of the border lands and in Dick s hands its bullets were as deadly as its owner s eye was quick and true Crusoe s education too had been completed Faithfully and patiently had his young master trained his mind until he fitted him to be a meet companion in the hunt To carry and fetch were now but trifling portions of the dog s accomplishments He could dive a fathom deep in the lake and bring up any article that might have been dropped or thrown in His swimming powers were marvellous and so powerful were his muscles that he seemed to spurn the water while passing through it with his broad chest high out of the curling wave at a speed that neither man nor beast could keep up with for a moment His intellect now was sharp and quick as a needle he never required a second bidding When Dick went out hunting he used frequently to drop a mitten or a powder horn unknown to the dog and after walking miles away from it would stop short and look down into the mild gentle face of his companion Crusoe he said in the same quiet tones with which he would have addressed a human friend I ve dropped my mitten go fetch it pup Dick continued to call it pup from habit One glance of intelligence passed from Crusoe s eye and in a moment he was away at full gallop nor did he rest until the lost article was lying at his master s feet Dick was loath to try how far back on his track Crusoe would run if desired He had often gone back five and six miles at a stretch but his powers did not stop here He could carry articles back to the spot from which they had been taken and leave them there He could head the game that his master was pursuing and turn it back and he would guard any object he was desired to watch with unflinching constancy But it would occupy too much space and time to enumerate all Crusoe s qualities and powers His biography will unfold them In personal appearance he was majestic having grown to an immense size even for a Newfoundland Had his visage been at all wolfish in character his aspect would have been terrible But he possessed in an eminent degree that mild humble expression of face peculiar to his race When roused or excited and especially when bounding through the forest with the chase in view he was absolutely magnificent At other times his gait was slow and he seemed to prefer a quiet walk with Dick Varley to anything else under the sun But when Dick was inclined to be boisterous Crusoe s tail and ears rose at a moment s notice and he was ready for anything Moreover he obeyed commands instantly and implicitly In this respect he put to shame most of the boys of the settlement who were by no means famed for their habits of prompt obedience Crusoe s eye was constantly watching the face of his master When Dick said Go he went when he said Come he came If he had been in the midst of an excited bound at the throat of a stag and Dick had called out Down Crusoe he would have sunk to the earth like a stone No doubt it took many months of training to bring the dog to this state of perfection but Dick accomplished it by patience perseverance and love Besides all this Crusoe could speak He spoke by means of the dog s dumb alphabet in a way that defies description He conversed so to speak with his extremities his head and his tail But his eyes his soft brown eyes were the chief medium of communication If ever the language of the eyes was carried to perfection it was exhibited in the person of Crusoe But indeed it would be difficult to say which part of his expressive face expressed most The cocked ears of expectation the drooped ears of sorrow the bright full eye of joy the half closed eye of contentment and the frowning eye of indignation accompanied with a slight a very slight pucker of the nose and a gleam of dazzling ivory ha no enemy ever saw this last piece of canine language without a full appreciation of what it meant Then as to the tail the modulations of meaning in the varied wag of that expressive member Oh it s useless to attempt description Mortal man cannot conceive of the delicate shades of sentiment expressible by a dog s tail unless he has studied the subject the wag the waggle the cock the droop the slope the wriggle Away with description it is impotent and valueless here As we have said Crusoe was meek and mild He had been bitten on the sly by half the ill natured curs in the settlement and had only shown his teeth in return He had no enmities though several enemies and he had a thousand friends particularly among the ranks of the weak and the persecuted whom he always protected and avenged when opportunity offered A single instance of this kind will serve to show his character One day Dick and Crusoe were sitting on a rock beside the lake the same identical rock near which when a pup the latter had received his first lesson They were conversing as usual for Dick had elicited such a fund of intelligence from the dog s mind and had injected such wealth of wisdom into it that he felt convinced it understood every word he said This is capital weather Crusoe ain t it pup Crusoe made a motion with his head which was quite as significant as a nod Ha my pup I wish that you and I might go and have a slap at the grizzly bars and a look at the Rocky Mountains Wouldn t it be nuts pup Crusoe looked dubious What you don t agree with me Now tell me pup wouldn t ye like to grip a bar Still Crusoe looked dubious but made a gentle motion with his tail as though he would have said I ve seen neither Rocky Mountains nor grizzly bars and know nothin about em but I m open to conviction You re a brave pup rejoined Dick stroking the dog s huge head affectionately I wouldn t give you for ten times your weight in golden dollars if there be sich things Crusoe made no reply whatever to this He regarded it as a truism unworthy of notice he evidently felt that a comparison between love and dollars was preposterous At this point in the conversation a little dog with a lame leg hobbled to the edge of the rocks in front of the spot where Dick was seated and looked down into the water which was deep there Whether it did so for the purpose of admiring its very plain visage in the liquid mirror or finding out what was going on among the fish we cannot say as it never told us but at that moment a big clumsy savage looking dog rushed out from the neighbouring thicket and began to worry it Punish him Crusoe said Dick quickly Crusoe made one bound that a lion might have been proud of and seizing the aggressor by the back lifted him off his legs and held him howling in the air at the same time casting a look towards his master for further instructions Pitch him in said Dick making a sign with his hand Crusoe turned and quietly dropped the dog into the lake Having regarded his struggles there for a few moments with grave severity of countenance he walked slowly back and sat down beside his master The little dog made good its retreat as fast as three legs would carry it and the surly dog having swam ashore retired sulkily with his tail very much between his legs Little wonder then that Crusoe was beloved by great and small among the well disposed of the canine tribes of the Mustang Valley But Crusoe was not a mere machine When not actively engaged in Dick Varley s service he busied himself with private little matters of his own He undertook modest little excursions into the woods or along the margin of the lake sometimes alone but more frequently with a little friend whose whole heart and being seemed to be swallowed up in admiration of his big companion Whether Crusoe botanised or geologised on these excursions we will not venture to say Assuredly he seemed as though he did both for he poked his nose into every bush and tuft of moss and turned over the stones and dug holes in the ground and in short if he did not understand these sciences he behaved very much as if he did Certainly he knew as much about them as many of the human species do In these walks he never took the slightest notice of Grumps that was the little dog s name but Grumps made up for this by taking excessive notice of him When Crusoe stopped Grumps stopped and sat down to look at him When Crusoe trotted on Grumps trotted on too When Crusoe examined a bush Grumps sat down to watch him and when he dug a hole Grumps looked into it to see what was there Grumps never helped him his sole delight was in looking on They didn t converse much these two dogs To be in each other s company seemed to be happiness enough at least Grumps thought so There was one point at which Grumps stopped short however and ceased to follow his friend and that was when he rushed headlong into the lake and disported himself for an hour at a time in its cool waters Crusoe was both by nature and training a splendid water dog Grumps on the contrary held water in abhorrence so he sat on the shores of the lake disconsolate when his friend was bathing and waited till he came out The only time when Grumps was thoroughly nonplussed was when Dick Varley s whistle sounded faintly in the far distance Then Crusoe would prick up his ears and stretch out at full gallop clearing ditch and fence and brake with his strong elastic bound and leaving Grumps to patter after him as fast as his four inch legs would carry him Poor Grumps usually arrived at the village to find both dog and master gone and would betake himself to his own dwelling there to lie down and sleep and dream perchance of rambles and gambols with his gigantic friend CHAPTER FIVE A MISSION OF PEACE UNEXPECTED JOYS DICK AND CRUSOE SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE RED SKINS AND MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY AS A MATTER OF COURSE NIGHT IN THE WILD WOODS One day the inhabitants of Mustang Valley were thrown into considerable excitement by the arrival of an officer of the United States army and a small escort of cavalry They went direct to the block house which since Major Hope s departure had become the residence of Joe Blunt that worthy having by general consent been deemed the fittest man in the settlement to fill the major s place Soon it began to be noised abroad that the strangers had been sent by Government to endeavour to bring about if possible a more friendly state of feeling between the whites and the Indians by means of presents and promises and fair speeches The party remained all night in the block house and ere long it was reported that Joe Blunt had been requested and had consented to be the leader and chief of a party of three men who should visit the neighbouring tribes of Indians to the west and north of the valley as Government agents Joe s knowledge of two or three different Indian dialects and his well known sagacity rendered him a most fitting messenger on such an errand It was also whispered that Joe was to have the choosing of his comrades in this mission and many were the opinions expressed and guesses made as to who would be chosen That same evening Dick Varley was sitting in his mother s kitchen cleaning his rifle his mother was preparing supper and talking quietly about the obstinacy of a particular hen that had taken to laying her eggs in places where they could not be found Fan was coiled up in a corner sound asleep and Crusoe was sitting at one side of the fire looking on at things in general I wonder remarked missus Varley as she spread the table with a pure white napkin I wonder what the sodgers are doin wi Joe Blunt As often happens when an individual is mentioned the worthy referred to opened the door at that moment and stepped into the room Good e en t ye dame said the stout hunter doffing his cap and resting his rifle in a corner while Dick rose and placed a chair for him The same to you Master Blunt answered the widow you ve jist comed in good time for a cut o venison Thanks mistress I s pose we re beholden to the silver rifle for that To the hand that aimed it rather suggested the widow Nay then say raither to the dog that turned it said Dick Varley But for Crusoe that buck would ha bin couched in the woods this night Oh if it comes to that retorted Joe I d lay it to the door o Fan for if she d niver bin born nother would Crusoe But it s good an tender meat whativer ways ye got it Howsiver I ve other things to talk about jist now Them sodgers that are eatin buffalo tongues up at the block house as if they d niver ate meat before and didn t hope to eat agin for a twelve month Ay what o them interrupted missus Varley I ve bin wonderin what was their errand Of coorse ye wos Dame Varley and I ve comed here a purpis to tell ye They want me to go to the Red skins to make peace between them and us and they ve brought a lot o goods to make them presents withal beads an knives an lookin glasses an vermilion paint an sich like jist as much as ll be a light load for one horse for ye see nothin can be done wi the Red skins without gifts Tis a blessed mission said the widow I wish it may succeed D ye think ye ll go Go ay that will I I only wish they d made the offer to me said Dick with a sigh An so they do make the offer lad They ve gin me leave to choose the two men I m to take with me and I ve comed straight to ask you Ay or no for we must up an away by break o day to morrow missus Varley started So soon she said with a look of anxiety Ay the Pawnees are at the Yellow Creek jist at this time but I ve heer d they re bout to break up camp an away west so we ll need to use haste May I go mother asked Dick with a look of anxiety There was evidently a conflict in the widow s breast but it quickly ceased Yes my boy she said in her own low quiet voice an God go with ye I knew the time must come soon an I thank Him that your first visit to the Red skins will be on an errand o peace Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God Dick grasped his mother s hand and pressed it to his cheek in silence At the same moment Crusoe seeing that the deeper feelings of his master were touched and deeming it his duty to sympathise rose up and thrust his nose against him Ah pup cried the young man hastily you must go too Of course Crusoe goes Joe Blunt Hum I don t know that There s no dependin on a dog to keep his tongue quiet in times o danger Believe me exclaimed Dick flashing with enthusiasm Crusoe s more trustworthy than I am myself If ye can trust the master yer safe to trust the pup Well lad ye may be right We ll take him Thanks Joe And who else goes with us I ve bin castin that in my mind for some time an I ve fixed to take Henri He s not the safest man in the valley but he s the truest that s a fact And now younker get yer horse an rifle ready and come to the block house at daybreak to morrow Good luck to ye mistress till we meet agin Joe Blunt rose and taking up his rifle without which he scarcely ever moved a foot from his own door left the cottage with rapid strides My son said missus Varley kissing Dick s cheek as he resumed his seat put this in the little pocket I made for it in your hunting shirt She handed him a small pocket Bible Dear mother he said as he placed the book carefully within the breast of his coat the Red skin that takes that from me must take my scalp first But don t fear for me You ve often said the Lord would protect me So He will mother for sure it s an errand o peace Ay that s it that s it murmured the widow in a half soliloquy Dick Varley spent that night in converse with his mother and next morning at daybreak he was at the place of meeting mounted on his sturdy little horse with the silver rifle on his shoulder and Crusoe by his side That s right lad that s right Nothin like keepin yer time said Joe as he led out a pack horse from the gate of the block house while his own charger was held ready saddled by a man named Daniel Brand who had been appointed to the charge of the block house in his absence Where s Henri oh here he comes exclaimed Dick as the hunter referred to came thundering up the slope at a charge on a horse that resembled its rider in size and not a little in clumsiness of appearance Ah mes boy Him is a goot one to go cried Henri remarking Dick s smile as he pulled up No hoss on de plain can beat dis one surement Now then Henri lend a hand to fix this pack we ve no time to palaver By this time they were joined by several of the soldiers and a few hunters who had come to see them start Remember Joe cried one if you don t come back in three months we ll all come out in a band to seek you If we don t come back in less than that time what s left o us won t be worth seekin for said Joe tightening the girth of his saddle Put a bit in yer own mouth Henri cried another as the Canadian arranged his steed s bridle ye ll need it more than yer horse when ye git mong the red reptiles Vraiment if mon mout needs one bit yours will need one padlock Now lads mount cried Joe Blunt as he vaulted into the saddle Dick Varley sprang lightly on his horse and Henri made a rush at his steed and hurled his huge frame across its back with a violence that ought to have brought it to the ground but the tall raw boned broad chested roan was accustomed to the eccentricities of its master and stood the shock bravely Being appointed to lead the pack horse Henri seized its halter then the three cavaliers shook their reins and waving their hands to their comrades they sprang into the woods at full gallop and laid their course for the far west For some time they galloped side by side in silence each occupied with his own thoughts Crusoe keeping close beside his master s horse The two elder hunters evidently ruminated on the object of their mission and the prospects of success for their countenances were grave and their eyes cast on the ground Dick Varley too thought upon the Red men but his musings were deeply tinged with the bright hues of a first adventure The mountains the plains the Indians the bears the buffaloes and a thousand other objects danced wildly before his mind s eye and his blood careered through his veins and flushed his forehead as he thought of what he should see and do and felt the elastic vigour of youth respond in sympathy to the light spring of his active little steed He was a lover of nature too and his flashing eyes glanced observantly from side to side as they swept along sometimes through glades of forest trees sometimes through belts of more open ground and shrubbery anon by the margin of a stream or along the shores of a little lake and often over short stretches of flowering prairie land while the firm elastic turf sent up a muffled sound from the tramp of their mettlesome chargers It was a scene of wild luxuriant beauty that might almost one could fancy have drawn involuntary homage to its bountiful Creator from the lips even of an infidel After a time Joe Blunt reined up and they proceeded at an easy ambling pace Joe and his friend Henri were so used to these beautiful scenes that they had long ceased to be enthusiastically affected by them though they never ceased to delight in them I hope said Joe that them sodgers ll go their ways soon I ve no notion o them chaps when they re left at a place wi nothin to do but whittle sticks Why Joe exclaimed Dick Varley in a tone of surprise I thought you were admirin the beautiful face o nature all this time and yer only thinkin about the sodgers Now that s strange Not so strange after all lad answered Joe When a man s used to a thing he gits to admire an enjoy it without speakin much about it But it is true boy that mankind gits in coorse o time to think little o the blissins he s used to Oui c est vrai murmured Henri emphatically Well Joe Blunt it may be so but I m thankful I m not used to this sort o thing yet exclaimed Varley Let s have another gallop so ho come along Crusoe shouted the youth as he shook his reins and flew over a long stretch of prairie on which at that moment they entered Joe smiled as he followed his enthusiastic companion but after a short run he pulled up Hold on youngster he cried ye must larn to do as yer bid lad it s trouble enough to be among wild Injuns and wild buffaloes as I hope soon to be without havin wild comrades to look after Dick laughed and reined in his panting horse I ll be as obedient as Crusoe he said and no one can beat him Besides continued Joe the horses won t travel far if we begin by runnin all the wind out o them Wah exclaimed Henri as the led horse became restive I think we must give to him de pack hoss for to lead eh Not a bad notion Henri We ll make that the penalty of runnin off again so look out Master Dick I m down replied Dick with a modest air obedient as a baby and won t run off again till the next time By the way Joe how many days provisions did ye bring Two That s nough to carry us to the Great Prairie which is three weeks distant from this our own good rifles must make up the difference and keep us when we git there And s pose we neither find deer nor buffalo suggested Dick I s pose we ll have to starve Dat is cumfer able to tink upon remarked Henri More comfortable to think o than to undergo said Dick but I s pose there s little chance o that Well not much replied Joe Blunt patting his horse s neck but d ye see lad ye niver can count for sartin on anythin The deer and buffalo ought to be thick in them plains at this time and when the buffalo are thick they covers the plains till ye can hardly see the end o them but ye see sometimes the rascally Red skins takes it into their heads to burn the prairies and sometimes ye find the place that should ha bin black wi buffalo black as a coal wi fire for miles an miles on end At other times the Red skins go huntin in ticlar places and sweeps them clean o every hoof that don t git away Sometimes too the animals seems to take a scunner at a place and keeps out o the way But one way or another men gin rally manage to scramble through Look yonder Joe exclaimed Dick pointing to the summit of a distant ridge where a small black object was seen moving against the sky that s a deer ain t it Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed earnestly at the object in question Yer right boy and by good luck we ve got the wind of him Cut in an take your chance now There s a long strip o wood as ll let ye git close to him Before the sentence was well finished Dick and Crusoe were off at full gallop For a few hundred yards they coursed along the bottom of a hollow then turning to the right they entered the strip of wood and in a few minutes gained the edge of it Here Dick dismounted You can t help me here Crusoe Stay where you are pup and hold my horse Crusoe seized the end of the line which was fastened to the horse s nose in his mouth and lay down on a hillock of moss submissively placing his chin on his fore paws and watching his master as he stepped noiselessly through the wood In a few minutes Dick emerged from among the trees and creeping from bush to bush succeeded in getting to within six hundred yards of the deer which was a beautiful little antelope Beyond the bush behind which he now crouched all was bare open ground without a shrub or hillock large enough to conceal the hunter There was a slight undulation in the ground however which enabled him to advance about fifty yards further by means of lying down quite flat and working himself forward like a serpent Further than this he could not move without being seen by the antelope which browsed on the ridge before him in fancied security The distance was too great even for a long shot but Dick knew of a weak point in this little creature s nature which enabled him to accomplish his purpose a weak point which it shares in common with animals of a higher order namely curiosity The little antelope of the North American prairies is intensely curious about everything that it does not quite understand and will not rest satisfied until it has endeavoured to clear up the mystery Availing himself of this propensity Dick did what both Indians and hunters are accustomed to do on these occasions he put a piece of rag on the end of his ramrod and keeping his person concealed and perfectly still waved this miniature flag in the air The antelope noticed it at once and pricking up its ears began to advance timidly and slowly step by step to see what remarkable phenomenon it could be In a few seconds the flag was lowered a sharp crack followed and the antelope fell dead upon the plain Ha boy that s a good supper anyhow cried Joe as he galloped up and dismounted Goot dat is better nor dried meat added Henri Give him to me I will put him on my hoss vich is strongar dan yourn But ver is your hoss He ll be here in a minute replied Dick putting his fingers to his mouth and giving forth a shrill whistle The instant Crusoe heard the sound he made a savage and apparently uncalled for dash at the horse s heels This wild act so contrary to the dog s gentle nature was a mere piece of acting He knew that the horse would not advance without getting a fright so he gave him one in this way which sent him off at a gallop Crusoe followed close at his heels so as to bring the line alongside of the nag s body and thereby prevent its getting entangled but despite his best efforts the horse got on one side of a tree and he on the other so he wisely let go his hold of the line and waited till more open ground enabled him to catch it again Then he hung heavily back gradually checked the horse s speed and finally trotted him up to his master s side Tis a cliver cur good sooth exclaimed Joe Blunt in surprise Ah Joe you haven t seen much of Crusoe yet He s as good as a man any day I ve done little else but train him for two years gone by and he can do most anything but shoot he can t handle the rifle nohow Ha then I tink perhaps hims could if he wos try said Henri plunging on to his horse with a laugh and arranging the carcase of the antelope across the pommel of his saddle Thus they hunted and galloped and trotted and ambled on through wood and plain all day until the sun began to descend below the tree tops of the bluffs on the west then Joe Blunt looked about him for a place on which to camp and finally fixed on a spot under the shadow of a noble birch by the margin of a little stream The carpet of grass on its banks was soft like green velvet and the rippling waters of the brook were clear as crystal very different from the muddy Missouri into which it flowed While Dick Varley felled and cut up firewood Henri unpacked the horses and turned them loose to graze and Joe kindled the fire and prepared venison steaks and hot tea for supper In excursions of this kind it is customary to hobble the horses that is to tie their fore legs together so that they cannot run either fast or far but are free enough to amble about with a clumsy sort of hop in search of food This is deemed a sufficient check on their tendency to roam although some of the knowing horses sometimes learn to hop so fast with their hobbles as to give their owners much trouble to recapture them But when out in the prairies where Indians are known or supposed to be in the neighbourhood the horses are picketed by means of a pin or stake attached to the ends of their long laryats as well as hobbled for Indians deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lies though they think it disgraceful to be found out in doing either And so expert are these dark skinned natives of the western prairies that they will creep into the midst of an enemy s camp cut the laryats and hobbles of several horses spring suddenly on their backs and gallop away They not only steal from white men but tribes that are at enmity steal from each other and the boldness with which they do this is most remarkable When Indians are travelling in a country where enemies are prowling they guard their camps at night with jealous care The horses in particular are both hobbled and picketed and sentries are posted all round the camp Yet in spite of these precautions hostile Indians manage to elude the sentries and creep into the camp When a thief thus succeeds in effecting an entrance his chief danger is past He rises boldly to his feet and wrapping his blanket or buffalo robe round him he walks up and down as if he were a member of the tribe At the same time he dexterously cuts the laryats of such horses as he observes are not hobbled He dare not stoop to cut the hobbles as the action would be observed and suspicion would be instantly aroused He then leaps on the best horse he can find and uttering a terrific war whoop darts away into the plains driving the loosened horses before him No such dark thieves were supposed to be near the camp under the birch tree however so Joe and Dick and Henri ate their supper in comfort and let their horses browse at will on the rich pasturage A bright ruddy fire was soon kindled which created as it were a little ball of light in the midst of surrounding darkness for the special use of our hardy hunters Within this magic circle all was warm comfortable and cheery Outside all was dark and cold and dreary by contrast When the substantial part of supper was disposed of tea and pipes were introduced and conversation began to flow Then the three saddles were placed in a row each hunter wrapped himself in his blanket and pillowing his head on his saddle stretched his feet towards the fire and went to sleep with his loaded rifle by his side and his hunting knife handy in his belt Crusoe mounted guard by stretching himself out couchant at Dick Varley s side The faithful dog slept lightly and never moved all night but had any one observed him closely he would have seen that every fitful flame that burst from the sinking fire every unusual puff of wind and every motion of the horses that fed or rested hard by had the effect of revealing a speck of glittering white in Crusoe s watchful eye CHAPTER SIX THE GREAT PRAIRIES OF THE FAR WEST A REMARKABLE COLONY DISCOVERED AND A MISERABLE NIGHT ENDURED Of all the hours of the night or day the hour that succeeds the dawn is the purest the most joyous and the best At least so think we and so think hundreds and thousands of the human family and so thought Dick Varley as he sprung suddenly into a sitting posture next morning and threw his arms with an exulting feeling of delight round the neck of Crusoe who instantly sat up to greet him This was an unusual piece of enthusiasm on the part of Dick but the dog received it with marked satisfaction rubbed his big hairy cheek against that of his young master and arose from his sedentary position in order to afford free scope for the use of his tail Ho Joe Blunt Henri Up boys up The sun will have the start o us I ll catch the nags So saying Dick bounded away into the woods with Crusoe gambolling joyously at his heels Dick soon caught his own horse and Crusoe caught Joe s Then the former mounted and quickly brought in the other two Returning to the camp he found everything packed and ready to strap on the back of the pack horse That s the way to do it lad cried Joe Here Henri look alive and git yer beast ready I do believe yer goin to take another snooze Henri was indeed at that moment indulging in a gigantic stretch and a cavernous yawn but he finished both hastily and rushed at his poor horse as if he intended to slay it on the spot He only threw the saddle on its back however and then threw himself on the saddle Now then all ready Ay oui yis And away they went at full stretch again on their journey Thus day after day they travelled and night after night they laid them down to sleep under the trees of the forest until at length they reached the edge of the Great Prairie It was a great a memorable day in the life of Dick Varley that on which he first beheld the prairie the vast boundless prairie He had heard of it talked of it dreamed about it but he had never no he had never realised it Tis always thus Our conceptions of things that we have not seen are almost invariably wrong Dick s eyes glittered and his heart swelled and his cheeks flushed and his breath came thick and quick There it is he gasped as the great rolling plain broke suddenly on his enraptured gaze that s it oh Dick uttered a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest chief of the Pawnees and being unable to utter another word he swung his cap in the air and sprang like an arrow from a bow over the mighty ocean of grass The sun had just risen to send a flood of golden glory over the scene the horses were fresh so the elder hunters gladdened by the beauty of all around them and inspired by the irresistible enthusiasm of their young companion gave the reins to the horses and flew after him It was a glorious gallop that first headlong dash over the boundless prairie of the far west The prairies have often been compared most justly to the ocean There is the same wide circle of space bounded on all sides by the horizon there is the same swell or undulation or succession of long low unbroken waves that marks the ocean when it is calm they are canopied by the same pure sky and swept by the same untrammelled breezes There are islands too clumps of trees and willow bushes which rise out of this grassy ocean to break and relieve its uniformity and these vary in size and numbers as do the isles of ocean being numerous in some places while in others they are so scarce that the traveller does not meet one in a long day s journey Thousands of beautiful flowers decked the green sward and numbers of little birds hopped about among them Now lads said Joe Blunt reining up our troubles begin to day Our troubles our joys you mean exclaimed Dick Varley P raps I don t mean nothin o the sort retorted Joe Man wos never intended to swaller his joys without a strong mixtur o troubles I s pose he couldn t stand em pure Ye see we ve got to the prairie now One blind hoss might see dat interrupted Henri An we may or may not diskiver buffalo An water s scarce too so we ll need to look out for it pretty sharp I guess else we ll lose our horses in which case we may as well give out at once Besides there s rattlesnakes about in sandy places we ll ha to look out for them an there s badger holes we ll need to look sharp for them lest the horses put their feet in em an there s Injuns who ll look out pretty sharp for us if they once get wind that we re in them parts Oui yis mes boys and there s rain and tunder and lightin added Henri pointing to a dark cloud which was seen rising on the horizon ahead of them It ll be rain remarked Joe but there s no thunder in the air jist now we ll make for yonder clump o bushes and lay by till it s past Turning a little to the right of the course they had been following the hunters galloped along one of the hollows between the prairie waves before mentioned in the direction of a clump of willows Before reaching it however they passed over a bleak and barren plain where there was neither flower nor bird Here they were suddenly arrested by a most extraordinary sight at least it was so to Dick Varley who had never seen the like before This was a colony of what Joe called prairie dogs On first beholding them Crusoe uttered a sort of half growl half bark of surprise cocked his tail and ears and instantly prepared to charge but he glanced up at his master first for permission Observing that his finger and his look commanded silence he dropped his tail at once and stepped to the rear He did not however cease to regard the prairie dogs with intense curiosity These remarkable little creatures have been egregiously misnamed by the hunters of the west for they bear not the slightest resemblance to dogs either in formation or habits They are in fact the marmot and in size are little larger than squirrels which animals they resemble in some degree They burrow under the light soil and throw it up in mounds like moles Thousands of them were running about among their dwellings when Dick first beheld them but the moment they caught sight of the horsemen rising over the ridge they set up a tremendous hubbub of consternation each little beast instantly mounted guard on the top of his house and prepared as it were to receive cavalry The most ludicrous thing about them was that although the most timid and cowardly creatures in the world they seemed the most impertinent things that ever lived Knowing that their holes afforded them a perfectly safe retreat they sat close beside them and as the hunters slowly approached they elevated their heads wagged their little tails showed their teeth and chattered at them like monkeys The nearer they came the more angry and furious did the prairie dogs become until Dick Varley almost fell off his horse with suppressed laughter They let the hunters come close up waxing louder and louder in their wrath but the instant a hand was raised to throw a stone or point a gun a thousand little heads dived into a thousand holes and a thousand little tails wriggled for an instant in the air then a dead silence reigned over the deserted scene Bien them s have dive into de bo els of de eart said Henri with a broad grin Presently a thousand noses appeared and nervously disappeared like the wink of an eye Then they appeared again and a thousand pairs of eyes followed Instantly like Jack in the box they were all on the top of their hillocks again chattering and wagging their little tails as vigorously as ever You could not say that you saw them jump out of their holes Suddenly as if by magic they were out then Dick tossed up his arms and suddenly as if by magic they were gone Their number was incredible and their cities were full of riotous activity What their occupations were the hunters could not ascertain but it was perfectly evident that they visited a great deal and gossiped tremendously for they ran about from house to house and sat chatting in groups but it was also observed that they never went far from their own houses Each seemed to have a circle of acquaintance in the immediate neighbourhood of his own residence to which in case of sudden danger he always fled But another thing about these prairie dogs perhaps considering their size we should call them prairie doggies another thing about them we say was that each doggie lived with an owl or more correctly an owl lived with each doggie This is such an extraordinary fact that we could scarce hope that men would believe us were our statement not supported by dozens of trustworthy travellers who have visited and written about these regions The whole plain was covered with these owls Each hole seemed to be the residence of an owl and a doggie and these incongruous couples lived together apparently in perfect harmony We have not been able to ascertain from travellers why the owls have gone to live with these doggies so we beg humbly to offer our own private opinion to the reader We assume then that owls find it absolutely needful to have holes Probably prairie owls cannot dig holes for themselves Having discovered however a race of little creatures that could they very likely determined to take forcible possession of the holes made by them Finding no doubt that when they did so the doggies were too timid to object and discovering moreover that they were sweet innocent little creatures the owls resolved to take them into partnership and so the thing was settled that s how it came about no doubt of it There is a report that rattlesnakes live in these holes also but we cannot certify our reader of the truth of this still it is well to be acquainted with a report that is current among the men of the backwoods If it be true we are of opinion that the doggie s family is the most miscellaneous and remarkable on the face of or as Henri said in the bo els of the earth Dick and his friends were so deeply absorbed in watching these curious little creatures that they did not observe the rapid spread of the black clouds over the sky A few heavy drops of rain now warned them to seek shelter so wheeling round they dashed off at speed for the clump of willows which they gained just as the rain began to descend in torrents Now lads do it slick Off packs and saddles cried Joe Blunt jumping from his horse I ll make a hut for ye right off A hut Joe what sort o hut can ye make here inquired Dick Ye ll see boy in a minute Ach lend me hand here Dick de bockle am tight as de hosse s own skin Ah dere all right Hallo what s this exclaimed Dick as Crusoe advanced with something in his mouth I declare it s a bird of some sort A prairie hen remarked Joe as Crusoe laid the bird at Dick s feet capital for supper Ah dat chien is superb goot dog Come here I vill clap you But Crusoe refused to be caressed Meanwhile Joe and Dick formed a sort of beehive looking hut by bending down the stems of a tall bush and thrusting their points into the ground Over this they threw the largest buffalo robe and placed another on the ground below it on which they laid their packs of goods These they further secured against wet by placing several robes over them and a skin of parchment Then they sat down on this pile to rest and consider what should be done next Tis a bad look out said Joe shaking his head I fear it is replied Dick in a melancholy tone Henri said nothing but he sighed deeply on looking up at the sky which was now of a uniform watery grey while black clouds drove athwart it The rain was pouring in torrents and the wind began to sweep it in broad sheets over the plains and under their slight covering so that in a short time they were wet to the skin The horses stood meekly beside them with their tails and heads equally pendulous and Crusoe sat before his master looking at him with an expression that seemed to say Couldn t you put a stop to this if you were to try This ll never do I ll try to git up a fire said Dick jumping up in desperation Ye may save yerself the trouble remarked Joe drily at least as drily as was possible in the circumstances However Dick did try but he failed signally Everything was soaked and saturated There were no large trees most of the bushes were green and the dead ones were soaked The coverings were slobbery the skins they sat on were slobbery the earth itself was slobbery so Dick threw his blanket which was also slobbery round his shoulders and sat down beside his companions to grin and bear it As for Joe and Henri they were old hands and accustomed to such circumstances From the first they had resigned themselves to their fate and wrapping their wet blankets round them sat down side by side wisely to endure the evils that they could not cure There is an old rhyme by whom composed we know not and it matters little which runs thus For every evil under the sun There is a remedy or there s none If there is try and find it If there isn t never mind it There is deep wisdom here in small compass The principle involved deserves to be heartily recommended Dick never heard of the lines but he knew the principle well so he began to never mind it by sitting down beside his companions and whistling vociferously As the wind rendered this a difficult feat he took to singing instead After that he said Let s eat a bite Joe and then go to bed Be all means said Joe who produced a mass of dried deer s meat from a wallet It s cold grub said Dick and tough But the hunters teeth were sharp and strong so they ate a hearty supper and washed it down with a drink of rain water collected from a pool on the top of their hut They now tried to sleep for the night was advancing and it was so dark that they could scarce see their hands when held up before their faces They sat back to back and thus in the form of a tripod began to snooze Joe s and Henri s seasoned frames would have remained stiff as posts till morning but Dick s body was young and pliant so he hadn t been asleep a few seconds when he fell forward into the mud and effectually awakened the others Joe gave a grunt and Henri exclaimed Hah but Dick was too sleepy and miserable to say anything Crusoe however rose up to show his sympathy and laid his wet head on his master s knee as he resumed his place This catastrophe happened three times in the space of an hour and by the third time they were all wakened up so thoroughly that they gave up the attempt to sleep and amused each other by recounting their hunting experiences and telling stories So engrossed did they become that day broke sooner than they had expected and just in proportion as the grey light of dawn rose higher into the eastern sky did the spirits of these weary men rise within their soaking bodies CHAPTER SEVEN THE WALLERING PECULIARITIES OF BUFFALO BULLS THE FIRST BUFFALO HUNT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES CRUSOE COMES TO THE RESCUE PAWNEES DISCOVERED A MONSTER BUFFALO HUNT JOE ACTS THE PART OF AMBASSADOR Fortunately the day that succeeded the dreary night described in the last chapter was warm and magnificent The sun rose in a blaze of splendour and filled the atmosphere with steam from the moist earth The unfortunates in the wet camp were not slow to avail themselves of his cheering rays They hung up everything on the bushes to dry and by dint of extreme patience and cutting out the comparatively dry hearts of several pieces of wood they lighted a fire and boiled some rain water which was soon converted into soup This and the exercise necessary for the performance of these several duties warmed and partially dried them so that when they once more mounted their steeds and rode away they were in a state of comparative comfort and in excellent spirits The only annoyance was the clouds of mosquitoes and large flies that assailed men and horses whenever they checked their speed I tell ye wot it is said Joe Blunt one fine morning about a week after they had begun to cross the prairie it s my pinion that we ll come on buffaloes soon Them tracks are fresh an yonder s one o their wallers that s bin used not long agone I ll go have a look at it cried Dick trotting away as he spoke Everything in these vast prairies was new to Dick Varley and he was kept in a constant state of excitement during the first week or two of his journey It is true he was quite familiar with the names and habits of all the animals that dwelt there for many a time and oft had he listened to the yarns of the hunters and trappers of the Mustang Valley when they returned laden with rich furs from their periodical hunting expeditions But this knowledge of his only served to whet his curiosity and his desire to see the denizens of the prairies with his own eyes and now that his wish was accomplished it greatly increased the pleasures of his journey Dick had just reached the wallow referred to by Joe Blunt and had reined up his steed to observe it leisurely when a faint hissing sound reached his ear Looking quickly back he observed his two companions crouching on the necks of their horses and slowly descending into a hollow of the prairie in front of them as if they wished to bring the rising ground between them and some object in advance Dick instantly followed their example and was soon at their heels Ye needn t look at the waller whispered Joe for a t other side o the ridge there s a bull wallerin Ye don t mean it exclaimed Dick as they all dismounted and picketed their horses to the plain Oui said Henri tumbling off his horse while a broad grin overspread his good natured countenance it is one fact One buffalo bull be wollerin like a enormerous hog Also dere be t ousands o buffaloes farder on Can ye trust yer dog keepin back inquired Joe with a dubious glance at Crusoe Trust him Ay I wish I was as sure o myself Look to your primin then an we ll have tongues and marrow bones for supper to night I se warrant Hist down on yer knees and go softly We might ha run them down on horseback but its bad to wind yer beasts on a trip like this if ye can help it an it s about as easy to stalk them Leastways we ll try Lift yer head slowly Dick an don t show more nor the half o t above the ridge Dick elevated his head as directed and the scene that met his view was indeed well calculated to send an electric shock to the heart of an ardent sportsman The vast plain beyond was absolutely blackened with countless herds of buffaloes which were browsing on the rich grass They were still so far distant that their bellowing and the trampling of their myriad hoofs only reached the hunters like a faint murmur on the breeze In the immediate foreground however there was a group of about half a dozen buffalo cows feeding quietly and in the midst of them an enormous old bull was enjoying himself in his wallow The animals towards which our hunters now crept with murderous intent are the fiercest and the most ponderous of the ruminating inhabitants of the western wilderness The name of buffalo however is not correct The animal is the bison and bears no resemblance whatever to the buffalo proper but as the hunters of the far west and indeed travellers generally have adopted the misnomer we bow to the authority of custom and adopt it too Buffaloes roam in countless thousands all over the North American prairies from the Hudson s Bay territories north of Canada to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico The advance of white men to the west has driven them to the prairies between the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains and has somewhat diminished their numbers but even thus diminished they are still innumerable in the more distant plains Their colour is dark brown but it varies a good deal with the seasons The hair or fur from its great length in winter and spring and exposure to the weather turns quite light but when the winter coat is shed off the new growth is a beautiful dark brown almost approaching to jet black In form the buffalo somewhat resembles the ox but its head and shoulders are much larger and are covered with a profusion of long shaggy hair which adds greatly to the fierce aspect of the animal It has a large hump on the shoulder and its fore quarters are much larger in proportion than the hindquarters The horns are short and thick the hoofs are cloven and the tail is short with a tuft of hair at the extremity It is scarcely possible to conceive a wilder or more ferocious and terrible monster than a buffalo bull He often grows to the enormous weight of two thousand pounds His lion like mane falls in shaggy confusion quite over his head and shoulders down to the ground When he is wounded he becomes imbued with the spirit of a tiger he stamps bellows roars and foams forth his rage with glaring eyes and steaming nostrils and charges furiously at man and horse with utter recklessness Fortunately however he is not naturally pugnacious and can be easily thrown into a sudden panic Moreover the peculiar position of his eye renders this creature not so terrible as he would otherwise be to the hunter Owing to the stiff structure of the neck and the sunken downward looking eyeball the buffalo cannot without an effort see beyond the direct line of vision presented to the habitual carriage of his head When therefore he is wounded and charges he does so in a straight line so that his pursuer can leap easily out of his way The pace of the buffalo is clumsy and apparently slow yet when chased he dashes away over the plains in blind blundering terror at a rate that leaves all but good horses far behind He cannot keep the pace up however and is usually soon overtaken Were the buffalo capable of the same alert and agile motions of head and eye peculiar to the deer or wild horse in addition to his bovine rage he would be the most formidable brute on earth There is no object perhaps so terrible as the headlong advance of a herd of these animals when thoroughly aroused by terror They care not for their necks All danger in front is forgotten or not seen in the terror of that from which they fly No thundering cataract is more tremendously irresistible than the black bellowing torrent which sometimes pours through the narrow defiles of the Rocky Mountains or sweeps like a roaring flood over the trembling plains The wallowing to which we have referred is a luxury usually indulged in during the hot months of summer when the buffaloes are tormented by flies and heat and drought At this season they seek the low grounds in the prairies where there is a little stagnant water lying amongst the grass and the ground underneath being saturated is soft The leader of the herd a shaggy old bull usually takes upon himself to prepare the wallow It was a rugged monster of the largest size that did so on the present occasion to the intense delight of Dick Varley who begged Joe to lie still and watch the operation before trying to shoot one of the buffalo cows Joe consented with a nod and the four spectators for Crusoe was as much taken up with the proceedings as any of them crouched in the grass and looked on Coming up to the swampy spot the old bull gave a grunt of satisfaction and going down on one knee plunged his short thick horns into the mud tore it up and cast it aside Having repeated this several times he plunged his head in and brought it forth saturated with dirty water and bedaubed with lumps of mud through which his fierce eyes gazed with a ludicrous expression of astonishment straight in the direction of the hunters as if he meant to say I ve done it that time and no mistake The other buffaloes seemed to think so too for they came up and looked on with an expression that seemed to say Well done old fellow try that again The old fellow did try it again and again and again plunging and ramming and tearing up the earth until he formed an excavation large enough to contain his huge body In this bath he laid himself comfortably down and began to roll and wallow about until he mixed up a trough full of thin soft mud which completely covered him When he came out of the hole there was scarcely an atom of his former self visible The coat of mud thus put on by bulls is usually permitted by them to dry and is not finally got rid of until long after when oft repeated rollings on the grass and washings by rain at length clear it away When the old bull vacated this delectable bath another bull scarcely if at all less ferocious looking stepped forward to take his turn but he was interrupted by a volley from the hunters which scattered the animals right and left and sent the mighty herds in the distance flying over the prairie in wild terror The very turmoil of their own mad flight added to their panic and the continuous thunder of their hoofs was heard until the last of them disappeared on the horizon The family party which had been fired at however did not escape so well Joe s rifle wounded a fat young cow and Dick Varley brought it down Henri had done his best but as the animals were too far distant for his limited vision he missed the cow he fired at and hit the young bull whose bath had been interrupted The others scattered and fled Well done Dick exclaimed Joe Blunt as they all ran up to the cow that had fallen Your first shot at the buffalo was a good un Come now an I ll show ye how to cut it up an carry off the titbits Ah mon dear ole bull exclaimed Henri gazing after the animal which he had wounded and which was now limping slowly away You is not worth goin after Varewell adieu He ll be tough enough I warrant said Joe an we ve more meat here nor we can lift But wouldn t it be as well to put the poor brute out o pain suggested Dick Oh he ll die soon enough replied Joe tucking up his sleeves and drawing his long hunting knife Dick however was not satisfied with this way of looking at it Saying that he would be back in a few minutes he re loaded his rifle and calling Crusoe to his side walked quickly after the wounded bull which was now hid from view in a hollow of the plain In a few minutes he came in sight of it and ran forward with his rifle in readiness Down Crusoe he whispered wait for me here Crusoe crouched in the grass instantly and Dick advanced As he came on the bull observed him and turned round bellowing with rage and pain to receive him The aspect of the brute on a near view was so terrible that Dick involuntarily stopped too and gazed with a mingled feeling of wonder and awe while it bristled with passion and blood streaked foam dropped from its open jaws and its eyes glared furiously Seeing that Dick did not advance the bull charged him with a terrific roar but the youth had firm nerves and although the rush of such a savage creature at full speed was calculated to try the courage of any man especially one who had never seen a buffalo bull before Dick did not lose presence of mind He remembered the many stories he had listened to of this very thing that was now happening so crushing down his excitement as well as he could he cocked his rifle and awaited the charge He knew that it was of no use to fire at the head of the advancing foe as the thickness of the skull together with the matted hair on the forehead rendered it impervious to a bullet When the bull was within a yard of him he leaped lightly to one side and it passed Just as it did so Dick aimed at its heart and fired but his knowledge of the creature s anatomy was not yet correct The ball entered the shoulder too high and the bull checking himself as well as he could in his headlong rush turned round and made at Dick again The failure coupled with the excitement proved too much for Dick he could not resist discharging his second barrel at the brute s head as it came on He might as well have fired at a brick wall it shook its shaggy front and with a hideous bellow thundered forward Again Dick sprang to one side but in doing so a tuft of grass or a stone caught his foot and he fell heavily to the ground Up to this point Crusoe s admirable training had nailed him to the spot where he had been left although the twitching of every fibre in his body and a low continuous whine showed how gladly he would have hailed permission to join in the combat but the instant he saw his master down and the buffalo turning to charge again he sprang forward with a roar that would have done credit to his bovine enemy and seized him by the nose So vigorous was the rush that he well nigh pulled the bull down on its side One toss of its head however sent Crusoe high into the air but it accomplished this feat at the expense of its nose which was torn and lacerated by the dog s teeth Scarcely had Crusoe touched the ground which he did with a sounding thump than he sprang up and flew at his adversary again This time however he adopted the plan of barking furiously and biting by rapid yet terrible snaps as he found opportunity thus keeping the bull entirely engrossed and affording Dick an opportunity of re loading his rifle which he was not slow to do Dick then stepped close up and while the two combatants were roaring in each other s face he shot the buffalo through the heart It fell to the earth with a deep groan Crusoe s rage instantly vanished on beholding this and he seemed to be filled with tumultuous joy at his master s escape for he gambolled round him and whined and fawned upon him in a manner that could not be misunderstood Good dog thank ee my pup said Dick patting Crusoe s head as he stooped to brush the dust from his leggings I don t know what would ha become o me but for your help Crusoe Crusoe turned his head a little to one side wagged his tail and looked at Dick with an expression that said quite plainly I d die for you I would not once or twice but ten times fifty times if need be and that not merely to save your life but even to please you There is no doubt whatever that Crusoe felt something of this sort The love of a Newfoundland dog to its master is beyond calculation or expression He who once gains such love carries the dog s life in his hand But let him who reads note well and remember that there is only one coin that can purchase such love and that is kindness the coin too must be genuine Kindness merely expressed will not do it must be felt Hallo boy ye ve bin i the wars exclaimed Joe raising himself from his task as Dick and Crusoe returned You look more like it than I do retorted Dick laughing This was true for cutting up a buffalo carcase with no other instrument than a large knife is no easy matter Yet western hunters and Indians can do it without cleaver or saw in a way that would surprise a civilised butcher not a little Joe was covered with blood up to the elbows His hair happening to have a knack of getting into his eyes had been so often brushed off with bloody hands that his whole visage was speckled with gore and his dress was by no means immaculate While Dick related his adventure or mis adventure with the bull Joe and Henri completed the cutting out of the most delicate portions of the buffalo namely the hump on its shoulder which is a choice piece much finer than the best beef and the tongue and a few other parts The tongues of buffaloes are superior to those of domestic cattle When all was ready the meat was slung across the back of the pack horse and the party remounting their horses continued their journey having first cleansed themselves as well as they could in the rather dirty waters of an old wallow See said Henri turning to Dick and pointing to a circular spot of green as they rode along that is one old dry waller Ay remarked Joe after the waller dries it becomes a ring o greener grass than the rest o the plain as ye see Tis said the first hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster ous circles and they invented all sorts o stories to account for em Some said they wos fairy rings but at last they comed to know they wos nothin more nor less than places where buffaloes wos used to waller in It s often seemed to me that if we knowed the raisons o things we wouldn t be so much puzzled wi them as we are The truth of this last remark was so self evident and incontrovertible that it elicited no reply and the three friends rode on for a considerable time in silence It was now past noon and they were thinking of calling a halt for a short rest to the horses and a pipe to themselves when Joe was heard to give vent to one of those peculiar hisses that always accompanied either a surprise or a caution In the present case it indicated both What now Joe Injuns ejaculated Joe Eh fat you say ou is de Crusoe at this moment uttered a low growl Ever since the day he had been partially roasted he had maintained a rooted antipathy to Red men Joe immediately dismounted and placing his ear to the ground listened intently It is a curious fact that by placing the ear close to the ground sounds can be heard distinctly which could not be heard at all if the listener were to maintain an erect position They re arter the buffalo said Joe rising an I think it s likely they re a band o Pawnees Listen an ye ll hear their shouts quite plain Dick and Henri immediately lay down and placed their ears to the ground Now me hear noting said Henri jumping up but me ear is like me eyes ver short sighted I do hear something said Dick as he got up but the beating o my own heart makes row enough to spoil my hearin Joe Blunt smiled Ah lad yer young an yer blood s too hot yet but bide a bit you ll cool down soon I wos like you once Now lads what think ye we should do You know best Joe Oui nodoubtedly Then wot I advise is that we gallop to the broken sand hillocks ye see yonder get behind them an take a peep at the Red skins If they are Pawnees we ll go up to them at once if not we ll hold a council o war on the spot Having arranged this they mounted and hastened towards the hillocks in question which they reached after ten minutes gallop at full stretch The sandy mounds afforded them concealment and enabled them to watch the proceedings of the savages in the plain below The scene was the most curious and exciting that can be conceived The centre of the plain before them was crowded with hundreds of buffaloes which were dashing about in the most frantic state of alarm To whatever point they galloped they were met by yelling savages on horseback who could not have been fewer in numbers than a thousand all being armed with lance bow and quiver and mounted on active little horses The Indians had completely surrounded the herd of buffaloes and were now advancing steadily towards them gradually narrowing the circle and whenever the terrified animals endeavoured to break through the line they rushed to that particular spot in a body and scared them back again into the centre Thus they advanced until they closed in on their prey and formed an unbroken circle round them whilst the poor brutes kept eddying and surging to and fro in a confused mass hooking and climbing upon each other and bellowing furiously Suddenly the horsemen made a rush and the work of destruction began The tremendous turmoil raised a cloud of dust that obscured the field in some places and hid it from our hunters view Some of the Indians galloped round and round the circle sending their arrows whizzing up to the feathers in the sides of the fattest cows Others dashed fearlessly into the midst of the black heaving mass and with their long lances pierced dozens of them to the heart In many instances the buffaloes infuriated by wounds turned fiercely on their assailants and gored the horses to death in which cases the men had to trust to their nimble legs for safety Sometimes a horse got jammed in the centre of the swaying mass and could neither advance nor retreat Then the savage rider leaped upon the buffaloes backs and springing from one to another like an acrobat gained the outer edge of the circle not failing however in his strange flight to pierce with his lance several of the fattest of his stepping stones as he sped along A few of the herd succeeded in escaping from the blood and dust of this desperate battle and made off over the plains but they were quickly overtaken and the lance or arrow brought them down on the green turf Many of the dismounted riders were chased by bulls but they stepped lightly to one side and as the animals passed drove their arrows deep into their sides Thus the tumultuous war went on amid thundering tread and yell and bellow till the green plain was transformed into a sea of blood and mire and every buffalo of the herd was laid low It is not to be supposed that such reckless warfare is invariably waged without damage to the savages Many were the wounds and bruises received that day and not a few bones were broken but happily no lives were lost Now lads now s our time A bold and fearless look s the best at all times Don t look as if ye doubted their friendship and mind wotever ye do don t use yer arms Follow me Saying this Joe Blunt leaped on his horse and bounding over the ridge at full speed galloped headlong across the plain The savages observed the strangers instantly and a loud yell announced the fact as they assembled from all parts of the field brandishing their bows and spears Joe s quick eye soon distinguished their chief towards whom he galloped still at full speed till within a yard or two of his horse s head then he reined up suddenly So rapidly did Joe and his comrades approach and so instantaneously did they pull up that their steeds were thrown almost on their haunches The Indian chief did not move a muscle He was a tall powerful savage almost naked and mounted on a coal black charger which he sat with the ease of a man accustomed to ride from infancy He was indeed a splendid looking savage but his face wore a dark frown for although he and his band had visited the settlements and trafficked with the fur traders on the Missouri he did not love the Pale faces whom he regarded as intruders on the hunting grounds of his fathers and the peace that existed between them at that time was of a very fragile character Indeed it was deemed by the traders impossible to travel through the Indian country at that period except in strong force and it was the very boldness of the present attempt that secured to our hunters anything like a civil reception Joe who could speak the Pawnee tongue fluently began by explaining the object of his visit and spoke of the presents which he had brought for the great chief but it was evident that his words made little impression As he discoursed to them the savages crowded round the little party and began to handle and examine their dresses and weapons with a degree of rudeness that caused Joe considerable anxiety Mahtawa believes that the heart of the Pale face is true said the savage when Joe paused but he does not choose to make peace The Pale faces are grasping They never rest They turn their eyes to the great mountains and say There we will stop But even there they will not stop They are never satisfied Mahtawa knows them well This speech sank like a death knell into the hearts of the hunters for they knew that if the savages refused to make peace they would scalp them all and appropriate their goods To make things worse a dark visaged Indian suddenly caught hold of Henri s rifle and ere he was aware plucked it from his hand The blood rushed to the gigantic hunter s forehead and he was on the point of springing at the man when Joe said in a deep quiet voice Be still Henri You will but hasten death At this moment there was a movement in the outskirts of the circle of horsemen and another chief rode into the midst of them He was evidently higher in rank than Mahtawa for he spoke authoritatively to the crowd and stepped in before him The hunters drew little comfort from the appearance of his face however for it scowled upon them He was not so powerful a man as Mahtawa but he was more gracefully formed and had a more noble and commanding countenance Have the Pale faces no wigwams on the great river that they should come to spy out the lands of the Pawnee he demanded We have not come to spy your country answered Joe raising himself proudly as he spoke and taking off his cap We have come with a message from the great chief of the Pale faces who lives in the village far beyond the great river where the sun rises He says why should the Pale face and the Red man fight They are brothers The same Manitou the Indian name for God watches over both The Pale faces have more beads and guns and blankets and knives and vermilion than they require they wish to give some of these things for the skins and furs which the Red man does not know what to do with The great chief of the Pale faces has sent me to say Why should we fight let us smoke the pipe of peace At the mention of beads and blankets the face of the wily chief brightened for a moment Then he said sternly The heart of the Pale face is not true He has come here to trade for himself San it sa rish has eyes that can see they are not shut Are not these your goods The chief pointed to the pack horse as he spoke Trappers do not take their goods into the heart of an enemy s camp returned Joe San it sa rish is wise and will understand this These are gifts to the chief of the Pawnees There are more awaiting him when the pipe of peace is smoked I have said What message shall we take back to the great chief of the Pale faces San it sa rish was evidently mollified The hunting field is not the council tent he said The Pale faces will go with us to our village Of course Joe was only too glad to agree to this proposal but he now deemed it politic to display a little firmness We cannot go till our rifle is restored It will not do to go back and tell the great chief of the Pale faces that the Pawnees are thieves The chief frowned angrily The Pawnees are true they are not thieves They choose to look at the rifle of the Pale face It shall be returned The rifle was instantly restored and then our hunters rode off with the Indians towards their camp On the way they met hundreds of women and children going to the scene of the great hunt for it was their special duty to cut up the meat and carry it into camp The men considering that they had done quite enough in killing it returned to smoke and eat away the fatigues of the chase As they rode along Dick Varley observed that some of the braves as Indian warriors are styled were eating pieces of the bloody livers of the buffaloes in a raw state at which he expressed not a little disgust Ah boy you re green yet remarked Joe Blunt in an undertone Mayhap ye ll be thankful to do that same yerself some day Well I ll not refuse to try when it is needful said Dick with a laugh meanwhile I m content to see the Red skins do it Joe Blunt CHAPTER EIGHT DICK AND HIS FRIENDS VISIT THE INDIANS AND SEE MANY WONDERS CRUSOE TOO EXPERIENCES A FEW SURPRISES AND TEACHES INDIAN DOGS A LESSON AN INDIAN DANDY A FOOT RACE The Pawnee village at which they soon arrived was situated in the midst of a most interesting and picturesque scene It occupied an extensive plain which sloped gently down to a creek In America small rivers or riverlets are termed creeks whose winding course was marked by a broken line of wood here and there interspersed with a fine clump of trees between the trunks of which the blue waters of the lake sparkled in the distance Hundreds of tents or lodges of buffalo skins covered the ground and thousand of Indians men women and children moved about the busy scene Some were sitting in their lodges lazily smoking their pipes But these were chiefly old and infirm veterans for all the young men had gone to the hunt which we have just described The women were stooping over their fires busily preparing maize and meat for their husbands and brothers while myriads of little brown and naked children romped about everywhere filling the air with their yells and screams which were only equalled if not surpassed by the yelping dogs that seemed innumerable Far as the eye could reach were seen scattered herds of horses These were tended by little boys who were totally destitute of clothing and who seemed to enjoy with infinite zest the pastime of shooting practice with little bows and arrows No wonder that these Indians become expert bowmen There were urchins there scarce two feet high with round bullets of bodies and short spindle shanks who could knock blackbirds off the trees at every shot and cut the heads of the taller flowers with perfect certainty There was much need too for the utmost proficiency they could attain for the very existence of the Indian tribes of the prairies depends on their success in hunting the buffalo There are hundreds and thousands of North American savages who would undoubtedly perish and their tribes become extinct if the buffaloes were to leave the prairies or die out Yet although animals are absolutely essential to their existence they pursue and slay them with improvident recklessness sometimes killing hundreds of them merely for the sake of the sport the tongues and the marrow bones In the bloody hunt described in the last chapter however the slaughter of so many was not wanton because the village that had to be supplied with food was large and just previous to the hunt they had been living on somewhat reduced allowance Even the blackbirds shot by the brown bodied urchins before mentioned had been thankfully put into the pot Thus precarious is the supply of food among the Red men who on one day are starving and the next are revelling in superabundance But to return to our story At one end of this village the creek sprang over a ledge of rock in a low cascade and opened out into a beautiful lake the bosom of which was studded with small islands Here were thousands of those smaller species of wild water fowl which were either too brave or too foolish to be scared away by the noise of the camp And here too dozens of children were sporting on the beach or paddling about in their light bark canoes Isn t it strange remarked Dick to Henri as they passed among the tents towards the centre of the village isn t it strange that them Injuns should be so fond o fightin when they ve got all they can want a fine country lots o buffalo an as far as I can see happy homes Oui it is remarkaibel vraiment But dey do more love war to peace Dey loves to be excited I s pose Humph One would think the hunt we seed a little agone would be excitement enough But I say that must be the chief s tent by the look o t Dick was right the horsemen pulled up and dismounted opposite the principal chief s tent which was a larger and more elegant structure than the others Meanwhile an immense concourse of women children and dogs gathered round the strangers and while the latter yelped their dislike to white men the former chattered continuously as they discussed the appearance of the strangers and their errand which latter soon became known An end was put to this by San it sa rish desiring the hunters to enter the tent and spreading a buffalo robe for them to sit on Two braves carried in their packs and then led away their horses All this time Crusoe had kept as close as possible to his master s side feeling extremely uncomfortable in the midst of such a strange crowd the more especially that the ill looking Indian curs gave him expressive looks of hatred and exhibited some desire to rush upon him in a body so that he had to keep a sharp look out all round him When therefore Dick entered the tent Crusoe endeavoured to do so along with him but he was met by a blow on the nose from an old squaw who scolded him in a shrill voice and bade him begone Either our hero s knowledge of the Indian language was insufficient to enable him to understand the order or he had resolved not to obey it for instead of retreating he drew a deep gurgling breath curled his nose and displayed a row of teeth that caused the old woman to draw back in alarm Crusoe s was a forgiving spirit The instant that opposition ceased he forgot the injury and was meekly advancing when Dick held up his finger Go outside pup and wait Crusoe s tail drooped with a deep sigh he turned and left the tent He took up a position near the entrance however and sat down resignedly So meek indeed did the poor dog look that six mangy looking curs felt their dastardly hearts emboldened to make a rush at him with boisterous yells Crusoe did not rise He did not even condescend to turn his head toward them but he looked at them out of the corner of his dark eye wrinkled very slightly the skin of his nose exhibited two beautiful fangs and gave utterance to a soft remark that might be described as quiet deep toned gargling It wasn t much but it was more than enough for the valiant six who paused and snarled violently It was a peculiar trait of Crusoe s gentle nature that the moment any danger ceased he resumed his expression of nonchalant gravity The expression on this occasion was misunderstood however and as about two dozen additional yelping dogs had joined the ranks of the enemy they advanced in close order to the attack Crusoe still sat quiet and kept his head high but he looked at them again and exhibited four fangs for their inspection Among the pack there was one Indian dog of large size almost as large as Crusoe himself which kept well in the rear and apparently urged the lesser dogs on The little dogs didn t object for little dogs are generally the most pugnacious At this big dog Crusoe directed a pointed glance but said nothing Meanwhile a particularly small and vicious cur with a mere rag of a tail crept round by the back of the tent and coming upon Crusoe in the rear snapped at his tail sharply and then fled shrieking with terror and surprise no doubt at its own temerity Crusoe did not bark he seldom barked he usually either said nothing or gave utterance to a prolonged roar of indignation of the most terrible character with barks as it were mingled through it It somewhat resembled that peculiar and well known species of thunder the prolonged roll of which is marked at short intervals in its course by cannon like cracks It was a continuous but so to speak knotted roar On receiving the snap Crusoe gave forth the roar with a majesty and power that scattered the pugnacious front rank of the enemy to the winds Those that still remained half stupefied he leaped over with a huge bound and alighted fangs first on the back of the big dog There was one hideous yell a muffled scramble of an instant s duration and the big dog lay dead upon the plain It was an awful thing to do but Crusoe evidently felt that the peculiar circumstances of the case required that an example should be made and to say truth all things considered we cannot blame him The news must have been carried at once through the canine portion of the camp for Crusoe was never interfered with again after that Dick witnessed this little incident but he observed that the Indian chief cared not a straw about it and as his dog returned quietly and sat down in its old place he took no notice of it either but continued to listen to the explanations which Joe gave to the chief of the desire of the Pale faces to be friends with the Red men Joe s eloquence would have done little for him on this occasion had his hands been empty but he followed it up by opening one of his packs and displaying the glittering contents before the equally glittering eyes of the chief and his squaws These said Joe are the gifts that the great chief of the Pale faces sends to the great chief of the Pawnees and he bids me say that there are many more things in his stores which will be traded for skins with the Red men when they visit him and he also says that if the Pawnees will not steal horses any more from the Pale faces they shall receive gifts of knives and guns and powder and blankets every year Wah grunted the chief it is good The great chief is wise We will smoke the pipe of peace The things that afforded so much satisfaction to San it sa rish were the veriest trifles Penny looking glasses in yellow gilt tin frames beads of various colours needles cheap scissors and knives vermilion paint and coarse scarlet cloth etcetera They were of priceless value however in the estimation of the savages who delighted to adorn themselves with leggings made from the cloth beautifully worked with beads by their own ingenious women They were thankful too for knives even of the commonest description having none but bone ones of their own and they gloried in daubing their faces with intermingled streaks of charcoal and vermilion To gaze at their visages when thus treated in the little penny looking glasses is their summit of delight Joe presented the chief with a portion of these coveted goods and tied up the remainder We may remark here that the only thing which prevented the savages from taking possession of the whole at once without asking permission was the promise of the annual gifts which they knew would not be forthcoming were any evil to befall the deputies of the Pale faces Nevertheless it cost them a severe struggle to restrain their hands on this occasion and Joe and his companions felt that they would have to play their part well in order to fulfil their mission with safety and credit The Pale faces may go now and talk with the braves said San it sa rish after carefully examining everything that was given to him a council will be called soon and we will smoke the pipe of peace Accepting this permission to retire the hunters immediately left the tent and being now at liberty to do what they pleased they amused themselves by wandering about the village He s a cute chap that remarked Joe with a sarcastic smile I don t feel quite easy about gettin away He ll bother the life out o us to get all the goods we ve got and ye see as we ve other tribes to visit we must give away as little as we can here Ha you is right said Henri dat fellow s eyes twinkle at de knives and tings like two stars Fire flies ye should say Stars are too soft an beautiful to compare to the eyes o yon savage said Dick laughing I wish we were well away from them That rascal Mahtawa is an ugly customer True lad returned Joe had he bin the great chief our scalps had bin dryin in the smoke o a Pawnee wigwam afore now What now lad Joe s question was put in consequence of a gleeful smile that overspread the countenance of Dick Varley who replied by pointing to a wigwam towards which they were approaching Oh that s only a dandy exclaimed Joe There s lots o them in every Injun camp They re fit for nothin but dress poor contemptible critters Joe accompanied his remark with a sneer for of all pitiable objects he regarded an unmanly man as the most despicable He consented however to sit down on a grassy bank and watch the proceedings of this Indian dandy who had just seated himself in front of his wigwam for the purpose of making his toilet He began it by greasing his whole person carefully and smoothly over with buffalo fat until he shone like a patent leather boot then he rubbed himself almost dry leaving the skin sleek and glossy Having proceeded thus far he took up a small mirror a few inches in diameter which he or some other member of the tribe must have procured during one of their few excursions to the trading forts of the Pale faces and examined himself as well as he could in so limited a space Next he took a little vermilion from a small parcel and rubbed it over his face until it presented the somewhat demoniac appearance of a fiery red He also drew a broad red score along the crown of his head which was closely shaved with the exception of the usual tuft or scalp lock on the top This scalp lock stood bristling straight up a few inches and then curved over and hung down his back about two feet Immense care and attention was bestowed on this lock He smoothed it greased it and plaited it into the form of a pigtail Another application was here made to the glass and the result was evidently satisfactory to judge from the beaming smile that played on his features But not content with the general effect he tried the effect of expression frowned portentously scowled savagely gaped hideously and grinned horribly a ghastly smile Then our dandy fitted into his ears which were bored in several places sundry ornaments such as rings wampum etcetera and hung several strings of beads round his neck Besides these he affixed one or two ornaments to his arms wrists and ankles and touched in a few effects with vermilion on the shoulders and breast After this and a few more glances at the glass he put on a pair of beautiful moccasins which besides being richly wrought with beads were soft as chamois leather and fitted his feet like gloves a pair of leggings of scarlet cloth were drawn on attached to a waist belt and bound below the knee with broad garters of variegated bead work It was some time before this Adonis was quite satisfied with himself He re touched the paint on his shoulders several times and modified the glare of that on his wide mouthed high cheek boned visage before he could tear himself away but at last he did so and throwing a large piece of scarlet cloth over his shoulders he thrust his looking glass under his belt and proceeded to mount his palfrey which was held in readiness near to the tent door by one of his wives The horse was really a fine animal and seemed worthy of a more warlike master His shoulders too were striped with red paint and feathers were intertwined with his mane and tail while the bridle was decorated with various jingling ornaments Vaulting upon his steed with a large fan of wild goose and turkey feathers in one hand and a whip dangling at the wrist of the other this incomparable dandy sallied forth for a promenade that being his chief delight when there was no buffalo hunting to be done Other men who were not dandies sharpened their knives smoked feasted and mended their spears and arrows at such seasons of leisure or played at athletic games Let s follow my buck said Joe Blunt Oui Come long replied Henri striding after the rider at a pace that almost compelled his comrades to run Hold on cried Dick laughing we don t want to keep him company A distant view is quite enough o sich a chap as that Mais you forgit I cannot see far So much the better remarked Joe it s my opinion we ve seen enough o him Ah he s goin to look on at the games Them s worth lookin at The games to which Joe referred were taking place on a green level plain close to the creek and a little above the waterfall before referred to Some of the Indians were horse racing some jumping and others wrestling but the game which proved most attractive was throwing the javelin in which several of the young braves were engaged This game is played by two competitors each armed with a dart in an arena about fifty yards long One of the players has a hoop of six inches in diameter At a signal they start off on foot at full speed and on reaching the middle of the arena the Indian with the hoop rolls it along before them and each does his best to send a javelin through the hoop before the other He who succeeds counts so many points if both miss the nearest to the hoop is allowed to count but not so much as if he had ringed it The Indians are very fond of this game and will play at it under a broiling sun for hours together But a good deal of the interest attaching to it is owing to the fact that they make it a means of gambling Indians are inveterate gamblers and will sometimes go on until they lose horses bows blankets robes and in short their whole personal property The consequences are as might be expected that fierce and bloody quarrels sometimes arise in which life is often lost Try your hand at that said Henri to Dick By all means cried Dick handing his rifle to his friend and springing into the ring enthusiastically A general shout of applause greeted the Pale face who threw off his coat and tightened his belt while a young Indian presented him with a dart Now see that ye do us credit lad said Joe I ll try answered Dick In a moment they were off The young Indian rolled away the hoop and Dick threw his dart with such vigour that it went deep into the ground but missed the hoop by a foot at least The young Indian s first dart went through the centre Ha exclaimed Joe Blunt to the Indians near him the lad s not used to that game try him at a race Bring out your best brave he whose bound is like the hunted deer We need scarcely remind the reader that Joe spoke in the Indian language and that the above is a correct rendering of the sense of what he said The name of Tarwicadia or the little chief immediately passed from lip to lip and in a few minutes an Indian a little below the medium size bounded into the arena with an indiarubber like elasticity that caused a shade of anxiety to pass over Joe s face Ah boy he whispered I m afeared you ll find him a tough customer That s just what I want replied Dick He s supple enough but he wants muscle in the thigh We ll make it a long heat Right lad yer right Joe now proceeded to arrange the conditions of the race with the chiefs around him It was fixed that the distance to be run should be a mile so that the race would be one of two miles out and back Moreover the competitors were to run without any clothes except a belt and a small piece of cloth round the loins This to the Indians was nothing for they seldom wore more in warm weather but Dick would have preferred to keep on part of his dress The laws of the course however would not permit of this so he stripped and stood forth the beau ideal of a well formed agile man He was greatly superior in size to his antagonist and more muscular the savage being slender and extremely lithe and springy Hah I will run too shouted Henri bouncing forward with clumsy energy and throwing off his coat just as they were going to start The savages smiled at this unexpected burst and made no objection considering the thing in the light of a joke The signal was given and away they went Oh it would have done you good to have seen the way in which Henri manoeuvred his limbs on this celebrated occasion He went over the ground with huge elephantine bounds runs and jumps He could not have been said to have one style of running he had a dozen styles all of which came into play in the course of half as many minutes The other two ran like the wind yet although Henri appeared to be going heavily over the ground he kept up with them to the turning point As for Dick it became evident in the first few minutes that he could outstrip his antagonist with ease and was hanging back a little all the time He shot ahead like an arrow when they came about half way back and it was clear that the real interest of the race was to lie in the competition between Henri and Tarwicadia Before they were two thirds of the way back Dick walked in to the winning point and turned to watch the others Henri s wind was about gone for he exerted himself with such violence that he wasted half his strength The Indian on the contrary was comparatively fresh but he was not so fleet as his antagonist whose tremendous strides carried him over the ground at an incredible pace On they came neck and neck till close on the score that marked the winning point Here the value of enthusiasm came out strongly in the case of Henri He felt that he could not gain an inch on Tarwicadia to save his life but just as he came up he observed the anxious faces of his comrades and the half sneering countenances of the savages His heart thumped against his ribs every muscle thrilled with a gush of conflicting feelings and he hurled himself over the score like a cannon shot full six inches ahead of the little chief But the thing did not by any means end here Tarwicadia pulled up the instant he had passed Not so our Canadian Such a clumsy and colossal frame was not to be checked in a moment The crowd of Indians opened up to let him pass but unfortunately a small tent that stood in the way was not so obliging Into it he went head foremost like a shell carried away the corner post with his shoulder and brought the whole affair down about his own ears and those of its inmates among whom were several children and two or three dogs It required some time to extricate them all from the ruins but when this was effected it was found that no serious damage had been done to life or limb CHAPTER NINE CRUSOE ACTS A CONSPICUOUS AND HUMANE PART A FRIEND GAINED A GREAT FEAST When the foot race was concluded the three hunters hung about looking on at the various games for some time and then strolled towards the lake Ye may be thankful yer neck s whole said Joe grinning as Henri rubbed his shoulder with a rueful look An we ll have to send that Injun and his family a knife and some beads to make up for the fright they got Hah an fat is to be give to me for my broke shoulder Credit man credit said Dick Varley laughing Credit fat is dat Honour and glory lad and the praises of them savages Ha de praise more probeebale de ill vill of de rascale I seed dem scowl at me not ver pritty That s true Henri but sich as it is it s all ye ll git I vish remarked Henri after a pause I vish I could git de vampum belt de leetle chief had on It vas superb Fat place do vampums come from They re shells Oui interrupted Henri I know fat de is Dey is shells and de Injuns tink dem goot monish mais I ask you fat place de come from They are thought to be gathered on the shores o the Pacific said Joe the Injuns on the west o the Rocky Mountains picks them up and exchanges them wi the fellows here away for horses and skins so I m told At this moment there was a wild cry of terror heard a short distance ahead of them Rushing forward they observed an Indian woman flying frantically down the river s bank towards the waterfall a hundred yards above which an object was seen struggling in the water Tis her child cried Joe as the mother s frantic cry reached his ear It ll be over the fall in a minute Run Dick you re quickest They had all started forward at speed but Dick and Crusoe were far ahead and abreast of the spot in a few seconds Save it pup cried Dick pointing to the child which had been caught in an eddy and was for a few moments hovering on the edge of the stream that rushed impetuously towards the fall The noble Newfoundland did not require to be told what to do It seems a natural instinct in this sagacious species of dog to save man or beast that chances to be struggling in the water and many are the authentic stories related of Newfoundland dogs saving life in cases of shipwreck Indeed they are regularly trained to the work in some countries and nobly fearlessly disinterestedly do they discharge their trust often in the midst of appalling dangers Crusoe sprang from the bank with such impetus that his broad chest ploughed up the water like the bow of a boat and the energetic workings of his muscles were indicated by the force of each successive propulsion as he shot ahead In a few seconds he reached the child and caught it by the hair Then he turned to swim back but the stream had got hold of him Bravely he struggled and lifted the child breast high out of the water in his powerful efforts to stem the current In vain Each moment he was carried inch by inch down until he was on the brink of the fall which though not high was a large body of water and fell with a heavy roar He raised himself high out of the stream with the vigour of his last struggle and then fell back into the abyss By this time the poor mother was in a canoe as close to the fall as she could with safety approach and the little bark danced like a cockle shell on the turmoil of waters as she stood with uplifted paddle and staring eyeballs awaiting the rising of the child Crusoe came up almost instantly but alone for the dash over the fall had wrenched the child from his teeth He raised himself high up and looked anxiously round for a moment Then he caught sight of a little hand raised above the boiling flood In one moment he had the child again by the hair and just as the prow of the Indian woman s canoe touched the shore he brought the child to land Springing towards him the mother snatched her child from the flood and gazed at its death like face with eyeballs starting from their sockets then she laid her cheek on its cold breast and stood like a statue of despair There was one slight pulsation of the heart and a gentle motion of the hand The child still lived Opening up her blanket she laid her little one against her naked warm bosom drew the covering close around it and sitting down on the bank wept aloud for joy Come come way quick cried Henri hurrying off to hide the emotion which he could not crush down Ay she don t need our help now said Joe following his comrade As for Crusoe he walked along by his master s side with his usual quiet serene look of good will towards all mankind Doubtless a feeling of gladness at having saved a human life filled his shaggy breast for he wagged his tail gently after each shake of his dripping sides but his meek eyes were downcast save when raised to receive the welcome and unusually fervent caress Crusoe did not know that those three men loved him as though he had been a brother On their way back to the village the hunters were met by a little boy who said that a council was to be held immediately and their presence was requested The council was held in the tent of the principal chief towards which all the other chiefs and many of the noted braves hurried Like all Indian councils it was preceded by smoking the medicine pipe and was followed by speeches from several of the best orators The substance of the discourse differed little from what has been already related in reference to the treaty between the Pale faces and upon the whole it was satisfactory But Joe Blunt could not fail to notice that Mahtawa maintained sullen silence during the whole course of the meeting He observed also that there was a considerable change in the tone of the meeting when he informed them that he was bound on a similar errand of peace to several of the other tribes especially to one or two tribes which were the Pawnees bitter enemies at that time These grasping savages having quite made up their minds that they were to obtain the entire contents of the two bales of goods were much mortified on hearing that part was to go to other Indian tribes Some of them even hinted that this would not be allowed and Joe feared at one time that things were going to take an unfavourable turn The hair of his scalp as he afterwards said began to lift a little and feel oneasy But San it sa rish stood honestly to his word said that it would be well that the Pale faces and the Pawnees should be brothers and hoped that they would not forget the promise of annual presents from the hand of the great chief who lived in the big village near the rising sun Having settled this matter amicably Joe distributed among the Indians the proportion of his goods designed for them and then they all adjourned to another tent where a great feast was prepared for them Are ye hungry inquired Joe of Dick as they walked along Ay that am I I feel as if I could eat a buffalo alive Why it s my pinion we ve tasted nothin since daybreak this mornin Well I ve often told ye that them Red skins think it a disgrace to give in eatin till all that s set before them at a feast is bolted We ll ha to stretch oursel s we will I se got a plenty room remarked Henri Ye have but ye ll wish ye had more in a little Bien I not care In a quarter of an hour all the guests invited to this great medicine feast were assembled No women were admitted They never are at Indian feasts We may remark in passing that the word medicine as used among the North American Indians has a very much wider signification than it has with us It is an almost inexplicable word When asked they cannot give a full or satisfactory explanation of it themselves In the general we may say that whatever is mysterious is medicine Jugglery and conjuring of a noisy mysterious and we must add rather silly nature is medicine and the juggler is a medicine man These medicine men undertake cures but they are regular charlatans and know nothing whatever of the diseases they pretend to cure or their remedies They carry bags containing sundry relics these are medicine bags Every brave has his own private medicine bag Everything that is incomprehensible or supposed to be supernatural religious or medical is medicine This feast being an unusual one in honour of strangers and in connection with a peculiar and unexpected event was medicine Even Crusoe since his gallant conduct in saving the Indian child was medicine and Dick Varley s double barrelled rifle which had been an object of wonder ever since his arrival at the village was tremendous medicine Of course the Indians were arrayed in their best several wore necklaces of the claws of the grizzly bear of which they are extremely proud and a gaudily picturesque group they were The chief however had undergone a transformation that well nigh upset the gravity of our hunters and rendered Dick s efforts to look solemn quite abortive San it sa rish had once been to the trading forts of the Pale faces and while there had received the customary gift of a blue surtout with brass buttons and an ordinary hat such as gentlemen wear at home As the coat was a good deal too small for him a terrible length of dark bony wrist appeared below the cuffs The waist was too high and it was with great difficulty that he managed to button the garment across his broad chest Being ignorant of the nature of a hat the worthy savage had allowed the paper and string with which it had been originally covered to remain on supposing them to be part and parcel of the hat and this together with the high collar of the coat which gave him a crushed up appearance the long black naked legs and the painted visage gave to him a tout ensemble which we can compare to nothing as there was nothing in nature comparable to it Those guests who assembled first passed their time in smoking the medicine pipe until the others should arrive for so long as a single invited guest is absent the feast cannot begin Dignified silence was maintained while the pipe thus circulated from hand to hand When the last guest arrived they began The men were seated in two rows face to face Feasts of this kind usually consist of but one species of food and on the present occasion it was an enormous cauldron full of maize which had to be devoured About fifty sat down to eat a quantity of what may be termed thick porridge that would have been ample allowance for a hundred ordinary men Before commencing San it sa rish desired an aged medicine man to make an oration which he did fluently and poetically Its subject was the praise of the giver of the feast At the end of each period there was a general Hou hou of assent equivalent to the hear hear of civilised men Other orators then followed all of whom spoke with great ease and fluency and some in the most impassioned strains working themselves and their audience up to the highest pitch of excitement now shouting with frenzied violence till their eyes glared from their sockets and the veins of their foreheads swelled almost to bursting as they spoke of war and chase anon breaking into soft modulated and pleasing tones while they dilated upon the pleasures of peace and hospitality After these had finished a number of wooden bowls full of maize porridge were put down between the guests one bowl to each couple facing each other But before commencing a portion was laid aside and dedicated to their gods with various mysterious ceremonies for here as in other places where the gospel is not known the poor savages fancied that they could propitiate God with sacrifices They had never heard of the sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite heart This offering being made the feast began in earnest Not only was it a rule in this feast that every mouthful should be swallowed by each guest however unwilling and unable he should be to do so but he who could dispose of it with greatest speed was deemed the greatest man at least on that occasion while the last to conclude his supper was looked upon with some degree of contempt It seems strange that such a custom should ever have arisen and one is not a little puzzled in endeavouring to guess at the origin of it There is one fact that occurs to us as the probable cause The Indian is as we have before hinted frequently reduced to a state bordering on starvation and in a day after he may be burdened with superabundance of food He oftentimes therefore eats as much as he can stuff into his body when he is blessed with plenty so as to be the better able to withstand the attacks of hunger that may possibly be in store for him The amount that an Indian will thus eat at a single meal is incredible He seems to have the power of distending himself for the reception of a quantity that would kill a civilised man Children in particular become like tightly inflated little balloons after a feast and as they wear no clothing the extraordinary rotundity is very obvious not to say ridiculous We conclude therefore that unusual powers of gormandising being useful come at last to be cultivated as praiseworthy By good fortune Dick and Joe Blunt happened to have such enormous gluttons as vis a vis that the portions of their respective bowls which they could not devour were gobbled up for them By good capacity and digestion with no small amount of effort Henri managed to dispose of his own share but he was last of being done and fell in the savages esteem greatly The way in which that sticky compost of boiled maize went down was absolutely amazing The man opposite Dick in particular was a human boa constrictor He well nigh suffocated Dick with suppressed laughter He was a great raw boned savage with a throat of indiarubber and went quickly and quietly on swallowing mass after mass with the solemn gravity of an owl It mattered not a straw to him that Dick took comparatively small mouthfuls and nearly choked on them too for want of liquid to wash them down Had Dick eaten none at all he would have uncomplainingly disposed of the whole Jack the Giant Killer s feats were nothing to his and when at last the bowl was empty he stopped short like a machine from which the steam had been suddenly cut off and laid down his buffalo horn spoon without a sigh Dick sighed though with relief and gratitude when his bowl was empty I hope I may never have to do it again said Joe that night as they wended their way back to the chief s tent after supper I wouldn t be fit for anything for a week arter it Dick could only laugh for any allusion to the feast instantly brought back that owl like gourmand to whom he was so deeply indebted Henri groaned Oh mes boy I am speechless I am ready for bust Oui hah I veesh it vas to morrow Many a time that night did Henri veesh it vas to morrow as he lay helpless on his back looking up through the roof of the chief s tent at the stars and listening enviously to the plethoric snoring of Joe Blunt He was entertained however during those waking hours with a serenade such as few civilised ears ever listen to This was nothing else than a vocal concert performed by all the dogs of the village and as they amounted to nearly two thousand the orchestra was a pretty full one These wretches howled as if they had all gone mad Yet there was method in their madness for they congregated in a crowd before beginning and sat down on their haunches Then one which seemed to be the conductor raised his snout to the sky and uttered a long low melancholy wail The others took it up by twos and threes until the whole pack had their noses pointing to the stars and their throats distended to the uttermost while a prolonged yell filled the air Then it sank gradually one or two bad performers probably making a yelping attempt to get it up again at the wrong time Again the conductor raised his nose and out it came full swing There was no vociferous barking It was simple wolfish howling increased in fervour to an electric yell with slight barks running continuously through it like an obbligato accompaniment When Crusoe first heard the unwonted sound he sprang to his feet bristled up like a hyena showed all his teeth and bounded out of the tent blazing with indignation and astonishment When he found out what it was he returned quite sleek and with a look of profound contempt on his countenance as he resumed his place by his master s side and went to sleep CHAPTER TEN PERPLEXITIES OUR HUNTERS PLAN THEIR ESCAPE UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION THE TABLES TURNED CRUSOE MOUNTS GUARD THE ESCAPE Dick Varley sat before the fire ruminating We do not mean to assert that Dick had been previously eating grass By no means For several days past he had been mentally subsisting on the remarkable things that he heard and saw in the Pawnee village and wondering how he was to get away without being scalped he was now chewing the cud of this intellectual fare We therefore repeat emphatically in case any reader should have presumed to contradict us that Dick Varley sat before the fire ruminating Joe Blunt likewise sat by the fire along with him ruminating too and smoking besides Henri also sat there smoking and looking a little the worse of his late supper I don t like the look o things said Joe blowing a whiff of smoke slowly from his lips and watching it as it ascended into the still air That blackguard Mahtawa is determined not to let us off till he gits all our goods an if he gits them he may as well take our scalps too for we would come poor speed in the prairies without guns horses or goods Dick looked at his friend with an expression of concern What s to be done said he Ve must escape answered Henri but his tone was not a hopeful one for he knew the danger of their position better than Dick Ay we must escape at least we must try said Joe but I ll make one more effort to smooth over San it sa rish an git him to snub that villain Mahtawa Just as he spoke the villain in question entered the tent with a bold haughty air and sat down before the fire in sullen silence For some minutes no one spoke and Henri who happened at the time to be examining the locks of Dick s rifle continued to inspect them with an appearance of careless indifference that he was far from feeling Now this rifle of Dick s had become a source of unceasing wonder to the Indians wonder which was greatly increased by the fact that no one could discharge it but himself Dick had during his short stay at the Pawnee village amused himself and the savages by exhibiting his marvellous powers with the silver rifle Since it had been won by him at the memorable match in the Mustang Valley it had scarce ever been out of his hand so that he had become decidedly the best shot in the settlement could bark squirrels that is hit the bark of the branch on which a squirrel happened to be standing and so kill it by the concussion alone and could drive the nail every shot The silver rifle as we have said became great medicine to the Red men when they saw it kill at a distance which the few wretched guns they had obtained from the fur traders could not even send a spent ball to The double shot too filled them with wonder and admiration but that which they regarded with an almost supernatural feeling of curiosity was the percussion cap which in Dick s hands always exploded but in theirs was utterly useless This result was simply owing to the fact that Dick after firing handed the rifle to the Indians without renewing the cap So that when they loaded and attempted to fire of course it merely snapped When he wished again to fire he adroitly exchanged the old cap for a new one He was immensely tickled by the solemn looks of the Indians at this most incomprehensible of all medicines and kept them for some days in ignorance of the true cause intending to reveal it before he left But circumstances now arose which banished all trifling thoughts from his mind Mahtawa raised his head suddenly and said pointing to the silver rifle Mahtawa wishes to have the two shotted medicine gun He will give his best horse in exchange Mahtawa is liberal answered Joe but the pale faced youth cannot part with it He has far to travel and must shoot buffaloes by the way The pale faced youth shall have a bow and arrows to shoot the buffalo rejoined the Indian He cannot use the bow and arrow answered Joe he has not been trained like the Red man Mahtawa was silent for a few seconds and his dark brows frowned more heavily than ever over his eyes The Pale faces are too bold he exclaimed working himself into a passion they are in the power of Mahtawa If they will not give the gun he will take it He sprang suddenly to his feet as he spoke and snatched the rifle from Henri s hand Henri being ignorant of the language had not been able to understand the foregoing conversation although he saw well enough that it was not an agreeable one but no sooner did he find himself thus rudely and unexpectedly deprived of the rifle than he jumped up wrenched it in a twinkling from the Indian s grasp and hurled him violently out of the tent In a moment Mahtawa drew his knife uttered a savage yell and sprang on the reckless hunter who however caught his wrist and held it as if in a vice The yell brought a dozen warriors instantly to the spot and before Dick had time to recover from his astonishment Henri was surrounded and pinioned despite his herculean struggles Before Dick could move Joe Blunt grasped his arm and whispered quickly Don t rise You can t help him They daren t kill him till San it sa rish agrees Though much surprised Dick obeyed but it required all his efforts both of voice and hand to control Crusoe whose mind was much too honest and straightforward to understand such subtle pieces of diplomacy and who strove to rush to the rescue of his ill used friend When the tumult had partly subsided Joe Blunt rose and said Have the Pawnee braves turned traitors that they draw the knife against those who have smoked with them the pipe of peace and eaten their maize The Pale faces are three the Pawnees are thousands If evil has been done let it be laid before the chief Mahtawa wishes to have the medicine gun Although we said No we could not part with it he tried to take it by force Are we to go back to the great chief of the Pale faces and say that the Pawnees are thieves Are the Pale faces henceforth to tell their children when they steal That is bad that is like the Pawnee No this must not be The rifle shall be restored and we will forget this disagreement Is it not so There was an evident disposition on the part of many of the Indians with whom Mahtawa was no favourite to applaud this speech but the wily chief sprang forward and with flashing eye sought to turn the tables The Pale face speaks with soft words but his heart is false Is he not going to make peace with the enemies of the Pawnee Is he not going to take goods to them and make them gifts and promises The Pale faces are spies They come to see the weakness of the Pawnee camp but they have found that it is strong Shall we suffer the false hearts to escape Shall they live No we will hang their scalps in our wigwams for they have struck a chief and we will keep all their goods for our squaws wah This allusion to keeping all the goods had more effect on the minds of the vacillating savages than the chiefs eloquence But a new turn was given to their thoughts by Joe Blunt remarking in a quiet almost contemptuous tone Mahtawa is not the great chief True true they cried and immediately hurried to the tent of San it sa rish Once again this chief stood between the hunters and the savages who wanted but a signal to fall on them There was a long palaver which ended in Henri being set at liberty and the rifle being restored That evening as the three friends sat beside their fire eating their supper of boiled maize and buffalo meat they laughed and talked as carelessly as ever but the gaiety was assumed for they were at the time planning their escape from a tribe which they foresaw would not long refrain from carrying out their wishes and robbing perhaps murdering them Ye see said Joe with a perplexed air while he drew a piece of live charcoal from the fire with his fingers and lighted his pipe ye see there s more difficulties in the way o gettin off than ye think Oh nivare mind de difficulties interrupted Henri whose wrath at the treatment he had received had not yet cooled down Ve must jump on de best horses ve can git hold shake our fist at de red reptiles and go away fast as ve can De best hoss must vin de race Joe shook his head A hundred arrows would be in our backs before we got twenty yards from the camp Besides we can t tell which are the best horses Our own are the best in my pinion but how are we to git em I know who has charge o them said Dick I saw them grazing near the tent o that poor squaw whose baby was saved by Crusoe Either her husband looks after them or some neighbours That s well said Joe That s one o my difficulties gone What are the others Well d ye see they re troublesome We can t git the horses out o camp without bein seen for the red rascals would see what we were at in a jiffy Then if we do git em out we can t go off without our bales an we needn t think to take em from under the nose o the chief and his squaws without bein axed questions To go off without them would niver do at all Joe said Dick earnestly I ve hit on a plan Have ye Dick what is t Come and I ll let ye see answered Dick rising hastily and quitting the tent followed by his comrades and his faithful dog It may be as well to remark here that no restraint whatever had yet been put on the movements of our hunters as long as they kept to their legs for it was well known that any attempt by men on foot to escape from mounted Indians on the plains would be hopeless Moreover the savages thought that as long as there was a prospect of their being allowed to depart peaceably with their goods they would not be so mad as to fly from the camp and by so doing risk their lives and declare war with their entertainers They had therefore been permitted to wander unchecked as yet far beyond the outskirts of the camp and amuse themselves in paddling about the lake in the small Indian canoes and shooting wild fowl Dick now led the way through the labyrinths of tents in the direction of the lake and they talked and laughed loudly and whistled to Crusoe as they went in order to prevent their purpose being suspected For the purpose of further disarming suspicion they went without their rifles Dick explained his plan by the way and it was at once warmly approved of by his comrades On reaching the lake they launched a small canoe into which Crusoe was ordered to jump then embarking they paddled swiftly to the opposite shore singing a canoe song as they dipped their paddles in the moonlit waters of the lake Arrived at the other side they hauled the canoe up and hurried through the thin belt of wood and willows that intervened between the lake and the prairie Here they paused Is that the bluff Joe No Dick that s too near T other one ll be best Far away to the right It s a little one and there s others near it The sharp eyes o the Red skins won t be so likely to be prowlin there Come on then but we ll have to take down by the lake first In a few minutes the hunters were threading their way through the outskirts of the wood at a rapid trot in the opposite direction from the bluff or wooded knoll which they wished to reach This they did lest prying eyes should have followed them In a quarter of an hour they turned at right angles to their track and struck straight out into the prairie and after a long run they edged round and came in upon the bluff from behind It was merely a collection of stunted but thick growing willows Forcing their way into the centre of this they began to examine it It ll do said Joe De very ting remarked Henri Come here Crusoe Crusoe bounded to his master s side and looked up in his face Look at this place pup smell it well Crusoe instantly set off all round among the willows in and out snuffing everywhere and whining with excitement Come here good pup that will do Now lads we ll go back So saying Dick and his friends left the bluff and retraced their steps to the camp Before they had gone far however Joe halted and said D ye know Dick I doubt if the pup s so cliver as ye think What if he don t quite onderstand ye Dick replied by taking off his cap and throwing it down at the same time exclaiming Take it yonder pup and pointing with his hand towards the bluff The dog seized the cap and went off with it at full speed towards the willows where it left it and came galloping back for the expected reward not now as in days of old a bit of meat but a gentle stroke of its head and a hearty clap on its shaggy side Good pup go now an fetch it Away he went with a bound and in a few seconds came back and deposited the cap at his master s feet Will that do asked Dick triumphantly Ay lad it will The pup s worth its weight in goold Oui I have said and I say it agen de dog is human so him is If not fat am he Without pausing to reply to this perplexing question Dick stepped forward again and in half an hour or so they were back in the camp Now for your part of the work Joe yonder s the squaw that owns the half drowned baby Everything depends on her Dick pointed to the Indian woman as he spoke She was sitting beside her tent and playing at her knee was the identical youngster that had been saved by Crusoe I ll manage it said Joe and walked towards her while Dick and Henri returned to the chiefs tent Does the Pawnee woman thank the Great Spirit that her child is saved began Joe as he came up She does answered the woman looking up at the hunter And her heart is warm to the Pale faces After a short silence Joe continued The Pawnee chiefs do not love the Pale faces Some of them hate them The Dark Flower knows it answered the woman she is sorry She would help the Pale faces if she could This was uttered in a low tone and with a meaning glance of the eye Joe hesitated again could he trust her Yes the feelings that filled her breast and prompted her words were not those of the Indian just now they were those of a mother whose gratitude was too full for utterance Will the Dark Flower said Joe catching the name she had given herself help the Pale face if he opens his heart to her Will she risk the anger of her nation She will replied the woman she will do what she can Joe and his dark friend now dropped their high sounding style of speech and spoke for some minutes rapidly in an undertone It was finally arranged that on a given day at a certain hour the woman should take the four horses down the shores of the lake to its lower end as if she were going for firewood there cross the creek at the ford and drive them to the willow bluff and guard them till the hunters should arrive Having settled this Joe returned to the tent and informed his comrades of his success During the next three days Joe kept the Indians in good humour by giving them one or two trinkets and speaking in glowing terms of the riches of the white men and the readiness with which they would part with them to the savages if they would only make peace Meanwhile during the dark hours of each night Dick managed to abstract small quantities of goods from their pack in room of which he stuffed in pieces of leather to keep up the size and appearance The goods thus taken out he concealed about his person and went off with a careless swagger to the outskirts of the village with Crusoe at his heels Arrived there he tied the goods in a small piece of deerskin and gave the bundle to the dog with the injunction Take it yonder pup Crusoe took it up at once darted off at full speed with the bundle in his mouth down the shore of the lake towards the ford of the river and was soon lost to view In this way little by little the goods were conveyed by the faithful dog to the willow bluff and left there while the stuffed pack still remained in safekeeping in the chief s tent Joe did not at first like the idea of thus sneaking off from the camp and more than once made strong efforts to induce San it sa rish to let him go but even that chief s countenance was not so favourable as it had been It was clear that he could not make up his mind to let slip so good a chance of obtaining guns powder and shot horses and goods without any trouble so Joe made up his mind to give them the slip at once A dark night was chosen for the attempt and the Indian woman went off with the horses to the place where firewood for the camp was usually cut Unfortunately the suspicion of that wily savage Mahtawa had been awakened and he stuck close to the hunters all day not knowing what was going on but feeling convinced that something was brewing which he resolved to watch without mentioning his suspicions to any one I think that villain s away at last whispered Joe to his comrades it s time to go lads the moon won t be up for an hour Come along Have ye got the big powder horn Joe Ay ay all right Stop stop my knife my couteau Ah here it be Now boy The three set off as usual strolling carelessly to the outskirts of the camp then they quickened their pace and gaining the lake pushed off in a small canoe At the same moment Mahtawa stepped from the bushes leaped into another canoe and followed them Hah he must die muttered Henri Not at all said Joe we ll manage him without that The chief landed and strode boldly up to them for he knew well that whatever their purpose might be they would not venture to use their rifles within sound of the camp at that hour of the night as for their knives he could trust to his own active limbs and the woods to escape and give the alarm if need be The Pale faces hunt very late he said with a malicious grin Do they love the dark better than the sunshine Not so replied Joe coolly but we love to walk by the light of the moon It will be up in less than an hour and we mean to take a long ramble to night The Pawnee chief loves to walk by the moon too he will go with the Pale faces Good ejaculated Joe Come along then The party immediately set forward although the savage was a little taken by surprise at the indifferent way in which Joe received his proposal to accompany them He walked on to the edge of the prairie however and then stopped The Pale faces must go alone said he Mahtawa will return to his tent Joe replied to this intimation by seizing him suddenly by the throat and choking back the yell that would otherwise have brought the Pawnee warriors rushing to the scene of action in hundreds Mahtawa s hand was on the handle of his scalping knife in a moment but before he could draw it his arms were glued to his sides by the bear like embrace of Henri while Dick tied a handkerchief quickly yet firmly round his mouth The whole thing was accomplished in two minutes After taking his knife and tomahawk away they loosened their gripe and escorted him swiftly over the prairie Mahtawa was perfectly submissive after the first convulsive struggle was over He knew that the men who walked on each side of him grasping his arms were more than his match singly so he wisely made no resistance Hurrying him to a clump of small trees on the plain which was so far distant from the village that a yell could not be heard they removed the bandage from Mahtawa s mouth Must he be kill inquired Henri in a tone of commiseration Not at all answered Joe we ll tie him to a tree and leave him there Then he vill be starve to deat Oh dat is more horrobell He must take his chance o that I ve no doubt his friends ll find him in a day or two an he s game to last for a week or more But you ll have to run to the willow bluff Dick and bring a bit of line to tie him We can t spare it well but there s no help But there is help retorted Dick Just order the villain to climb into that tree Why so lad Don t ask questions but do what I bid ye The hunter smiled for a moment as he turned to the Indian and ordered him to climb up a small tree near to which he stood Mahtawa looked surprised but there was no alternative Joe s authoritative tone brooked no delay so he sprang into the tree like a monkey Crusoe said Dick watch him The dog sat quietly down at the foot of the tree and fixed his eyes on the savage with a glare that spoke unutterable things At the same time he displayed his full compliment of teeth and uttered a sound like distant thunder Joe almost laughed and Henri did laugh outright Come along he s safe now cried Dick hurrying away in the direction of the willow bluff which they soon reached and found that the faithful squaw had tied their steeds to the bushes and moreover had bundled up their goods into a pack and strapped it on the back of the pack horse but she had not remained with them Bless yer dark face ejaculated Joe as he sprang into the saddle and rode out of the clump of bushes He was followed immediately by the others and in three minutes they were flying over the plain at full speed On gaining the last far off ridge that afforded a distant view of the woods skirting the Pawnee camp they drew up and Dick putting his fingers to his mouth drew a long shrill whistle It reached the willow bluff like a faint echo At the same moment the moon arose and more clearly revealed Crusoe s catalyptic glare at the Indian chief who being utterly unarmed was at the dog s mercy The instant the whistle fell on his ear however he dropped his eyes covered his teeth and leaping through the bushes flew over the plains like an arrow At the same instant Mahtawa descending from his tree ran as fast as he could towards the village uttering the terrible war whoop when near enough to be heard No sound sends such a thrill through an Indian camp Every warrior flew to arms and vaulted on his steed So quickly was the alarm given that in less than ten minutes a thousand hoofs were thundering on the plain and faintly reached the ears of the fugitives Joe smiled It ll puzzle them to come up wi nags like ours They re in prime condition too lots o wind in em If we only keep out o badger holes we may laugh at the red varmints Joe s opinion of Indian horses was correct In a very few minutes the sound of hoofs died away but the fugitives did not draw bridle during the remainder of that night for they knew not how long the pursuit might be continued By pond and brook and bluff they passed down in the grassy bottoms and over the prairie waves nor checked their headlong course till the sun blazed over the level sweep of the eastern plain as if it arose out of the mighty ocean Then they sprang from the saddle and hastily set about the preparation of their morning meal CHAPTER ELEVEN EVENING MEDITATIONS AND MORNING REFLECTIONS BUFFALOES BADGERS ANTELOPES AND ACCIDENTS AN OLD BULL AND THE WOLVES MAD TAILS HENRI FLOORED ETCETERA There is nothing that prepares one so well for the enjoyment of rest both mental and physical as a long protracted period of excitement and anxiety followed up by bodily fatigue Excitement alone banishes rest but united with severe physical exertion it prepares for it At least courteous reader this is our experience and certainly this was the experience of our three hunters as they lay on their backs beneath the branches of a willow bush and gazed serenely up at the twinkling stars two days after their escape from the Indian village They spoke little they were too tired for that also they were too comfortable Their respective suppers of fresh antelope steak shot that day had just been disposed of their feet were directed towards the small fire on which the said steaks had been cooked and which still threw a warm ruddy glow over the encampment Their blankets were wrapped comfortably round them and tucked in as only hunters and mothers know how to tuck them in Their respective pipes delivered forth at stated intervals three richly yellow puffs of smoke as if a three gun battery were playing upon the sky from that particular spot of earth The horses were picketted and hobbled in a rich grassy bottom close by from which the quiet munch of their equine jaws sounded pleasantly for it told of healthy appetites and promised speed on the morrow The fear of being overtaken during the night was now past and the faithful Crusoe by virtue of sight hearing and smell guaranteed them against sudden attack during the hours of slumber A perfume of wild flowers mingled with the loved odours of the weed and the tinkle of a tiny rivulet fell sweetly on their ears In short the Pale faces were supremely happy and disposed to be thankful for their recent deliverance and their present comforts I wonder what the stars are said Dick languidly taking the pipe out of his mouth Bits o fire suggested Joe I tink dey are vorlds muttered Henri an have peepels in dem I have hear men say dat A long silence followed during which no doubt the star gazers were working out various theories in their own minds Wonder said Dick again how far off they be A mile or two maybe said Joe Henri was about to laugh sarcastically at this but on further consideration he thought it would be more comfortable not to so he lay still In another minute he said Joe Blunt you is ver igrant Don t you know dat de books say de stars be hondreds tousands oh milleryons of mile away to here and dat de is more bigger dan dis vorld Joe snored lightly and his pipe fell out of his mouth at this point so the conversation dropped Presently Dick asked in a low tone I say Henri are ye asleep Oui replied Henri faintly Don t speak or you vill vaken me Ah Crusoe you re not asleep are you pup No need to ask that question The instantaneous wag of that speaking fail and the glance of that wakeful eye as the dog lifted his head and laid his chin on Dick s arm showed that he had been listening to every word that was spoken We cannot say whether he understood it but beyond all doubt he heard it Crusoe never presumed to think of going to sleep until his master was as sound as a top then he ventured to indulge in that light species of slumber which is familiarly known as sleeping with one eye open But comparatively as well as figuratively speaking Crusoe slept usually with one eye and a half open and the other half was never very tightly shut Gradually Dick s pipe fell out of his mouth an event which the dog with an exercise of instinct almost if not quite amounting to reason regarded as a signal for him to go off The campfire went slowly out the stars twinkled down at their reflections in the brook and a deep breathing of wearied men was the only sound that rose in harmony with the purling stream Before the sun rose next morning and while many of the brighter stars were still struggling for existence with the approaching day Joe was up and buckling on the saddle bags while he shouted to his unwilling companions to rise If it depended on you he said the Pawnees wouldn t be long afore they got our scalps Jump ye dogs an lend a hand will ye A snore from Dick and a deep sigh from Henri was the answer to this pathetic appeal It so happened however that Henri s pipe in falling from his lips had emptied the ashes just under his nose so that the sigh referred to drew a quantity thereof into his throat and almost choked him Nothing could have been a more effective awakener He was up in a moment coughing vociferously Most men have a tendency to vent ill humour on some one and they generally do it on one whom they deem to be worse than themselves Henri therefore instead of growling at Joe for rousing him scolded Dick for not rising Ha mauvais dog bad chien vill you dare to look to me Crusoe did look with amiable placidity as though to say Howl away old boy I won t budge till Dick does With a mighty effort Giant Sleep was thrown off at last and the hunters were once more on their journey cantering lightly over the soft turf Ho let s have a run cried Dick unable to repress the feelings aroused by the exhilarating morning air Have a care boy cried Joe as they stretched out at full gallop Keep off the ridge it s riddled wi badger Hah I thought so At that moment Dick s horse put its foot into a badger hole and turned completely over sending its rider through the air in a curve that an East Indian acrobat would have envied For a few seconds Dick lay flat on his back then he jumped up and laughed while his comrades hurried up anxiously to his assistance No bones broke inquired Joe Dick gave a hysterical gasp I I think not Let s have a look No nothin to speak o be good luck Ye should niver go slap through a badger country like that boy always keep i the bottoms where the grass is short Now then up ye go That s it Dick remounted though not with quite so elastic a spring as usual and they pushed forward at a more reasonable pace Accidents of this kind are of common occurrence in the prairies Some horses however are so well trained that they look sharp out for these holes which are generally found to be most numerous on the high and dry grounds But in spite of all the caution both of man and horse many ugly falls take place and sometimes bones are broken They had not gone far after this accident when an antelope leaped from a clump of willows and made for a belt of woodland that lay along the margin of a stream not half a mile off Hurrah cried Dick forgetting his recent fall Come along Crusoe And away they went again full tilt for the horse had not been injured by its somersault The antelope which Dick was thus wildly pursuing was of the same species as the one he had shot some time before namely the prong horned antelope These graceful creatures have long slender limbs delicately formed heads and large beautiful eyes The horns are black and rather short they have no branches like the antlers of the red deer but have a single projection on each horn near the head and the extreme points of the horns curve suddenly inwards forming the hook or prong from which the name of the animal is derived Their colour is dark yellowish brown They are so fleet that not one horse in a hundred can overtake them and their sight and sense of smell are so acute that it would be next to impossible to kill them were it not for the inordinate curiosity which we have before referred to The Indians manage to attract these simple little creatures by merely lying down on their backs and kicking their heels in the air or by waving any white object on the point of an arrow while the hunter keeps concealed by lying flat in the grass By these means a herd of antelopes may be induced to wheel round and round an object in timid but intense surprise gradually approaching until they come near enough to enable the hunter to make sure of his mark Thus the animals which of all others ought to be the most difficult to slay are in consequence of their insatiable curiosity more easily shot than any other deer of the plains May we not gently suggest to the reader for his or her consideration that there are human antelopes so to speak whose case bears a striking resemblance to the prong horn of the North American prairie Dick s horse was no match for the antelope neither was Crusoe so they pulled up shortly and returned to their companions to be laughed at It s no manner o use to wind yer horse lad after sich game They re not much worth an if I mistake not we ll be among the buffalo soon There s fresh tracks everywhere and the herds are scattered now Ye see when they keep together in bands o thousands ye don t so often fall in wi them But when they scatters about in twos an threes an sixes ye may shoot them every day as much as ye please Several groups of buffalo had already been seen on the horizon but as a red deer had been shot in a belt of woodland the day before they did not pursue them The red deer is very much larger than the prong horned antelope and is highly esteemed both for its flesh and its skin which latter becomes almost like chamois leather when dressed Notwithstanding this supply of food the hunters could not resist the temptation to give chase to a herd of about nine buffaloes that suddenly came into view as they overtopped an undulation in the plain It s no use cried Dick I must go at them Joe himself caught fire from the spirit of his young friend so calling to Henri to come on and let the pack horse remain to feed he dashed away in pursuit The buffaloes gave one stare of surprise and then fled as fast as possible At first it seemed as if such huge unwieldy carcases could not run very fast but in a few minutes they managed to get up a pace that put the horses to their mettle Indeed at first it seemed as if the hunters did not gain an inch but by degrees they closed with them for buffaloes are not long winded On nearing the herd the three men diverged from each other and selected their animals Henri being short sighted naturally singled out the largest and the largest also naturally was a tough old bull Joe brought down a fat young cow at the first shot and Dick was equally fortunate But he well nigh shot Crusoe who just as he was about to fire rushed in unexpectedly and sprang at the animal s throat for which piece of recklessness he was ordered back to watch the pack horse Meanwhile Henri by dint of yelling throwing his arms wildly about and digging his heels into the sides of his long legged horse succeeded in coming close up with the bull which once or twice turned his clumsy body half round and glared furiously at its pursuer with its small black eyes Suddenly it stuck out its tail stopped short and turned full round Henri stopped short also Now the sticking out of a buffalo s tail has a peculiar significance which it is well to point out It serves in a sense the same purpose to the hunter that the compass does to the mariner it points out where to go and what to do When galloping away in ordinary flight the buffalo carries his tail like ordinary cattle which indicates that you may push on When wounded he lashes it from side to side or carries it over his back up in the air this indicates Look out haul off a bit But when he carries it stiff and horizontal with a slight curve in the middle of it it says plainly Keep back or kill me as quick as you can for that is what Indians call the mad lazy and is a sign that mischief is brewing Henri s bull displayed the mad tail just before turning but he didn t observe it and accordingly waited for the bull to move and show his shoulder for a favourable shot But instead of doing this he put his head down and foaming with rage went at him full tilt The big horse never stirred it seemed to be petrified Henri had just time to fire at the monster s neck and the next moment was sprawling on his back with the horse rolling over four or five yards beyond him It was a most effective tableau Henri rubbing his shins and grinning with pain the horse gazing in affright as he rose trembling from the plain and the buffalo bull looking on half stunned and evidently very much surprised at the result of his charge Fortunately before he could repeat the experiment Dick galloped up and put a ball through his heart Joe and his comrades felt a little ashamed of their exploit on this occasion for there was no need to have killed three animals they could not have carried with them more than a small portion of one and they upbraided themselves several times during the operation of cutting out the tongues and other choice portions of the two victims As for the bull he was almost totally useless so they left him as a gift to the wolves Now that they had come among the buffalo wolves were often seen sneaking about and licking their hungry jaws but although they approached pretty near to the camp at nights they did not give the hunters any concern Even Crusoe became accustomed to them at last and ceased to notice them These creatures are very dangerous sometimes however and when hard pressed by hunger will even attack man The day after this hunt the travellers came upon a wounded old buffalo which had evidently escaped from the Indians for a couple of arrows were sticking in its side only to fall a prey to his deadly enemies the white wolves These savage brutes hang on the skirts of the herds of buffaloes to attack and devour any one that may chance from old age or from being wounded to linger behind the rest The buffalo is tough and fierce however and fights so desperately that although surrounded by fifty or a hundred wolves he keeps up the unequal combat for several days before he finally succumbs The old bull that our travellers discovered had evidently been long engaged with his ferocious adversaries for his limbs and flesh were torn in shreds in many places and blood was streaming from his sides Yet he had fought so gallantly that he had tossed and stamped to death dozens of the enemy There could not have been fewer than fifty wolves round him and they had just concluded another of many futile attacks when the hunters came up for they were ranged in a circle round their huge adversary some lying down some sitting on their haunches to rest and others sneaking about lolling out their red tongues and licking their chops as if impatient to renew the combat The poor buffalo was nearly spent and it was clear that a few hours more would see him torn to shreds and his bones picked clean Ugh de brutes ejaculated Henri They don t seem to mind us a bit remarked Dick as they rode up to within pistol shot It ll be merciful to give the old fellow a shot said Joe Them varmits are sure to finish him at last Joe raised his rifle as he spoke and fired The old bull gave his last groan and fell while the wolves alarmed by the shot fled in all directions but they did not run far They knew well that some portion at least of the carcase would fall to their share so they sat down at various distances all round to wait as patiently as they might for the hunters to retire Dick left the scene with a feeling of regret that the villanous wolves should have their feast so much sooner than they expected Yet after all why should we call these wolves villanous They did nothing wrong nothing contrary to the laws of their peculiar nature Nay if we come to reason upon it they rank higher in this matter than man for while the wolf does no violence to the laws of its instincts man often deliberately silences the voice of conscience and violates the laws of his own nature But we will not insist on the term good reader if you object strongly to it We are willing to admit that the wolves are not villanous but assuredly they are unlovable In the course of the afternoon the three horsemen reached a small creek the banks of which were lined with a few stunted shrubs and trees Having eaten nothing since the night before they dismounted here to feed as Joe expressed it Cur ous thing remarked Joe as he struck a light by means of flint steel and tinder box curious thing that we re made to need sich a lot o grub If we could only get on like the sarpints now wot can breakfast on a rabbit and then wait a month or two for dinner Ain t it cur ous Dick admitted that it was and stooped to blow the fire into a blaze Here Henri uttered a cry of consternation and stood speechless with his mouth open What s the matter what is t cried Dick and Joe seizing their rifles instinctively De grub him be forgat There was a look of blank horror and then a burst of laughter from Dick Varley Well well cried he we ve got lots o tea an sugar an some flour we can git on wi that till we shoot another buffalo or a ha Dick observed a wild turkey stalking among the willows as he spoke It was fully a hundred yards off and only its head was seen above the leaves This was a matter of little moment however for by aiming a little lower he knew that he must hit the body but Dick had driven the nail too often to aim at its body he aimed at the bird s eye and cut its head off Fetch it Crusoe In three minutes it was at Dick s feet and it is not too much to say that in five minutes more it was in the pot As this unexpected supply made up for the loss of the meat which Henri had forgotten at their last halting place their equanimity was restored and while the meal was in preparation Dick shouldered his rifle and went into the bush to try for another turkey He did not get one however but he shot a couple of prairie hens which are excellent eating Moreover he found a large quantity of wild grapes and plums These were unfortunately not nearly ripe but Dick resolved to try his hand at a new dish so he stuffed the breast of his coat full of them After the pot was emptied Dick washed it out and put a little clean water in it Then he poured some flour in and stirred it well While this was heating he squeezed the sour grapes and plums into what Joe called a mush mixed it with a spoonful of sugar and emptied it into the pot He also skimmed a quantity of the fat from the remains of the turkey soup and added that to the mess which he stirred with earnest diligence till it boiled down into a sort of thick porridge D ye think it ll be good asked Joe gravely I ve me doubts of it We ll see Hold the tin dish Henri Take care of de fingers Ha it looks magnifique superb The first spoonful produced an expression on Henri s face that needed not to be interpreted It was as sour as vinegar Ye ll ha to eat it yerself Dick lad cried Joe throwing down his spoon and spitting out the unsavoury mess Nonsense cried Dick bolting two or three mouthfuls and trying to look as if he liked it Try again it s not so bad as you think Ho o o o o cried Henri after the second mouthful Tis vinaigre All de sugare in de pack would not make more sweeter one bite of it Dick was obliged to confess the dish a failure so it was thrown out after having been offered to Crusoe who gave it one sniff and turned away in silence Then they mounted and resumed their journey At this place mosquitoes and horse flies troubled our hunters and their steeds a good deal The latter especially were very annoying to the poor horses They bit them so much that the blood at last came trickling down their sides They were troubled also once or twice by cockchafers and locusts which annoyed them not indeed by biting but by flying blindly against their faces and often narrowly missed hitting them in the eyes Once particularly they were so bad that Henri in his wrath opened his lips to pronounce a malediction on the whole race when a cockchafer flew straight into his mouth and to use his own forcible expression nearly knocked him off de hoss But these were minor evils and scarcely cost the hunters a thought CHAPTER TWELVE WANDERINGS ON THE PRAIRIE A WAR PARTY CHASED BY INDIANS A BOLD LEAP FOR LIFE For many days the three hunters wandered over the trackless prairie in search of a village of the Sioux Indians but failed to find one for the Indians were in the habit of shifting their ground and following the buffalo Several times they saw small isolated bands of Indians but these they carefully avoided fearing they might turn out to be war parties and if they fell into their hands the white men could not expect civil treatment whatever nation the Indians might belong to During the greater portion of this time they met with numerous herds of buffalo and deer and were well supplied with food but they had to cook it during the day being afraid to light a fire at night while Indians were prowling about One night they halted near the bed of a stream which was almost dry They had travelled a day and a night without water and both men and horses were almost choking so that when they saw the trees on the horizon which indicated the presence of a stream they pushed forward with almost frantic haste Hope it s not dry said Joe anxiously as they galloped up to it No there s water lads and they dashed forward to a pool that had not yet been dried up They drank long and eagerly before they noticed that the pool was strongly impregnated with salt Many streams in those parts of the prairies are quite salt but fortunately this one was not utterly undrinkable though it was very unpalatable We ll make it better lads said Joe digging a deep hole in the sand with his hands a little below the pool In a short time the water filtered through and though not rendered fresh it was nevertheless much improved We may light a fire to night d ye think inquired Dick we ve not seed Injuns for some days Pr aps twould be better not said Joe but I daresay we re safe enough A fire was therefore lighted in as sheltered a spot as could be found and the three friends bivouacked as usual Towards dawn they were aroused by an angry growl from Crusoe It s a wolf likely said Dick but all three seized and cocked their rifles nevertheless Again Crusoe growled more angrily than before and springing out of the camp snuffed the breeze anxiously Up lads catch the nags There s something in the wind for the dog niver did that afore In a few seconds the horses were saddled and the packs secured Call in the dog whispered Joe Blunt if he barks they ll find out our whereabouts Here Crusoe come It was too late the dog barked loudly and savagely at the moment and a troop of Indians came coursing over the plain On hearing the unwonted sound they wheeled directly and made for the camp It s a war party fly lads nothin ll save our scalps now but our horses heels cried Joe In a moment they vaulted into the saddle and urged their steeds forward at the utmost speed The savages observed them and with an exulting yell dashed after them Feeling that there was now no need of concealment the three horsemen struck off into the open prairie intending to depend entirely on the speed and stamina of their horses As we have before remarked they were good ones but the Indians soon proved that they were equally well if not better mounted It ll be a hard run said Joe in a low muttering tone and looking furtively over his shoulder The varmints are mounted on wild horses leastways they were wild not long agone Them chaps can throw the lasso and trip a mustang as well as a Mexican Mind the badger holes Dick Hold in a bit Henri yer nag don t need drivin a foot in a hole just now would cost us our scalps Keep down by the creek lads Hah how dey yell said Henri in a savage tone looking back and shaking his rifle at them an act that caused them to yell more fiercely than ever Dis old pack hoss give me moche trobel The pace was now tremendous Pursuers and pursued rose and sank on the prairie billows as they swept along till they came to what is termed a dividing ridge which is a cross wave as it were which cuts the others in two thus forming a continuous level Here they advanced more easily but the advantage was equally shared with their pursuers who continued the headlong pursuit with occasional yells which served to show the fugitives that they at least did not gain ground A little to the right of the direction in which they were flying a blue line was seen on the horizon This indicated the existence of trees to Joe s practised eyes and feeling that if the horses broke down they could better make a last manful stand in the wood than on the plain he urged his steed towards it The savages noticed the movement at once and uttered a yell of exultation for they regarded it as an evidence that the fugitives doubted the strength of their horses Ye haven t got us yet muttered Joe with a sardonic grin If they get near us Dick keep yer eyes open an look out for yer neck else they ll drop a noose over it they will afore ye know they re near an haul ye off like a sack Dick nodded in reply but did not speak for at that moment his eye was fixed on a small creek ahead which they must necessarily leap or dash across It was lined with clumps of scattered shrubbery and he glanced rapidly for the most suitable place to pass Joe and Henri did the same and having diverged a little to the different points chosen they dashed through the shrubbery and were hid from each other s view On approaching the edge of the stream Dick found to his consternation that the bank was twenty feet high opposite him and too wide for any horse to clear Wheeling aside without checking speed at the risk of throwing his steed he rode along the margin of the stream for a few hundred yards until he found a ford at least such a spot as might be cleared by a bold leap The temporary check however had enabled an Indian to gain so close upon his heels that his exulting yell sounded close in his ear With a vigorous bound his gallant little horse went over Crusoe could not take it but he rushed down the one bank and up the other so that he only lost a few yards These few yards however were sufficient to bring the Indian close upon him as he cleared the stream at full gallop The savage whirled his lasso swiftly round for a second and in another moment Crusoe uttered a tremendous roar as he was tripped up violently on the plain Dick heard the cry of his faithful dog and turned quickly round just in time to see him spring at the horse s throat and bring both steed and rider down upon him Dick s heart leaped to his throat Had a thousand savages been rushing on him he would have flown to the rescue of his favourite but an unexpected obstacle came in the way His fiery little steed excited by the headlong race and the howls of the Indians had taken the bit in his teeth and was now unmanageable He tore at the reins like a maniac and in the height of his frenzy even raised the butt of his rifle with the intent to strike the poor horse to the earth but his better nature prevailed He checked the uplifted hand and with a groan dropped the reins and sank almost helplessly forward on the saddle for several of the Indians had left the main body and were pursuing him alone so that there would have been now no chance of his reaching the place where Crusoe fell even if he could have turned his horse Spiritless and utterly indifferent to what his fate might be Dick Varley rode along with his head drooping and keeping his seat almost mechanically while the mettlesome little steed flew on over wave and hollow Gradually he awakened from this state of despair to a sense of danger Glancing round he observed that the Indians were now far behind him though still pursuing He also observed that his companions were galloping miles away on the horizon to the left and that he had foolishly allowed the savages to get between him and them The only chance that remained for him was to outride his pursuers and circle round towards his comrades and this he hoped to accomplish for his little horse had now proved itself to be superior to those of the Indians and there was good running in him still Urging him forward therefore he soon left the savages still further behind and feeling confident that they could not now overtake him he reined up and dismounted The pursuers quickly drew near but short though it was the rest did his horse good Vaulting into the saddle he again stretched out and now skirted along the margin of a wood which seemed to mark the position of a river of considerable size At this moment his horse put his foot into a badger hole and both of them came heavily to the ground In an instant Dick rose picked up his gun and leaped unhurt into the saddle But on urging his poor horse forward he found that its shoulder was badly sprained There was no room for mercy however life and death were in the balance so he plied the lash vigorously and the noble steed warmed into something like a run when again it stumbled and fell with a crash on the ground while the blood burst from its mouth and nostrils Dick could hear the shout of triumph uttered by his pursuers My poor poor horse he exclaimed in a tone of the deepest commiseration while he stooped and stroked its foam studded neck The dying steed raised his head for a moment it almost seemed as if to acknowledge the tones of affection then it sank down with a gurgling groan Dick sprang up for the Indians were now upon him and bounded like an antelope into the thickest of the shrubbery which was nowhere thick enough however to prevent the Indians following Still it sufficiently retarded them to render the chase a more equal one than could have been expected In a few minutes Dick gained a strip of open ground beyond and found himself on the bank of a broad river whose evidently deep waters rushed impetuously along their unobstructed channel The bank at the spot where he reached it was a sheer precipice of between thirty and forty feet high Glancing up and down the river he retreated a few paces turned round and shook his clenched fist at the savages accompanying the action with a shout of defiance and then running to the edge of the bank sprang far out into the boiling flood and sank The Indians pulled up on reaching the spot There was no possibility of galloping down the wood encumbered banks after the fugitive but quick as thought each Red man leaped to the ground and fitting an arrow to his bow awaited Dick s re appearance with eager gaze Young though he was and unskilled in such wild warfare Dick knew well enough what sort of reception he would meet with on coming to the surface so he kept under water as long as he could and struck out as vigorously as the care of his rifle would permit At last he rose for a few seconds and immediately half a dozen arrows whizzed through the air but most of them fell short only one passed close to his cheek and went with a whip into the river He immediately sank again and the next time he rose to breathe he was far beyond the reach of his Indian enemies CHAPTER THIRTEEN ESCAPE FROM INDIANS A DISCOVERY ALONE IN THE DESERT Dick Varley had spent so much of his boyhood in sporting about among the waters of the rivers and lakes near which he had been reared and especially during the last two years had spent so much of his leisure time in rolling and diving with his dog Crusoe in the lake of the Mustang Valley that he had become almost as expert in the water as a south sea islander so that when he found himself whirling down the rapid river as already described he was more impressed with a feeling of gratitude to God for his escape from the Indians than anxiety about getting ashore He was not altogether blind or indifferent to the danger into which he might be hurled if the channel of the river should be found lower down to be broken with rocks or should a waterfall unexpectedly appear After floating down a sufficient distance to render pursuit out of the question he struck in to the bank opposite to that from which he had plunged and clambering up to the green sward above stripped off the greater part of his clothing and hung it on the branches of a bush to dry Then he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree to consider what course he had best pursue in his present circumstances These circumstances were by no means calculated to inspire him with hope or comfort He was in the midst of an unknown wilderness hundreds of miles from any white man s settlement surrounded by savages without food or blanket his companions gone he knew not whither perhaps taken and killed by the Indians his horse dead and his dog the most trusty and loving of all his friends lost to him probably for ever A more veteran heart might have quailed in the midst of such accumulated evils but Dick Varley possessed a strong young and buoyant constitution which united with a hopefulness of disposition that almost nothing could overcome enabled him very quickly to cast aside the gloomy view of his case and turn to its brighter aspects He still grasped his good rifle that was some comfort and as his eye fell upon it he turned with anxiety to examine into the condition of his powder horn and the few things that he had been fortunate enough to carry away with him about his person The horn in which western hunters carry their powder is usually that of an ox It is closed up at the large end with a piece of hard wood fitted tightly into it and the small end is closed with a wooden peg or stopper It is therefore completely water tight and may be for hours immersed without the powder getting wet unless the stopper should chance to be knocked out Dick found to his great satisfaction that the stopper was fast and the powder perfectly dry Moreover he had by good fortune filled it full two days before from the package that contained the general stock of ammunition so that there were only two or three charges out of it His percussion caps however were completely destroyed and even though they had not been it would have mattered little for he did not possess more than half a dozen But this was not so great a misfortune as at first it might seem for he had the spare flint locks and the little screw driver necessary for fixing and unfixing them stowed away in his shot pouch To examine his supply of bullets was his next care and slowly he counted them out one by one to the number of thirty This was a pretty fair supply and with careful economy would last him many days Having relieved his mind on these all important points he carefully examined every pouch and corner of his dress to ascertain the exact amount and value of his wealth Besides the leather leggings moccasins deerskin hunting shirt cap and belt which composed his costume he had a short heavy hunting knife a piece of tinder a little tin pannikin which he had been in the habit of carrying at his belt and a large cake of maple sugar This last is a species of sugar which is procured by the Indians from the maple tree Several cakes of it had been carried off from the Pawnee village and Dick usually carried one in the breast of his coat Besides these things he found that the little Bible for which his mother had made a small inside breast pocket was safe Dick s heart smote him when he took it out and undid the clasp for he had not looked at it until that day It was firmly bound with a brass clasp so that although the binding and edges of the leaves were soaked the inside was quite dry On opening the book to see if it had been damaged a small paper fell out Picking it up quickly he unfolded it and read in his mother s handwriting Call upon me in the time of trouble and I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me My son give me thine heart Dick s eyes filled with tears while the sound as it were of his mother s voice thus reached him unexpectedly in that lonely wilderness Like too many whose hearts are young and gay Dick had regarded religion if not as a gloomy at least as not a cheerful thing But he felt the comfort of these words at that moment and he resolved seriously to peruse his mother s parting gift in time to come The sun was hot and a warm breeze gently shook the leaves so that Dick s garments were soon dry A few minutes served to change the locks of his rifle draw the wet charges dry out the barrels and re load Then throwing it across his shoulder he entered the wood and walked lightly away And well he might poor fellow for at that moment he felt light enough in person if not in heart His worldly goods were not such as to oppress him but the little note had turned his thoughts towards home and he felt comforted Traversing the belt of woodland that marked the course of the river Dick soon emerged on the wide prairie beyond and here he paused in some uncertainty as to how he should proceed He was too good a backwoodsman albeit so young to feel perplexed as to the points of the compass He knew pretty well what hour it was so that the sun showed him the general bearings of the country and he knew that when night came he could correct his course by the pole star Dick s knowledge of astronomy was limited he knew only one star by name but that one was an inestimable treasure of knowledge His perplexity was owing to his uncertainty as to the direction in which his companions and their pursuers had gone for he had made up his mind to follow their trail if possible and render all the succour his single arm might afford To desert them and make for the settlement he held would be a faithless and cowardly act While they were together Joe Blunt had often talked to him about the route he meant to pursue to the Rocky Mountains so that if they had escaped the Indians he thought there might be some chance of finding them at last But to set against this there was the probability that they had been taken and carried away in a totally different direction or they might have taken to the river as he had done and gone further down without his observing them Then again if they had escaped they would be sure to return and search the country round for him so that if he left the spot he might miss them Oh for my dear pup Crusoe he exclaimed aloud in this dilemma but the faithful ear was shut now and the deep silence that followed his cry was so oppressive that the young hunter sprang forward at a run over the plain as if to fly from solitude He soon became so absorbed however in his efforts to find the trail of his companions that he forgot all other considerations and ran straight forward for hours together with his eyes eagerly fixed on the ground At last he felt so hungry having tasted no food since supper time the previous evening that he halted for the purpose of eating a morsel of maple sugar A line of bushes in the distance indicated water so he sped on again and was soon seated beneath a willow drinking water from the cool stream No game was to be found here but there were several kinds of berries among which wild grapes and plums grew in abundance With these and some sugar he made a meal though not a good one for the berries were quite green and intensely sour All that day Dick Varley followed up the trail of his companions which he discovered at a ford in the river They had crossed therefore in safety though still pursued so he ran on at a regular trot and with a little more hope than he had felt during the day Towards night however Dick s heart sank again for he came upon innumerable buffalo tracks among which those of the horses soon became mingled up so that he lost them altogether Hoping to find them again more easily by broad daylight he went to the nearest clump of willows he could find and encamped for the night Remembering the use formerly made of the tall willows he set to work to construct a covering to protect him from the dew As he had no blanket or buffalo skin he used leaves and grass instead and found it a better shelter than he had expected especially when the fire was lighted and a pannikin of hot sugar and water smoked at his feet but as no game was to be found he was again compelled to sup off unripe berries Before lying down to rest he remembered his resolution and pulling out the little Bible read a portion of it by the fitful blaze of the fire and felt great comfort in its blessed words It seemed to him like a friend with whom he could converse in the midst of his loneliness The plunge into the river having broken Dick s pipe and destroyed his tobacco he now felt the want of that luxury very severely and never having wanted it before he was greatly surprised to find how much he had become enslaved to the habit It cost him more than an hour s rest that night the craving for his wonted pipe The sagacious reader will doubtless not fail here to ask himself the question whether it is wise in man to create in himself an unnatural and totally unnecessary appetite which may and often does entail hours ay sometimes months of exceeding discomfort but we would not for a moment presume to suggest such a question to him We have a distinct objection to the ordinary method of what is called drawing a moral It is much better to leave wise men to do this for themselves Next morning Dick rose with the sun and started without breakfast preferring to take his chance of finding a bird or animal of some kind before long to feeding again on sour berries He was disappointed however in finding the tracks of his companions The ground here was hard and sandy so that little or no impression of a distinct kind was made on it and as buffaloes had traversed it in all directions he was soon utterly bewildered He thought it possible that by running out for several miles in a straight line and then taking a wide circuit round he might find the tracks emerging from the confusion made by the buffaloes But he was again disappointed for the buffalo tracks still continued and the ground became less capable of showing a footprint Soon Dick began to feel so ill and weak from eating such poor fare that he gave up all hope of discovering the tracks and was compelled to push forward at his utmost speed in order to reach a less barren district where he might procure fresh meat but the further he advanced the worse and more sandy did the district become For several days he pushed on over this arid waste without seeing bird or beast and to add to his misery he failed at last to find water For a day and a night he wandered about in a burning fever and his throat so parched that he was almost suffocated Towards the close of the second day he saw a slight line of bushes away down in a hollow on his right With eager steps he staggered towards them and on drawing near beheld blessed sight a stream of water glancing in the beams of the setting sun Dick tried to shout for joy but his parched throat refused to give utterance to the voice It mattered not exerting all his remaining strength he rushed down the bank dropped his rifle and plunged head foremost into the stream The first mouthful sent a thrill of horror to his heart it was salt as brine The poor youth s cup of bitterness was now full to overflowing Crawling out of the stream he sank down on the bank in a species of lethargic torpor from which he awakened next morning in a raging fever Delirium soon rendered him insensible to his sufferings The sun rose like a ball of fire and shone down with scorching power on the arid plain What mattered it to Dick He was far away in the shady groves of the Mustang Valley chasing the deer at times but more frequently cooling his limbs and sporting with Crusoe in the bright blue lake Now he was in his mother s cottage telling her how he had thought of her when far away on the prairie and what a bright sweet word it was she had whispered in his ear so unexpectedly too Anon he was scouring over the plains on horseback with the savages at his heels and at such times Dick would spring with almost supernatural strength from the ground and run madly over the burning plain but as if by a species of fascination he always returned to the salt river and sank exhausted by its side or plunged helplessly into its waters These sudden immersions usually restored him for a short time to reason and he would crawl up the bank and gnaw a morsel of the maple sugar but he could not eat much for it was in a tough compact cake which his jaws had not power to break All that day and the next night he lay on the banks of the salt stream or rushed wildly over the plain It was about noon of the second day after his attack that he crept slowly out of the water into which he had plunged a few seconds before His mind was restored but he felt an indescribable sensation of weakness that seemed to him to be the approach of death Creeping towards the place where his rifle lay he fell exhausted beside it and laid his cheek on the Bible which had fallen out of his pocket there While his eyes were closed in a dreamy sort of half waking slumber he felt the rough hairy coat of an animal brush against his forehead The idea of being torn to pieces by wolves flashed instantly across his mind and with a shriek of terror he sprang up to be almost overwhelmed by the caresses of his faithful dog Yes there he was bounding round his master barking and whining and giving vent to every possible expression of canine joy CHAPTER FOURTEEN CRUSOE S RETURN AND HIS PRIVATE ADVENTURES AMONG THE INDIANS DICK AT A VERY LOW EBB CRUSOE SAVES HIM The means by which Crusoe managed to escape from his two legged captors and rejoin his master requires separate and special notice In the struggle with the fallen horse and Indian which Dick had seen begun but not concluded he was almost crushed to death and the instant the Indian gained his feet he sent an arrow at his head with savage violence Crusoe however had been so well used to dodging the blunt headed arrows that were wont to be shot at him by the boys of the Mustang Valley that he was quite prepared and eluded the shaft by an active bound Moreover he uttered one of his own peculiar roars flew at the Indian s throat and dragged him down At the same moment the other Indians came up and one of them turned aside to the rescue This man happened to have an old gun of the cheap sort at that time exchanged for peltries by the fur traders 
1901-147822-0000	train-other-500	With the butt of this he struck Crusoe a blow on the head that sent him sprawling on the grass The rest of the savages as we have seen continued in pursuit of Dick until he leaped into the river then they returned took the saddle and bridle off his dead horse
1901-147822-0001	train-other-500	and rejoined their comrades Here they held a court martial on Crusoe who was now bound foot and muzzle with cords Some were for killing him others who admired his noble appearance immense size and courage
1901-147822-0002	train-other-500	thought it would be well to carry him to their village and keep him There was a pretty violent dispute on the subject but at length it was agreed that they should spare his life in the mean time and perhaps have a dog dance round him when they got to their wigwams
1901-147822-0003	train-other-500	This dance of which Crusoe was to be the chief though passive performer is peculiar to some of the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains and consists in killing a dog and cutting out its liver
1901-147822-0004	train-other-500	which is afterwards sliced into shreds or strings and hung on a pole about the height of a man s head A band of warriors then come and dance wildly round this pole and each one
1901-147822-0005	train-other-500	in succession goes up to the raw liver and bites a piece off it without however putting his hands near it Such is the dog dance and to such was poor Crusoe destined by his fierce captors
none	none	 especially by the one whose throat still bore very evident marks of his teeth 
1901-147822-0006	train-other-500	But Crusoe was much too clever a dog to be disposed of in so disgusting a manner He had privately resolved in his own mind that he would escape but the hopelessness of his ever carrying that resolution into effect
none	none	 would have been apparent to any one who could have seen the way in which his muzzle was secured 
1901-147822-0007	train-other-500	and his four paws were tied together in a bunch as he hung suspended across the saddle of one of the savages This particular party of Indians who had followed Dick Varley determined not to wait for the return of their comrades who were in pursuit of the other two hunters
1901-147822-0008	train-other-500	but to go straight home so for several days they galloped away over the prairie At nights when they encamped Crusoe was thrown on the ground like a piece of old lumber and left to lie there with a mere scrap of food till morning
1901-147822-0009	train-other-500	when he was again thrown across the horse of his captor and carried on When the village was reached he was thrown again on the ground and would certainly have been torn to pieces in five minutes by the Indian curs which came howling round him
1901-147822-0010	train-other-500	had not an old woman come to the rescue and driven them away
none	none	 With the help of her grandson a little naked creature just able to walk 
1901-147822-0011	train-other-500	or rather to stagger she dragged him to her tent and undoing the line that fastened his mouth offered him a bone Although lying in a position that was unfavourable for eating purposes Crusoe opened his jaws and took it
1901-147822-0012	train-other-500	An awful crash was followed by two crunches and it was gone and Crusoe looked up in the old squaw s face with a look that said plainly
none	none	 Another of the same please and as quick as possible The old woman gave him another and then a lump of meat which latter went down with a gulp 
1901-147822-0013	train-other-500	but he coughed after it and it was well he didn t choke After this the squaw left him and Crusoe spent the remainder of that night gnawing the cords that bound him
1901-147822-0014	train-other-500	So diligent was he that he was free before morning and walked deliberately out of the tent Then he shook himself and with a yell that one might have fancied was intended for defiance he bounded joyfully away and was soon out of sight
1901-147822-0015	train-other-500	To a dog with a good appetite which had been on short allowance for several days the mouthful given to him by the old squaw was a mere nothing All that day he kept bounding over the plain from bluff to bluff in search of something to eat
1901-147822-0016	train-other-500	but found nothing until dusk when he pounced suddenly and most unexpectedly on a prairie hen fast asleep In one moment its life was gone In less than a minute its body was gone too feathers and bones and all
1901-147822-0017	train-other-500	down Crusoe s ravenous throat On the identical spot Crusoe lay down and slept like a top for four hours
none	none	 At the end of that time he jumped up bolted a scrap of skin that somehow had been overlooked at supper 
1901-147822-0018	train-other-500	and flew straight over the prairie to the spot where he had had the scuffle with the Indian He came to the edge of the river took precisely the same leap that his master had done before him
1901-147822-0019	train-other-500	and came out on the other side a good deal higher up than Dick had done for the dog had no savages to dodge and was as we have said before a powerful swimmer It cost him a good deal of running about to find the trail
1901-147822-0020	train-other-500	and it was nearly dark before he resumed his journey then putting his keen nose to the ground he ran step by step over Dick s track and at last found him as we have shown on the banks of the Salt Creek
1901-147822-0021	train-other-500	It is quite impossible to describe the intense joy which filled Dick s heart on again beholding his favourite
none	none	 Only those who have lost and found such an one can know it Dick seized him round the neck and hugged him as well as he could poor fellow in his feeble arms then he wept then he laughed and then he fainted 
1901-147822-0022	train-other-500	This was a consummation that took Crusoe quite aback Never having seen his master in such a state before he seemed to think at first that he was playing some trick for he bounded round him and barked and wagged his tail
1901-147822-0023	train-other-500	But as Dick lay quite still and motionless he went forward with a look of alarm snuffed him once or twice and whined piteously then he raised his nose in the air and uttered a long melancholy wail The cry seemed to revive Dick
1901-147822-0024	train-other-500	for he moved and with some difficulty sat up to the dog s evident relief There is no doubt whatever that Crusoe learned an erroneous lesson that day and was firmly convinced thenceforth that the best cure for a fainting fit is a melancholy yell
none	none	 So easy is it for the wisest of dogs as well as men to fall into gross error 
1901-147822-0025	train-other-500	Crusoe said Dick in a feeble voice dear good pup
none	none	 come here 
1901-147822-0026	train-other-500	He crawled as he spoke down to the water s edge where there was a level patch of dry sand
none	none	 Dig 
1901-147822-0027	train-other-500	said Dick pointing to the sand Crusoe looked at him in surprise as well he might for he had never heard the word dig in all his life before Dick pondered a minute
none	none	 then a thought struck him 
1901-147822-0028	train-other-500	He turned up a little of the sand with his fingers
none	none	 and pointing to the hole cried Seek him out pup Ha Crusoe understood that Many and many a time had he unhoused rabbits and squirrels and other creatures at that word of command 
1901-147822-0029	train-other-500	so without a moment s delay he commenced to dig down into the sand every now and then stopping for a moment and shoving in his nose and snuffing interrogatively as if he fully expected to find a buffalo at the bottom of it Then he would resume again
none	none	 one paw after another so fast that you could scarce see them going hand over hand as sailors would have called it 
1901-147822-0030	train-other-500	while the sand flew out between his hind legs in a continuous shower When the sand accumulated so much behind him as to impede his motions he scraped it out of his way and set to work again with tenfold earnestness
1901-147822-0031	train-other-500	After a good while he paused and looked up at Dick with an it won t do I fear there s nothing here expression on his face
none	none	 Seek him out pup repeated Dick Oh very good mutely answered the dog 
1901-147822-0032	train-other-500	and went at it again tooth and nail harder than ever
none	none	 In the course of a quarter of an hour there was a deep yawning hole in the sand into which Dick peered with intense anxiety 
1901-147822-0033	train-other-500	The bottom appeared slightly damp Hope now reanimated Dick Varley and by various devices he succeeded in getting the dog to scrape away a sort of tunnel from the hole into which he might roll himself and put down his lips to drink when the water should rise high enough
none	none	 Impatiently and anxiously he lay watching the moisture slowly accumulate in the bottom of the hole 
1901-147822-0034	train-other-500	drop by drop and while he gazed he fell into a troubled restless slumber and dreamed that Crusoe s return was a dream and that he was alone again perishing for want of water When he awakened
none	none	 the hole was half full of clear water and Crusoe was lapping it greedily Back pup he shouted as he crept down to the hole and put his trembling lips to the water 
1901-147822-0035	train-other-500	It was brackish but drinkable and as Dick drank deeply of it he esteemed it at that moment better than nectar Here he lay for half an hour alternately drinking and gazing in surprise
none	none	 at his own emaciated visage as reflected in the pool 
1901-147822-0036	train-other-500	The same afternoon Crusoe in a private hunting excursion of his own discovered and caught a prairie hen which he quietly proceeded to devour on the spot when Dick who saw what had occurred
none	none	 whistled to him Obedience was engrained in every fibre of Crusoe s mental and corporeal being 
1901-147822-0037	train-other-500	He did not merely answer at once to the call he sprang to it leaving the prairie hen untasted Fetch it pup cried Dick eagerly as the dog came up In a few moments the hen was at his feet
1901-147822-0038	train-other-500	Dick s circumstances could not brook the delay of cookery he gashed the bird with his knife and drank the blood and then gave the flesh to the dog while he crept to the pool again for another draught Ah think not reader
1901-147822-0039	train-other-500	that although we have treated this subject in a slight vein of pleasantry because it ended well that therefore our tale is pure fiction Not only are Indians glad to satisfy the urgent cravings of hunger with raw flesh but many civilised men and delicately nurtured
1901-147822-0040	train-other-500	have done the same ay and doubtless will do the same again as long as enterprising and fearless men shall go forth to dare the dangers of flood and field in the wild places of our wonderful world
none	none	 Crusoe had finished his share of the feast before Dick returned from the pool Then master and dog lay down together side by side and fell into a long deep peaceful slumber CHAPTER FIFTEEN HEALTH AND HAPPINESS RETURN INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY A BUFFALO SHOT A WILD HORSE CREASED DICK S BATTLE WITH A MUSTANG Dick Varley s fears and troubles in the meantime were ended On the day following he awoke refreshed and happy so happy and light at heart as he felt the glow of returning health coursing through his veins that he fancied he must have dreamed it all In fact he was so certain that his muscles were strong that he endeavoured to leap up but was powerfully convinced of his true condition by the miserable stagger that resulted from the effort However he knew he was recovering so he rose and thanking God for his recovery and for the new hope that was raised in his heart he went down to the pool and drank deeply of its water Then he returned and sitting down beside his dog opened the Bible and read long and for the first time earnestly the story of Christ s love for sinful man He at last fell asleep over the book and when he awakened felt so much refreshed in body and mind that he determined to attempt to pursue his journey He had not proceeded far when he came upon a colony of prairie dogs Upon this occasion he was little inclined to take a humorous view of the vagaries of these curious little creatures but he shot one and as before ate part of it raw These creatures are so active that they are difficult to shoot and even when killed generally fall into their holes and disappear Crusoe however soon unearthed the dead animal on this occasion That night the travellers came to a stream of fresh water and Dick killed a turkey so that he determined to spend a couple of days there to recruit At the end of that time he again set out but was able only to advance five miles when he broke down In fact it became evident to him that he must have a longer period of absolute repose ere he could hope to continue his journey but to do so without food was impossible Fortunately there was plenty of water as his course lay along the margin of a small stream and as the arid piece of prairie was now behind him he hoped to fall in with birds or perhaps deer soon While he was plodding heavily and wearily along pondering these things he came to the brow of a wave from which he beheld a most magnificent view of green grassy plains decked with flowers and rolling out to the horizon with a stream meandering through it and clumps of trees scattered everywhere far and wide It was a glorious sight but the most glorious object in it to Dick at that time was a fat buffalo which stood grazing not a hundred yards off The wind was blowing towards him so that the animal did not scent him and as he came up very slowly and it was turned away it did not see him Crusoe would have sprung forward in an instant but his master s finger imposed silence and caution Trembling with eagerness Dick sank flat down in the grass cocked both barrels of his piece and resting it on his left hand with his left elbow on the ground he waited until the animal should present its side In a few seconds it moved Dick s eye glanced along the barrel but it trembled his wonted steadiness of aim was gone He fired and the buffalo sprang off in terror With a groan of despair he fired again almost recklessly and the buffalo fell It rose once or twice and stumbled forward a few paces then it fell again Meanwhile Dick re loaded with trembling hand and advanced to give it another shot but it was not needful the buffalo was already dead Now Crusoe said Dick sitting down on the buffalo s shoulder and patting his favourite on the head we re all right at last You and I shall have a jolly time o t pup from this time for ard Dick paused for breath and Crusoe wagged his tail and looked as if to say pshaw as if We tell ye what it is reader it s of no use at all to go on writing as if when we tell you what Crusoe said If there is any language in eyes whatever if there is language in a tail in a cocked ear in a mobile eyebrow in the point of a canine nose if there is language in any terrestrial thing at all apart from that which flows from the tongue then Crusoe spoke Do we not speak at this moment to you and if so then tell me wherein lies the difference between a written letter and a given sign Yes Crusoe spoke He said to Dick as plain as dog could say it slowly and emphatically That s my opinion precisely Dick You re the dearest most beloved jolliest fellow that ever walked on two legs you are and whatever s your opinion is mine no matter how absurd it may be Dick evidently understood him perfectly for he laughed as he looked at him and patted him on the head and called him a funny dog Then he continued his discourse Yes pup we ll make our camp here for a long bit old dog in this beautiful plain We ll make a willow wigwam to sleep in you and me jist in yon clump o trees not a stone s throw to our right where we ll have a run o pure water beside us and be near our buffalo at the same time For ye see we ll need to watch him lest the wolves take a notion to eat him that ll be your duty pup Then I ll skin him when I get strong enough which ll be in a day or two I hope and we ll put one half of the skin below us and t other half above us i the camp an sleep an eat an take it easy for a week or two won t we pup Hoora a a y shouted Crusoe with a jovial wag of his tail that no human arm with hat or cap or kerchief ever equalled Poor Dick Varley He smiled to think how earnestly he had been talking to the dog but he did not cease to do it for although he entered into discourses the drift of which Crusoe s limited education did not permit him to follow he found comfort in hearing the sound of his own voice and in knowing that it fell pleasantly on another ear in that lonely wilderness Our hero now set about his preparations as vigorously as he could He cut out the buffalo s tongue a matter of great difficulty to one in his weak state and carried it to a pleasant spot near to the stream where the turf was level and green and decked with wild flowers Here he resolved to make his camp His first care was to select a bush whose branches were long enough to form a canopy over his head when bent and the ends thrust into the ground The completing of this exhausted him greatly but after a rest he resumed his labours The next thing was to light a fire a comfort which he had not enjoyed for many weary days Not that he required it for warmth for the weather was extremely warm but he required it to cook with and the mere sight of a blaze in a dark place is a most heart cheering thing as every one knows When the fire was lighted he filled his pannikin at the brook and put it on to boil and cutting several slices of buffalo tongue he thrust short stakes through them and set them up before the fire to roast By this time the water was boiling so he took it off with difficulty nearly burning his fingers and singeing the tail of his coat in so doing Into the pannikin he put a lump of maple sugar and stirred it about with a stick and tasted it It seemed to him even better than tea or coffee It was absolutely delicious Really one has no notion what he can do if he makes believe very hard The human mind is a nicely balanced and extremely complex machine and when thrown a little off the balance can be made to believe almost anything as we see in the case of some poor monomaniacs who have fancied that they were made of all sorts of things glass and porcelain and suchlike No wonder then that poor Dick Varley after so much suffering and hardship came to regard that pannikin of hot syrup as the most delicious beverage he ever drank During all these operations Crusoe sat on his haunches beside him and looked And you haven t no you haven t got the most distant notion of the way in which that dog manoeuvred with his head and face He opened his eyes wide and cocked his ears and turned his head first a little to one side then a little to the other After that he turned it a good deal to one side and then a good deal more to the other Then he brought it straight and raised one eyebrow a little and then the other a little and then both together very much Then when Dick paused to rest and did nothing Crusoe looked mild for a moment and yawned vociferously Presently Dick moved up went the ears again and Crusoe came in military parlance to the position of attention At last supper was ready and they began Dick had purposely kept the dog s supper back from him in order that they might eat it in company And between every bite and sup that Dick took he gave a bite but not a sup to Crusoe Thus lovingly they ate together and when Dick lay that night under the willow branches looking up through them at the stars with his feet to the fire and Crusoe close along his side he thought it the best and sweetest supper he ever ate and the happiest evening he ever spent so wonderfully do circumstances modify our notions of felicity Two weeks after this Richard was himself again The muscles were springy and the blood coursed fast and free as was its wont Only a slight and perhaps salutary feeling of weakness remained to remind him that young muscles might again become more helpless than those of an aged man or a child Dick had left his encampment a week ago and was now advancing by rapid stages towards the Rocky Mountains closely following the trail of his lost comrades which he had no difficulty in finding and keeping now that Crusoe was with him The skin of the buffalo that he had killed was now strapped to his shoulders and the skin of another animal that he had shot a few days after was cut up into a long line and slung in a coil round his neck Crusoe was also laden He had a little bundle of meat slung on each side of him For some time past numerous herds of mustangs or wild horses had crossed their path and Dick was now on the look out for a chance to crease one of those magnificent creatures On one occasion a band of mustangs galloped close up to him before they were aware of his presence and stopped short with a wild snort of surprise on beholding him then wheeling round they dashed away at full gallop their long tails and manes flying wildly in the air and their hoofs thundering on the plain Dick did not attempt to crease one upon this occasion fearing that his recent illness might have rendered his hand too unsteady for so extremely delicate an operation In order to crease a wild horse the hunter requires to be a perfect shot and it is not every man of the west who carries a rifle that can do it successfully Creasing consists in sending a bullet through the gristle of the mustang s neck just above the bone so as to stun the animal If the ball enters a hair s breadth too low the horse falls dead instantly If it hits the exact spot the horse falls as instantaneously and dead to all appearance but in reality he is only stunned and if left for a few minutes will rise and gallop away nearly as well as ever When hunters crease a horse successfully they put a rope or halter round his under jaw and hobbles round his feet so that when he rises he is secured and after considerable trouble reduced to obedience The mustangs which roam in wild freedom on the prairies of the far west are descended from the noble Spanish steeds that were brought over by the wealthy cavaliers who accompanied Fernando Cortez the conqueror of Mexico in his expedition to the new world in fifteen eighteen These bold and we may add lawless cavaliers were mounted on the finest horses that could be procured from Barbary and the deserts of the Old World The poor Indians of the New World were struck with amazement and terror at these awful beings for never having seen horses before they believed that horse and rider were one animal During the wars that followed many of the Spaniards were killed and their steeds bounded into the wilds of the new country to enjoy a life of unrestrained freedom These were the forefathers of the present race of magnificent creatures which are found in immense droves all over the western wilderness from the Gulf of Mexico to the confines of the snowy regions of the far north At first the Indians beheld these horses with awe and terror but gradually they became accustomed to them and finally succeeded in capturing great numbers and reducing them to a state of servitude Not however to the service of the cultivated field but to the service of the chase and war The savages soon acquired the method of capturing wild horses by means of the lasso as the noose at that end of a long line of raw hide is termed which they adroitly threw over the heads of the animals and secured them having previously run them down At the present day many of the savage tribes of the west almost live upon horseback and without these useful creatures they could scarcely subsist as they are almost indispensable in the chase of the buffalo Mustangs are regularly taken by the Indians to the settlements of the white men for trade but very poor specimens are these of the breed of wild horses This arises from two causes First the Indian cannot overtake the finest of a drove of wild mustangs because his own steed is inferior to the best among the wild ones besides being weighted with a rider so that only the weak and inferior animals are captured And secondly when the Indian does succeed in lassoing a first rate horse he keeps it for his own use Thus those who have not visited the far off prairies and seen the mustang in all the glory of untrammelled freedom can form no adequate idea of its beauty fleetness and strength The horse however was not the only creature imported by Cortez There were priests in his army who rode upon asses and although we cannot imagine that the fathers charged with the cavaliers and were unhorsed or rather un assed in battle yet somehow the asses got rid of their riders and joined the Spanish chargers in their joyous bound into a new life of freedom Hence wild asses also are found in the western prairies But think not reader of those poor miserable wretches we see at home which seem little better than rough door mats sewed up and stuffed with head tail and legs attached and just enough of life infused to make them move No the wild ass of the prairie is a large powerful swift creature He has the same long ears it is true and the same hideous exasperating bray and the same tendency to flourish his heels but for all that he is a very fine animal and often wages successful warfare with the wild horse But to return The next drove of mustangs that Dick and Crusoe saw were feeding quietly and unsuspectingly in a rich green hollow in the plain Dick s heart leaped up as his eyes suddenly fell on them for he had almost discovered himself before he was aware of their presence Down pup he whispered as he sank and disappeared among the grass which was just long enough to cover him when lying quite flat Crusoe crouched immediately and his master made his observations of the drove and the dispositions of the ground that might favour his approach for they were not within rifle range Having done so he crept slowly back until the undulation of the prairie hid him from view then he sprang to his feet and ran a considerable distance along the bottom until he gained the extreme end of a belt of low bushes which would effectually conceal him while he approached to within a hundred yards or less of the troop Here he made his arrangements Throwing down his buffalo robe he took the coil of line and cut off a piece of about three yards in length On this he made a running noose The longer line he also prepared with a running noose These he threw in a coil over his arm He also made a pair of hobbles and placed them in the breast of his coat and then taking up his rifle advanced cautiously through the bushes Crusoe following close behind him In a few minutes he was gazing in admiration at the mustangs which were now within easy shot and utterly ignorant of the presence of man for Dick had taken care to approach in such a way that the wind did not carry the scent of him in their direction And well might he admire them The wild horse of these regions is not very large but it is exceedingly powerful with prominent eye sharp nose distended nostril small feet and a delicate leg Their beautiful manes hung at great length down their arched necks and their thick tails swept the ground One magnificent fellow in particular attracted Dick s attention It was of a rich dark brown colour with black mane and tail and seemed to be the leader of the drove Although not the nearest to him he resolved to crease this horse It is said that creasing generally destroys or damages the spirit of the horse so Dick determined to try whether his powers of close shooting would not serve him on this occasion Going down on one knee he aimed at the creature s neck just a hair breadth above the spot where he had been told that hunters usually hit them and fired The effect upon the group was absolutely tremendous With wild cries and snorting terror they tossed their proud heads in the air uncertain for one moment in which direction to fly then there was a rush as if a hurricane swept over the place and they were gone But the brown horse was down Dick did not wait until the others had fled He dropped his rifle and with the speed of a deer sprang towards the fallen horse and affixed the hobbles to his legs His aim had been true Although scarcely half a minute elapsed between the shot and the fixing of the hobbles the animal recovered and with a frantic exertion rose on his haunches just as Dick had fastened the noose of the short line in his under jaw But this was not enough If the horse had gained his feet before the longer line was placed round his neck he would have escaped As the mustang made the second violent plunge that placed it on its legs Dick flung the noose hastily it caught on one ear and would have fallen off had not the horse suddenly shaken its head and unwittingly sealed its own fate by bringing the noose round its neck And now the struggle began Dick knew well enough from hearsay the method of breaking down a wild horse He knew that the Indians choke them with the noose round the neck until they fall down exhausted and covered with foam when they creep up fix the hobbles and the line in the lower jaw and then loosen the lasso to let the horse breathe and resume its plungings till it is almost subdued when they gradually draw near and breathe into its nostrils But the violence and strength of this animal rendered this an apparently hopeless task We have already seen that the hobbles and noose in the lower jaw had been fixed so that Dick had nothing now to do but to choke his captive and tire him out while Crusoe remained a quiet though excited spectator of the scene But there seemed to be no possibility of choking this horse Either the muscles of his neck were too strong or there was something wrong with the noose which prevented it from acting for the furious creature dashed and bounded backwards and sidewise in its terror for nearly an hour dragging Dick after it till he was almost exhausted and yet at the end of that time although flecked with foam and panting with terror it seemed as strong as ever Dick held both lines for the short one attached to its lower jaw gave him great power over it At last he thought of seeking assistance from his dog Crusoe he cried lay hold pup The dog seized the long line in his teeth and pulled with all his might At the some moment Dick let go the short line and threw all his weight upon the long one The noose tightened suddenly under this strain and the mustang with a gasp fell choking to the ground Dick had often heard of the manner in which the Mexicans break their horses so he determined to abandon the method which had already almost worn him out and adopt the other as far as the means in his power rendered it possible Instead therefore of loosening the lasso and re commencing the struggle he tore a branch from a neighbouring bush cut the hobbles strode with his legs across the fallen steed seized the end of the short line or bridle and then ordering Crusoe to quit his hold he loosened the noose which compressed the horse s neck and had already well nigh terminated its existence One or two deep sobs restored it and in a moment it leaped to its feet with Dick firmly on its back To say that the animal leaped and kicked in its frantic efforts to throw this intolerable burden would be a tame manner of expressing what took place Words cannot adequately describe the scene It reared plunged shrieked vaulted into the air stood straight up on its hind legs and then almost as straight upon its fore ones but its rider held on like a burr Then the mustang raced wildly forwards a few paces then as wildly back and then stood still and trembled violently But this was only a brief lull in the storm so Dick saw that the time was now come to assert the superiority of his race Stay back Crusoe and watch my rifle pup he cried and raising his heavy switch he brought it down with a sharp cut across the horse s flank at the same time loosening the rein which hitherto he had held tight The wild horse uttered a passionate cry and sprang forward like the bolt from a cross bow And now commenced a race which if not as prolonged was at least as furious as that of the far famed Mazeppa Dick was a splendid rider however at least as far as sticking on goes He might not have come up to the precise pitch desiderated by a riding master in regard to carriage etcetera but he rode that wild horse of the prairie with as much ease as he had formerly ridden his own good steed whose bones had been picked by the wolves not long ago The pace was tremendous for the youth s weight was nothing to that muscular frame which bounded with cat like agility from wave to wave of the undulating plain in ungovernable terror In a few minutes the clump of willows where Crusoe and his rifle lay were out of sight behind but it mattered not for Dick had looked up at the sky and noted the position of the sun at the moment of starting Away they went on the wings of the wind mile after mile over the ocean like waste curving slightly aside now and then to avoid the bluffs that occasionally appeared on the scene for a few minutes and then swept out of sight behind them Then they came to a little rivulet it was a mere brook of a few feet wide and two or three yards perhaps from bank to bank Over this they flew so easily that the spring was scarcely felt and continued the headlong course And now a more barren country was around them Sandy ridges and scrubby grass appeared everywhere reminding Dick of the place where he had been so ill Rocks too were scattered about and at one place the horse dashed with clattering hoofs between a couple of rocky sand hills which for a few seconds hid the prairie from view Here the mustang suddenly shied with such violence that his rider was nearly thrown while a rattlesnake darted from the path Soon they emerged from this pass and again the plains became green and verdant Presently a distant line of trees showed that they were approaching water and in a few minutes they were close on it For the first time Dick felt alarm he sought to check his steed but no force he could exert had the smallest influence on it Trees and bushes flew past in bewildering confusion the river was before him what width he could not tell but he was reckless now like his charger which he struck with the willow rod with all his force as they came up One tremendous bound and they were across but Dick had to lie flat on the mustang s back as it crashed through the bushes to avoid being scraped off by the trees Again they were on the open plain and the wild horse began to show signs of exhaustion Now was its rider s opportunity to assert his dominion He plied the willow rod and urged the panting horse on until it was white with foam and laboured a little in its gait Then Dick gently drew the halter and it broke into a trot still tighter and it walked and in another minute stood still trembling in every limb Dick now quietly rubbed its neck and spoke to it in soothing tones then he wheeled it gently round and urged it forward It was quite subdued and docile In a little time they came to the river and forded it after which they went through the belt of woodland at a walk By the time they reached the open prairie the mustang was recovered sufficiently to feel its spirit returning so Dick gave it a gentle touch with the switch and away they went on their return journey But it amazed Dick not a little to find how long that journey was Very different was the pace too from the previous mad gallop and often would the poor horse have stopped had Dick allowed him But this might not be The shades of night were approaching and the camp lay a long way ahead At last it was reached and Crusoe came out with great demonstrations of joy but was sent back lest he should alarm the horse Then Dick jumped off his back stroked his head put his cheek close to his mouth and whispered softly to him after which he fastened him to a tree and rubbed him down slightly with a bunch of grass Having done this he left him to graze as far as his tether would permit and after supping with Crusoe lay down to rest not a little elated with his success in this first attempt at creasing and breaking a mustang CHAPTER SIXTEEN DICK BECOMES A HORSE TAMER RESUMES HIS JOURNEY CHARLIE S DOINGS MISFORTUNES WHICH LEAD TO BUT DO NOT TERMINATE IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS A GRIZZLY BEAR There is a proverb or a saying or at least somebody or book has told us that some Irishman once said Be aisy or if ye can t be aisy be as aisy as ye can Now we count that good advice and strongly recommend it to all and sundry Had we been at the side of Dick Varley on the night after his taming of the wild horse we would have strongly urged that advice upon him Whether he would have listened to it or not is quite another question we rather think not Reader if you wish to know why go and do what he did and if you feel no curious sensations about the region of the loins after it we will tell you why Dick Varley wouldn t have listened to that advice Can a man feel as if his joints were wrenched out of their sockets and listen to advice be that advice good or bad Can he feel as though these joints were trying to re set and re dislocate themselves perpetually and listen to advice Can he feel as if he were sitting down on red hot iron when he s not sitting down at all and listen to advice Can he but no why pursue the subject Poor Dick spent that night in misery and the greater part of the following day in sleep to make up for it When he got up to breakfast in the afternoon he felt much better but shaky Now pup he said stretching himself we ll go and see our horse Ours pup yours and mine didn t you help to catch him eh pup Crusoe acknowledged the fact with a wag and a playful bow wow wow oo ow and followed his master to the place where the horse had been picketted It was standing there quite quiet but looking a little timid Dick went boldly up to it and patted its head and stroked its nose for nothing is so likely to alarm either a tame or a wild horse as any appearance of timidity or hesitation on the part of those who approach them After treating it thus for a short time he stroked down its neck and then its shoulders the horse eyeing him all the time nervously Gradually he stroked its back and limbs gently and walked quietly round and round it once or twice sometimes approaching and sometimes going away but never either hesitating or doing anything abruptly This done he went down to the stream and filled his cap with water and carried it to the horse which snuffed suspiciously and backed a little so he laid the cap down and went up and patted him again Presently he took up the cap and carried it to his nose the poor creature was almost choking with thirst so that the moment he understood what was in the cap he buried his lips in it and sucked it up This was a great point gained he had accepted a benefit at the hands of his new master he had become a debtor to man and no doubt he felt the obligation Dick filled the cap and the horse emptied it again and again and again until its burning thirst was slaked Then Dick went up to his shoulder patted him undid the line that fastened him and vaulted lightly on his back We say lightly for it was so but it wasn t easily as Dick could have told you However he was determined not to forego the training of his steed on account of what he would have called a little bit pain At this unexpected act the horse plunged and reared a good deal and seemed inclined to go through the performance of the day before over again but Dick patted and stroked him into quiescence and having done so urged him into a gallop over the plains causing the dog to gambol round in order that he might get accustomed to him This tried his nerves a good deal and no wonder for if he took Crusoe for a wolf which no doubt he did he must have thought him a very giant of the pack By degrees they broke into a furious gallop and after breathing him well Dick returned and tied him to the tree Then he rubbed him down again and gave him another drink This time the horse smelt his new master all over and Dick felt that he had conquered him by kindness No doubt the tremendous run of the day before could scarcely be called kindness but without this subduing run he never could have brought the offices of kindness to bear on so wild a steed During all these operations Crusoe sat looking on with demure sagacity drinking in wisdom and taking notes We know not whether any notes made by the canine race have ever been given to the world but certain are we that if the notes and observations made by Crusoe on that journey were published they would to say the least surprise us Next day Dick gave the wild horse his second lesson and his name He called him Charlie after a much loved companion in the Mustang Valley And long and heartily did Dick Varley laugh as he told the horse his future designation in the presence of Crusoe for it struck him as somewhat ludicrous that a mustang which two days ago pawed the earth in all the pride of independent freedom should suddenly come down so low as to carry a hunter on his back and be named Charlie The next piece of instruction began by Crusoe being led up under Charlie s nose and while Dick patted the dog with his right hand he patted the horse with his left It backed a good deal at first and snorted but Crusoe walked slowly and quietly in front of him several times each time coming nearer until he again stood under his nose then the horse smelt him nervously and gave a sigh of relief when he found that Crusoe paid no attention to him whatever Dick then ordered the dog to lie down at Charlie s feet and went to the camp to fetch his rifle and buffalo robe and pack of meat These and all the other things belonging to him were presented for inspection one by one to the horse who arched his neck and put forward his ears and eyed them at first but smelt them all over and seemed to feel more easy in his mind Next the buffalo robe was rubbed over his nose then over his eyes and head then down his neck and shoulder and lastly was placed on his back Then it was taken off and flung on after that it was strapped on and the various little items of the camp were attached to it This done Dick took up his rifle and let him smell it then he put his hand on Charlie s shoulder vaulted on to his back and rode away Charlie s education was completed and now our hero s journey began again in earnest and with some prospect of its speedy termination In this course of training through which Dick put his wild horse he had been at much greater pains and had taken far longer time than is usually the case among the Indians who will catch and break and ride a wild horse into camp in less than three hours But Dick wanted to do the thing well which the Indians are not careful to do besides it must be borne in remembrance that this was his first attempt and that his horse was one of the best and most high spirited while those caught by the Indians as we have said are generally the poorest of a drove Dick now followed the trail of his lost companions at a rapid pace yet not so rapidly as he might have done being averse to exhausting his good dog and his new companion Each night he encamped under the shade of a tree or a bush when he could find one or in the open prairie when there were none and picketting his horse to a short stake or pin which he carried with him for the purpose lit his fire had supper and lay down to rest In a few days Charlie became so tame and so accustomed to his master s voice that he seemed quite reconciled to his new life There can be no doubt whatever that he had a great dislike to solitude for on one occasion when Dick and Crusoe went off a mile or so from the camp where Charlie was tied and disappeared from his view he was heard to neigh so loudly that Dick ran back thinking the wolves must have attacked him He was all right however and exhibited evident tokens of satisfaction when they returned On another occasion his fear of being left alone was more clearly demonstrated Dick had been unable to find wood or water that day so he was obliged to encamp upon the open plain The want of water was not seriously felt however for he had prepared a bladder in which he always carried enough to give him one pannikin of hot syrup and leave a mouthful for Crusoe and Charlie Dried buffalo dung formed a substitute for fuel Spreading his buffalo robe he lit his fire put on his pannikin to boil and stuck up a piece of meat to roast to the great delight of Crusoe who sat looking on with much interest Suddenly Charlie who was picketted a few hundred yards off in a grassy spot broke his halter close by the head piece and with a snort of delight bounded away prancing and kicking up his heels Dick heaved a deep sigh for he felt sure that his horse was gone However in a little Charlie stopped and raised his nose high in the air as if to look for his old equine companions But they were gone no answering neigh replied to his and he felt probably for the first time that he was really alone in the world Having no power of smell whereby he might have traced them out as the dog would have done he looked in a bewildered and excited state all round the horizon Then his eye fell on Dick and Crusoe sitting by their little fire Charlie looked hard at them and then again at the horizon and then coming to the conclusion no doubt that the matter was quite beyond his comprehension he quietly took to feeding Dick availed himself of the chance and tried to catch him but he spent an hour with Crusoe in the vain attempt and at last they gave it up in disgust and returned to the fire where they finished their supper and went to bed Next morning they saw Charlie feeding close at hand so they took breakfast and tried to catch him again But it was of no use he was evidently coquetting with them and dodged about and defied their utmost efforts for there was only a few inches of line hanging to his head At last it occurred to Dick that he would try the experiment of forsaking him So he packed up his things rolled up the buffalo robe threw it and the rifle on his shoulder and walked deliberately away Come along Crusoe he cried after walking a few paces But Crusoe stood by the fire with his head up and an expression on his face that said Hello man what s wrong You ve forgot Charlie Hold on Are you mad Come here Crusoe cried his master in a decided tone Crusoe obeyed at once Whatever mistake there might be there was evidently none in that command so he lowered his head and tail humbly and trotted on with his master but he perpetually turned his head as he went first on this side and then on that to look and wonder at Charlie When they were far away on the plain Charlie suddenly became aware that something was wrong He trotted to the brow of a slope with his head and tail very high up indeed and looked after them then he looked at the fire and neighed then he trotted quickly up to it and seeing that everything was gone he began to neigh violently and at last started off at full speed and overtook his friends passing within a few feet of them and wheeling round a few yards off stood trembling like an aspen leaf Dick called him by his name and advanced while Charlie met him half way and allowed himself to be saddled bridled and mounted forthwith After this Dick had no further trouble with his wild horse At his next camping place which was in the midst of a cluster of bushes close beside a creek Dick came unexpectedly upon a little wooden cross which marked the head of a grave There was no inscription on it but the Christian symbol told that it was the grave of a white man It is impossible to describe the rush of mingled feelings that filled the soul of the young hunter as he leaned on the muzzle of his rifle and looked at this solitary resting place of one who doubtless like himself had been a roving hunter Had he been young or old when he fell had he a mother in the distant settlement who watched and longed and waited for the son that was never more to gladden her eyes had he been murdered or had he died there and been buried by his sorrowing comrades These and a thousand questions passed rapidly through his mind as he gazed at the little cross Suddenly he started Could it be the grave of Joe or Henri For an instant the idea sent a chill to his heart but it passed quickly for a second glance showed that the grave was old and that the wooden cross had stood over it for years Dick turned away with a saddened heart and that night as he pored over the pages of his Bible his mind was filled with many thoughts about eternity and the world to come He too must come to the grave one day and quit the beautiful prairies and his loved rifle It was a sad thought but while he meditated he thought upon his mother After all he murmured there must be happiness without the rifle and youth and health and the prairie My mother s happy yet she don t shoot or ride like wildfire over the plains Then that word which had been sent so sweetly to him through her hand came again to his mind My son give me thine heart and as he read God s book he met with the word Delight thyself in the Lord and he shall give thee the desire of thine heart The desire of thine heart Dick repeated this and pondered it till he fell asleep A misfortune soon after this befell Dick Varley which well nigh caused him to give way to despair For some time past he had been approaching the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains those ragged jagged mighty hills which run through the whole continent from north to south in a continuous chain and form as it were the backbone of America One morning as he threw the buffalo robe off his shoulders and sat up he was horrified to find the whole earth covered with a mantle of snow We say he was horrified for this rendered it absolutely impossible any further to trace his companions either by scent or sight For some time he sat musing bitterly on his sad fate while his dog came and laid his head sympathisingly on his arm Ah pup he said I know ye d help me if ye could But it s all up now there s no chance of findin them none To this Crusoe replied by a low whine He knew full well that something distressed his master but he hadn t yet ascertained what it was As something had to be done Dick put the buffalo robe on his steed and mounting said as he was in the habit of doing each morning Lead on pup Crusoe put his nose to the ground and ran forward a few paces then he returned and ran about snuffing and scraping up the snow At last he looked up and uttered a long melancholy howl Ah I knowed it said Dick pushing forward Come on pup you ll have to follow now Any way we must go on The snow that had fallen was not deep enough to offer the slightest obstruction to their advance It was indeed only one of those occasional showers common to that part of the country in the late autumn which season had now crept upon Dick almost before he was aware of it and he fully expected that it would melt away in a few days In this hope he kept steadily advancing until he found himself in the midst of those rocky fastnesses which divide the waters that flow into the Atlantic from those that flow into the Pacific Ocean Still the slight crust of snow lay on the ground and he had no means of knowing whether he was going in the right direction or not Game was abundant and there was no lack of wood now so that his night bivouac was not so cold or dreary as might have been expected Travelling however had become difficult and even dangerous owing to the rugged nature of the ground over which he proceeded The scenery had completely changed in its character Dick no longer coursed over the free open plains but he passed through beautiful valleys filled with luxuriant trees and hemmed in by stupendous mountains whose rugged sides rose upward until the snow clad peaks pierced the clouds There was something awful in these dark solitudes quite overwhelming to a youth of Dick s temperament his heart began to sink lower and lower every day and the utter impossibility of making up his mind what to do became at length agonising To have turned and gone back the hundreds of miles over which he had travelled would have caused him some anxiety under any circumstances but to do so while Joe and Henri were either wandering about there or in the power of the savages was he felt out of the question Yet in which way should he go Whatever course he took might lead him further and further away from them In this dilemma he came to the determination of remaining where he was at least until the snow should leave the ground He felt great relief even when this hopeless course was decided upon and set about making himself an encampment with some degree of cheerfulness When he had completed this task he took his rifle and leaving Charlie picketted in the centre of a dell where the long rich grass rose high above the snow went off to hunt On turning a rocky point his heart suddenly bounded into his throat for there not thirty yards distant stood a huge grizzly bear Yes there he was at last the monster to meet which the young hunter had so often longed the terrible size and fierceness of which he had heard so often spoken about by the old hunters There it stood at last but little did Dick Varley think that the first time he should meet with his foe should be when alone in the dark recesses of the Rocky Mountains and with none to succour him in the event of the battle going against him Yes there was one The faithful Crusoe stood by his side with his hair bristling all his formidable teeth exposed and his eyes glaring in their sockets Alas for poor Crusoe had he gone into that combat alone One stroke of that monster s paw would have hurled him dead upon the ground CHAPTER SEVENTEEN DICK S FIRST FIGHT WITH A GRIZZLY ADVENTURE WITH A DEER A SURPRISE There is no animal in all the land so terrible and dangerous as the grizzly bear Not only is he the largest of the species in America but he is the fiercest the strongest and the most tenacious of life facts which are so well understood that few of the western hunters like to meet him single handed unless they happen to be first rate shots and the Indians deem the encounter so dangerous that to wear a collar composed of the claws of a grizzly bear of his own killing is counted one of the highest honours to which a young warrior can attain The grizzly bear resembles the brown bear of Europe but it is larger and the hair is long the points being of a paler shade About the head there is a considerable mixture of grey hair giving it the grizzly appearance from which it derives its name The claws are dirty white arched and very long and so strong that when the animal strikes with its paw they cut like a chisel These claws are not embedded in the paw as is the case with the cat but always project far beyond the hair thus giving to the foot a very ungainly appearance they are not sufficiently curved to enable the grizzly bear to climb trees like the black and brown bears and this inability on their part is often the only hope of the pursued hunter who if he succeeds in ascending a tree is safe for the time at least from the bear s assaults but Caleb is a patient creature and will often wait at the foot of the tree for many hours for his victim The average length of his body is about nine feet but he sometimes attains to a still larger growth Caleb is more carnivorous in his habits than other bears but like them he does not object to indulge occasionally in vegetable diet being partial to the bird cherry the choke berry and various shrubs He has a sweet tooth too and revels in honey when he can get it The instant the grizzly bear beheld Dick Varley standing in his path he rose on his hind legs and made a loud hissing noise like a man breathing quick but much harsher To this Crusoe replied by a deep growl and showing the utmost extent of his teeth gums and all and Dick cocked both barrels of his rifle To say that Dick Varley felt no fear would be simply to make him out that sort of hero which does not exist in nature namely a perfect hero He did feel a sensation as if his bowels had suddenly melted into water Let not our reader think the worse of Dick for this There is not a man living who having met with a huge grizzly bear for the first time in his life in a wild solitary place all alone has not experienced some such sensation There was no cowardice in this feeling Fear is not cowardice Acting in a wrong and contemptible manner because of our fear is cowardice It is said that Wellington or Napoleon we forget which once stood watching the muster of the men who were to form the forlorn hope in storming a citadel There were many brave strong stalwart men there in the prime of life and flushed with the blood of high health and courage There were also there a few stern browed men of riper years who stood perfectly silent with lips compressed and as pale as death Yonder veterans said the general pointing to these soldiers are men whose courage I can depend on they know what they are going to the others don t Yes these young soldiers very probably were brave the others certainly were Dick Varley stood for a few seconds as if thunderstruck while the bear stood hissing at him Then the liquefaction of his interior ceased and he felt a glow of fire gush through his veins Now Dick knew well enough that to fly from a grizzly bear was the sure and certain way of being torn to pieces as when taken thus by surprise they almost invariably follow a retreating enemy He also knew that if he stood where he was perfectly still the bear would get uncomfortable under his stare and would retreat from him But he neither intended to run away himself nor to allow the bear to do so he intended to kill it so he raised his rifle quickly drew a bead as the hunters express it on the bear s heart and fired It immediately dropped on its fore legs and rushed at him Back Crusoe out of the way pup shouted Dick as his favourite was about to spring forward The dog retired and Dick leaped behind a tree As the bear passed he gave it the contents of the second barrel behind the shoulder which brought it down but in another moment it rose and again rushed at him Dick had no time to load neither had he time to spring up the thick tree beside which he stood and the rocky nature of the ground out of which it grew rendered it impossible to dodge round it His only resource was flight but where was he to fly to If he ran along the open track the bear would overtake him in a few seconds on the right was a sheer precipice a hundred feet high on the left was an impenetrable thicket In despair he thought for an instant of clubbing his rifle and meeting the monster in close conflict but the utter hopelessness of such an effort was too apparent to be entertained for a moment He glanced up at the overhanging cliffs There were one or two rents and projections close above him In the twinkling of an eye he sprang up and grasped a ledge of about an inch broad ten or twelve feet up to which he clung while he glanced upward Another projection was within reach he gained it and in a few seconds he stood upon a ledge about twenty feet up the cliff where he had just room to plant his feet firmly Without waiting to look behind he seized his powder horn and loaded one barrel of his rifle and well was it for him that his early training had fitted him to do this with rapidity for the bear dashed up the precipice after him at once The first time it missed its hold and fell back with a savage growl but on the second attempt it sunk its long claws into the fissures between the rocks and ascended steadily till within a foot of the place where Dick stood At this moment Crusoe s obedience gave way before a sense of Dick s danger Uttering one of his lion like roars he rushed up the precipice with such violence that although naturally unable to climb he reached and seized the bear s flank despite his master s stern order to keep back and in a moment the two rolled down the face of the rock together just as Dick completed loading Knowing that one stroke of the bear s paw would be certain death to his poor dog Dick leaped from his perch and with one bound reached the ground at the same moment with the struggling animals and close beside them and before they had ceased rolling he placed the muzzle of his rifle into the bear s ear and blew out its brains Crusoe strange to say escaped with only one scratch on the side It was a deep one but not dangerous and gave him but little pain at the time although it caused him many a smart for some weeks after Thus happily ended Dick s first encounter with a grizzly bear and although in the course of his wild life he shot many specimens of Caleb he used to say that he an pup were never so near goin under as on the day he dropped that bar Having refreshed himself with a long draught from a neighbouring rivulet and washed Crusoe s wound Dick skinned the bear on the spot We chawed him up that time didn t we pup said Dick with a smile of satisfaction as he surveyed his prize Crusoe looked up and assented to this Gave us a hard tussle though very nigh sent us both under didn t he pup Crusoe agreed entirely and as if the remark reminded him of honourable scars he licked his wound Ah pup cried Dick sympathetically does it hurt ye eh poor dog Hurt him such a question No he should think not better ask if that leap from the precipice hurt yourself So Crusoe might have said but he didn t he took no notice of the remark whatever We ll cut him up now pup continued Dick The skin ll make a splendid bed for you an me o nights and a saddle for Charlie Dick cut out all the claws of the bear by the roots and spent the remainder of that night in cleaning them and stringing them on a strip of leather to form a necklace Independently of the value of these enormous claws the largest as long as a man s middle finger as an evidence of prowess they formed a remarkably graceful collar which Dick wore round his neck ever after with as much pride as if he had been a Pawnee warrior When it was finished he held it out at arm s length and said Crusoe my pup ain t ye proud of it I ll tell ye what it is pup the next time you an I floor Caleb I ll put the claws round your neck an make ye wear em ever arter so I will The dog did not seem quite to appreciate this piece of prospective good fortune Vanity had no place in his honest breast and sooth to say it had not a large place in that of his master either as we may well grant when we consider that this first display of it was on the occasion of his hunter s soul having at last realised its brightest day dream Dick s dangers and triumphs seemed to accumulate on him rather thickly at this place for on the very next day he had a narrow escape of being killed by a deer The way of it was this Having run short of meat and not being particularly fond of grizzly bear steak he shouldered his rifle and sallied forth in quest of game accompanied by Crusoe whose frequent glances towards his wounded side showed that whatever may have been the case the day before it hurt him now They had not gone far when they came on the track of a deer in the snow and followed it up till they spied a magnificent buck about three hundred yards off standing in a level patch of ground which was everywhere surrounded either by rocks or thicket It was a long shot but as the nature of the ground rendered it impossible for Dick to get nearer without being seen he fired and wounded the buck so badly that he came up with it in a few minutes The snow had drifted in the place where it stood bolt upright ready for a spring so Dick went round a little way Crusoe following till he was in a proper position to fire again Just as he pulled the trigger Crusoe gave a howl behind him and disturbed his aim so that he feared he had missed but the deer fell and he hurried towards it On coming up however the buck sprang to its legs rushed at him with its hair bristling knocked him down in the snow and deliberately commenced stamping him to death Dick was stunned for a moment and lay quite still so the deer left off pommelling him and stood looking at him But the instant he moved it plunged at him again and gave him another pounding until he was content to lie still This was done several times and Dick felt his strength going fast He was surprised that Crusoe did not come to his rescue and once he cleared his mouth and whistled to him but as the deer gave him another pounding for this he didn t attempt it again He now for the first time bethought him of his knife and quietly drew it from his belt but the deer observed the motion and was on him again in a moment Dick however sprang up on his left elbow and making several desperate thrusts upward succeeded in stabbing the animal to the heart Rising and shaking the snow from his garments he whistled loudly to Crusoe and on listening heard him whining piteously He hurried to the place whence the sound came and found that the poor dog had fallen into a deep pit or crevice in the rocks which had been concealed from view by a crust of snow and he was now making frantic but unavailing efforts to leap out Dick soon freed him from his prison by means of his belt which he let down for the dog to grasp and then returned to camp with as much deer meat as he could carry Dear meat it certainly was to him for it had nearly cost him his life and left him all black and blue for weeks after Happily no bones were broken so the incident only confined him a day to his encampment Soon after this the snow fell thicker than ever and it became evident that an unusually early winter was about to set in among the mountains This was a terrible calamity for if the regular snow of winter set in it would be impossible for him either to advance or retreat While he was sitting on his bear skin by the campfire one day thinking anxiously what he should do and feeling that he must either make the attempt to escape or perish miserably in that secluded spot a strange unwonted sound struck upon his ear and caused both him and Crusoe to spring violently to their feet and listen Could he be dreaming it seemed like the sound of human voices For a moment he stood with his eyes rivetted on the ground his lips apart and his nostrils distended as he listened with the utmost intensity Then he darted out and bounded round the edge of a rock which concealed an extensive but narrow valley from his view and there to his amazement he beheld a band of about a hundred human beings advancing on horseback slowly through the snow CHAPTER EIGHTEEN A SURPRISE AND A PIECE OF GOOD NEWS THE FUR TRADERS CRUSOE PROVED AND THE PEIGANS PURSUED Dick s first and most natural impulse on beholding this band was to mount his horse and fly for his mind naturally enough recurred to the former rough treatment he had experienced at the hands of Indians On second thoughts however he considered it wiser to throw himself upon the hospitality of the strangers for thought he they can but kill me an if I remain here I m like to die at any rate So Dick mounted his wild horse grasped his rifle in his right hand and followed by Crusoe galloped full tilt down the valley to meet them He had heard enough of the customs of savage tribes and had also of late experienced enough to convince him that when a man found himself in the midst of an overwhelming force his best policy was to assume an air of confident courage He therefore approached them at his utmost speed The effect upon the advancing band was electrical and little wonder for the young hunter s appearance was very striking His horse from having rested a good deal of late was full of spirit its neck was arched its nostrils expanded and its mane and tail never having been checked in their growth flew wildly around him in voluminous curls Dick s own hair not having been clipped for many months appeared scarcely less wild as they thundered down the rocky pass at what appeared a break neck gallop Add to this the grandeur of the scene out of which they sprang and the gigantic dog that bounded by his side and you will not be surprised to hear that the Indian warriors clustered together and prepared to receive this bold horseman as if he in his own proper person were a complete squadron of cavalry It is probable also that they fully expected the tribe of which Dick was the chief to be at his heels As he drew near the excitement among the strangers seemed very great and from the peculiarity of the various cries that reached him he knew that there were women and children in the band a fact which in such a place and at such a season was so unnatural that it surprised him very much He noted also that though the men in front were Indians their dresses were those of trappers and hunters and he almost leaped out of his saddle when he observed that Pale faces were among them But he had barely time to note these facts when he was up with the band According to Indian custom he did not check his speed till he was within four or five yards of the advance guard who stood in a line before him quite still and with their rifles lying loosely in their left palms then he reined his steed almost on its haunches One of the Indians advanced and spoke a few words in a language which was quite unintelligible to Dick who replied in the little Pawnee he could muster that he didn t understand him Why you must be a trapper exclaimed a thick set middle aged man riding out from the group Can you speak English Ay that can I cried Dick joyfully riding up and shaking the stranger heartily by the hand an right glad am I to fall in wi a white skin an a civil tongue in his head Good sooth sir replied the stranger with a quiet smile on his kind weather beaten face I can return you the compliment for when I saw you come thundering down the corrie with that wonderful horse and no less wonderful dog of yours I thought you were the wild man o the mountain himself and had an ambush ready to back you But young man do you mean to say that you live here in the mountain all alone after this fashion No that I don t I ve comed here in my travels but truly this bean t my home But sir for I see you are what the fur traders call a bourgeois how comes it that such a band as this rides i the mountains D ye mean to say that they live here Dick looked round in surprise as he spoke upon the crowd of mounted men and women with children and pack horses that now surrounded him Tis a fair question lad I am a principal among the fur traders whose chief trading post lies near the Pacific Ocean on the west side of these mountains and I have come with these trappers and their families as you see to hunt the beaver and other animals for a season in the mountains We ve never been here before but that s a matter of little moment for it s not the first time I ve been on what may be called a discovery trading expedition We are somewhat entangled however just now among these wild passes and if you can guide us out of our difficulties to the east side of the mountains I ll thank you heartily and pay you well But first tell me who and what you are if it s a fair question My name is Dick Varley and my home s in the Mustang Valley near the Missouri river As to what I am I m nothin yet but I hope to desarve the name o a hunter some day I can guide you to the east side o the mountains for I ve comed from there but more than that I can t do for I m a stranger to the country here like yourself But you re on the east side o the mountains already if I mistake not only these mountains are so rugged and jumbled up that it s not easy tellin where ye are And what continued Dick may be the name o the bourgeois who speaks to me My name is Cameron Walter Cameron a well known name among the Scottish hills although it sounds a little strange here And now young man will you join my party as guide and afterwards remain as trapper It will pay you better I think than roving about alone Dick shook his head and looked grave I ll guide you said he as far as my knowledge ll help me but after that I must return to look for two comrades whom I have lost They have been driven into the mountains by a band of Injuns God grant they may not have bin scalped The trader s face looked troubled and he spoke with one of his Indians for a few minutes in earnest hurried tones What were they like young man Dick described them The same continued the trader they ve been seen lad not more than two days ago by this Indian here when he was out hunting alone some miles away from our camp He came suddenly on a band of Indians who had two prisoners with them such as you describe They were stout said you Yes both of them cried Dick listening with intense eagerness Ay They were tied to their horses an from what I know of these fellows I m sure they re doomed But I ll help you my friend as well as I can They can t be far from this I treated my Indian s story about them as a mere fabrication for he s the most notorious liar in my company but he seems to have spoken truth for once Thanks thanks good sir cried Dick Had we not best turn back and follow them at once Nay friend not quite so fast replied Cameron pointing to his people These must be provided for first but I shall be ready before the sun goes down And now as I presume you don t bivouac in the snow will you kindly conduct us to your encampment if it be not far hence Although burning with impatience to fly to the rescue of his friends Dick felt constrained to comply with so reasonable a request so he led the way to his camping place where the band of fur traders immediately began to pitch their tents cut down wood kindle fires fill their kettles with water cook their food and in fact make themselves comfortable The wild spot which an hour before had been so still and grand and gloomy was now as if by magic transformed into a bustling village with bright fires blazing among the rocks and bushes and merry voices of men women and children ringing in the air It seemed almost incredible and no wonder Dick in his bewilderment had difficulty in believing it was not all a dream In days long gone by the fur trade in that country was carried on in a very different way from the manner in which it is now conducted These wild regions indeed are still as lonesome and untenanted save by wild beasts and wandering tribes of Indians as they were then but the Indians of the present day have become accustomed to the pale faced trader whose little wooden forts or trading posts are dotted here and there at wide intervals all over the land But in the days of which we write it was not so The fur traders at that time went forth in armed bands into the heart of the Indians country and he who went forth did so with his life in his hand As in the case of the soldier who went out to battle there was great probability that he might never return The band of which Walter Cameron was the chief had many months before started from one of the distant posts of Oregon on a hunting expedition into the then totally unknown lands of the Snake Indians It consisted of about sixty men thirty women and as many children of various ages about a hundred and twenty souls in all Many of the boys were capable of using the gun and setting a beaver trap The men were a most motley set There were Canadians half breeds Iroquois and Scotchmen Most of the women had Indian blood in their veins and a few were pure Indians The equipment of this strange band consisted of upwards of two hundred beaver traps which are similar to our rat traps with this difference that they have two springs and no teeth seventy guns a few articles for trade with the Indians and a large supply of powder and ball the whole men women children goods and chattels being carried on the backs of nearly four hundred horses Many of these horses at starting were not laden being designed for the transport of furs that were to be taken in the course of the season For food this adventurous party depended entirely on their guns and during the march hunters were kept constantly out ahead As a matter of course their living was precarious Sometimes their kettles were overflowing at others they scarce refrained from eating their horses But during the months they had already spent in the wilderness good living had been the rule starvation the exception They had already collected a large quantity of beaver skins which at that time were among the most valuable in the market although they are now scarcely saleable Having shot two wild horses seven elks six small deer and four big horned sheep the day before they met Dick Varley the camp kettles were full and the people consequently happy Now Master Dick Varley said Cameron touching the young hunter on the shoulder as he stood ready equipped by one of the campfires I m at your service The people won t need any more looking after to night I ll divide my men thirty shall go after this rascally band of Peigans for such I believe they are and thirty shall remain to guard the camp Are you ready Ready ay this hour past Mount then lad the men have already been told off and are mustering down yonder where the deer gave you such a licking Dick needed no second bidding He vaulted on Charlie s back and along with their commander joined the men who were thirty as fine hardy reckless looking fellows as one could desire for a forlorn hope They were chatting and laughing while they examined their guns and saddle girths Their horses were sorry looking animals compared with the magnificent creature that Dick bestrode but they were hardy nevertheless and well fitted for their peculiar work My wot a blazer exclaimed a trapper as Dick rode up Where you git him inquired a half breed I caught him answered Dick Baw cried the first speaker Dick took no notice of this last remark No did ye though he asked again I did answered Dick quietly I creased him in the prairie you can see the mark on his neck if you look The men began to feel that the young hunter was perhaps a little beyond them at their own trade and regarded him with increased respect Look sharp now lads said Cameron impatiently to several dilatory members of the band Night will be on us ere long Who sold ye the bear claw collar inquired another man of Dick I didn t buy it I killed the bear and made it Did ye though all be yer lone Ay that wasn t much was it You ve begun well yonker said a tall middle aged hunter whose general appearance was not unlike that of Joe Blunt Jest keep clear o the Injuns an the grog bottle an ye ve a glor ous life before ye At this point the conversation was interrupted by the order being given to move on which was obeyed in silence and the cavalcade descending the valley entered one of the gorges in the mountains For the first half mile Cameron rode a little ahead of his men then he turned to speak to one of them and for the first time observed Crusoe trotting close beside his master s horse Ah Master Dick he exclaimed with a troubled expression that won t do It would never do to take a dog on an expedition like this Why not asked Dick the pup s quiet and peaceable I doubt it not but he will betray our presence to the Indians which might be inconvenient I ve travelled more than a thousand miles through prairie and forest among game an among Injuns an the pup never betrayed me yet said Dick with suppressed vehemence he has saved my life more than once though You seem to have perfect confidence in your dog but as this is a serious matter you must not expect me to share in it without proof of his trustworthiness The pup may be useful to us how would you have it proved inquired Dick Any way you like You forgot your belt at starting I think I heered ye say Yes I did replied the trader smiling Dick immediately took hold of Cameron s coat and bade Crusoe smell it which the dog did very carefully Then he showed him his own belt and said Go back to the camp and fetch it pup Crusoe was off in a moment and in less than twenty minutes returned with Cameron s belt in his mouth Well I ll trust him said Cameron patting Crusoe s head Forward lads and away they went at a brisk trot along the bottom of a beautiful valley on each side of which the mountains towered in dark masses Soon the moon rose and afforded light sufficient to enable them to travel all night in the track of the Indian hunter who said he had seen the Peigans and who was constituted guide to the party Hour after hour the horsemen pressed on without check now galloping over a level plain now bounding by the banks of a rivulet or bending their heads to escape the boughs of overhanging trees and anon toiling slowly up among the rocks of some narrow defile At last the moon set and the order was given to halt in a little plain where there was wood and water The horses were picketted a fire kindled a mouthful of dried meat hastily eaten the watch was set and then each man scraped away the snow spread some branches on the ground and wrapping himself in his blanket went to sleep with his feet presented towards the fire Two hours were allowed for rest then they were awakened and in a few minutes were off again by the grey light of dawn In this way they travelled two nights and a day At the end of that time they came suddenly on a small party of nine Indians who were seated on the ground with their snow shoes and blankets by their sides They had evidently been taken by surprise but they made no attempt to escape knowing that it was useless Each sat still with his bow and arrows between his legs on the ground ready for instant use As soon as Cameron spoke however in their own language they felt relieved and began to talk Where do you come from and what are you doing here asked the trader We have come to trade with the white men one of them replied and to hunt We have come from the Missouri Our country is far away Do Peigans hunt with war arrows asked Cameron pointing to their weapons This question seemed to perplex them for they saw that their interrogator knew the difference between a war and a hunting arrow the former being barbed in order to render its extraction from the wound difficult while the head of the latter is round and can be drawn out of game that has been killed and used again And do Peigans continued Cameron come from a far country to trade with the white men with nothing Again the Indians were silent for they had not an article of trade about them Cameron now felt convinced that this party of Peigans into whose hands Joe Blunt and Henri had fallen were nothing else than a war party and that the men now before him were a scouting party sent out from them probably to spy out his own camp on the trail of which they had fallen so he said to them The Peigans are not wise men they tell lies to the traders I will tell you that you are a war party and that you are only a few warriors sent out to spy the traders camp You have also two Pale face prisoners in your camp You cannot deceive me It is useless to try Now conduct me to your camp My object is not war it is peace I will speak with your chiefs about trading with the white men and we will smoke the pipe of peace Are my words good Despite their proverbial control of muscle these Indians could not conceal their astonishment at hearing so much of their affairs thus laid bare so they said that the Pale face chief was wise that he must be a great medicine man and that what he said was all true except about the white men They had never seen any Pale faces and knew nothing whatever about those he spoke of This was a terrible piece of news to poor Dick and at first his heart fairly sank within him but by degrees he came to be more hopeful He concluded that if these men told lies in regard to one thing they would do it in regard to another and perhaps they might have some strong reason for denying any knowledge of Joe and Henri The Indians now packed up the buffalo robes on which they had slept and the mouthful of provisions they had taken with them I don t believe a word of what they say about your friends said Cameron to Dick in a low tone while the Indians were thus engaged Depend upon it they hope to hide them till they can send to the settlements and get a ransom or till they get an opportunity of torturing them to death before their women and children when they get back to their own village But we ll baulk them my friend do not fear The Indians were soon ready to start for they were lumbered with marvellously little camp equipage In less than half an hour after their discovery they were running like deer ahead of the cavalcade in the direction of the Peigan camp CHAPTER NINETEEN ADVENTURES WITH THE PEIGANS CRUSOE DOES GOOD SERVICE AS A DISCOVERER THE SAVAGES OUTWITTED THE RESCUE A run of twenty miles brought the travellers to a rugged defile in the mountains from which they had a view of a beautiful valley of considerable extent During the last two days a steady thaw had been rapidly melting away the snow so that it appeared only here and there in the landscape in dazzling patches At the distance of about half a mile from where they halted to breathe the horses before commencing the descent into this vale several thin wreaths of smoke were seen rising above the trees Is that your camp inquired Cameron riding up to the Indian runners who stood in a group in front looking as fresh after their twenty miles run as though they had only had a short walk To this they answered in the affirmative adding that there were about two hundred Peigans there It might have been thought that thirty men would have hesitated to venture to attack so large a number as two hundred but it had always been found in the experience of Indian life that a few resolute white men well armed were more than a match for ten times their number of Indians And this arose not so much from the superior strength or agility of the whites over their red foes as from that bull dog courage and utter recklessness of their lives in combat qualities which the crafty savage can neither imitate nor understand The information was received with perfect indifference by most of the trappers and with contemptuous laughter by some for a large number of Cameron s men were wild evil disposed fellows who would have as gladly taken the life of an Indian as a buffalo Just as the word was given to resume the march Dick Varley rode up to Cameron and said in a somewhat anxious tone D ye obsarve sir that one o the Red skins has gone off ahead o his comrades I see that Master Dick and it was a mistake of mine not to have stopped him but he was gone too far before I observed it and I thought it better to appear unconcerned We must push on though and give him as short time as possible to talk with his comrades in the camp The trappers pressed forward accordingly at a gallop and were soon in front of the clump of trees amongst which the Peigans were encamped Their approach had evidently spread great alarm among them for there was a good deal of bustle and running to and fro but by the time the trappers had dismounted and advanced in a body on foot the savages had resumed their usual quiet dignity of appearance and were seated calmly round their fires with their bows and arrows beside them There were no tents no women or children and the general aspect of the men showed Cameron conclusively that his surmise about their being a war party was correct A council was immediately called the trappers ranged themselves on one side of the council fire and the Indians on the other Meanwhile our friend Crusoe had been displaying considerable irritability against the Indians and he would certainly have attacked the whole two hundred single handed if he had not been ordered by his master to lie still but never in his life before had Crusoe obeyed with such a bad grace He bristled and whined in a low tremulous tone and looked imploringly at Dick as if for permission to fly at them The Pale faced traders are glad to meet with the Peigans began Cameron who determined to make no allusion to his knowledge that they were a war party for they wish to be friends with all the children of the woods and prairies They wish to trade with them to exchange blankets and guns and beads and other goods which the Peigans require for furs of animals which the Pale faces require Ho ho exclaimed the Indians which expression might be translated Hear hear But continued Cameron we wish to have no war We wish to see the hatchet buried and to see all the Red men and the white men smoking the pipe of peace and hunting like brothers The Ho ho ing at this was very emphatic Now resumed the trader the Peigans have got two prisoners two Pale faces in their camp and as we cannot be on good terms while our brothers are detained we have come to ask for them and to present some gifts to the Peigans To this there was no Ho at all but a prolonged silence which was at length interrupted by a tall chief stepping forward to address the trappers What the Pale face chief has said is good began the Indian His words are wise and his heart is not double The Red men are willing to smoke the pipe of peace and to hunt with all men as brothers but they cannot do it while many of their scalps are hanging in the lodges of their enemies and fringing the robes of the warriors The Peigans must have vengeance then they will make peace After a short pause he continued The chief is wrong when he says there are Pale faces in the Peigan camp The Peigans are not at war with the Pale faces neither have they seen any on their march The camp is open Let the Pale faces look round and see that what we say is true The chief waved his hand towards his warriors as he concluded as if to say Search amongst them There are no Pale faces there Cameron now spoke to Dick in a low tone They speak confidently he said and I fear greatly that your poor comrades have either been killed or conveyed away from the camp and hidden among the mountains in which case even though they should not be far off it would be next to impossible to find them especially when such a band o rascals is near compelling us to keep together But I ll try what a little tempting them with goods will do At any rate we shan t give in without a scuffle It now for the first time flashed across Dick Varley that there was something more than he imagined in Crusoe s restless anxiety which had not in the least abated and the idea of making use of him now occurred to his mind I ve a notion that I ll settle this matter in a shorter time than you think he said hurriedly if you ll agree to try what threatening will do The trader looked grave and undecided I never resort to that except as a last hope he answered but I ve a good deal of confidence in your prudence what would you advise Dick and the trader whispered a few minutes together while some of the men in order to show the Indians how perfectly unconcerned they were and how ready for anything took out their pipes and began to smoke Both parties were seated on the ground and during this interval the Indians also held eager discussion At length Cameron stood up and said to his men in a quiet tone Be ready lads for instant action when I give the word Up spring to your feet and cock your guns but don t fire a shot till you get the word He then stepped forward and said The Peigan warriors are double tongued they know that they have hid the Pale face prisoners We do not wish to quarrel but if they are not delivered up at once the Pale faces and the Peigans will not be friends Upon this the Indian chief again stood forward and said The Peigans are not double tongued They have not seen Pale faces till to day They can say no more Without moving hand or foot Cameron then said in a firm tone The first Peigan that moves shall die Up lads and ready In the twinkling of an eye the trappers sprang to their feet and cocking their rifles stood perfectly motionless scowling at the savages who were completely taken by surprise at the unusual suddenness and informality of such a declaration of war Not a man moved for unlike white men they seldom risk their lives in open fight and as they looked at the formidable row of muzzles that waited but a word to send instant death into their midst they felt that discretion was at that time the better part of valour Now said Cameron while Dick Varley and Crusoe stepped up beside him my young warrior will search for the Pale face prisoners If they are found we will take them and go away If they are not found we will ask the Peigans to forgive us and will give them gifts But in the meantime if a Peigan moves from the spot where he sits or lifts a bow my young men shall fire and the Peigans know that the rifle of the Pale face always kills Without waiting for an answer Dick immediately said Seek em out pup and Crusoe bounded away For a few minutes he sprang hither and thither through the camp quite regardless of the Indians and snuffed the air several times whining in an excited tone as if to relieve his feelings Then he put his nose to the ground and ran straight forward into the woods Dick immediately bounded after him like a deer while the trappers kept silent guard over the savages For some time Crusoe ran straight forward Then he came to a spot where there was a good deal of drifted snow on the ground Here he seemed to lose the trail for a little and ran about in all directions whining in a most piteous tone Seek em out pup repeated Dick encouragingly while his own breast heaved with excitement and expectation In a few seconds the dog resumed its onward course and led the way into a wild dark spot which was so overshadowed by trees and precipitous cliffs that the light of the sun scarce found entrance There were many huge masses of rock scattered over the ground which had fallen from the cliffs Behind one of these lay a mound of dried leaves towards which Crusoe darted and commenced scraping violently Trembling with dread that he should find this to be the grave of his murdered companions Dick rushed forward and hastily cleared away the leaves The first handful thrown off revealed part of the figure of a man Dick s heart beat audibly as he cleared the leaves from the face and he uttered a suppressed cry on beholding the well known features of Joe Blunt But they were not those of a dead man Joe s eyes met his with a scowl of anger which instantly gave place to one of intense surprise Joe Blunt exclaimed Dick in a voice of intense amazement while Crusoe sniffed round the heap of leaves and whined with excitement But Joe did not move neither did he speak a word in reply for the very good reasons that his mouth was tightly bound with a band of leather his hands and feet were tied and his whole body was secured in a rigid immovable position by being bound to a pole of about his own length In a moment Dick s knife was out bands and cords were severed and Joe Blunt was free Thank God exclaimed Joe with a deep earnest sigh the instant his lips were loosened and thanks to you lad he added endeavouring to rise but his limbs had become so benumbed in consequence of the cords by which they had been compressed that for some time he could not move I ll rub ye Joe I ll soon rub ye into a right state said Dick going down on his knees No no lad look sharp and dig up Henri He s just beside me here Dick immediately rose and pushing aside the heap of leaves found Henri securely bound in the same fashion But he could scarce refrain from laughing at the expression of that worthy s face Hearing the voices of Joe and Dick Varley in conversation though unable to see their persons he was filled with such unbounded amazement that his eyes when uncovered were found to be at their largest possible stretch and as for the eyebrows they were gone utterly lost among the roots of his voluminous hair Henri friend I knew I should find ye said Dick cutting the thongs that bound him Get up if ye can we haven t much time to lose an mayhap we ll have to fight afore we re done wi the Red skins Can ye rise Henri could do nothing but lie on his back and gasp Eh possible mon frere Oh non non not possible Oui my broder Deek Here he attempted to rise but being unable fell back again and the whole thing came so suddenly and made so deep an impression on his impulsive mind that he incontinently burst into tears then he burst into a long laugh Suddenly he paused and scrambling up to a sitting posture looked earnestly into Dick s face through his tearful eyes Oh non non he exclaimed stretching himself out at full length again and closing his eyes it are too goot to be true I am dream I vill wait till I am wake Dick roused him out of this resolute sleep however somewhat roughly Meanwhile Joe had rubbed and kicked himself into a state of animation exclaiming that he felt as if he wos walkin on a thousand needles and pins and in a few minutes they were ready to accompany their overjoyed deliverer back to the Peigan camp Crusoe testified his delight in various elephantine gambols round the persons of his old friends who were not slow to acknowledge his services They haven t treated us overly well remarked Joe Blunt as they strode through the underwood Non de rascale vraiment de am villains Oui How de have talk too bout oh o oo ooo wah roastin us alive an puttin our scalp in de vigvam for de poopoose to play wid Well niver mind Henri we ll be quits wi them now said Joe as they came in sight of the two bands who remained in precisely the same position in which they had been left except that one or two of the more reckless of the trappers had lit their pipes and taken to smoking without however laying down their rifles or taking their eyes off the savages A loud cheer greeted the arrival of the prisoners and looks of considerable discomfort began to be evinced by the Indians Glad to see you friends said Cameron as they came up Ve is appy ov de same replied Henri swaggering up in the joviality of his heart and seizing the trader s hand in his own enormous fist Shall ve go to york an slay dem all at vonce or von at a time We ll consider that afterwards my lad Meantime go you to the rear and get a weapon of some sort Oui Ah c est charmant he cried going with an immense flounder into the midst of the amused trappers and slapping those next to him on the back Give me veapon do mes ami gun pistol anyting cannon if you have von Meanwhile Cameron and Joe spoke together for a few moments You had goods with you and horses I believe when you were captured said the former Ay that we had Yonder stand the horses under the pine tree along wi the rest o the Red skin troop an a hard time they ve had o t as their bones may tell without speakin As for the goods he continued glancing round the camp I don t know where ah yes there they be in the old pack I see all safe Cameron now addressed the Indians The Peigans he said have not done well Their hearts have not been true to the Pale faces Even now I could take your scalps where you sit but white men do not like war they do not like revenge The Peigans may go free Considering the fewness of their numbers this was bold language to use towards the Indians but the boldest is generally the best policy on such occasions Moreover Cameron felt that being armed with rifles while the Indians had only bows and arrows the trappers had a great advantage over them The Indian who had spoken before now rose and said he was sorry there should be any cause of difference between them and added he was sorry for a great many more things besides but he did not say he was sorry for having told a lie But before you go you must deliver up the horses and goods belonging to these men said Cameron pointing to Joe and Henri This was agreed to The horses were led out the two little packs containing Joe s goods were strapped upon them and then the trappers turned to depart The Indians did not move until they had mounted then they rose and advanced in a body to the edge of the wood to see the Pale faces go away Meanwhile Joe spoke a few words to Cameron and the men were ordered to halt while the former dismounted and led his horse towards the band of savages Peigans he said you know the object for which I came into this country was to make peace between you and the Pale faces I have often told you so when you would not listen and when you told me that I had a double heart and told lies You were wrong when you said this but I do not wonder for you live among nations who do not fear God and who think it right to lie I now repeat to you what I said before It would be good for the Red men if they would make peace with the Pale faces and if they would make peace with each other I will now convince you that I am in earnest and have all along been speaking the truth Hereupon Joe Blunt opened his bundle of goods and presented fully one half of the gaudy and brilliant contents to the astonished Indians who seemed quite taken aback by such generous treatment The result of this was that the two parties separated with mutual expressions of esteem and good will The Indians then returned to the forest and the white men galloped back to their camp among the hills CHAPTER TWENTY NEW PLANS OUR TRAVELLERS JOIN THE FUR TRADERS AND SEE MANY STRANGE THINGS A CURIOUS FIGHT A NARROW ESCAPE AND A PRISONER TAKEN Not long after the events related in the last chapter our four friends Dick and Joe and Henri and Crusoe agreed to become for a time members of Walter Cameron s band of trappers Joe joined because one of the objects which the traders had in view was similar to his own mission namely the promoting of peace among the various Indian tribes of the mountains and plains to the west Joe therefore thought it a good opportunity of travelling with a band of men who could secure him a favourable hearing from the Indian tribes they might chance to meet with in the course of their wanderings Besides as the traders carried about a large supply of goods with them he could easily replenish his own nearly exhausted pack by hunting wild animals and exchanging their skins for such articles as he might require Dick joined because it afforded him an opportunity of seeing the wild majestic scenery of the Rocky Mountains and shooting the big horned sheep which abounded there and the grizzly bars as Joe named them or Caleb as they were more frequently styled by Henri and the other men Henri joined because it was agreeable to the inclination of his own rollicking blundering floundering crashing disposition and because he would have joined anything that had been joined by the other two Crusoe s reason for joining was single simple easy to be expressed easy to be understood and commendable He joined because Dick did The very day after the party left the encampment where Dick had shot the grizzly bear and the deer he had the satisfaction of bringing down a splendid specimen of the big horned sheep It came suddenly out from a gorge of the mountain and stood upon the giddy edge of a tremendous precipice at a distance of about two hundred and fifty yards You could not hit that said a trapper to Henri who was rather fond of jeering him about his short sightedness Non cried Henri who didn t see the animal in the least say you dat ve shall see and he let fly with a promptitude that amazed his comrades and with a result that drew from them peals of laughter Why you have missed the mountain Oh non dat am eempossoble It was true nevertheless for his ball had been arrested in its flight by the stem of a tree not twenty yards before him While the shot was yet ringing and before the laugh above referred to had pealed forth Dick Varley fired and the animal springing wildly into the air fell down the precipice and was almost dashed to pieces at their feet This Rocky Mountain or big horned sheep was a particularly large and fine one but being a patriarch of the flock was not well suited for food It was considerably larger in size than the domestic sheep and might be described as somewhat resembling a deer in the body and a ram in the head Its horns were the chief point of interest to Dick and truly they were astounding Their enormous size was out of all proportion to the animal s body and they curved backwards and downwards and then curled up again in a sharp point These creatures frequent the inaccessible heights of the Rocky Mountains and are difficult to approach They have a great fondness for salt and pay regular visits to the numerous caverns of these mountains which are encrusted with a saline substance Walter Cameron now changed his intention of proceeding to the eastward as he found the country not so full of beaver at that particular spot as he had anticipated He therefore turned towards the west penetrated into the interior of the mountains and took a considerable sweep through the lovely valleys on their western slopes The expedition which this enterprising fur trader was conducting was one of the first that ever penetrated these wild regions in search of furs The ground over which they travelled was quite new to them and having no guide they just moved about at haphazard encamping on the margin of every stream or river on which signs of the presence of beaver were discovered and setting their traps Beaver skins at this time were worth twenty five shillings a piece in the markets of civilised lands and in the Snake country through which our friends were travelling thousands of them were to be had from the Indians for trinkets and baubles that were scarce worth a farthing A beaver skin could be procured from the Indians for a brass finger ring or a penny looking glass Horses were also so numerous that one could be procured for an axe or a knife Let not the reader however hastily conclude that the traders cheated the Indians in this traffic though the profits were so enormous The ring or the axe was indeed a trifle to the trader but the beaver skin and the horse were equally trifles to the savage who could procure as many of them as he chose with very little trouble while the ring and the axe were in his estimation of priceless value Besides be it remembered to carry that ring and that axe to the far distant haunts of the Red man cost the trader weeks and months of constant toil trouble anxiety and alas too frequently cost him his life The state of trade is considerably modified in these regions at the present day It is not more justly conducted for in respect of the value of goods given for furs it was justly conducted then but time and circumstances have tended more to equalise the relative values of articles of trade The snow which had prematurely fallen had passed away and the trappers now found themselves wandering about in a country so beautiful and a season so delightful that it would have seemed to them a perfect paradise but for the savage tribes who hovered about them and kept them ever on the qui vive They soon passed from the immediate embrace of stupendous heights and dark gorges to a land of sloping ridges which divided the country into a hundred luxuriant vales composed part of woodland and part of prairie Through these numerous rivers and streams flowed deviously beautifying the landscape and enriching the land There were also many lakes of all sizes and these swarmed with fish while in some of them were found the much sought after and highly esteemed beaver Salt springs and hot springs of various temperatures abounded here and many of the latter were so hot that meat could be boiled in them Salt existed in all directions in abundance and of good quality A sulphurous spring was also discovered bubbling out from the base of a perpendicular rock three hundred feet high the waters of which were dark blue and tasted like gunpowder In short the land presented every variety of feature calculated to charm the imagination and delight the eye It was a mysterious land too for broad rivers burst in many places from the earth flowed on a short space and then disappeared as if by magic into the earth from which they rose Natural bridges spanned the torrents in many places and some of these were so correctly formed that it was difficult to believe they had not been built by the hand of man They often appeared opportunely to our trappers and saved them the trouble and danger of fording rivers Frequently the whole band would stop in silent wonder and awe as they listened to the rushing of waters under their feet as if another world of streams and rapids and cataracts were flowing below the crust of earth on which they stood Some considerable streams were likewise observed to gush from the faces of precipices some twenty or thirty feet from their summits while on the top no water was to be seen Wild berries of all kinds were found in abundance and wild vegetables besides many nutritious roots Among other fish splendid salmon were found in the lakes and rivers and animal life swarmed on hill and dale Woods and valleys plains and ravines teemed with it On every plain the red deer grazed in herds by the banks of lake and stream wherever there were clusters of poplar and elder trees and saplings the beaver was seen nibbling industriously with his sharp teeth and committing as much havoc in the forests as if they had been armed with the woodman s axe otters sported in the eddies racoons sat in the tree tops the marten the black fox and the wolf prowled in the woods in quest of prey mountain sheep and goats browsed on the rocky ridges and badgers peeped from their holes Here too the wild horse sprang snorting and dishevelled from his mountain retreats with flourishing mane and tail spanking step and questioning gaze and thundered away over the plains and valleys while the rocks echoed back his shrill neigh The huge heavy ungainly elk or moose deer trotted away from the travellers with speed equal to that of the mustang Elks seldom gallop their best speed is attained at the trot Bears too black and brown and grizzly roamed about everywhere So numerous were all these creatures that on one occasion the hunters of the party brought in six wild horses three bears four elks and thirty red deer having shot them all a short distance ahead of the main body and almost without diverging from the line of march And this was a matter of every day occurrence as it had need to be considering the number of mouths that had to be filled The feathered tribes were not less numerous Chief among these were eagles and vultures of uncommon size the wild goose wild duck and the majestic swan In the midst of such profusion the trappers spent a happy time of it when not molested by the savages but they frequently lost a horse or two in consequence of the expertness of these thievish fellows They often wandered however for days at a time without seeing an Indian and at such times they enjoyed to the full the luxuries with which a bountiful God had blessed these romantic regions Dick Varley was almost wild with delight It was his first excursion into the remote wilderness he was young healthy strong and romantic and it is a question whether his or his dog s heart or that of the noble wild horse he bestrode bounded most with joy at the glorious sights and sounds and influences by which they were surrounded It would have been perfection had it not been for the frequent annoyance and alarms caused by the Indians Alas alas that we who write and read about those wondrous scenes should have to condemn our own species as the most degraded of all the works of the Creator there Yet so it is Man exercising his reason and conscience in the path of love and duty which his Creator points out is God s noblest work but man left to the freedom of his own fallen will sinks morally lower than the beasts that perish Well may every Christian wish and pray that the name and the gospel of the blessed Jesus may be sent speedily to the dark places of the earth for you may read of and talk about but you cannot conceive the fiendish wickedness and cruelty which causes tearless eyes to glare and maddened hearts to burst in the lands of the heathen While we are on this subject let us add and our young readers will come to know it if they are spared to see many years that civilisation alone will never improve the heart Let history speak and it will tell you that deeds of darkest hue have been perpetrated in so called civilised though pagan lands Civilisation is like the polish that beautifies inferior furniture which water will wash off if it be but hot enough Christianity resembles dye which permeates every fibre of the fabric and which nothing can eradicate The success of the trappers in procuring beaver here was great In all sorts of creeks and rivers they were found One day they came to one of the curious rivers before mentioned which burst suddenly out of a plain flowed on for several miles and then disappeared into the earth as suddenly as it had risen Even in this strange place beaver were seen so the traps were set and a hundred and fifty were caught at the first lift The manner in which the party proceeded was as follows They marched in a mass in groups or in a long line according to the nature of the ground over which they travelled The hunters of the party went forward a mile or two in advance and scattered through the woods After them came the advance guard being the bravest and most stalwart of the men mounted on their best steeds and with rifle in hand immediately behind followed the women and children also mounted and the pack horses with the goods and camp equipage Another band of trappers formed the rear guard to this imposing cavalcade There was no strict regimental order kept but the people soon came to adopt the arrangements that were most convenient for all parties and at length fell naturally into their places in the line of march Joe Blunt usually was the foremost and always the most successful of the hunters He was therefore seldom seen on the march except at the hour of starting and at night when he came back leading his horse which always groaned under its heavy load of meat Henri being a hearty jovial soul and fond of society usually kept with the main body As for Dick he was everywhere at once at least as much so as it is possible for human nature to be His horse never wearied it seemed to delight in going at full speed no other horse in the troop could come near Charlie and Dick indulged him by appearing now at the front now at the rear anon in the centre and frequently nowhere having gone off with Crusoe like a flash of lightning after a buffalo or a deer Dick soon proved himself to be the best hunter of the party and it was not long before he fulfilled his promise to Crusoe and decorated his neck with a collar of grizzly bear claws Well when the trappers came to a river where there were signs of beaver they called a halt and proceeded to select a safe and convenient spot near wood and water for the camp Here the property of the band was securely piled in such a manner as to form a breastwork or slight fortification and here Walter Cameron established head quarters This was always the post of danger being exposed to sudden attack by prowling savages who often dogged the footsteps of the party in their journeyings to see what they could steal But Cameron was an old hand and they found it difficult to escape his vigilant eye From this point all the trappers were sent forth in small parties every morning in various directions some on foot and some on horseback according to the distances they had to go but they never went further than twenty miles as they had to return to camp every evening Each trapper had ten steel traps allowed him These he set every night and visited every morning sometimes oftener when practicable selecting a spot in the stream where many trees had been cut down by beavers for the purpose of damming up the water In some places as many as fifty tree stumps were seen in one spot within the compass of half an acre all cut through at about eighteen inches from the root We may remark in passing that the beaver is very much like a gigantic water rat with this marked difference that its tail is very broad and flat like a paddle The said tail is a greatly esteemed article of food as indeed is the whole body at certain seasons of the year The beaver s fore legs are very small and short and it uses its paws as hands to convey food to its mouth sitting the while in an erect position on its hind legs and tail Its fur is a dense coat of a greyish coloured down concealed by long coarse hair which lies smooth and is of a bright chestnut colour Its teeth and jaws are of enormous power with them it can cut through the branch of a tree as thick as a walking stick at one snap and as we have said it gnaws through thick trees themselves As soon as a tree falls the beavers set to work industriously to lop off the branches which as well as the smaller trunks they cut into lengths according to their weight and thickness These are then dragged by main force to the water side launched and floated to their destination Beavers build their houses or lodges under the banks of rivers and lakes and always select those of such depth of water that there is no danger of their being frozen to the bottom when such cannot be found and they are compelled to build in small rivulets of insufficient depth these clever little creatures dam up the waters until they are deep enough The banks thrown up by them across rivulets for this purpose are of great strength and would do credit to human engineers Their lodges are built of sticks mud and stones which form a compact mass this freezes solid in winter and defies the assaults of that house breaker the wolverine an animal which is the beaver s implacable foe From this lodge which is capable often of holding four old and six or eight young ones a communication is maintained with the water below the ice so that should the wolverine succeed in breaking up the lodge he finds the family not at home they having made good their retreat by the back door When man acts the part of house breaker however he cunningly shuts the back door first by driving stakes through the ice and thus stopping the passage Then he enters and we almost regret to say finds the family at home We regret it because the beaver is a gentle peaceable affectionate hairy little creature towards which one feels an irresistible tenderness But to return from this long digression Our trappers having selected their several localities set their traps in the water so that when the beavers roamed about at night they put their feet into them and were caught and drowned for although they can swim and dive admirably they cannot live altogether under water Thus the different parties proceeded and in the mornings the camp was a busy scene indeed for then the whole were engaged in skinning the animals The beavers thus taken were always skinned stretched dried folded up with the hair in the inside laid by and the flesh used for food But oftentimes the trappers had to go forth with the gun in one hand and their traps in the other while they kept a sharp look out on the bushes to guard against surprise Despite their utmost efforts a horse was occasionally stolen before their very eyes and sometimes even an unfortunate trapper was murdered and all his traps carried off An event of this kind occurred soon after the party had gained the western slopes of the mountains Three Iroquois Indians who belonged to the band of trappers were sent to a stream about ten miles off Having reached their destination they all entered the water to set their traps foolishly neglecting the usual precaution of one remaining on the bank to protect the others They had scarcely commenced operations when three arrows were discharged into their backs and a party of Snake Indians rushed upon and slew them carrying away their traps and horses and scalps This was not known for several days when becoming anxious about their prolonged absence Cameron sent out a party which found their mangled bodies affording a loathsome banquet to the wolves and vultures After this sad event the trappers were more careful to go in larger parties and keep watch As long as beaver were taken in abundance the camp remained stationary but whenever the beaver began to grow scarce the camp was raised and the party moved on to another valley One day Dick Varley came galloping into camp with the news that there were several bears in a valley not far distant which he was anxious not to disturb until a number of the trappers were collected together to go out and surround them On receiving the information Walter Cameron shook his head We have other things to do young man said he than go a hunting after bears I m just about making up my mind to send off a party to search out the valley on the other side of the Blue Mountains yonder and bring back word if there are beaver there for if not I mean to strike away direct south Now if you ve a mind to go with them you re welcome I ll warrant you ll find enough in the way of bear hunting to satisfy you perhaps a little Indian hunting to boot for if the Banattees get hold of your horses you ll have a long hunt before you find them again Will you go Ay right gladly replied Dick When do we start This afternoon Dick went off at once to his own part of the camp to replenish his powder horn and bullet pouch and wipe out his rifle That evening the party under command of a Canadian named Pierre set out for the Blue Hills They numbered twenty men and expected to be absent three days for they merely went to reconnoitre not to trap Neither Joe nor Henri were of this party both having been out hunting when it was organised But Crusoe and Charlie were of course Pierre although a brave and trusty man was of a sour angry disposition and not a favourite with Dick but the latter resolved to enjoy himself and disregard his sulky comrade Being so well mounted he not unfrequently shot far ahead of his companions despite their warnings that he ran great risk by so doing On one of these occasions he and Crusoe witnessed a very singular fight which is worthy of record Dick had felt a little wilder in spirit that morning than usual and on coming to a pretty open plain he gave the rein to Charlie and with an Adieu mes comerades he was out of sight in a few minutes He rode on several miles in advance without checking speed and then came to a wood where rapid motion was inconvenient so he pulled up and dismounting tied Charlie to a tree while he sauntered on a short way on foot On coming to the edge of a small plain he observed two large birds engaged in mortal conflict Crusoe observed them too and would soon have put an end to the fight had Dick not checked him Creeping as close to the belligerents as possible he found that one was a wild turkey cock the other a white headed eagle These two stood with their heads down and all their feathers bristling for a moment then they dashed at each other and struck fiercely with their spurs as our domestic cocks do but neither fell and the fight was continued for about five minutes without apparent advantage on either side Dick now observed that from the uncertainty of its motions the turkey cock was blind a discovery which caused a throb of compunction to enter his breast for standing and looking on so he ran forward The eagle saw him instantly and tried to fly away but was unable from exhaustion At him Crusoe cried Dick whose sympathies all lay with the other bird Crusoe went forward at a bound and was met by a peck between the eyes that would have turned most dogs but Crusoe only winked and the next moment the eagle s career was ended Dick found that the turkey cock was quite blind the eagle having thrust out both its eyes so in mercy he put an end to its sufferings The fight had evidently been a long and severe one for the grass all round the spot for about twenty yards was beaten to the ground and covered with the blood and feathers of the fierce combatants Meditating on the fight which he had just witnessed Dick returned towards the spot where he had left Charlie when he suddenly missed Crusoe from his side Hallo Crusoe here pup where are you he cried The only answer to this was a sharp whizzing sound and an arrow passing close to his ear quivered in a tree beyond Almost at the same moment Crusoe s angry roar was followed by a shriek from some one in fear or agony Cocking his rifle the young hunter sprang through the bushes towards his horse and was just in time to save a Banattee Indian from being strangled by the dog It had evidently scented out this fellow and pinned him just as he was in the act of springing on the back of Charlie for the halter was cut and the savage lay on the ground close beside him Dick called off the dog and motioned to the Indian to rise which he did so nimbly that it was quite evident he had sustained no injury beyond the laceration of his neck by Crusoe s teeth and the surprise He was a tall strong Indian for the tribe to which he belonged so Dick proceeded to secure him at once Pointing to his rifle and to the Indian s breast to show what he might expect if he attempted to escape Dick ordered Crusoe to keep him steady in that position The dog planted himself in front of the savage who began to tremble for his scalp and gazed up in his face with a look which to say the least of it was the reverse of amiable while Dick went towards his horse for the purpose of procuring a piece of cord to tie him with The Indian naturally turned his head to see what was going to be done but a peculiar gurgle in Crusoe s throat made him turn it round again very smartly and he did not venture thereafter to move a muscle In a few seconds Dick returned with a piece of leather and tied his hands behind his back While this was being done the Indian glanced several times at his bow which lay a few feet away where it had fallen when the dog caught him but Crusoe seemed to understand him for he favoured him with such an additional display of teeth and such a low apparently distant almost we might say subterranean rumble that he resigned himself to his fate His hands secured a long line was attached to his neck with a running noose so that if he ventured to run away the attempt would effect its own cure by producing strangulation The other end of this line was given to Crusoe who at the word of command marched him off while Dick mounted Charlie and brought up the rear Great was the laughter and merriment when this apparition met the eyes of the trappers but when they heard that he had attempted to shoot Dick their ire was raised and a court martial was held on the spot Hang the reptile cried one Burn him shouted another No no said a third don t imitate them villains don t be cruel Let s shoot him Shoot im cried Pierre Oui dat is de ting it too goot pour lui mais it shall be dooed Don t ye think lads it would be better to let the poor wretch off said Dick Varley he d p raps give a good account o us to his people There was a universal shout of contempt at this mild proposal Unfortunately few of the men sent on this exploring expedition were imbued with the peacemaking spirit of their chief and most of them seemed glad to have a chance of venting their hatred of the poor Indians on this unhappy wretch who although calm looked sharply from one speaker to another to gather hope if possible from the tones of their voices Dick was resolved at the risk of a quarrel with Pierre to save the poor man s life and had made up his mind to insist on having him conducted to the camp to be tried by Cameron when one of the men suggested that they should take the savage to the top of a hill about three miles further on and there hang him up on a tree as a warning to all his tribe Agreed agreed cried the men come on Dick too seemed to agree to this proposal and hastily ordered Crusoe to run on ahead with the savage an order which the dog obeyed so vigorously that before the men had done laughing at him he was a couple of hundred yards ahead of them Take care that he don t get off cried Dick springing on Charlie and stretching out at a gallop In a moment he was beside the Indian Scraping together the little of the Indian language he knew he stooped down and cutting the thongs that bound him said Go white men love the Indians The man cast on his deliverer one glance of surprise and the next moment bounded aside into the bushes and was gone A loud shout from the party behind showed that this act had been observed and Crusoe stood with the end of the line in his mouth and an expression on his face that said You re absolutely incomprehensible Dick It s all right I know but to my feeble capacity it seems wrong Fat for you do dat shouted Pierre in a rage as he came up with a menacing look Dick confronted him The prisoner was mine I had a right to do with him as it liked me True true cried several of the men who had begun to repent of their resolution and were glad the savage was off The lad s right Get along Pierre You had no right you vas wrong Oui et I have goot vill to give you one knock on de nose Dick looked Pierre in the face as he said this in a manner that cowed him It is time he said quietly pointing to the sun to go on Your bourgeois expects that time won t be wasted Pierre muttered something in an angry tone and wheeling round his horse dashed forward at full gallop followed by the rest of the men The trappers encamped that night on the edge of a wide grassy plain which offered such tempting food for the horses that Pierre resolved to forego his usual cautious plan of picketting them close to the camp and set them loose on the plain merely hobbling them to prevent their straying far Dick remonstrated but in vain An insolent answer was all he got for his pains He determined however to keep Charlie close beside him all night and also made up his mind to keep a sharp look out on the other horses At supper he again remonstrated No fraid said Pierre whose pipe was beginning to improve his temper The red reptiles no dare to come in open plain when de moon so clear Dun know that said a taciturn trapper who seldom ventured a remark of any kind them varmints ud steal the two eyes out o you head when they set their hearts on t Dat ar umposs ble for de have no hearts said a half breed dey have von hole vere de heart vas be This was received with a shout of laughter in the midst of which an appalling yell was heard and as if by magic four Indians were seen on the backs of four of the best horses yelling like fiends and driving all the other horses furiously before them over the plain How they got there was a complete mystery but the men did not wait to consider that point Catching up their guns they sprang after them with the fury of madmen and were quickly scattered far and wide Dick ordered Crusoe to follow and help the men and turned to spring on the back of Charlie but at that moment he observed an Indian s head and shoulders rise above the grass not fifty yards in advance from him so without hesitation he darted forward intending to pounce upon him Well would it have been for Dick Varley had he at that time possessed a little more experience of the wiles and stratagems of the Banattees The Snake nation is subdivided into several tribes of which those inhabiting the Rocky Mountains called the Banattees are the most perfidious Indeed they are confessedly the banditti of the hills and respect neither friend nor foe but rob all who come in their way Dick reached the spot where the Indian had disappeared in less than a minute but no savage was to be seen Thinking he had crept ahead he ran on a few yards further and darted about hither and thither while his eye glanced from side to side Suddenly a shout in the camp attracted his attention and looking back he beheld the savage on Charlie s back turning to fly Next moment he was off and away far beyond the hope of recovery Dick had left his rifle in the camp otherwise the savage would have gone but a short way as it was Dick returned and sitting down on a mound of grass stared straight before him with a feeling akin to despair Even Crusoe could not have helped him had he been there for nothing on four legs or on two could keep pace with Charlie The Banattee achieved this feat by adopting a stratagem which invariably deceives those who are ignorant of their habits and tactics When suddenly pursued the Banattee sinks into the grass and serpentlike creeps along with wonderful rapidity not from but towards his enemy taking care however to avoid him so that when the pursuer reaches the spot where the pursued is supposed to be hiding he hears him shout a yell of defiance far away in the rear It was thus that the Banattee eluded Dick and gained the camp almost as soon as the other reached the spot where he had disappeared One by one the trappers came back weary raging and despairing In a short time they all assembled and soon began to reproach each other Ere long one or two had a fight which resulted in several bloody noses and black eyes thus adding to the misery which one would think had been bad enough without such additions At last they finished their suppers and their pipes and then lay down to sleep under the trees till morning when they arose in a particularly silent and sulky mood rolled up their blankets strapped their things on their shoulders and began to trudge slowly back to the camp on foot CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WOLVES ATTACK THE HORSES AND CAMERON CIRCUMVENTS THE WOLVES A BEAR HUNT IN WHICH HENRI SHINES CONSPICUOUS JOE AND THE NATTER LIST AN ALARM A SURPRISE AND A CAPTURE We must now return to the camp where Walter Cameron still guarded the goods and the men pursued their trapping avocations Here seven of the horses had been killed in one night by wolves while grazing in a plain close to the camp and on the night following a horse that had strayed was also torn to pieces and devoured The prompt and daring manner in which this had been done convinced the trader that white wolves had unfortunately scented them out and he set several traps in the hope of capturing them White wolves are quite distinct from the ordinary wolves that prowl through woods and plains in large packs They are much larger weighing sometimes as much as a hundred and thirty pounds but they are comparatively scarce and move about alone or in small bands of three or four Their strength is enormous and they are so fierce that they do not hesitate upon occasions to attack man himself Their method of killing horses is very deliberate Two wolves generally undertake the cold blooded murder They approach their victim with the most innocent looking and frolicsome gambols lying down and rolling about and frisking pleasantly until the horse becomes a little accustomed to them Then one approaches right in front the other in rear still frisking playfully until they think themselves near enough when they make a simultaneous rush The wolf which approaches in rear is the true assailant the rush of the other is a mere feint then both fasten on the poor horse s haunches and never let go till the sinews are cut and he is rolling on his side The horse makes comparatively little struggle in this deadly assault He seems paralysed and soon falls to rise no more Cameron set his traps towards evening in a circle with a bait in the centre and then retired to rest Next morning he called Joe Blunt and the two went off together It is strange that these rascally white wolves should be so bold when the smaller kinds are so cowardly remarked Cameron as they walked along So tis replied Joe but I ve seed them other chaps bold enough too in the prairie when they were in large packs and starvin I believe the small wolves follow the big fellows and help them to eat what they kill though they generally sit round and look on at the killing Hist exclaimed Joe cocking his gun there he is an no mistake There he was undoubtedly A wolf of the largest size with one of his feet in the trap He was a terrible looking object for besides his immense size and naturally ferocious aspect his white hair bristled on end and was all covered with streaks and spots of blood from his bloody jaws In his efforts to escape he had bitten the trap until he had broken his teeth and lacerated his gums so that his appearance was hideous in the extreme And when the two men came up he struggled with all his might to fly at them Cameron and Joe stood looking at him in a sort of wondering admiration We d better put a ball in him suggested Joe after a time Mayhap the chain won t stand sich tugs long True Joe if it breaks we might get an ugly nip before we killed him So saying Cameron fired into the wolf s head and killed it It was found on examination that four wolves had been in the traps but the rest had escaped Two of them however had gnawed off their paws and left them lying in the traps After this the big wolves did not trouble them again The same afternoon a bear hunt was undertaken which well nigh cost one of the Iroquois his life It happened thus While Cameron and Joe were away after the white wolves Henri came floundering into camp tossing his arms like a maniac and shouting that seven bars wos be down in de bush close bye It chanced that this was an idle day with most of the men so they all leaped on their horses and taking guns and knives sallied forth to give battle to the bears Arrived at the scene of action they found the seven bears busily engaged in digging up roots so the men separated in order to surround them and then closed in The place was partly open and partly covered with thick bushes into which a horseman could not penetrate The moment the bears got wind of what was going forward they made off as fast as possible and then commenced a scene of firing galloping and yelling that defies description Four out of the seven were shot before they gained the bushes the other three were wounded but made good their retreat As their places of shelter however were like islands in the plain they had no chance of escaping The horsemen now dismounted and dashed recklessly into the bushes where they soon discovered and killed two of the bears the third was not found for some time At last an Iroquois came upon it so suddenly that he had not time to point his gun before the bear sprang upon him and struck him to the earth where it held him down Instantly the place was surrounded by eager men but the bushes were so thick and the fallen trees among which the bear stood were so numerous that they could not use their guns without running the risk of shooting their companion Most of them drew their knives and seemed about to rush on the bear with these but the monster s aspect as it glared round was so terrible that they held back for a moment in hesitation At this moment Henri who had been at some distance engaged in the killing of one of the other bears came rushing forward after his own peculiar manner Ah fat is eet hay de bar no go under yit Just then his eye fell on the wounded Iroquois with the bear above him and he uttered a yell so intense in tone that the bear himself seemed to feel that something decisive was about to be done at last Henri did not pause but with a flying dash he sprang like a spread eagle arms and legs extended right into the bear s bosom At the same moment he sent his long hunting knife down into its heart But Bruin is proverbially hard to kill and although mortally wounded he had strength enough to open his jaws and close them on Henri s neck There was a cry of horror and at the same moment a volley was fired at the bear s head for the trappers felt that it was better to risk shooting their comrades than see them killed before their eyes Fortunately the bullets took effect and tumbled him over at once without doing damage to either of the men although several of the balls just grazed Henri s temple and carried off his cap Although uninjured by the shot the poor Iroquois had not escaped scatheless from the paw of the bear His scalp was torn almost off and hung down over his eyes while blood streamed down his face He was conveyed by his comrades to the camp where he lay two days in a state of insensibility at the end of which time he revived and recovered daily Afterwards when the camp moved he had to be carried but in the course of two months he was as well as ever and quite as fond of bear hunting Among other trophies of this hunt there were two deer and a buffalo which last had probably strayed from the herd Four or five Iroquois were round this animal whetting their knives for the purpose of cutting it up when Henri passed so he turned aside to watch them perform the operation quite regardless of the fact that his neck and face were covered with blood which flowed from one or two small punctures made by the bear The Indians began by taking off the skin which certainly did not occupy them more than five minutes Then they cut up the meat and made a pack of it and cut out the tongue which is somewhat troublesome as that member requires to be cut out from under the jaw of the animal and not through the natural opening of the mouth One of the fore legs was cut off at the knee joint and this was used as a hammer with which to break the skull for the purpose of taking out the brains these being used in the process of dressing and softening the animal s skin An axe would have been of advantage to break the skull but in the hurry of rushing to the attack the Indians had forgotten their axes so they adopted the common fashion of using the buffalo s hoof as a hammer the shank being the handle The whole operation of flaying cutting up and packing the meat did not occupy more than twenty minutes Before leaving the ground these expert butchers treated themselves to a little of the marrow and warm liver in a raw state Cameron and Joe walked up to the group while they were indulging in this little feast Well I ve often seen that eaten but I never could do it myself remarked the former No cried Joe in surprise now that s oncommon cur us I ve lived on raw liver an marrow bones for two or three days at a time when we wos chased by the Camanchee Injuns and didn t dare to make a fire an it s ra al good it is Won t ye try it now Cameron shook his head No thankee I ll not refuse when I can t help it but until then I ll remain in happy ignorance of how good it is Well it is strange how some folk can t abide anything in the meat way they han t bin used to D ye know I ve actually knowd men from the cities as wouldn t eat a bit o horseflesh for love or money Would ye believe it I can well believe that Joe for I have met with such persons myself in fact they are rather numerous What are you chuckling at Joe Chucklin if ye mean be that larfin in to myself it s because I m thinkin o a chap as once comed out to the prairies Let us walk back to the camp Joe and you can tell me about him as we go along I think continued Joe he comed from Washington but I never could make out right whether he wos a government man or not Anyhow he wos a pheelosopher a natter list I think he call his self A naturalist suggested Cameron Ay that wos more like it Well he wos about six feet two in his moccasins an as thin as a ramrod an as blind as a bat leastways he had weak eyes an wore green spectacles He had on a grey shootin coat and trousers and vest and cap with rid whiskers an a long nose as rid at the point as the whiskers wos Well this gentleman engaged me an another hunter to go a trip with him into the prairies so off we sot one fine day on three hosses with our blankets at our backs we wos to depend on the rifle for victuals At first I thought the Natter list one o the cruellest beggars as iver went on two long legs for he used to go about everywhere pokin pins through all the beetles and flies an creepin things he could sot eyes on an stuck them in a box but he told me he comed here a purpose to git as many o them as he could so says I If that s it I ll fill yer box in no time Will ye says he quite pleased like I will says I an galloped off to a place as was filled wi all sorts o crawlin things So I sets to work and whenever I seed a thing crawlin I sot my fut on it and crushed it and soon filled my breast pocket I coched a lot o butterflies too an stuffed them into my shot pouch and went back in an hour or two an showed him the lot He put on his green spectacles and looked at them as if he d seen a rattlesnake My good man says he you ve crushed them all to pieces They ll taste as good for all that says I for somehow I d taken t in me head that he d heard o the way the Injuns make soup o the grasshoppers an was wantin to try his hand at a new dish He laughed when I said this an told me he wos collectin them to take home to be looked at But that s not wot I wos goin to tell ye about him continued Joe I wos goin to tell ye how we made him eat horseflesh He carried a revolver too this Natter list did to load wi shot as small as dust a most and shoot little birds with I ve seed him miss birds only three feet away with it An one day he drew it all of a suddent and let fly at a big bum bee that wos passin yellin out that it wos the finest wot he had iver seed He missed the bee of coorse cause it was a flyin shot he said but he sent the whole charge right into Martin s back Martin was my comrade s name By good luck Martin had on a thick leather coat so the shot niver got the length o his skin One day I noticed that the Natter list had stuffed small corks into the muzzles of all the six barrels of his revolver I wondered what they wos for but he wos al ays doin sich queer things that I soon forgot it May be thought I jist before it went out o my mind may be he thinks that ll stop the pistol from goin off by accident for ye must know he d let it off three times the first day by accident and well nigh blowed off his leg the last time only the shot lodged in the back o a big toad he d jist stuffed into his breeches pocket Well soon after we shot a buffalo bull so when it fell off he jumps from his horse an runs up to it So did I for I wasn t sure the beast was dead an I had jist got up when it rose an rushed at the Natter list Out o the way I yelled for my rifle was empty but he didn t move so I rushed forward an drew the pistol out o his belt and let fly in the bull s ribs jist as it ran the poor man down Martin came up that moment an put a ball through its heart and then we went to pick up the Natter list He came to in a little an the first thing he said was Where s my revolver When I gave it to him he looked at it an said with a solemcholy shake o the head There s a whole barrel full lost It turned out that he had taken to usin the barrels for bottles to hold things in but he forgot to draw the charges so sure enough I had fired a charge o bum bees an beetles an small shot into the buffalo But that s not what I wos goin to tell ye yet We comed to a part o the plains where we wos well nigh starved for want o game an the Natter list got so thin that ye could a most see through him so I offered to kill my horse an cut it up for meat but you niver saw sich a face he made I d rather die first says he than eat it so we didn t kill it But that very day Martin got a shot at a wild horse and killed it The Natter list was down in the bed o a creek at the time gropin for creepers an he didn t see it He ll niver eat it says Martin That s true says I Let s tell him it s a buffalo says he That would be tellin a lie says I So we stood lookin at each other not knowin what to do I ll tell ye what cries Martin we ll cut it up and take the meat into camp and cook it without sayin a word Done says I that s it for ye must know the poor creature wos no judge o meat He couldn t tell one kind from another an he niver axed questions In fact he niver a most spoke to us all the trip Well we cut up the horse and carried the flesh and marrow bones into camp takin care to leave the hoofs and skin behind and sot to work and roasted steaks and marrow bones When the Natter list came back ye should ha seen the joyful face he put on when he smelt the grub for he was all but starved out poor critter What have we got here cried he rubbin his hands and sittin down Steaks an marrow bones says Martin Capital says he I m so hungry So he fell to work like a wolf I niver seed a man pitch into anything like as that Natter list did into that horseflesh These are first rate marrow bones says he squintin with one eye down the shin bone o the hind leg to see if it was quite empty Yes sir they is answered Martin as grave as a judge Take another sir says I No thankee says he with a sigh for he didn t like to leave off Well we lived for a week on horseflesh an first rate livin it wos then we fell in with buffalo an niver ran short again till we got to the settlements when he paid us our money an shook hands sayin we d had a nice trip an he wished us well Jist as we wos partin I said says I D ye know what it wos we lived on for a week arter we wos well nigh starved in the prairies What says he when we got yon capital marrow bones The same says I yon was horseflesh says I an I think ye ll sur ly niver say again that it isn t first rate livin Yer jokin says he turnin pale It s true sir as true as yer standin there Well would ye believe it he turned that Natter list did as sick as a dog on the spot wot he wos standin on an didn t taste meat again for three days Shortly after the conclusion of Joe s story they reached the camp and here they found the women and children flying about in a state of terror and the few men who had been left in charge arming themselves in the greatest haste Hallo something wrong here cried Cameron hastening forward followed by Joe What has happened eh Injuns comin monsieur look dere answered a trapper pointing down the valley Arm and mount at once and come to the front of the camp cried Cameron in a tone of voice that silenced every other and turned confusion into order The cause of all this outcry was a cloud of dust seen far down the valley which was raised by a band of mounted Indians who approached the camp at full speed Their numbers could not be made out but they were a sufficiently formidable band to cause much anxiety to Cameron whose men at the time were scattered to the various trapping grounds and only ten chanced to be within call of the camp However with these ten he determined to show a bold front to the savages whether they came as friends or foes He therefore ordered the women and children within the citadel formed of the goods and packs of furs piled upon each other which point of retreat was to be defended to the last extremity Then galloping to the front he collected his men and swept down the valley at full speed In a few minutes they were near enough to observe that the enemy only numbered four Indians who were driving a band of about a hundred horses before them and so busy were they in keeping the troop together that Cameron and his men were close upon them before they were observed It was too late to escape Joe Blunt and Henri had already swept round and cut off their retreat In this extremity the Indians slipped from the backs of their steeds and darted into the bushes where they were safe from pursuit at least on horseback while the trappers got behind the horses and drove them towards the camp At this moment one of the horses sprang ahead of the others and made for the mountain with its mane and tail flying wildly in the breeze Marrow bones and buttons shouted one of the men there goes Dick Varley s horse So it am cried Henri and dashed off in pursuit followed by Joe and two others Why these are our own horses said Cameron in surprise as they drove them into a corner of the hills from which they could not escape This was true but it was only half the truth for besides their own horses they had secured upwards of seventy Indian steeds a most acceptable addition to their stud which owing to casualties and wolves had been diminishing too much of late The fact was that the Indians who had captured the horses belonging to Pierre and his party were a small band of robbers who had travelled as was afterwards learned a considerable distance from the south stealing horses from various tribes as they went along As we have seen in an evil hour they fell in with Pierre s party and carried off their steeds which they drove to a pass leading from one valley to the other Here they united them with the main band of their ill gotten gains and while the greater number of the robbers descended further into the plains in search of more booty four of them were sent into the mountains with the horses already procured These four utterly ignorant of the presence of white men in the valley drove their charge as we have seen almost into the camp Cameron immediately organised a party to go out in search of Pierre and his companions about whose fate he became intensely anxious and in the course of half an hour as many men as he could spare with safety were despatched in the direction of the Blue Mountains CHAPTER TWENTY TWO CHARLIE S ADVENTURES WITH SAVAGES AND BEARS TRAPPING LIFE It is one thing to chase a horse it is another thing to catch it Little consideration and less sagacity is required to convince us of the truth of that fact The reader may perhaps venture to think this rather a trifling fact We are not so sure of that In this world of fancies to have any fact incontestably proved and established is a comfort and whatever is a source of comfort to mankind is worthy of notice Surely our reader won t deny that Perhaps he will so we can only console ourself with the remark that there are people in this world who would deny anything who would deny that there was a nose on their face if you said there was Well to return to the point which was the chase of a horse in the abstract from which we will rapidly diverge to the chase of Dick Varley s horse in particular This noble charger having been ridden by savages until all his old fire and blood and metal were worked up to a red heat no sooner discovered that he was pursued than he gave a snort of defiance which he accompanied with a frantic shake of his mane and a fling of contempt in addition to a magnificent wave of his tail then he thundered up the valley at a pace which would speedily have left Joe Blunt and Henri out of sight behind if ay that s the word if what a word that if is what a world of if s we live in There never was anything that wouldn t have been something else if something hadn t intervened to prevent it Yes we repeat Charlie would have left his two friends miles and miles behind in what is called no time if he had not run straight into a gorge which was surrounded by inaccessible precipices and out of which there was no exit except by the entrance which was immediately barred by Henri while Joe advanced to catch the runaway For two hours at least did Joe Blunt essay to catch Charlie and during that space of time he utterly failed The horse seemed to have made up his mind for what is vulgarly termed a lark It won t do Henri said Joe advancing towards his companion and wiping his forehead with the cuff of his leathern coat I can t catch him The wind s a most blowed out o me body Dat am vexatiable replied Henri in a tone of commiseration S pose I wos make try In that case I s pose ye would fail But go ahead an do what ye can I ll hold yer horse So Henri began by a rush and a flourish of legs and arms that nearly frightened the horse out his wits For half an hour he went through all the complications of running and twisting of which he was capable without success when Joe Blunt suddenly uttered a stentorian yell that rooted him to the spot on which he stood To account for this we must explain that in the heights of the Rocky Mountains vast accumulations of snow take place among the crevices and gorges during winter Such of these masses as form on steep slopes are loosened by occasional thaws and are precipitated in the form of avalanches into the valleys below carrying trees and stones along with them in their thundering descent In the gloomy gorge where Dick s horse had taken refuge the precipices were so steep that many avalanches had occurred as was evident from the mounds of heaped snow that lay at the foot of most of them Neither stones nor trees were carried down here however for the cliffs were nearly perpendicular and the snow slipping over their edges had fallen on the grass below Such an avalanche was now about to take place and it was this that caused Joe to utter his cry of alarm and warning Henri and the horse were directly under the cliff over which it was about to be hurled the latter close to the wall of rock the other at some distance away from it Joe cried again Back Henri back vite when the mass flowed over and fell with a roar like prolonged thunder Henri sprang back in time to save his life though he was knocked down and almost stunned but poor Charlie was completely buried under the avalanche which now presented the appearance of a hill of snow The instant Henri recovered sufficiently Joe and he mounted their horses and galloped back to the camp as fast as possible Meanwhile another spectator stepped forward upon the scene they had left and surveyed the snow hill with a critical eye This was no less than a grizzly bear which had unobserved been a spectator and which immediately proceeded to dig into the mound with the purpose no doubt of disentombing the carcase of the horse for purposes of his own While he was thus actively engaged the two hunters reached the camp where they found that Pierre and his party had just arrived The men sent out in search of them had scarcely advanced a mile when they found them trudging back to the camp in a very disconsolate manner But all their sorrows were put to flight on hearing of the curious way in which the horses had been returned to them with interest Scarcely had Dick Varley however congratulated himself on the recovery of his gallant steed when he was thrown into despair by the sudden arrival of Joe with the tidings of the catastrophe we have just related Of course there was a general rush to the rescue Only a few men were ordered to remain to guard the camp while the remainder mounted their horses and galloped towards the gorge where Charlie had been entombed On arriving they found that Bruin had worked with such laudable zeal that nothing but the tip of his tail was seen sticking out of the hole which he had dug The hunters could not refrain from laughing as they sprang to the ground and standing in a semicircle in front of the hole prepared to fire But Crusoe resolved to have the honour of leading the assault He seized fast hold of Bruin s flank and caused his teeth to meet therein Caleb backed out at once and turned round but before he could recover from his surprise a dozen bullets pierced his heart and brain Now lads cried Cameron setting to work with a large wooden shovel work like niggers If there s any life left in the horse it ll soon be smothered out unless we set him free The men needed no urging however They worked as if their lives depended on their exertions Dick Varley in particular laboured like a young Hercules and Henri hurled masses of snow about in a most surprising manner Crusoe too entered heartily into the spirit of the work and scraping with his forepaws sent such a continuous shower of snow behind him that he was speedily lost to view in a hole of his own excavating In the course of half an hour a cavern was dug in the mound almost close up to the cliff and the men were beginning to look about for the crushed body of Dick s steed when an exclamation from Henri attracted their attention Ha mes ami here am be one hole The truth of this could not be doubted for the eccentric trapper had thrust his shovel through the wall of snow into what appeared to be a cavern beyond and immediately followed up his remark by thrusting in his head and shoulders He drew them out in a few seconds with a look of intense amazement Voila Joe Blunt Look in dere and you shall see fat you will behold Why it s the horse I do b lieve cried Joe Go ahead lads So saying he resumed his shovelling vigorously and in a few minutes the hole was opened up sufficiently to enable a man to enter Dick sprang in and there stood Charlie close beside the cliff looking as sedate and unconcerned as if all that had been going on had no reference to him whatever The cause of his safety was simple enough The precipice beside which he stood when the avalanche occurred overhung its base at that point considerably so that when the snow descended a clear space of several feet wide was left all along its base Here Charlie had remained in perfect comfort until his friends dug him out Congratulating themselves not a little on having saved the charger and bagged a grizzly bear the trappers remounted and returned to the camp For some time after this nothing worthy of particular note occurred The trapping operations went on prosperously and without interruption from the Indians who seemed to have left the locality altogether During this period Dick and Crusoe and Charlie had many excursions together and the silver rifle full many a time sent death to the heart of bear and elk and buffalo while indirectly it sent joy to the heart of man woman and child in camp in the shape of juicy steaks and marrow bones Joe and Henri devoted themselves almost exclusively to trapping beaver in which pursuit they were so successful that they speedily became wealthy men according to backwood notions of wealth With the beaver that they caught they purchased from Cameron s store powder and shot enough for a long hunting expedition and a couple of spare horses to carry their packs They also purchased a large assortment of such goods and trinkets as would prove acceptable to Indians and supplied themselves with new blankets and a few pairs of strong moccasins of which they stood much in need Thus they went on from day to day until symptoms of the approach of winter warned them that it was time to return to the Mustang Valley About this time an event occurred which totally changed the aspect of affairs in these remote valleys of the Rocky Mountains and precipitated the departure of our four friends Dick Joe Henri and Crusoe This was the sudden arrival of a whole tribe of Indians As their advent was somewhat remarkable we shall devote to it the commencement of a new chapter CHAPTER TWENTY THREE SAVAGE SPORTS LIVING CATARACTS AN ALARM INDIANS AND THEIR DOINGS THE STAMPEDO CHARLIE AGAIN One day Dick Varley was out on a solitary hunting expedition near the rocky gorge where his horse had received temporary burial a week or two before Crusoe was with him of course Dick had tied Charlie to a tree and was sunning himself on the edge of a cliff from the top of which he had a fine view of the valley and the rugged precipices that hemmed it in Just in front of the spot on which he sat the precipices on the opposite side of the gorge rose to a considerable height above him so that their ragged outlines were drawn sharply across the clear sky Dick was gazing in dreamy silence at the jutting rocks and dark caverns and speculating on the probable number of bears that dwelt there when a slight degree of restlessness on the part of Crusoe attracted him What is t pup said he laying his hand on the dog s broad back Crusoe looked the answer I don t know Dick but it s something you may depend upon it else I would not have disturbed you Dick lifted his rifle from the ground and laid it in the hollow of his left arm There must be something in the wind remarked Dick As wind is known to be composed of two distinct gases Crusoe felt perfectly safe in replying Yes with his tail Immediately after he added Hallo did you hear that with his ears Dick did hear it and sprang hastily to his feet as a sound like yet unlike distant thunder came faintly down upon the breeze In a few seconds the sound increased to a roar in which was mingled the wild cries of men Neither Dick nor Crusoe moved for the sounds came from behind the heights in front of them and they felt that the only way to solve the question What can the sounds be was to wait till the sounds should solve it themselves Suddenly the muffled sounds gave place to the distinct bellowing of cattle the clatter of innumerable hoofs and the yells of savage men while at the same moment the edges of the opposite cliffs became alive with Indians and buffaloes rushing about in frantic haste the former almost mad with savage excitement the latter with blind rage and terror On reaching the edge of the dizzy precipice the buffaloes turned abruptly and tossed their ponderous heads as they coursed along the edge Yet a few of them unable to check their headlong course fell over and were dashed to pieces on the rocks below Such falls Dick observed were hailed with shouts of delight by the Indians whose sole object evidently was to enjoy the sport of driving the terrified animals over the precipice The wily savages had chosen their ground well for this purpose The cliff immediately opposite to Dick Varley was a huge projection from the precipice that hemmed in the gorge or species of cape or promontory several hundred yards wide at the base and narrowing abruptly to a point The sides of this wedge shaped projection were quite perpendicular indeed in some places the top overhung the base and they were at least three hundred feet high Broken and jagged rocks of that peculiarly chaotic character which probably suggested the name to this part of the great American chain projected from and were scattered all round the cliffs Over these the Indians whose numbers increased every moment strove to drive the luckless herd of buffaloes that had chanced to fall in their way The task was easy The unsuspecting animals of which there were hundreds rushed in a dense mass upon the cape referred to On they came with irresistible impetuosity bellowing furiously while their hoofs thundered on the turf with the muffled continuous roar of a distant but mighty cataract the Indians meanwhile urging them on by hideous yell and frantic gesture The advance guard came bounding madly to the edge of the precipice Here they stopped short and gazed affrighted at the gulf below It was but for a moment The irresistible momentum of the flying mass behind pushed them over Down they came absolutely a living cataract upon the rocks below Some struck on the projecting rocks in the descent and their bodies were dashed almost in pieces while their blood spurted out in showers Others leaped from rock to rock with awful bounds until losing their foot hold they fell headlong while others descended sheer down into the sweltering mass that lay shattered at the base of the cliffs Dick Varley and his dog remained rooted to the rock as they gazed at the sickening sight as if petrified Scarce fifty of that noble herd of buffaloes escaped the awful leap but they escaped only to fall before the arrows of their ruthless pursuers Dick had often heard of this tendency of the Indians where buffaloes were very numerous to drive them over precipices in mere wanton sport and cruelty but he had never seen it until now and the sight filled his soul with horror It was not until the din and tumult of the perishing herd and the shrill yells of the Indians had almost died away that he turned to quit the spot But the instant he did so another shout was raised The savages had observed him and were seen galloping along the cliffs towards the head of the gorge with the obvious intention of gaining the other side and capturing him Dick sprang on Charlie s back and the next instant was flying down the valley towards the camp He did not however fear being overtaken for the gorge could not be crossed and the way round the head of it was long and rugged but he was anxious to alarm the camp as quickly as possible so that they might have time to call in the more distant trappers and make preparations for defence Where away now youngster inquired Cameron emerging from his tent as Dick taking the brook that flowed in front at a flying leap came crashing through the bushes into the midst of the fur packs at full speed Injuns ejaculated Dick reining up and vaulting out of the saddle Hundreds of em Fiends incarnate every one Are they near Yes an hour ll bring them down on us Are Joe and Henri far from camp to day At Ten mile Creek replied Cameron with an expression of bitterness as he caught up his gun and shouted to several men who hurried up on seeing our hero s burst into camp Ten mile Creek muttered Dick I ll bring em in though he continued glancing at several of the camp horses that grazed close at hand In another moment he was on Charlie s back the line of one of the best horses was in his hand and almost before Cameron knew what he was about he was flying down the valley like the wind Charlie often stretched out at full speed to please his young master but seldom had he been urged forward as he was upon this occasion The led horse being light and wild kept well up and in a marvellously short space of time they were at Ten mile Creek Hallo Dick wot s to do inquired Joe Blunt who was up to his knees in the water setting a trap at the moment his friend galloped up Injuns Where s Henri demanded Dick At the head o the dam there Dick was off in a moment and almost instantly returned with Henri galloping beside him No word was spoken In time of action these men did not waste words During Dick s momentary absence Joe Blunt had caught up his rifle and examined the priming so that when Dick pulled up beside him he merely laid his hand on the saddle saying All right as he vaulted on Charlie s back behind his young companion In another moment they were away at full speed The mustang seemed to feel that unwonted exertions were required of him Double weighted though he was he kept well up with the other horse and in less than two hours after Dick s leaving the camp the three hunters came in sight of it Meanwhile Cameron had collected nearly all his forces and put his camp in a state of defence before the Indians arrived which they did suddenly and as usual at full gallop to the amount of at least two hundred They did not at first seem disposed to hold friendly intercourse with the trappers but assembled in a semicircle round the camp in a menacing attitude while one of their chiefs stepped forward to hold a palaver For some time the conversation on both sides was polite enough but by degrees the Indian chief assumed an imperious tone and demanded gifts from the trappers taking care to enforce his request by hinting that thousands of his countrymen were not far distant Cameron stoutly refused and the palaver threatened to come to an abrupt and unpleasant termination just at the time that Dick and his friends appeared on the scene of action The brook was cleared at a bound the three hunters leaped from their steeds and sprang to the front with a degree of energy that had a visible effect on the savages and Cameron seizing the moment proposed that the two parties should smoke a pipe and hold a council The Indians agreed and in a few minutes they were engaged in animated and friendly intercourse The speeches were long and the compliments paid on either side were inflated and we fear undeserved but the result of the interview was that Cameron made the Indians a present of tobacco and a few trinkets and sent them back to their friends to tell them that he was willing to trade with them Next day the whole tribe arrived in the valley and pitched their deerskin tents on the plain opposite to the camp of the white men Their numbers far exceeded Cameron s expectation and it was with some anxiety that he proceeded to strengthen his fortifications as much as circumstances and the nature of the ground would admit The Indian camp which numbered upwards of a thousand souls was arranged with great regularity and was divided into three distinct sections each section being composed of a separate tribe The Great Snake Nation at that time embraced three tribes or divisions namely the Shirry dikas or dog eaters the War are ree kas or fish eaters and the Banattees or robbers These were the most numerous and powerful Indians on the west side of the Rocky Mountains The Shirry dikas dwelt in the plains and hunted the buffaloes dressed well were cleanly rich in horses bold independent and good warriors The War are ree kas lived chiefly by fishing and were found on the banks of the rivers and lakes throughout the country They were more corpulent slovenly and indolent than the Shirry dikas and more peaceful The Banattees as we have before mentioned were the robbers of the mountains They were a wild and contemptible race and at enmity with every one In summer they went about nearly naked In winter they clothed themselves in the skins of rabbits and wolves Being excellent mimics they could imitate the howling of wolves the neighing of horses and the cries of birds by which means they could approach travellers rob them and then fly to their rocky fastnesses in the mountains where pursuit was vain Such were the men who now assembled in front of the camp of the fur traders and Cameron soon found that the news of his presence in the country had spread far and wide among the natives bringing them to the neighbourhood of his camp in immense crowds so that during the next few days their numbers increased to thousands Several long palavers quickly ensued between the red men and the white and the two great chiefs who seemed to hold despotic rule over the assembled tribes were extremely favourable to the idea of universal peace which was propounded to them In several set speeches of great length and very considerable power these natural orators explained their willingness to enter into amicable relations with all the surrounding nations as well as with the white men But said Pee eye em the chief of the Shirry dikas a man above six feet high and of immense muscular strength but my tribe cannot answer for the Banattees who are robbers and cannot be punished because they dwell in scattered families among the mountains The Banattees are bad they cannot be trusted None of the Banattees were present at the council when this was said and if they had been it would have mattered little for they were neither fierce nor courageous although bold enough in their own haunts to murder and rob the unwary The second chief did not quite agree with Pee eye em he said that it was impossible for them to make peace with their natural enemies the Peigans and the Blackfeet on the east side of the mountains It was very desirable he admitted but neither of these tribes would consent to it he felt sure Upon this Joe blunt rose and said The great chief of the War are ree kas is wise and knows that enemies cannot be reconciled unless deputies are sent to make proposals of peace The Pale face does not know the Blackfeet answered the chief Who will go into the lands of the Blackfeet My young men have been sent once and again and their scalps are now fringes to the leggings of their enemies The War are ree kas do not cross the mountains but for the purpose of making war The chief speaks truth returned Joe yet there are three men round the council fire who will go to the Blackfeet and the Peigans with messages of peace from the Snakes if they wish it Joe pointed to himself Henri and Dick as he spoke and added We three do not belong to the camp of the fur traders we only lodge with them for a time The Great Chief of the white men has sent us to make peace with the Red men and to tell them that he desires to trade with them to exchange hatchets and guns and blankets for furs This declaration interested the two chiefs greatly and after a good deal of discussion they agreed to take advantage of Joe Blunt s offer and appoint him as a deputy to the court of their enemies Having arranged these matters to their satisfaction Cameron bestowed a red flag and a blue surtout with brass buttons on each of the chiefs and a variety of smaller articles on the other members of the council and sent them away in a particularly amiable frame of mind Pee eye em burst the blue surtout at the shoulders and elbows in putting it on as it was much too small for his gigantic frame but never having seen such an article of apparel before he either regarded this as the natural and proper consequence of putting it on or was totally indifferent to it for he merely looked at the rents with a smile of satisfaction while his squaw surreptitiously cut off the two back buttons and thrust them into her bosom By the time the council closed the night was far advanced and a bright moon was shedding a flood of soft light over the picturesque and busy scene I ll go to the Injun camp said Joe to Walter Cameron as the chiefs rose to depart The season s far enough advanced already it s time to be off and if I m to speak for the Red skins in the Blackfeet Council I d need to know what to say Please yourself Master Blunt answered Cameron I like your company and that of your friends and if it suited you I would be glad to take you along with us to the coast of the Pacific but your mission among the Indians is a good one and I ll help it on all I can I suppose you will go also he added turning to Dick Varley who was still seated beside the council fire caressing Crusoe Wherever Joe goes I go answered Dick Crusoe s tail ears and eyes demonstrated high approval of the sentiment involved in this speech And your friend Henri He goes too answered Joe It s as well that the Red skins should see the three o us before we start for the east side o the mountains Ho Henri come here lad Henri obeyed and in a few seconds the three friends crossed the brook to the Indian camp and were guided to the principal lodge by Pee eye em Here a great council was held and the proposed attempt at negotiations for peace with their ancient enemies fully discussed While they were thus engaged and just as Pee eye em had in the energy of an enthusiastic peroration burst the blue surtout almost up to the collar a distant rushing sound was heard which caused every man to spring to his feet run out of the tent and seize his weapons What can it be Joe whispered Dick as they stood at the tent door leaning on their rifles and listening intently Dunno answered Joe shortly Most of the numerous fires of the camp had gone out but the bright moon revealed the dusky forms of thousands of Indians whom the unwonted sound had startled moving rapidly about The mystery was soon explained The Indian camp was pitched on an open plain of several miles in extent which took a sudden bend half a mile distant where a spur of the mountains shut out the further end of the valley from view From beyond this point the dull rumbling sound proceeded Suddenly there was a roar as if a mighty cataract had been let loose upon the scene At the same moment a countless herd of wild horses came thundering round the base of the mountain and swept over the plain straight towards the Indian camp A stampedo cried Joe springing to the assistance of Pee eye em whose favourite horses were picketted near the tent On they came like a living torrent and the thunder of a thousand hoofs was soon mingled with the howling of hundreds of dogs in the camp and the yelling of Indians as they vainly endeavoured to restrain the rising excitement of their steeds Henri and Dick stood rooted to the ground gazing in silent wonder at the fierce and uncontrollable gallop of the thousands of panic stricken horses that bore down upon the camp with the tumultuous violence of a mighty cataract As the maddened troop drew nigh the camp horses began to snort and tremble violently and when the rush of the wild steeds was almost upon them they became ungovernable with terror broke their halters and hobbles and dashed wildly about To add to the confusion at that moment a cloud passed over the moon and threw the whole scene into deep obscurity Blind with terror which was probably increased by the din of their own mad flight the galloping troop came on and with a sound like the continuous roar of thunder that for an instant drowned the yell of dog and man they burst upon the camp trampling over packs and skins and dried meat etcetera in their headlong speed and overturning several of the smaller tents In another moment they swept out upon the plain beyond and were soon lost in the darkness of the night while the yelping of dogs as they vainly pursued them mingled and gradually died away with the distant thunder of their retreat This was a stampedo one of the most extraordinary scenes that can be witnessed in the western wilderness Lend a hand Henri shouted Joe who was struggling with a powerful horse Wot s comed over yer brains man This brute ll git off if ye don t look sharp Dick and Henri both answered to the summons and they succeeded in throwing the struggling animal on its side and holding it down until its excitement was somewhat abated Pee eye em had also been successful in securing his favourite hunter but nearly every other horse belonging to the camp had broken loose and joined the whirlwind gallop but they gradually dropped out and before morning the most of them were secured by their owners As there were at least two thousand horses and an equal number of dogs in the part of the Indian camp which had been thus over run by the wild mustangs the turmoil as may be imagined was prodigious Yet strange to say no accident of a serious nature occurred beyond the loss of several chargers In the midst of this exciting scene there was one heart there which beat with a nervous vehemence that well nigh burst it This was the heart of Dick Varley s horse Charlie Well known to him was that distant rumbling sound that floated on the night air into the fur trader s camp where he was picketted close to Cameron s tent Many a time had he heard the approach of such a wild troop and often in days not long gone by had his shrill neigh rung out as he joined and led the panic stricken band He was first to hear the sound and by his restive actions to draw the attention of the fur traders to it As a precautionary measure they all sprang up and stood by their horses to soothe them but as a brook with a belt of bushes and quarter of a mile of plain intervened between their camp and the mustangs as they flew past they had little or no trouble in restraining them Not so however with Charlie At the very moment that his master was congratulating himself on the supposed security of his position he wrenched the halter from the hand of him who held it burst through the barrier of felled trees that had been thrown round the camp cleared the brook at a bound and with a wild hilarious neigh resumed his old place in the ranks of the free born mustangs of the prairie Little did Dick think when the flood of horses swept past him that his own good steed was there rejoicing in his recovered liberty But Crusoe knew it Ay the wind had borne down the information to his acute nose before the living storm burst upon the camp and when Charlie rushed past with the long tough halter trailing at his heels Crusoe sprang to his side seized the end of the halter with his teeth and galloped off along with him It was a long gallop and a tough one but Crusoe held on for it was a settled principle in his mind never to give in At first the check upon Charlie s speed was imperceptible but by degrees the weight of the gigantic dog began to tell and after a time they fell a little to the rear then by good fortune the troop passed through a mass of underwood and the line getting entangled brought their mad career forcibly to a close the mustangs passed on and the two friends were left to keep each other company in the dark How long they would have remained thus is uncertain for neither of them had sagacity enough to undo a complicated entanglement fortunately however in his energetic tugs at the line Crusoe s sharp teeth partially severed it and a sudden start on the part of Charlie caused it to part Before he could escape Crusoe again seized the end of it and led him slowly but steadily back to the Indian camp never halting or turning aside until he had placed the line in Dick Varley s hand Hallo pup where have ye bin How did ye bring him here exclaimed Dick as he gazed in amazement at his foam covered horse Crusoe wagged his tail as if to say Be thankful that you ve got him Dick my boy and don t ask questions that you know I can t answer He must ha broke loose and jined the stampedo remarked Joe coming out of the chief s tent at the moment but tie him up Dick and come in for we want to settle about startin to morrow or nixt day Having fastened Charlie to a stake and ordered Crusoe to watch him Dick re entered the tent where the council had re assembled and where Pee eye em having in the recent struggle split the blue surtout completely up to the collar so that his backbone was visible throughout the greater part of its length was holding forth in eloquent strains on the subject of peace in general and peace with the Blackfeet the ancient enemies of the Shirry dikas in particular CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR PLANS AND PROSPECTS DICK BECOMES HOME SICK AND HENRI METAPHYSICAL THE INDIANS ATTACK THE CAMP A BLOW UP On the following day the Indians gave themselves up to unlimited feasting in consequence of the arrival of a large body of hunters with an immense supply of buffalo meat It was a regular day of rejoicing Upwards of six hundred buffaloes had been killed and as the supply of meat before their arrival had been ample the camp was now overflowing with plenty Feasts were given by the chiefs and the medicine men went about the camp uttering loud cries which were meant to express gratitude to the Great Spirit for the bountiful supply of food They also carried a portion of meat to the aged and infirm who were unable to hunt for themselves and had no young men in their family circle to hunt for them This arrival of the hunters was a fortunate circumstance as it put the Indians in great good humour and inclined them to hold friendly intercourse with the trappers who for some time continued to drive a brisk trade in furs Having no market for the disposal of their furs the Indians of course had more than they knew what to do with and were therefore glad to exchange those of the most beautiful and valuable kind for a mere trifle so that the trappers laid aside their traps for a time and devoted themselves to traffic Meanwhile Joe Blunt and his friends made preparations for their return journey Ye see remarked Joe to Henri and Dick as they sat beside the fire in Pee eye em s lodge and feasted on a potful of grasshopper soup which the great chiefs squaw had just placed before them ye see my calc lations is as follows Wot with trappin beavers and huntin we three ha made enough to sot us up an it likes us in the Mustang Valley Ha interrupted Dick remitting for a few seconds the use of his teeth in order to exercise his tongue ha Joe but it don t like me What give up a hunter s life and become a farmer I should think not Bon ejaculated Henri but whether the remark had reference to the grasshopper soup or the sentiment we cannot tell Well continued Joe commencing to devour a large buffalo steak with a hunter s appetite ye ll please yourselves lads as to that but as I wos sayin we ve got a powerful lot o furs an a big pack o odds and ends for the Injuns we chance to meet with by the way an powder and lead to last us a twelve month besides five good horses to carry us an our packs over the plains so if it s agreeable to you I mean to make a bee line for the Mustang Valley We re pretty sure to meet with Blackfeet on the way and if we do we ll try to make peace between them an the Snakes I xpect it ll be pretty well on for six weeks afore we git to home so we ll start to morrow Dat is fat vill do ver vell said Henri vill you please donnez me one petit morsel of steak I m ready for anything Joe cried Dick you are leader Just point the way and I ll answer for two o us followin ye eh won t we Crusoe We will remarked the dog quietly How comes it inquired Dick that these Indians don t care for our tobacco They like their own better I s pose answered Joe most all the western Injuns do They make it o the dried leaves o the shumack and the inner bark o the red willow chopped very small an mixed together They call this stuff Kinnekinnik but they like to mix about a fourth o our tobacco with it so Pee eye em tells me an he s a good judge the amount that red skinned mortal smokes is oncommon What are they doin yonder inquired Dick pointing to a group of men who had been feasting for some time past in front of a tent within sight of our trio Goin to sing I think replied Joe As he spoke six young warriors were seen to work their bodies about in a very remarkable way and give utterance to still more remarkable sounds which gradually increased until the singers burst out into that terrific yell or war whoop for which American savages have long been famous Its effect would save been appalling to unaccustomed ears Then they allowed their voices to die away in soft plaintive tones while their action corresponded thereto Suddenly the furious style was revived and the men wrought themselves into a condition little short of madness while their yells rung wildly through the camp This was too much for ordinary canine nature to withstand so all the dogs in the neighbourhood joined in the horrible chorus Crusoe had long since learned to treat the eccentricities of Indians and their curs with dignified contempt He paid no attention to this serenade but lay sleeping by the fire until Dick and his companions rose to take leave of their host and return to the camp of the fur traders The remainder of that night was spent in making preparations for setting forth on the morrow and when at grey dawn Dick and Crusoe lay down to snatch a few hours repose the yells and howling in the Snake camp were going on as vigorously as ever The sun had arisen and his beams were just tipping the summits of the Rocky Mountains causing the snowy peaks to glitter like flame and the deep ravines and gorges to look sombre and mysterious by contrast when Dick and Joe and Henri mounted their gallant steeds and with Crusoe gambolling before and the two pack horses trotting by their side turned their faces eastward and bade adieu to the Indian camp Crusoe was in great spirits He was perfectly well aware that he and his companions were on their way home and testified his satisfaction by bursts of scampering over the hills and valleys Doubtless he thought of Dick Varley s cottage and of Dick s mild kind hearted mother Undoubtedly too he thought of his own mother Fan and felt a glow of filial affection as he did so Of this we feel quite certain He would have been unworthy the title of hero if he hadn t Perchance he thought of Grumps but of this we are not quite so sure We rather think upon the whole that he did Dick too let his thoughts run away in the direction of home Sweet word Those who have never left it cannot by any effort of imagination realise the full import of the word home Dick was a bold hunter but he was young and this was his first long expedition Oftentimes when sleeping under the trees and gazing dreamily up through the branches at the stars had he thought of home until his longing heart began to yearn to return He repelled such tender feelings however when they became too strong deeming them unmanly and sought to turn his mind to the excitements of the chase but latterly his efforts were in vain He became thoroughly home sick and while admitting the fact to himself he endeavoured to conceal it from his comrades He thought that he was successful in this attempt Poor Dick Varley as yet he was sadly ignorant of human nature Henri knew it and Joe Blunt knew it Even Crusoe knew that something was wrong with his master although he could not exactly make out what it was But Crusoe made memoranda in the note book of his memory He jotted down the peculiar phases of his master s new disease with the care and minute exactness of a physician and we doubt not ultimately added the knowledge of the symptoms of homesickness to his already well filled stores of erudition It was not till they had set out on their homeward journey that Dick Varley s spirits revived and it was not till they reached the beautiful prairies on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and galloped over the green sward towards the Mustang Valley that Dick ventured to tell Joe Blunt what his feelings had been D ye know Joe he said confidentially reining up his gallant steed after a sharp gallop d ye know I ve bin feelin awful low for some time past I know it lad answered Joe with a quiet smile in which there was a dash of something that implied he knew more than he chose to express Dick felt surprised but he continued I wonder what it could have bin I never felt so before Twas homesickness boy returned Joe How d ye know that The same way as how I know most things by experience an obsarvation I ve bin home sick myself once but it was long long agone Dick felt much relieved at this candid confession by such a bronzed veteran and the chords of sympathy having been struck he opened up his heart at once to the evident delight of Henri who among other curious partialities was extremely fond of listening to and taking part in conversations that bordered on the metaphysical and were hard to be understood Most conversations that were not connected with eating and hunting were of this nature to Henri Hom sik he cried veech mean bein sik of hom hah dat is fat I am always be ven I goes hout on de expedition Oui vraiment I always packs up continued Joe paying no attention to Henri s remark I always packs up an sots off for home when I gits home sick it s the best cure an when hunters are young like you Dick it s the only cure I ve know d fellers a most die o homesickness an I m told they do go under altogether sometimes Go onder exclaimed Henri oui I vas all but die myself ven I fust try to git away from hom If I have not git away I not be here to day Henri s idea of homesickness was so totally opposed to theirs that his comrades only laughed and refrained from attempting to set him right The fust time I was took bad with it wos in a country somethin like that said Joe pointing to the wide stretch of undulating prairie dotted with clusters of trees and wandering streamlets that lay before them I had bin out about two months an wos makin a good thing of it for game wos plenty when I began to think somehow more than usual o home My mother wos alive then Joe s voice sank to a deep solemn tone as he said this and for a few minutes he rode on in silence Well it grew worse and worse I dreamed o home all night an thought of it all day till I began to shoot bad an my comrades wos gittin tired o me so says I to them one night says I I give out lads I ll make tracks for the settlement to morrow They tried to laugh me out of it at first but it was no go so I packed up bid them good day an sot off alone on a trip o five hundred miles The very first mile o the way back I began to mend and before two days I wos all right again Joe was interrupted at this point by the sudden appearance of a solitary horseman on the brow of an eminence not half a mile distant The three friends instantly drove their pack horses behind a clump of trees but not in time to escape the vigilant eye of the Red man who uttered a loud shout which brought up a band of his comrades at full gallop Remember Henri cried Joe Blunt our errand is one of peace The caution was needed for in the confusion of the moment Henri was making preparation to sell his life as dearly as possible Before another word could be uttered they were surrounded by a troop of about twenty yelling Blackfeet Indians They were fortunately not a war party and still more fortunately they were peaceably disposed and listened to the preliminary address of Joe Blunt with exemplary patience after which the two parties encamped on the spot the council fire was lighted and every preparation made for a long palaver We will not trouble the reader with the details of what was said on this occasion The party of Indians was a small one and no chief of any importance was attached to it Suffice it to say that the pacific overtures made by Joe were well received the trifling gifts made thereafter were still better received and they separated with mutual expressions of good will Several other bands which were afterwards met with were equally friendly and only one war party was seen Joe s quick eye observed it in time to enable them to retire unseen behind the shelter of some trees where they remained until the Indian warriors were out of sight The next party they met with however were more difficult to manage and unfortunately blood was shed on both sides before our travellers escaped It was at the close of a beautiful day that a war party of Blackfeet were seen riding along a ridge on the horizon It chanced that the prairie at this place was almost destitute of trees or shrubs large enough to conceal the horses By dashing down the grassy wave into the hollow between the two undulations and dismounting Joe hoped to elude the savages so he gave the word but at the same moment a shout from the Indians told that they were discovered Look sharp lads throw down the packs on the highest point of the ridge cried Joe undoing the lashings seizing one of the bales of goods and hurrying to the top of the undulation with it we must keep them at arm s length boys be alive War parties are not to be trusted Dick and Henri seconded Joe s efforts so ably that in the course of two minutes the horses were unloaded the packs piled in the form of a wall in front of a broken piece of ground the horses picketted close beside them and our three travellers peeping over the edge with their rifles cocked while the savages about thirty in number came sweeping down towards them I ll try to git them to palaver said Joe Blunt but keep yer eye on em Dick an if they behave ill shoot the horse o the leadin chief I ll throw up my left hand as a signal Mind lad don t hit human flesh till my second signal is given and see that Henri don t draw till I git back to ye So saying Joe sprang lightly over the slight parapet of their little fortress and ran swiftly out unarmed towards the Indians In a few seconds he was close up with them and in another moment was surrounded At first the savages brandished their spears and rode round the solitary man yelling like fiends as if they wished to intimidate him but as Joe stood like a statue with his arms crossed and a grave expression of contempt on his countenance they quickly desisted and drawing near asked him where he came from and what he was doing there Joe s story was soon told but instead of replying they began to shout vociferously and evidently meant mischief If the Blackfeet are afraid to speak to the Pale face he will go back to his braves said Joe passing suddenly between two of the warriors and taking a few steps towards the camp Instantly every bow was bent and it seemed as if our bold hunter were about to be pierced by a hundred arrows when he turned round and cried The Blackfeet must not advance a single step The first that moves his horse shall die The second that moves himself shall die To this the Blackfoot chief replied scornfully The Pale face talks with a big mouth We do not believe his words The Snakes are liars we will make no peace with them While he was yet speaking Joe threw up his hand there was a loud report and the noble horse of the savage chief lay struggling in death agony on the ground The use of the rifle as we have before hinted was little known at this period among the Indians of the far west and many had never heard the dreaded report before although all were aware from hearsay of its fatal power The fall of the chief s horse therefore quite paralysed them for a few moments and they had not recovered from their surprise when a second report was heard a bullet whistled past and a second horse fell At the same moment there was a loud explosion in the camp of the Pale faces a white cloud enveloped it and from the midst of this a loud shriek was heard as Dick Henri and Crusoe bounded over the packs with frantic gestures At this the gaping savages wheeled their steeds round the dismounted horsemen sprang on behind two of their comrades and the whole band dashed away over the plains as if they were chased by evil spirits Meanwhile Joe hastened towards his comrades in a state of great anxiety for he knew at once that one of the powder horns must have been accidentally blown up No damage done boys I hope he cried on coming up Damage cried Henri holding his hands tight over his face Oh oui great damage moche damage me two eyes be blowed out of dere holes Not quite so bad as that I hope said Dick who was very slightly singed and forgot his own hurts in anxiety about his comrade Let me see My eye exclaimed Joe Blunt while a broad grin overspread his countenance ye ve not improved yer looks Henri This was true The worthy hunter s hair was singed to such an extent that his entire countenance presented the appearance of a universal frizzle Fortunately the skin although much blackened was quite uninjured a fact which when he ascertained it beyond a doubt afforded so much satisfaction to Henri that he capered about shouting with delight as if some piece of good fortune had befallen him The accident had happened in consequence of Henri having omitted to replace the stopper of his powder horn and when in his anxiety for Joe he fired at random amongst the Indians despite Dick s entreaties to wait a spark communicated with the powder horn and blew him up Dick and Crusoe were only a little singed but the former was not disposed to quarrel with an accident which had sent their enemies so promptly to the right about This band followed them for some nights in the hope of being able to steal their horses while they slept but they were not brave enough to venture a second time within range of the death dealing rifle CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE DANGERS OF THE PRAIRIE OUR TRAVELLERS ATTACKED BY INDIANS AND DELIVERED IN A REMARKABLE MANNER There are periods in the life of almost all men when misfortunes seem to crowd upon them in rapid succession when they escape from one danger only to encounter another and when to use a well known expression they succeed in leaping out of the frying pan at the expense of plunging into the fire So was it with our three friends upon this occasion They were scarcely rid of the Blackfeet who found them too watchful to be caught napping when about daybreak one morning they encountered a roving band of Camanchee Indians who wore such a warlike aspect that Joe deemed it prudent to avoid them if possible They don t see us yit I guess said Joe as he and his companions drove the horses into a hollow between the grassy waves of the prairie any if we only can escape their sharp eyes till we re in yonder clump o willows we re safe enough But why don t you ride up to them Joe inquired Dick and make peace between them and the Pale faces as you ha done with other bands Because it s o no use to risk our scalps for the chance o makin peace wi a rovin war party Keep yer head down Henri If they git only a sight o the top o yer cap they ll be down on us like a breeze o wind Hah let dem come said Henri They ll come without askin yer leave remarked Joe drily Notwithstanding his defiant expression Henri had sufficient prudence to induce him to bend his head and shoulders and in a few minutes they reached the shelter of the willows unseen by the savages At least so thought Henri Joe was not quite sure about it and Dick hoped for the best In the course of half an hour the last of the Camanchees was seen to hover for a second on the horizon like a speck of black against the sky and then to disappear Immediately the three hunters bolted on their steeds and resumed their journey but before that evening closed they had sad evidence of the savage nature of the band from which they had escaped On passing the brow of a slight eminence Dick who rode first observed that Crusoe stopped and snuffed the breeze in an anxious inquiring manner What is t pup said Dick drawing up for he knew that his faithful dog never gave a false alarm Crusoe replied by a short uncertain bark and then bounding forward disappeared behind a little wooded knoll In another moment a long dismal howl floated over the plains There was a mystery about the dog s conduct which coupled with his melancholy cry struck the travellers with a superstitious feeling of dread as they sat looking at each other in surprise Come let s clear it up cried Joe Blunt shaking the reins of his steed and galloping forward A few strides brought them to the other side of the knoll where scattered upon the torn and bloody turf they discovered the scalped and mangled remains of about twenty or thirty human beings Their skulls had been cleft by the tomahawk and their breasts pierced by the scalping knife and from the position in which many of them lay it was evident that they had been slain while asleep Joe s brow flushed and his lips became tightly compressed as he muttered between his set teeth Their skins are white A short examination sufficed to show that the men who had thus been barbarously murdered while they slept had been a band of trappers or hunters but what their errand had been or whence they came they could not discover Everything of value had been carried off and all the scalps had been taken Most of the bodies although much mutilated lay in a posture that led our hunters to believe they had been killed while asleep but one or two were cut almost to pieces and from the blood bespattered and trampled sward around it seemed as if they had struggled long and fiercely for life Whether or not any of the savages had been slain it was impossible to tell for if such had been the case their comrades doubtless had carried away their bodies That they had been slaughtered by the party of Camanchees who had been seen at daybreak was quite clear to Joe but his burning desire to revenge the death of the white men had to be stifled as his party was so small Long afterwards it was discovered that this was a band of trappers who like those mentioned at the beginning of this volume had set out to avenge the death of a comrade but God who has retained the right of vengeance in His own hand saw fit to frustrate their purpose by giving them into the hands of the savages whom they had set forth to slay As it was impossible to bury so many bodies the travellers resumed their journey and left them to bleach there in the wilderness but they rode the whole of that day almost without uttering a word Meanwhile the Camanchees who had observed the trio and had ridden away at first for the purpose of deceiving them into the belief that they had passed unobserved doubled on their track and took a long sweep in order to keep out of sight until they could approach under the shelter of a belt of woodland towards which the travellers now approached The Indians adopted this course instead of the easier method of simply pursuing so weak a party because the plains at this part were bordered by a long stretch of forest into which the hunters could have plunged and rendered pursuit more difficult if not almost useless The detour thus taken was so extensive that the shades of evening were beginning to descend before they could put their plan into execution The forest lay about a mile to the right of our hunters like some dark mainland of which the prairie was the sea and the scattered clumps of wood the islands There s no lack o game here said Dick Varley pointing to a herd of buffaloes which rose at their approach and fled away towards the wood I think we ll ha thunder soon remarked Joe I never feel it onnatteral hot like this without looking out for a plump Hah den ve better look hout for one goot tree to get b low suggested Henri Voila he added pointing with his finger towards the plain dere am a lot of wild hosses A troop of about thirty wild horses appeared as he spoke on the brow of a ridge and advanced slowly towards them Hist exclaimed Joe reining up hold on lads Wild horses my rifle to a pop gun there s wilder men on t other side o them What mean you Joe inquired Dick riding close up D ye see the little lumps on the shoulder o each horse said Joe Them s Injun s feet an if we don t want to lose our scalps we d better make for the forest Joe proved himself to be in earnest by wheeling round and making straight for the thick woods as fast as his horse could run The others followed driving the pack horses before them The effect of this sudden movement on the so called wild horses was very remarkable and to one unacquainted with the habits of the Camanchee Indians must have appeared almost supernatural In the twinkling of an eye every steed had a rider on its back and before the hunters had taken five strides in the direction of the forest the whole band were in hot pursuit yelling like furies The manner in which these Indians accomplish this feat is very singular and implies great activity and strength of muscle on the part of the savages The Camanchees are low in stature and usually are rather corpulent In their movements on foot they are heavy and ungraceful and they are on the whole a slovenly and unattractive race of men But the instant they mount their horses they seem to be entirely changed and surprise the spectator with the ease and elegance of their movements Their great and distinctive peculiarity as horsemen is the power they have acquired of throwing themselves suddenly on either side of their horse s body and clinging on in such a way that no part of them is visible from the other side save the foot by which they cling In this manner they approach their enemies at full gallop and without rising again to the saddle discharge their arrows at them over their horses backs or even under their necks This apparently magical feat is accomplished by means of a halter of horsehair which is passed round under the neck of the horse and both ends braided into the mane on the withers thus forming a loop which hangs under the neck and against the breast This being caught by the hand makes a sling into which the elbow falls taking the weight of the body on the middle of the upper arm Into this loop the rider drops suddenly and fearlessly leaving his heel to hang over the horse s back to steady him and also to restore him to his seat when desired By this stratagem the Indians had approached on the present occasion almost within rifle range before they were discovered and it required the utmost speed of the hunters horses to enable them to avoid being overtaken One of the Indians who was better mounted than his fellows gained on the fugitives so much that he came within arrow range but reserved his shaft until they were close on the margin of the wood when being almost alongside of Henri he fitted an arrow to his bow Henri s eye was upon him however letting go the line of the pack horse which he was leading he threw forward his rifle but at the same moment the savage disappeared behind his horse and an arrow whizzed past the hunter s ear Henri fired at the horse which dropped instantly hurling the astonished Camanchee upon the ground where he lay for some time insensible In a few seconds pursued and pursuers entered the wood where both had to advance with caution in order to avoid being swept off by the overhanging branches of the trees Meanwhile the sultry heat of which Joe had formerly spoken increased considerably and a rumbling noise as if of distant thunder was heard but the flying hunters paid no attention to it for the led horses gave them so much trouble and retarded their flight so much that the Indians were gradually and visibly gaining on them We ll ha to let the packs go said Joe somewhat bitterly as he looked over his shoulder Our scalps ll pay for t if we don t Henri uttered a peculiar and significant hiss between his teeth as he said P raps ve better stop and fight Dick said nothing being resolved to do exactly what Joe Blunt bid him and Crusoe for reasons best known to himself also said nothing but bounded along beside his master s horse casting an occasional glance upwards to catch any signal that might be given They had passed over a considerable space of ground and were forcing their way at the imminent hazard of their necks through a densely clothed part of the wood when the sound above referred to increased attracting the attention of both parties In a few seconds the air was filled with a steady and continuous rumbling sound like the noise of a distant cataract Pursuers and fugitives drew rein instinctively and came to a dead stand while the rumbling increased to a roar and evidently approached them rapidly though as yet nothing to cause it could be seen except that there was a dense dark cloud overspreading the sky to the southward The air was oppressively still and hot What can t be inquired Dick looking at Joe who was gazing with an expression of wonder not unmixed with concern at the southern sky Dunno boy I ve bin more in the woods than in the clearin in my day but I niver heerd the likes o that It am like t ondre said Henri mais it nevair do stop This was true The sound was similar to continuous uninterrupted thunder On it came with a magnificent roar that shook the very earth and revealed itself at last in the shape of a mighty whirlwind In a moment the distant woods bent before it and fell like grass before the scythe It was a whirling hurricane accompanied by a deluge of rain such as none of the party had ever before witnessed Steadily fiercely irresistibly it bore down upon them while the crash of falling snapping and uprooting trees mingled with the dire artillery of that sweeping storm like the musketry on a battle field Follow me lads shouted Joe turning his horse and dashing at full speed towards a rocky eminence that offered shelter But shelter was not needed The storm was clearly defined Its limits were as distinctly marked by its Creator as if it had been a living intelligence sent forth to put a belt of desolation round the world and although the edge of devastation was not five hundred yards from the rock behind which the hunters were stationed only a few drops of ice cold rain fell upon them It passed directly between the Camanchee Indians and their intended victims placing between them a barrier which it would have taken days to cut through The storm blew for an hour then it travelled onward in its might and was lost in distance Whence it came and whither it went none could tell but far as the eye could see on either hand an avenue a quarter of a mile wide was cut through the forest It had levelled everything with the dust the very grass was beaten flat the trees were torn shivered snapped across and crushed and the earth itself in many places was ploughed up and furrowed with deep scars The chaos was indescribable and it is probable that centuries will not quite obliterate the work of that single hour While it lasted Joe and his comrades remained speechless and awe stricken When it passed no Indians were to be seen So our hunters remounted their steeds and with feelings of gratitude to God for having delivered them alike from savage foes and from the destructive power of the whirlwind resumed their journey towards the Mustang Valley CHAPTER TWENTY SIX ANXIOUS FEARS FOLLOWED BY A JOYFUL SURPRISE SAFE HOME AT LAST AND HAPPY HEARTS One fine afternoon a few weeks after the storm of which we have given an account in the last chapter old missus Varley was seated beside her own chimney corner in the little cottage by the lake gazing at the glowing logs with the earnest expression of one whose thoughts were far away Her kind face was paler than usual and her hands rested idly on her knee grasping the knitting wires to which was attached a half finished stocking On a stool near to her sat young Marston the lad to whom on the day of the shooting match Dick Varley had given his old rifle The boy had an anxious look about him as he lifted his eyes from time to time to the widow s face Did ye say my boy that they were all killed inquired missus Varley awaking from her reverie with a deep sigh Every one replied Marston Jim Scraggs who brought the news said they wos all lyin dead with their scalps off They wos a party o white men missus Varley sighed again and her face assumed an expression of anxious pain as she thought of her son Dick being exposed to a similar fate missus Varley was not given to nervous fears but as she listened to the boy s recital of the slaughter of a party of white men news of which had just reached the valley her heart sank and she prayed inwardly to Him who is the husband of the widow that her dear one might be protected from the ruthless hand of the savage After a short pause during which young Marston fidgeted about and looked concerned as if he had something to say which he would fain leave unsaid missus Varley continued Was it far off where the bloody deed was done Yes three weeks off I believe And Jim Scraggs said that he found a knife that looked like the one wot belonged to to the lad hesitated To whom my boy Why don t ye go on To your son Dick The widow s hands dropped by her side and she would have fallen had not Marston caught her O mother dear don t take on like that he cried smoothing down the widow s hair as her head rested on his breast For some time missus Varley suffered the boy to fondle her in silence while her breast laboured with anxious dread Tell me all she said at last recovering a little Did Jim see Dick No answered the boy He looked at all the bodies but did not find his so he sent me over here to tell ye that p raps he s escaped missus Varley breathed more freely and earnestly thanked God but her fears soon returned when she thought of his being a prisoner and recalled the tales of terrible cruelty often related of the savages While she was still engaged in closely questioning the lad Jim Scraggs himself entered the cottage and endeavoured in a gruff sort of way to re assure the widow Ye see mistress he said Dick is a oncommon tough customer an if he could only git fifty yards start there s not a Injun in the west as could git hold o him agin so don t be takin on But what if he s bin taken prisoner said the widow Ay that s jest wot I ve comed about Ye see it s not onlikely he s bin took so about thirty o the lads o the valley are ready jest now to start away and give the red riptiles chase an I come to tell ye so keep up heart mistress With this parting word of comfort Jim withdrew and Marston soon followed leaving the widow to weep and pray in solitude Meanwhile an animated scene was going on near the block house Here thirty of the young hunters of the Mustang Valley were assembled actively engaged in supplying themselves with powder and lead and tightening their girths preparatory to setting out in pursuit of the Indians who had murdered the white men while hundreds of boys and girls and not a few matrons crowded round and listened to the conversation and to the deep threats of vengeance that were uttered ever and anon by the younger men Major Hope too was among them The worthy major unable to restrain his roving propensities determined to revisit the Mustang Valley and had arrived only two days before Backwoodsmen s preparations are usually of the shortest and simplest In a few minutes the cavalcade was ready and away they went towards the prairies with the bold major at their head But their journey was destined to come to an abrupt and unexpected close A couple of hours gallop brought them to the edge of one of those open plains which sometimes break up the woodland near the verge of the great prairies It stretched out like a green lake towards the horizon on which just as the band of horsemen reached it the sun was descending in a blaze of glory With a shout of enthusiasm several of the younger members of the party sprang forward into the plain at a gallop but the shout was mingled with one of a different tone from the older men Hist hallo hold on ye cat a mounts There s Injuns ahead The whole band came to a sudden halt at this cry and watched eagerly and for some time in silence the motions of a small party of horsemen who were seen in the far distance like black specks on the golden sky They come this way I think said Major Hope after gazing steadfastly at them for some minutes Several of the old hands signified their assent to this suggestion by a grunt although to unaccustomed eyes the objects in question looked more like crows than horsemen and their motion was for some time scarcely perceptible I sees pack horses among them cried young Marston in an excited tone an there s three riders but there s somethin else only wot it be I can t tell Ye ve sharp eyes younker remarked one of the men an I do b lieve yer right Presently the horsemen approached and soon there was a brisk fire of guessing as to who they could be It was evident that the strangers observed the cavalcade of white men and regarded them as friends for they did not check the headlong speed at which they approached In a few minutes they were clearly made out to be a party of three horsemen driving pack horses before them and somethin which some of the hunters guessed was a buffalo calf Young Marston guessed too but his guess was different Moreover it was uttered with a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest of all the savages Crusoe he shouted while at the same moment he brought his whip heavily down on the flank of his little horse and sprang over the prairie like an arrow One of the approaching horsemen was far ahead of his comrades and seemed as if encircled with the flying and voluminous mane of his magnificent horse Hah ho gasped Marston in a low tone to himself as he flew along Crusoe I d know ye dog among a thousand A buffalo calf Ha git on with ye This last part of the remark was addressed to his horse and was followed by a whack that increased the pace considerably The space between two such riders was soon devoured Hallo Dick Dick Varley Eh why Marston my boy The friends reined up so suddenly that one might have fancied they had met like the knights of old in the shock of mortal conflict Is t yerself Dick Varley Dick held out his hand and his eyes glistened but he could not find words Marston seized it and pushing his horse close up vaulted nimbly off and alighted on Charlie s back behind his friend Off ye go Dick I ll take ye to yer mother Without reply Dick shook the reins and in another minute was in the midst of the hunters To the numberless questions that were put to him he only waited to shout aloud We re all safe They ll tell ye all about it he added pointing to his comrades who were now close at hand and then dashing onward made straight for home with little Marston clinging to his waist like a monkey Charlie was fresh and so was Crusoe so you may be sure it was not long before they all drew up opposite the door of the widow s cottage Before Dick could dismount Marston had slipped off and was already in the kitchen Here s Dick mother The boy was an orphan and loved the widow so much that he had come at last to call her mother Before another word could be uttered Dick Varley was in the room Marston immediately stepped out and softly shut the door Reader we shall not open it Having shut the door as we have said Marston ran down to the edge of the lake and yelled with delight usually terminating each paroxysm with the Indian war whoop with which he was well acquainted Then he danced and then he sat down on a rock and became suddenly aware that there were other hearts there close beside him as glad as his own Another mother of the Mustang Valley was rejoicing over a long lost son Crusoe and his mother Fan were scampering round each other in a manner that evinced powerfully the strength of their mutual affection Talk of holding converse Every hair on Crusoe s body every motion of his limbs was eloquent with silent language He gazed into his mother s mild eyes as if he would read her inmost soul supposing that she had one He turned his head to every possible angle and cocked his ears to every conceivable elevation and rubbed his nose against Fan s and barked softly in every imaginable degree of modulation and varied these proceedings by bounding away at full speed over the rocks of the beach and in among the bushes and out again but always circling round and round Fan and keeping her in view It was a sight worth seeing and young Marston sat down on a rock deliberately and enthusiastically to gloat over it But perhaps the most remarkable part of it has not yet been referred to There was yet another heart there that was glad exceeding glad that day It was a little one too but it was big for the body that held it Grumps was there and all that Grumps did was to sit on his haunches and stare at Fan and Crusoe and wag his tail as well as he could in so awkward a position Grumps was evidently bewildered with delight and had lost nearly all power to express it Crusoe s conduct towards him too was not calculated to clear his faculties Every time he chanced to pass near Grumps in his elephantine gambols he gave him a passing touch with his nose which always knocked him head over heels whereat Grumps invariably got up quickly and wagged his tail with additional energy Before the feelings of those canine friends were calmed they were all three ruffled into a state of comparative exhaustion Then young Marston called Crusoe to him and Crusoe obedient to the voice of friendship went Are you happy my dog You re a stupid fellow to ask such a question however it s an amiable one Yes I am What do you want ye small bundle o hair This was addressed to Grumps who came forward innocently and sat down to listen to the conversation On being thus sternly questioned the little dog put down its ears flat and hung its head looking up at the same time with a deprecatory look as if to say Oh dear I beg pardon I I only want to sit near Crusoe please but if you wish it I ll go away sad and lonely with my tail very much between my legs indeed I will only say the word but but I d rather stay if I might Poor bundle said Marston patting its head you can stay then Hooray Crusoe are you happy I say Does your heart bound in you like a cannon ball that wants to find its way out and can t eh Crusoe put his snout against Marston s cheek and in the excess of his joy the lad threw his arms round the dog s neck and hugged it vigorously a piece of impulsive affection which that noble animal bore with characteristic meekness and which Grumps regarded with idiotic satisfaction CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN REJOICINGS THE FEAST AT THE BLOCK HOUSE GRUMPS AND CRUSOE COME OUT STRONG THE CLOSING SCENE The day of Dick s arrival with his companions was a great day in the annals of the Mustang Valley and Major Hope resolved to celebrate it by an impromptu festival at the old block house for many hearts in the valley had been made glad that day and he knew full well that under such circumstances some safety valve must be devised for the escape of overflowing excitement A messenger was sent round to invite the population to assemble without delay in front of the block house With backwoods like celerity the summons was obeyed men women and children hurried towards the central point wondering yet more than half suspecting what was the major s object in calling them together They were not long in doubt The first sight that presented itself as they came trooping up the slope in front of the log hut was an ox roasting whole before a gigantic bonfire Tables were being extemporised on the broad level plot in front of the gate Other fires there were of smaller dimensions on which sundry steaming pots were placed and various joints of wild horse bear and venison roasted and sent forth a savoury odour as well as a pleasant hissing noise The inhabitants of the block house were self taught brewers and the result of their recent labours now stood displayed in a row of goodly casks of beer the only beverage with which the dwellers in these far off regions were wont to regale themselves The whole scene as the cooks moved actively about upon the lawn and children romped round the fires and settlers came flocking through the forests might have recalled the revelry of merry England in the olden time though the costumes of the far west were perhaps somewhat different from those of old England No one of all the band assembled there on that day of rejoicing required to ask what it was all about Had any one been in doubt for a moment a glance at the centre of the crowd assembled round the gate of the western fortress would have quickly enlightened him for there stood Dick Varley and his mild looking mother and his loving dog Crusoe There too stood Joe Blunt like a bronzed warrior returned from the fight turning from one to another as question poured in upon question almost too rapidly to permit of a reply There too stood Henri making enthusiastic speeches to whoever chose to listen to him now glaring at the crowd with clenched fists and growling voice as he told of how Joe and he had been tied hand and foot and lashed to poles and buried in leaves and threatened with a slow death by torture at other times bursting into a hilarious laugh as he held forth on the predicament of Mahtawa when that wily chief was treed by Crusoe in the prairie Young Marston was there too hanging about Dick whom he loved as a brother and regarded as a perfect hero Grumps too was there and Fan Do you think reader that Grumps looked at any one but Crusoe If you do you are mistaken Grumps on that day became a regular an incorrigible utter and perfect nuisance to everybody not excepting himself poor beast Grumps was a dog of one idea and that idea was Crusoe Out of that great idea there grew one little secondary idea and that idea was that the only joy on earth worth mentioning was to sit on his haunches exactly six inches from Crusoe s nose and gaze steadfastly into his face Wherever Crusoe went Grumps went If Crusoe stopped Grumps was down before him in an instant If Crusoe bounded away which in the exuberance of his spirits he often did Grumps was after him like a bundle of mad hair He was in everybody s way in Crusoe s way and being so to speak beside himself was also in his own way If people trod upon him accidentally which they often did Grumps uttered a solitary heart rending yell proportioned in intensity to the excruciating nature of the torture he endured then instantly resumed his position and his fascinated stare Crusoe generally held his head up and gazed over his little friend at what was going on around him but if for a moment he permitted his eye to rest on the countenance of Grumps that creature s tail became suddenly imbued with an amount of wriggling vitality that seemed to threaten its separation from the body It was really quite interesting to watch this unblushing and disinterested and utterly reckless display of affection on the part of Grumps and the amiable way in which Crusoe put up with it we say put up with it advisedly because it must have been a very great inconvenience to him seeing that if he attempted to move his satellite moved in front of him so that his only way of escaping temporarily was by jumping over Grumps s head Grumps was everywhere all day Nobody almost escaped trampling on part of him He tumbled over everything into everything and against everything He knocked himself singed himself and scalded himself and in fact forgot himself altogether and when late that night Crusoe went with Dick into his mother s cottage and the door was shut Grumps stretched his ruffled battered ill used and dishevelled little body down on the doorstep thrust his nose against the opening below the door and lay in humble contentment all night for he knew that Crusoe was there Of course such an occasion could not pass without a shooting match Rifles were brought out after the feast was over just before the sun went down into its bed on the western prairies and the nail was soon surrounded by bullets tipped by Joe Blunt and Jim Scraggs and of course driven home by Dick Varley whose silver rifle had now become in its owner s hand a never failing weapon Races too were started and here again Dick stood pre eminent and when night spread her dark mantle over the scene the two best fiddlers in the settlement were placed on empty beer casks and some danced by the light of the monster fires while others listened to Joe Blunt as he recounted their adventures on the prairies and among the Rocky Mountains There were sweethearts and wives and lovers at the feast but we question whether any heart there was so full of love and admiration and gratitude as that of the Widow Varley as she watched her son Dick throughout that merry evening Years rolled by and the Mustang Valley prospered Missionaries went there and a little church was built and to the blessings of a fertile land were added the far greater blessings of Christian light and knowledge One sad blow fell on the Widow Varley s heart Her only brother Daniel Hood was murdered by the Indians Deeply and long she mourned and it required all Dick s efforts and those of the pastor of the settlement to comfort her But from the first the widow s heart was sustained by the loving hand that dealt the blow and when time blunted the keen edge of her feelings her face became as sweet and mild though not so lightsome as before Joe Blunt and Henri became leading men in the councils of the Mustang Valley but Dick Varley preferred the woods although as long as his mother lived he hovered round her cottage going off sometimes for a day sometimes for a week but never longer After her head was laid in the dust Dick took altogether to the woods with Crusoe and Charlie the wild horse as his only companions and his mother s Bible in the breast of his hunting shirt And soon Dick the bold hunter and his dog Crusoe became renowned in the frontier settlements from the banks of the Yellow Stone River to the Gulf of Mexico Many a grizzly bear did the famous silver rifle lay low and many a wild exciting chase and adventure did Dick go through but during his occasional visits to the Mustang Valley he was wont to say to Joe Blunt and Henri with whom he always sojourned that nothin he ever felt or saw came up to his first grand dash over the Western Prairies into the heart of the Rocky Mountains And in saying this with enthusiasm in his eye and voice Dick invariably appealed to and received a ready affirmative glance from his early companion and his faithful loving friend the dog Crusoe THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Dog Crusoe and his Master by R M Ballantyne END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DOG CRUSOE AND HIS
