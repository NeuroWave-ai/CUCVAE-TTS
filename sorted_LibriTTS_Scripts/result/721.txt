none	none	VII THE BIRDLING FLIES AWAY The Birds Christmas Carol I A LITTLE SNOW BIRD 
1061_146197_000014_000000	train-clean-360	It was very early Christmas morning and in the stillness of the dawn with the soft snow falling on the housetops a little child was born in the Bird household 
1061_146197_000015_000000	train-clean-360	They had intended to name the baby Lucy if it were a girl but they hadn t expected her on Christmas morning and a real Christmas baby was not to be lightly named the whole family agreed in that 
1061_146197_000016_000000	train-clean-360	They were consulting about it in the nursery 
none	none	mister Bird said that he had assisted in naming the three boys and that he should leave this matter entirely to missus Bird Donald wanted the child called Maud after a pretty little curly haired girl who sat next him in school Paul chose Luella for Luella was the nurse who had been with him during his whole babyhood up to the time of his first trousers and the name suggested all sorts of comfortable things Uncle Jack said that the first girl should always be named for her mother no matter how hideous the name happened to be Grandma said that she would prefer not to take any part in the discussion and everybody suddenly remembered that missus Bird had thought of naming the baby Lucy for Grandma herself and while it would be indelicate for her to favor that name it would be against human nature for her to suggest any other under the circumstances 
1061_146197_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Hugh the hitherto baby if that is a possible term sat in one corner and said nothing but felt in some mysterious way that his nose was out of joint for there was a newer baby now a possibility he had never taken into consideration and the first girl too a still higher development of treason which made him actually green with jealousy 
none	none	But it was too profound a subject to be settled then and there on the spot besides Mama had not been asked and everybody felt it rather absurd after all to forestall a decree that was certain to be absolutely wise just and perfect The reason that the subject had been brought up at all so early in the day lay in the fact that missus Bird never allowed her babies to go over night unnamed 
1061_146197_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She was a person of so great decision of character that she would have blushed at such a thing she said that to let blessed babies go dangling and dawdling about without names for months and months was enough to ruin them for life 
1061_146197_000020_000002	train-clean-360	She also said that if one could not make up one s mind in twenty four hours it was a sign that but I will not repeat the rest as it might prejudice you against the most charming woman in the world 
none	none	So Donald took his new velocipede and went out to ride up and down the stone pavement and notch the shins of innocent people as they passed by while Paul spun his musical top on the front steps But Hugh refused to leave the scene of action He seated himself on the top stair in the hall banged his head against the railing a few times just by way of uncorking the vials of his wrath and then subsided into gloomy silence waiting to declare war if more first girl babies were thrust upon a family already surfeited with that unnecessary article 
1061_146197_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile dear missus Bird lay in her room weak but safe and happy with her sweet girl baby by her side and the heaven of motherhood opening before her 
1061_146197_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Nurse was making gruel in the kitchen and the room was dim and quiet 
none	none	There was a cheerful open fire in the grate but though the shutters were closed the side windows that looked out on the Church of our Saviour next door were wide open Suddenly a sound of music poured out into the bright air and drifted into the chamber 
1061_146197_000024_000001	train-clean-360	It was the boy choir singing Christmas anthems Higher and higher rose the clear fresh voices full of hope and cheer as children s voices always are 
1061_146197_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Fuller and fuller grew the burst of melody as one glad strain fell upon another in joyful harmony 
none	none	Carol brothers carol Carol joyfully Carol the good tidings Carol merrily And pray a gladsome Christmas For all your fellow men Carol brothers carol Christmas Day again One verse followed another always with the same glad refrain And pray a gladsome Christmas For all your fellow men Carol brothers carol Christmas Day again 
1061_146197_000028_000000	train-clean-360	missus Bird thought as the music floated in upon her gentle sleep that she had slipped into heaven with her new baby and that the angels were bidding them welcome 
none	none	But the tiny bundle by her side stirred a little and though it was scarcely more than the ruffling of a feather she awoke for the mother ear is so close to the heart that it can hear the faintest whisper of a child 
1061_146197_000029_000000	train-clean-360	She opened her eyes and drew the baby closer 
1061_146197_000029_000001	train-clean-360	It looked like a rose dipped in milk she thought this pink and white blossom of girlhood or like a pink cherub with its halo of pale yellow hair finer than floss silk 
none	none	Carol brothers carol Carol joyfully Carol the good tidings Carol merrily The voices were brimming over with joy
1061_146197_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Why my baby whispered missus Bird in soft surprise I had forgotten what day it was 
1061_146197_000032_000001	train-clean-360	You are a little Christmas child and we will name you Carol mother s little Christmas Carol 
1061_146197_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 What said mister Bird coming in softly and closing the door behind him 
none	none	Why Donald 
5731_50778_000042_000002	train-clean-360	don t you 
none	none	think Carol is a sweet name for a Christmas baby It came to me just a moment ago in the singing as I was lying here half asleep and half awake
1061_146197_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I think it is a charming name dear heart and that it sounds just like you and I hope that being a girl this baby has some chance of being as lovely as her mother at which speech from the baby s papa missus Bird though she was as weak and tired as she could be blushed with happiness 
none	none	And so Carol came by her name Of course it was thought foolish by many people though Uncle Jack declared laughingly that it was very strange if a whole family of Birds could not be indulged in a single Carol and Grandma who adored the child thought the name much more appropriate than Lucy but was glad that people would probably think it short for Caroline Perhaps because she was born in holiday time Carol was a very happy baby Of course she was too tiny to understand the joy of Christmas tide but people say there is everything in a good beginning and she may have breathed in unconsciously the fragrance of evergreens and holiday dinners while the peals of sleigh bells and the laughter of happy children may have fallen upon her baby ears and wakened in them a glad surprise at the merry world she had come to live in Her cheeks and lips were as red as holly berries her hair was for all the world the color of a Christmas candle flame her eyes were bright as stars her laugh like a chime of Christmas bells and her tiny hands forever outstretched in giving Such a generous little creature you never saw A spoonful of bread and milk had always to be taken by Mama or nurse before Carol could enjoy her supper and whatever bit of cake or sweetmeat found its way into her pretty fingers it was straightway broken in half and shared with Donald Paul or Hugh and when they made believe nibble the morsel with affected enjoyment she would clap her hands and crow with delight Why does she do it asked Donald thoughtfully None of us boys ever did I hardly know said Mama catching her darling to her heart except that she is a little Christmas child and so she has a tiny share of the blessedest birthday the world ever saw II DROOPING WINGS It was December ten years later Carol had seen nine Christmas trees lighted on her birthdays one after another nine times she had assisted in the holiday festivities of the household though in her babyhood her share of the gayeties was somewhat limited For five years certainly she had hidden presents for Mama and Papa in their own bureau drawers and harbored a number of secrets sufficiently large to burst a baby s brain had it not been for the relief gained by whispering them all to Mama at night when she was in her crib a proceeding which did not in the least lessen the value of a secret in her innocent mind For five years she had heard Twas the night before Christmas and hung up a scarlet stocking many sizes too large for her and pinned a sprig of holly on her little white night gown to show Santa Claus that she was a truly Christmas child and dreamed of fur coated saints and toy packs and reindeer and wished everybody a Merry Christmas before it was light in the morning and lent every one of her new toys to the neighbors children before noon and eaten turkey and plum pudding and gone to bed at night in a trance of happiness at the day s pleasures Donald was away at college now Paul and Hugh were great manly fellows taller than their mother Papa Bird had grey hairs in his whiskers and Grandma God bless her had been four Christmases in heaven But Christmas in the Birds Nest was scarcely as merry now as it used to be in the bygone years for the little child that once brought such an added blessing to the day lay month after month a patient helpless invalid in the room where she was born She had never been very strong in body and it was with a pang of terror her mother and father noticed soon after she was five years old that she began to limp ever so slightly to complain too often of weariness and to nestle close to her mother saying she would rather not go out to play please The illness was slight at first and hope was always stirring in missus Bird s heart Carol would feel stronger in the summer time or She would be better when she had spent a year in the country or She would outgrow it or They would try a new physician but by and by it came to be all too sure that no physician save One could make Carol strong again and that no summer time nor country air unless it were the everlasting summer time in a heavenly country could bring back the little girl to health The cheeks and lips that were once as red as holly berries faded to faint pink the star like eyes grew softer for they often gleamed through tears and the gay child laugh that had been like a chime of Christmas bells gave place to a smile so lovely so touching so tender and patient that it filled every corner of the house with a gentle radiance that might have come from the face of the Christ child himself Love could do nothing and when we have said that we have said all for it is stronger than anything else in the whole wide world mister and missus Bird were talking it over one evening when all the children were asleep A famous physician had visited them that day and told them that sometime it might be in one year it might be in more Carol would slip quietly off into heaven whence she came Dear heart said mister Bird pacing up and down the library floor it is no use to shut our eyes to it any longer Carol will never be well again It almost seems as if I could not bear it when I think of that loveliest child doomed to lie there day after day and what is still more to suffer pain that we are helpless to keep away from her Merry Christmas indeed it gets to be the saddest day in the year to me and poor mister Bird sank into a chair by the table and buried his face in his hands to keep his wife from seeing the tears that would come in spite of all his efforts But Donald dear said sweet missus Bird with trembling voice Christmas day may not be so merry with us as it used but it is very happy and that is better and very blessed and that is better yet I suffer chiefly for Carol s sake but I have almost given up being sorrowful for my own I am too happy in the child and I see too clearly what she has done for us and for our boys That s true bless her sweet heart said mister Bird she has been better than a daily sermon in the house ever since she was born and especially since she was taken ill Yes Donald and Paul and Hugh were three strong willful boisterous boys but you seldom see such tenderness devotion thought for others and self denial in lads of their years A quarrel or a hot word is almost unknown in this house Why Carol would hear it and it would distress her she is so full of love and goodness The boys study with all their might and main Why Partly at least because they like to teach Carol and amuse her by telling her what they read When the seamstress comes she likes to sew in Miss Carol s room because there she forgets her own troubles which Heaven knows are sore enough And as for me Donald I am a better woman every day for Carol s sake I have to be her eyes ears feet hands her strength her hope and she my own little child is my example I was wrong dear heart said mister Bird more cheerfully we will try not to repine but to rejoice instead that we have an angel of the house like Carol And as for her future missus Bird went on I think we need not be over anxious I feel as if she did not belong altogether to us and when she has done what God sent her for He will take her back to Himself and it may not be very long Here it was poor missus Bird s turn to break down and mister Bird s turn to comfort her III THE BIRD S NEST Carol herself knew nothing of motherly tears and fatherly anxieties she lived on peacefully in the room where she was born But you never would have known that room for mister Bird had a great deal of money and though he felt sometimes as if he wanted to throw it all in the ocean since it could not buy a strong body for his little girl yet he was glad to make the place she lived in just as beautiful as it could be made The room had been extended by the building of a large addition that hung out over the garden below and was so filled with windows that it might have been a conservatory The ones on the side were thus still nearer the little Church of our Saviour than they used to be those in front looked out on the beautiful harbor and those in the back commanded a view of nothing in particular but a little alley nevertheless they were pleasantest of all to Carol for the 
5731_50777_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Ruggles 
none	none	family lived in the alley and the nine little middle sized and big Ruggles children were the source of inexhaustible interest The shutters could all be opened and Carol could take a real sun bath in this lovely glass house or they could all be closed when the dear head ached or the dear eyes were tired The carpet was of soft grey with clusters of green bay and holly leaves The furniture was of white wood on which an artist had painted snow scenes and Christmas trees and groups of merry children ringing bells and singing carols Donald had made a pretty polished shelf and screwed it on to the outside of the footboard and the boys always kept this full of blooming plants which they changed from time to time the head board too had a bracket on either side where there were pots of maidenhair ferns Love birds and canaries hung in their golden houses in the windows and they poor caged things could hop as far from their wooden perches as Carol could venture from her little white bed On one side of the room was a bookcase filled with hundreds yes I mean it with hundreds and hundreds of books books with gay colored pictures books without books with black and white outline sketches books with none at all books with verses books with stories books that made children laugh and some that made them cry books with words of one syllable for tiny boys and girls and books with words of fearful length to puzzle wise ones This was Carol s Circulating Library Every Saturday she chose ten books jotting their names down in a little diary into these she slipped cards that said Please keep this book two weeks and read it With love 
5731_50776_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Carol Bird

5731_50777_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Carol Bird 
none	none	Then missus Bird stepped into her carriage and took the ten books to the Childrens Hospital and brought home ten others that she had left there the fortnight before This was a source of great happiness for some of the Hospital children that were old enough to print or write and were strong enough to do it wrote Carol cunning little letters about the books and she answered them and they grew to be friends It is very funny but you do not always have to see people to love them 
5731_50776_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Just think 
none	none	about it and see if it isn t so There was a high wainscoting of wood about the room and on top of this in a narrow gilt framework ran a row of illuminated pictures illustrating fairy tales all in dull blue and gold and scarlet and silver and other lovely colors From the door to the closet there was the story of The Fair One with Golden Locks from closet to bookcase ran Puss in Boots from bookcase to fireplace was Jack the Giant killer and on the other side of the room were Hop o my Thumb The Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella Then there was a great closet full of beautiful things to wear but they were all dressing gowns and slippers and shawls and there were drawers full of toys and games but they were such as you could play with on your lap There were no ninepins nor balls nor bows and arrows nor bean bags nor tennis rackets but after all other children needed these more than Carol Bird for she was always happy and contented whatever she had or whatever she lacked and after the room had been made so lovely for her on her eighth Christmas she always called herself in fun a Bird of Paradise On these particular December days she was happier than usual for Uncle Jack was coming from Europe to spend the holidays Dear funny jolly loving wise Uncle Jack who came every two or three years and brought so much joy with him that the world looked as black as a thunder cloud for a week after he went away again The mail had brought this letter LONDON Nov twenty eighth one hundred eighty eight Wish you merry Christmas you dearest birdlings in America Preen your feathers and stretch the Birds nest a little if you please and let Uncle Jack in for the holidays I am coming with such a trunk full of treasures that you ll have to borrow the stockings of Barnum s Giant and Giantess I am coming to squeeze a certain little lady bird until she cries for mercy I am coming to see if I can find a boy to take care of a little black pony I bought lately It s the strangest thing I ever knew I ve hunted all over Europe and can t find a boy to suit me I ll tell you why I ve set my heart on finding one with a dimple in his chin because this pony particularly likes dimples Hurrah cried Hugh bless my dear dimple I ll never be ashamed of it again Please drop a note to the clerk of the weather and have a good rousing snow storm say on the twenty second None of your meek gentle nonsensical shilly shallying snow storms not the sort where the flakes float lazily down from the sky as if they didn t care whether they ever got here or not and then melt away as soon as they touch the earth but a regular business like whizzing whirring blurring cutting snow storm warranted to freeze and stay on I should like rather a LARGE Christmas tree if it s convenient not one of those sprigs five or six feet high that you used to have three or four years ago when the birdlings were not fairly feathered out but a tree of some size Set it up in the garret if necessary and then we can cut a hole in the roof if the tree chances to be too high for the room Tell Bridget to begin to fatten a turkey Tell her by the twentieth of December that turkey must not be able to stand on its legs for fat and then on the next three days she must allow it to recline easily on its side and stuff it to bursting One ounce of stuffing beforehand is worth a pound afterwards The pudding must be unusually huge and darkly deeply lugubriously black in color It must be stuck so full of plums that the pudding itself will ooze out into the pan and not be brought on to the table at all I expect to be there by the twentieth to manage these little things remembering it is the early Bird that catches the worm but give you the instructions in case I should be delayed And Carol must decide on the size of the tree she knows best she was a Christmas child and she must plead for the snow storm the clerk of the weather may pay some attention to her and she must look up the boy with the dimple for me she s likelier to find him than I am this minute She must advise about the turkey and Bridget must bring the pudding to her bedside and let her drop every separate plum into it and stir it once for luck or I ll not eat a single slice for Carol is the dearest part of Christmas to Uncle Jack and he ll have none of it without her She is better than all the turkeys and puddings and apples and spare ribs and wreaths and garlands and mistletoe and stockings and chimneys and sleigh bells in Christendom She is the very sweetest Christmas Carol that was ever written said sung or chanted and I am coming as fast as ships and railway trains can carry me to tell her so Carol s joy knew no bounds mister and missus Bird laughed like children and kissed each other for sheer delight and when the boys heard it they simply whooped like wild Indians until the Ruggles family whose back yard joined their garden gathered at the door and wondered what was up in the big house IV BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER Uncle Jack did really come on the twentieth 
5731_50776_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He was not detained by business nor did he get left behind nor snowed up as frequently happens in stories and in real life too I am afraid 
5731_50776_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The snow storm came also and the turkey nearly died a natural and premature death from over eating 
5731_50776_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Donald came too Donald with a line of down upon his upper lip and Greek and Latin on his tongue and stores of knowledge in his handsome head and stories bless me you couldn t turn over a chip without reminding Donald of something that happened at College 
none	none	One or the other was always at Carol s bedside for they fancied her paler than she used to be and they could not bear her out of sight It was Uncle lack though who sat beside her in the winter twilights The room was quiet and almost dark save for the snow light outside and the flickering flame of the fire that danced over the Sleeping Beauty s face and touched the Fair One s golden locks with ruddier glory 
5731_50776_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Carol s hand all too thin and white these latter days lay close clasped in Uncle Jack s and they talked together quietly of many many things 
none	none	I want to tell you all about my plans for Christmas this year Uncle Jack said Carol on the first evening of his visit because it will be the loveliest one I ever had The boys laugh at me for caring so much about it but it isn t altogether because it is Christmas nor because it is my birthday but long long ago when I first began to be ill I used to think the first thing when I waked on Christmas morning To day is Christ s birthday AND MINE I did not put the words close together because that made it seem too bold but I first thought Christ s birthday and then in a minute softly to myself AND MINE Christ s birthday AND MINE And so I do not quite feel about Christmas as other girls do 
5731_50776_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Mama says she supposes that ever so many other children have been born on that day 
5731_50776_000004_000005	train-clean-360	I often wonder where they are Uncle Jack and whether it is a dear thought to them too or whether I am so much in bed and so often alone that it means more to me 
5731_50776_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Oh I do hope that none of them are poor or cold or hungry and I wish I wish they were all as happy as I because they are my little brothers and sisters 
none	none	Now Uncle Jack dear I am going to try and make somebody happy every single Christmas that I live and this year it is to be the Ruggleses in the rear
5731_50776_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 That large and interesting brood of children in the little house at the end of the back garden 
5731_50776_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes isn t it nice to see so many together 
5731_50776_000006_000001	train-clean-360	We ought to call them the Ruggles children of course but Donald began talking of them as the Ruggleses in the rear and Papa and Mama took it up and now we cannot seem to help it 
5731_50776_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The house was built for mister Carter s coachman but mister Carter lives in Europe and the gentleman who rents his place doesn t care what happens to it and so this poor Irish family came to live there 
none	none	When they first moved in I used to sit in my window and watch them play in their backyard they are so strong and jolly and good natured and then one day I had a terrible headache and Donald asked them if they would please not scream quite so loud and they explained that they were having a game of circus but that they would change and play Deaf and Dumb School all the afternoon Ha ha ha laughed Uncle Jack what an obliging family to be sure
5731_50776_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes we all thought it very funny and I smiled at them from the window when I was well enough to be up again 
none	none	Now Sarah Maud comes to her door when the children come home from school and if Mama nods her head Yes that means Carol is very well and then you ought to hear the little Ruggleses yell I believe they try to see how much noise they can make but if Mama shakes her head No they always play at quiet games 
5731_50776_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Then one day Cary my pet canary flew out of her cage and Peter Ruggles caught her and brought her back and I had him up here in my room to thank him 
5731_50776_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Is Peter the oldest 
5731_50776_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 No Sarah Maud is the oldest she helps do the washing and Peter is the next 
5731_50776_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He is a dressmaker s boy 
5731_50776_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 And which is the pretty little red haired girl 
5731_50776_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 That s Kitty 
5731_50776_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 And the fat youngster 
5731_50776_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Baby Larry 
5731_50778_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Larry 
5731_50776_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 And that freckled one 
5731_50776_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Now don t laugh that s Peoria 
5731_50776_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Carol you are joking 
5731_50776_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No really Uncle dear 
5731_50776_000018_000001	train-clean-360	She was born in Peoria that s all 
5731_50776_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 And is the next boy Oshkosh 
5731_50776_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 No laughed Carol the others are Susan and Clement and Eily and Cornelius 
5731_50776_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 How did you ever learn all their names 
5731_50776_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I have what I call a window school It is too cold now but in warm weather I am wheeled out on my little balcony and the Ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence and sit down on the roof of our carriage house 
5731_50776_000022_000001	train-clean-360	That brings them quite near and I read to them and tell them stories On Thanksgiving Day they came up for a few minutes it was quite warm at eleven o clock and we told each other what we had to be thankful for but they gave such queer answers that Papa had to run away for fear of laughing and I couldn t understand them very well 
5731_50776_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Susan was thankful for TRUNKS of all things in the world Cornelius for horse cars Kitty for pork steak while Clem who is very quiet brightened up when I came to him and said he was thankful for HIS LAME PUPPY Wasn t that pretty 
5731_50776_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 It might teach some of us a lesson mightn t it little girl 
5731_50776_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what Mama said 
5731_50776_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Now I m going to give this whole Christmas to the Ruggleses and Uncle Jack I earned part of the money myself

5731_50776_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you see it could not be my own own Christmas if Papa gave me all the money and I thought to really keep Christ s birthday I ought to do something of my very own and so I talked with Mama 
5731_50776_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Of course she thought of something lovely she always does Mama s head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts and all I have to do is ask and out pops the very one I want 
5731_50776_000026_000002	train-clean-360	This thought was to let her write down just as I told her a description of how a little girl lived in her own room three years and what she did to amuse herself and we sent it to a magazine and got twenty five dollars for it

none	none	I should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table Uncle Jack for nobody could ever be frightened of you you dearest dearest dearest thing that ever was Mama is going to help us but Papa and the boys are going to eat together down stairs for fear of making the little Ruggleses shy and after we ve had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening church service if it comes before the children go 
5731_50776_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I have written a letter to the organist and asked him if I might have the two songs I like best

5731_50776_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I am the little sick girl who lives next door to the church and as I seldom go out the music on practice days and Sundays is one of my greatest pleasures 
5731_50776_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I want to know if you can let the boys sing Carol brothers carol on Christmas night and if the one who sings My ain countree so beautifully may please sing that too 
5731_50776_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I think it is the loveliest song in the world but it always makes me cry doesn t it you

5731_50776_000036_000000	train-clean-360	P S The reason I like Carol brothers carol is because the choir boys sang it eleven years ago the morning I was born and put it into Mama s head to call me Carol 
5731_50776_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She didn t remember then that my other name would be Bird because she was half asleep and couldn t think of but one thing at a time 
none	none	Donald says if I had been born on the Fourth of July they would have named me Independence or if on the twenty second of February Georgina or even Cherry like Cherry in Martin Chuzzlewit but I like my own name and birthday best

5731_50776_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Uncle Jack thought the letter quite right and did not even smile at her telling the organist so many family items 
5731_50776_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The days flew by as they always fly in holiday time and it was Christmas eve before anybody knew it 
none	none	The family festival was quiet and very pleasant but quite swallowed up in the grander preparations for next day 
5731_50776_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Carol and Elfrida her pretty German nurse had ransacked books and introduced so many plans and plays and customs and merry makings from Germany and Holland and England and a dozen other places that you would scarcely have known how or where you were keeping Christmas 
5731_50776_000039_000004	train-clean-360	The dog and the cat had enjoyed their celebration under Carol s direction Each had a tiny table with a lighted candle in the center and a bit of Bologna sausage placed very near it and everybody laughed till the tears stood in their eyes to see Villikins and Dinah struggle to nibble the sausages and at the same time evade the candle flame 
5731_50776_000039_000005	train-clean-360	Villikins barked and sniffed and howled in impatience and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize though he singed his nose in doing it 
5731_50776_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Dinah meanwhile watched him placidly her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation and after all excitement had subsided walked with dignity to the table her beautiful gray satin tail sweeping behind her and calmly putting up one velvet paw drew the sausage gently down and walked out of the room without turning a hair so to speak 
5731_50776_000039_000007	train-clean-360	Elfrida had scattered handfuls of seeds over the snow in the garden that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning and had stuffed bundles of dried grasses in the fireplaces so that the reindeer of Santa Claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country 
5731_50776_000039_000008	train-clean-360	This was really only done for fun but it pleased Carol 
none	none	And when after dinner the whole family had gone to church to see the Christmas decorations Carol limped wearily out on her little crutches and with Elfrida s help placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall 
5731_50776_000040_000001	train-clean-360	That was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year 
5731_50776_000040_000002	train-clean-360	There were Papa s stout top boots Mama s pretty buttoned shoes next then Uncle Jack s Donald s Paul s and Hugh s and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers 
5731_50776_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Last and sweetest of all like the little children in Austria she put a lighted candle in her window to guide the dear Christ child lest he should stumble in the dark night as he passed up the deserted street

none	none	CAROL BIRD 
5731_50777_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Breakfast was on the table promptly at seven o clock and there was very little of it too for it was an excellent day for short rations though missus Ruggles heaved a sigh as she reflected that even the boys with their India rubber stomachs would be just as hungry the day after the dinner party as if they had never had any at all 
none	none	As soon as the scanty meal was over she announced the plan of the campaign Now Susan you an Kitty wash up the dishes an Peter can t you spread up the beds so t I can git ter cuttin out Larry s new suit I ain t satisfied with his close an I thought in the night of a way to make him a dress out of my old plaid shawl kind o Scotch style yer know

5731_50777_000008_000008	train-clean-360	Won t yer Peory 
none	none	Peoria was young and greedy and thought the remedy so much worse than the disease that she set up a deafening howl at the projected bargain a howl so rebellious and so out of all season that her mother started in her direction with flashing eye and uplifted hand but she let it fall suddenly saying No I won t lick ye Christmas day if yer drive me crazy but speak up smart now n say whether yer d ruther give Tim Cullen half yer candy or go bare legged ter the party The matter being put so plainly Peoria collected her faculties dried her tears and chose the lesser evil Clem having hastened the decision by an affectionate wink that meant he d go halves with her on his candy
5731_50777_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a lady cried her mother 
none	none	Now you young ones that ain t doin nothin play all yer want ter before noontime for after ye git through eatin at twelve o clock me n Sarah Maud s goin ter give yer such a washin an combin an dressin as yer never had before an never will agin an then I m goin to set yer down an give yer two solid hours trainin in manners an twon t be no foolin neither All we ve got ter do s go eat grumbled Peter Well that s enough responded his mother there s more n one way of eatin let me tell yer an you ve got a heap ter learn about it Peter Ruggles Lord sakes I wish you childern could see the way I was fetched up to eat never took a meal o vittles in the kitchen before I married Ruggles but yer can t keep up that style with nine young ones n yer Pa always off ter sea The big Ruggleses worked so well and the little Ruggleses kept from under foot so successfully that by one o clock nine complete toilets were laid out in solemn grandeur on the beds 
5731_50777_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I say complete but I do not know whether they would be called so in the best society 
5731_50777_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The law of compensation had been well applied he that had necktie had no cuffs she that had sash had no handkerchief and vice versa but they all had boots and a certain amount of clothing such as it was the outside layer being in every case quite above criticism 
5731_50777_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Sarah Maud said missus Ruggles her face shining with excitement everything is red up an we can begin 
none	none	I ve got a boiler n a kettle n a pot o hot water Peter you go into the back bedroom an I ll take Susan Kitty Peory an Cornelius an Sarah Maud you take Clem n Eily n Larry one to a time an git as fur as you can with em an then I ll finish em off while you do yerself Sarah Maud couldn t have scrubbed with any more decision and force if she had been doing floors and the little Ruggleses bore it bravely not from natural heroism but for the joy that was set before them Not being satisfied however with the tone of their complexions she wound up operations by applying a little Bristol brick from the knife board which served as the proverbial last straw from under which the little Ruggleses issued rather red and raw and out of temper When the clock struck three they were all clothed and most of them in their right minds ready for those last touches that always take the most time Kitty s red hair was curled in thirty four ringlets Sarah Maud s was braided in one pig tail and Susan s and Eily s in two braids apiece while Peoria s resisted all advances in the shape of hair oils and stuck out straight on all sides like that of the Circassian girl of the circus so Clem said and he was sent into the bed room for it too from whence he was dragged out forgivingly by Peoria herself five minutes later Then exciting moment came linen collars for some and neckties and bows for others and Eureka the Ruggleses were dressed and Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these 
5731_50777_000015_000003	train-clean-360	A row of seats was formed directly through the middle of the kitchen 
5731_50777_000015_000004	train-clean-360	There were not quite chairs enough for ten since the family had rarely all wanted to sit down at once somebody always being out or in bed but the wood box and the coal hod finished out the line nicely 
5731_50777_000015_000005	train-clean-360	The children took their places according to age Sarah Maud at the head and Larry on the coal hod and missus Ruggles seated herself in front surveying them proudly as she wiped the sweat of honest toil from her brow 
none	none	Well she exclaimed if I do say so as shouldn t I never see a cleaner more stylish mess o childern in my life I do wish Ruggles could look at ye for a minute Now I ve of en told ye what kind of a family the McGrills was I ve got some reason to be proud your uncle is on the po lice force o New York city you can take up the newspaper most any day an see his name printed right out James McGrill and I can t have my childern fetched up common like some folks When they go out they ve got to have close and learn ter act decent Now I want ter see how yer goin to behave when yer git there to night Let s start in at the beginnin n act out the whole business Pile into the bed room there every last one of ye an show me how yer goin ter go in t the parlor This ll be the parlor n I ll be Mis Bird The youngsters hustled into the next room in high glee and missus Ruggles drew herself up in her chair with an infinitely haughty and purse proud expression that much better suited a descendant of the McGrills than modest missus Bird The bed room was small and there presently ensued such a clatter that you would have thought a herd of wild cattle had broken loose the door opened and they straggled in all the little ones giggling with Sarah Maud at the head looking as if she had been caught in the act of stealing sheep while Larry being last in line seemed to think the door a sort of gate of heaven which would be shut in his face if he didn t get there in time accordingly he struggled ahead of his elders and disgraced himself by tumbling in head foremost 
5731_50777_000017_000000	train-clean-360	missus Ruggles looked severe 
none	none	There I knew yer d do it in some sech fool way try it agin n if Larry can t come in on two legs he can stay ter home 
5731_50777_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The matter began to assume a graver aspect the little Ruggleses stopped giggling and backed into the bed room issuing presently with lock step Indian file a scared and hunted expression in every countenance 
none	none	No no no cried missus Ruggles in despair Yer look for all the world like a gang o pris ners there ain t no style ter that spread out more can t yer an act kind o careless like nobody s goin ter kill ye 
5731_50777_000019_000001	train-clean-360	The third time brought deserved success and the pupils took their seats in the row 
none	none	Now yer know said missus Ruggles there ain t enough decent hats to go round an if there was I don know s I d let yer wear em for the boys would never think to take em off when they got inside but anyhow there ain t enough good ones 
5731_50777_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Now look me in the eye 
none	none	You needn t wear no hats none of yer en when yer get int the parlor n they ask yer ter lay off yer hats Sarah Maud must speak up an say it was sech a pleasant evenin an sech a short walk that you left yer hats to home to save trouble 
5731_50777_000019_000005	train-clean-360	Now can you remember 
5731_50777_000020_000000	train-clean-360	All the little Ruggleses shouted Yes marm in chorus 
none	none	What have you got ter do with it demanded their mother did I tell YOU to say it Wasn t I talkin ter Sarah Maud 
5731_50777_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The little Ruggleses hung their diminished heads 
none	none	Yes marm they piped more feebly Now git up all of ye an try it 
5731_50777_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Speak up Sarah Maud 
none	none	Sarah Maud s tongue clove to the roof of her mouth
5731_50777_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Quick 
none	none	Ma thought it was sech a pleasant hat that we d we d better leave our short walk to home recited Sarah Maud in an agony of mental effort 
5731_50777_000025_000000	train-clean-360	This was too much for the boys 
none	none	Oh whatever shall I do with ye moaned the unhappy mother I suppose I ve got to learn it to yer which she did word for word until Sarah Maud thought she could stand on her head and say it backwards Now Cornelius what are YOU goin ter say ter make yerself good comp ny
5731_50777_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Dunno said Cornelius turning pale 
none	none	Well ye ain t goin to set there like a bump on a log thout sayin a word ter pay for yer vittles air ye 
5731_50777_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Ask Mis Bird how she s feelin this evenin or if mister Bird s havin a busy season or somethin like that 
none	none	Now we ll make b lieve we ve got ter the dinner that won t be so hard cause yer ll have somethin to do it s awful bothersome ter stan round an act stylish If they have napkins Sarah Maud down to Peory may put em in their laps n the rest of ye can tuck em in yer necks Don t eat with yer fingers don t grab no vittles off one nother s plates don t reach out for nothin but wait till yer asked n if yer never GIT asked don t git up and grab it don t spill nothin on the table cloth or like s not Mis Bird ll send yer away from the table Now we ll try a few things ter see how they ll go mister Clement do you eat cramb ry sarse Bet yer life cried Clem who not having taken in the idea exactly had mistaken this for an ordinary family question
5731_50777_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Clement Ruggles do you mean to tell me that you d say that to a dinner party 
none	none	I ll give ye one more chance

none	none	I ain t particler as ter color anything that nobody else wants will suit me answered Peter with his best air
5731_50777_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 First rate 
5731_50777_000035_000001	train-clean-360	nobody could speak more genteel than that 
none	none	Miss Kitty will you have hard or soft sarse with your pudden A little of both if you please an I m much obliged said Kitty with decided ease and grace at which all the other Ruggleses pointed the finger of shame at her and Peter GRUNTED expressively that their meaning might not be mistaken
5731_50777_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 You just stop your gruntin Peter Ruggles that was all right 
none	none	I wish I could git it inter your heads that it ain t so much what yer say as the way yer say it Eily you an Larry s too little to train so you just look at the rest an do s they do an the Lord have mercy on ye an help ye to act decent 
5731_50777_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Now is there anything more ye d like to practice 
none	none	If yer tell me one more thing I can t set up an eat said Peter gloomily I m so cram full o manners now I m ready ter bust thout no dinner at all Me too chimed in Cornelius Well I m sorry for yer both rejoined missus Ruggles sarcastically if the mount o manners yer ve got on hand now troubles ye you re dreadful easy hurt Now Sarah Maud after dinner about once in so often you must say I guess we d better be goin an if they say Oh no set a while longer yer can stay but if they don t say nothin you ve got ter get up an go Can you remember
5731_50777_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 ABOUT ONCE IN SO OFTEN Could any words in the language be fraught with more terrible and wearing uncertainty 
none	none	Well answered Sarah Maud mournfully seems as if this whole dinner party set right square on top o me Maybe I could manage my own manners but ter manage nine mannerses is worse n staying to home
5731_50777_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh don t fret said her mother good naturedly I guess you ll git along 
none	none	I wouldn t mind if folks would only say Oh childern will be childern but they won t They ll say Land o Goodness who fetched them childern up Now it s quarter past five you can go an whatever yer do don t forget your mother was a McGrill VI WHEN THE PIE WAS OPENED THE BIRDS BEGAN TO SING The children went out the back door quietly and were presently lost to sight Sarah Maud slipping and stumbling along absent mindedly as she recited under her breath It was such a pleasant evenin an sech a short walk we thought we d leave our hats to home 
5731_50778_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Peter rang the door bell and presently a servant admitted them and whispering something in Sarah s ear drew her downstairs into the kitchen 
5731_50778_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The other Ruggleses stood in horror stricken groups as the door closed behind their commanding officer but there was no time for reflection for a voice from above was heard saying Come right up stairs please 
5731_50778_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Theirs not to make reply Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do or die 
5731_50778_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Accordingly they walked upstairs and Elfrida the nurse ushered them into a room more splendid than anything they had ever seen 
none	none	But oh woe where was Sarah Maud and was it Fate that missus Bird should say at once Did you lay your hats in the hall Peter felt himself elected by circumstance the head of the family and casting one imploring look at tongue tied Susan standing next him said huskily It was so very pleasant that that That we hadn t good hats enough to go round put in little Susan bravely to help him out and then froze with horror that the ill fated words had slipped off her tongue 
5731_50778_000006_000000	train-clean-360	However missus Bird said pleasantly Of course you wouldn t wear hats such a short distance I forgot when I asked 
5731_50778_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Now will you come right in to Miss Carol s room she is so anxious to see you 
5731_50778_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Just then Sarah Maud came up the back stairs so radiant with joy from her secret interview with the cook that Peter could have pinched her with a clear conscience and Carol gave them a joyful welcome 
5731_50778_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 But where is Baby Larry she cried looking over the group with searching eye 
5731_50778_000007_000002	train-clean-360	 Didn t he come 
none	none	Larry 
5731_50778_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Larry Good Gracious where was Larry 
5731_50778_000008_000002	train-clean-360	They were all sure that he had come in with them for Susan remembered scolding him for tripping over the door mat 
5731_50778_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Uncle Jack went into convulsions of laughter 
5731_50778_000008_000004	train-clean-360	 Are you sure there were nine of you he asked merrily 
5731_50778_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I think so sir said Peoria timidly but anyhow there was Larry and she showed signs of weeping 
5731_50778_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh well cheer up cried Uncle Jack 
5731_50778_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I guess he s not lost only mislaid 
5731_50778_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I ll go and find him before you can say Jack Robinson 
none	none	I ll go too if you please sir said Sarah Maud for it was my place to mind him an if he s lost I can t relish my vittles 
5731_50778_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The other Ruggleses stood rooted to the floor 
none	none	Was this a dinner party forsooth and if so why were such things ever spoken of as festive occasions 
5731_50778_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Sarah Maud went out through the hall calling Larry 
none	none	Larry and without any interval of suspense a thin voice piped up from below Here I be The truth was that Larry being deserted by his natural guardian dropped behind the rest and wriggled into the hat tree to wait for her having no notion of walking unprotected into the jaws of a dinner party Finding that she did not come he tried to crawl from his refuge and call somebody when dark and dreadful ending to a tragic day he found that he was too much intertwined with umbrellas and canes to move a single step 
5731_50778_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He was afraid to yell 
none	none	When I have said this of Larry Ruggles I have pictured a state of helpless terror that ought to wring tears from every eye and the sound of Sarah Maud s beloved voice some seconds later was like a strain of angel music in his ears 
5731_50778_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Uncle Jack dried his tears carried him upstairs and soon had him in breathless fits of laughter while Carol so made the other Ruggleses forget themselves that they were soon talking like accomplished diners out 
5731_50778_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Carol s bed had been moved into the farthest corner of the room and she was lying on the outside dressed in a wonderful soft white wrapper 
5731_50778_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Her golden hair fell in soft fluffy curls over her white forehead and neck her cheeks flushed delicately her eyes beamed with joy and the children told their mother afterwards that she looked as beautiful as the pictures of the Blessed Virgin 
5731_50778_000014_000002	train-clean-360	There was great bustle behind a huge screen in another part of the room and at half past five this was taken away and the Christmas dinner table stood revealed 
5731_50778_000014_000003	train-clean-360	What a wonderful sight it was to the poor little Ruggles children who ate their sometimes scanty meals on the kitchen table 
5731_50778_000014_000004	train-clean-360	It blazed with tall colored candles it gleamed with glass and silver it blushed with flowers it groaned with good things to eat so it was not strange that the Ruggleses forgetting that their mother was a McGrill shrieked in admiration of the fairy spectacle 
none	none	But Larry s behavior was the most disgraceful for he stood not upon the order of his going but went at once for a high chair that pointed unmistakably to him climbed up like a squirrel gave a comprehensive look at the turkey clapped his hands in ecstacy rested his fat arms on the table and cried with joy I beat the hull lot o yer Carol laughed until she cried giving orders meanwhile Uncle Jack please sit at the head Sarah Maud at the foot and that will leave four on each side Mama is going to help Elfrida so that the children need not look after each other but just have a good time A sprig of holly lay by each plate and nothing would do but each little Ruggles must leave his seat and have it pinned on by Carol and as each course was served one of them pleaded to take something to her There was hurrying to and fro I can assure you for it is quite a difficult matter to serve a Christmas dinner on the third floor of a great city house but if every dish had had to be carried up a rope ladder the servants would gladly have done so 
5731_50778_000015_000001	train-clean-360	There was turkey and chicken with delicious gravy and stuffing and there were half a dozen vegetables with cranberry jelly and celery and pickles and as for the way these delicacies were served the Ruggleses never forgot it as long as they lived 
none	none	Peter nudged Kitty who sat next him and said Look will yer ev ry feller s got his own partic lar butter I suppose that s to show yer can eat that much n no more No it ain t neither for that pig of a Peory s just gittin another helpin Yes whispered Kitty an the napkins is marked with big red letters I wonder if that s so nobody ll nip em an oh Peter look at the pictures painted right on ter the dishes Did yer ever The plums is all took out o my cramb ry sarse an it s friz to a stiff jell shouted Peoria in wild excitement Hi yah I got a wish bone sung Larry regardless of Sarah Maud s frown after which she asked to have his seat changed giving as excuse that he general ally set beside her an would feel strange the true reason being that she desired to kick him gently under the table whenever he passed what might be termed the McGrill line
5731_50778_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I declare to goodness murmured Susan on the other side there s so much to look at I can t scarcely eat nothin 
none	none	Bet yer life I can said Peter who had kept one servant busily employed ever since he sat down for luckily no one was asked by Uncle Jack whether he would have a second helping but the dishes were quietly passed under their noses and not a single Ruggles refused anything that was offered him even unto the seventh time 
5731_50778_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Then when Carol and Uncle Jack perceived that more turkey was a physical impossibility the meats were taken off and the dessert was brought in a dessert that would have frightened a strong man after such a dinner as had preceded it 
none	none	Not so the Ruggleses for a strong man is nothing to a small boy and they kindled to the dessert as if the turkey had been a dream and the six vegetables an optical delusion There was plum pudding mince pie and ice cream and there were nuts and raisins and oranges 
5731_50778_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Kitty chose ice cream explaining that she knew it by sight but hadn t never tasted none but all the rest took the entire variety without any regard to consequences 
5731_50778_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear child whispered Uncle Jack as he took Carol an orange there is no doubt about the necessity of this feast but I do advise you after this to have them twice a year or quarterly perhaps for the way they eat is positively dangerous I assure you I tremble for that terrible Peoria 
5731_50778_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I m going to run races with her after dinner 
none	none	Never mind laughed Carol let them eat for once it does my heart good to see them and they shall come oftener next year 
5731_50778_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The feast being over the Ruggleses lay back in their chairs languidly and the table was cleared in a trice then a door was opened into the next room and there in a corner facing Carol s bed which had been wheeled as close as possible stood the brilliantly lighted Christmas tree glittering with gilded walnuts and tiny silver balloons and wreathed with snowy chains of pop corn 
none	none	The presents had been bought mostly with Carol s story money and were selected after long consultations with missus Bird 
5731_50778_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Each girl had a blue knitted hood and each boy a red crocheted comforter all made by Mama Carol and Elfrida because if you buy everything it doesn t show so much love said Carol 
5731_50778_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Then every girl had a pretty plaid dress of a different color and every boy a warm coat of the right size 
5731_50778_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Here the useful presents stopped and they were quite enough but Carol had pleaded to give them something for fun 
5731_50778_000023_000005	train-clean-360	 I know they need the clothes she had said when they were talking over the matter just after Thanksgiving but they don t care much for them after all 
none	none	Now Papa won t you PLEASE let me go without part of my presents this year and give me the money they would cost to buy something to amuse them
5731_50778_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 You can have both said mister Bird promptly is there any need of my little girl s going without her Christmas I should like to know Spend all the money you like 
5731_50778_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But that isn t the thing objected Carol nestling close to her father it wouldn t be mine 
5731_50778_000025_000001	train-clean-360	What is the use 
5731_50778_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Haven t I almost everything already and am I not the happiest girl in the world this year with Uncle Jack and Donald at home 
none	none	Now Papa you know very well it is more blessed to give than to receive then why won t you let me do it 
5731_50778_000025_000004	train-clean-360	You never look half as happy when you are getting your presents as when you are giving us ours 
5731_50778_000025_000005	train-clean-360	Now Papa submit or I shall have to be very firm and disagreeable with you 
5731_50778_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well your Highness I surrender 
5731_50778_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a dear Papa 
5731_50778_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Now what were you going to give me 
5731_50778_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Confess 
5731_50778_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 A bronze figure of Santa Claus and in the little round belly that shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly is a wonderful clock 
5731_50778_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Oh you would never give it up if you could see it 
5731_50778_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense laughed Carol as I never have to get up to breakfast nor go to bed nor catch trains I think my old clock will do very well Now Mama what were you going to give me 
5731_50778_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I hadn t decided 
5731_50778_000030_000001	train-clean-360	A few more books and a gold thimble and a smelling bottle and a music box 
5731_50778_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor Carol laughed the child merrily she can afford to give up these lovely things for there will still be left Uncle Jack and Donald and Paul and Hugh and Uncle Rob and Aunt Elsie and a dozen other people 
none	none	So Carol had her way as she generally did but it was usually a good way which was fortunate under the circumstances and Sarah Maud had a set of Miss Alcott s books and Peter a modest silver watch Cornelius a tool chest Clement a dog house for his lame puppy Larry a magnificent Noah s ark and each of the little girls a beautiful doll You can well believe that everybody was very merry and very thankful All the family from mister Bird down to the cook said they had never seen so much happiness in the space of three hours but it had to end as all things do 
5731_50778_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The candles flickered and went out the tree was left alone with its gilded ornaments and missus Bird sent the children down stairs at half past eight thinking that Carol looked tired 
5731_50778_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Now my darling you have done quite enough for one day said missus Bird getting Carol into her little night dress I am afraid you will feel worse to morrow and that would be a sad ending to such a good time 
5731_50778_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh wasn t it a lovely lovely time sighed Carol 
5731_50778_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 From first to last everything was just right 
none	none	I shall never forget Larry s face when he looked at the turkey nor Peter s when he saw his watch nor that sweet sweet Kitty s smile when she kissed her dolly nor the tears in poor dull Sarah Maud s eyes when she thanked me for her books nor
5731_50778_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 But we mustn t talk any longer about it to night said missus Bird anxiously you are too tired dear 
5731_50778_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not so very tired Mama 
5731_50778_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I have felt well all day not a bit of pain anywhere 
5731_50778_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps this has done me good 
5731_50778_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I hope so 
5731_50778_000037_000001	train-clean-360	There was no noise or confusion it was just a merry time 
5731_50778_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Now may I close the door and leave you alone 
5731_50778_000037_000003	train-clean-360	I will steal in softly the first thing in the morning and see if you are all right but I think you need to be quiet 
5731_50778_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I m willing to stay alone but I am not sleepy yet and I am going to hear the music by and by you know 
5731_50778_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I have opened the window a little and put the screen in front of it so that you will not feel the air 
5731_50778_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Can I have the shutters open and won t you turn my bed a little please 
none	none	This morning I woke ever so early and one bright beautiful star shone in that eastern window 
5731_50778_000040_000002	train-clean-360	I never saw it before and I thought of the Star in the East that guided the wise men to the place where Jesus was 
5731_50778_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Good night Mama 
5731_50778_000040_000004	train-clean-360	Such a happy happy day 
5731_50778_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Good night my precious little Christmas Carol mother s blessed Christmas child 
5731_50778_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Bend your head a minute mother dear whispered Carol calling her mother back 
5731_50778_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Mama dear I do think that we have kept Christ s birthday this time just as He would like it 
none	none	Don t you
5731_50778_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure of it said missus Bird softly 
none	none	VII THE BIRDLING FLIES AWAY The Ruggleses had finished a last romp in the library with Paul and Hugh and Uncle Jack had taken them home and stayed a while to chat with missus Ruggles who opened the door for them her face all aglow with excitement and delight When Kitty and Clem showed her the oranges and nuts they had kept for her she astonished them by saying that at six o clock missus Bird had sent her in the finest dinner she had ever seen in her life and not only that but a piece of dress goods that must have cost a dollar a yard if it cost a cent As Uncle Jack went down the little porch he looked back into the window for a last glimpse of the family as the children gathered about their mother showing their beautiful presents again and again and then upward to a window in the great house yonder A little child shall lead them he thought well if if anything ever happens to Carol I will take the Ruggleses under my wing Softly Uncle Jack whispered the boys as he walked into the library a little while later We are listening to the music in the church They sang Carol brothers carol a while ago and now we think the organist is beginning to play My ain countree for Carol I hope she hears it said missus Bird but they are very late to night and I dare not speak to her lest she should be asleep It is after ten o clock The boy soprano clad in white surplice stood in the organ loft The lamps shone full upon his crown of fair hair and his pale face with its serious blue eyes looked paler than usual Perhaps it was something in the tender thrill of the voice or in the sweet words but there were tears in many eyes both in the church and in the great house next door I am far frae my hame I am weary aften whiles For the langed for hame bringin An my Faether s welcome smiles An I ll ne er be fu content Until my e en do see The gowden gates o heaven In my ain countree The earth is decked wi flow rs Mony tinted fresh an gay An the birdies warble blythely For my Faether made them sae But these sights an these soun s Will as naething be to me When I hear the angels singin In my ain countree Like a bairn to its mither A wee birdie to its nest I fain would be gangin noo Unto my Faether s breast For He gathers in His arms Helpless worthless lambs like me An carries them Himsel To His ain countree There were tears in many eyes but not in Carol s The loving heart had quietly ceased to beat and the wee birdie in the great house had flown to its home nest Carol had fallen asleep But as to the song I think perhaps I cannot say she heard it after all So sad an ending to a happy day Perhaps to those who were left and yet Carol s mother even in the freshness of her grief was glad that her darling had slipped away on the loveliest day of her life out of its glad content into everlasting peace She was glad that she had gone as she had come on wings of song when all the world was brimming over with joy glad of every grateful smile of every joyous burst of laughter of every loving thought and word and deed the dear last day had brought Sadness reigned it is true in the little house behind the garden and one day poor Sarah Maud with a courage born of despair threw on her hood and shawl walked straight to a certain house a mile away dashed up the marble steps and into good doctor Bartol s office falling at his feet as she cried Oh sir it was me an our childern that went to Miss Carol s last dinner party an if we made her worse we can t never be happy again Then the kind old gentleman took her rough hand in his and told her to dry her tears for neither she nor any of her flock had hastened Carol s flight indeed he said that had it not been for the strong hopes and wishes that filled her tired heart she could not have stayed long enough to keep that last merry Christmas with her dear ones And so the old years fraught with memories die one after another and the new years bright with hopes are born to take their places but Carol lives again in every chime of Christmas bells that peal glad tidings and in every Christmas anthem sung by childish voices End of Project Gutenberg s The Birds Christmas Carol by Kate Douglas Wiggin
