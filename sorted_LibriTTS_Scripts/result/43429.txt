you must put it in the end entoirely Such was the advice an Irish friend gave me when I talked of an introductory chapter to the present work on cats I think it was a good one Whether it be owing to our style of living now a days which tends more to the development of brain than muscle or whether it be as Darwin says that we really are descended from the ape and as the years roll on are losing that essentially animal virtue patience certainly it is true that we cannot tolerate prefaces preludes and long graces before meat as our grandfathers did A preface like Curacoa and B before dinner ought to be short and sweet something merely to give an edge to appetite or it had as well be put in the end entoirely or better still in the fire I presume then the reader is fond of the domestic cat if only for the simple reason that God made it Yes God made it and man mars it Pussy is an ill used much persecuted little understood and greatly slandered animal It is with the view therefore of gaining for our little fireside friend a greater meed of justice than she has hitherto obtained of removing the ban under which she mostly lives and making her life a more pleasant and happy one that the following pages are written and I shall deem it a blessing if I am in any way successful I have tried to paint pussy just as she is without the aid of putty and varnish and I have been at no small pains to prove the authenticity of the various anecdotes and can assure the reader that they are all strictly true CHAPTER II See Note B Addenda PUSSY ON HER NATIVE HEARTH It wouldn t have surprised me a bit doctor said my gallant captain to me on the quarter deck of the saucy Pen gun It wouldn t have surprised me a bit if they had sent you on board minus the head A nice thing that would have been with so many hands sick And rather unconvenient for me I added stroking my neck I had been explaining to the gentleman that my reason for not being off the night before was my finding myself on the desert side of the gates of Aden after sun down A strange motley cut throat band I had found myself among too Wild Somalis half caste Indian Jews Bedouin Arabs and burly Persian merchants all armed with sword and spear and shield and long rifles that judging by their build seemed made to shoot round corners Strings of camels lay on the ground and round each camp fire squatted these swarthy sons of the desert engaged in talking eating smoking or quarrelling as the case might be Unless at Falkirk tryst I had never been among such a parcel of rogues in my life I myself was armed to the teeth that is I had nothing but my tongue wherewith to defend myself I could not help a feeling of insecurity taking possession of me there seemed to be a screw that wanted tightening somewhere about my neck Yet I do not now repent having spent that night in the desert as it has afforded me the opportunity of settling that long disputed question the origin of the domestic cat Some have searched Egyptian annals for the origin of their pet some Persian and some assert they can trace its descent from the days of Noah I can go a long way beyond that It is difficult to get over the flood though but I suppose my typical cat belonged to some one of the McPherson clan McPhlail was telling McPherson that he could trace his genealogy from the days of Noah And mine said the rival clansman from nine hundred years before that But the flood you know hinted the McPhlail And did you ever hear of a Phairson that hadn t a boat of his own was the indignant retort In the midst of a group of young Arabs was one that attracted my special attention He was an old man who looked with his snow white beard his turban and robes as venerable as one of Dore s patriarchs In sonorous tones in his own noble language he was reading from a book in his lap while one arm was coiled lovingly round a beautiful long haired cat Beside this man I threw myself down The fierceness of his first glance which seemed to resent my intrusion melted into a smile as sweet as a woman s when I began to stroke and admire his cat Just the same story all the world over praise a man s pet and he ll do anything for you fight for you or even lend you money That Arab shared his supper with me Ah my son he said more than my goods more than my horse I love my cat She comforts me More than the smoke she soothes me Allah is great and good when our first mother and father went out into the mighty desert alone He gave them two friends to defend and comfort them the dog and the cat In the body of the cat He placed the spirit of a gentle woman in the dog the soul of a brave man It is true my son the book hath it After this I remained for some time speculatively silent The old man s story may be taken according to taste with or without a grain of salt but we must admit it is as good a way of accounting for domestic pussy s origin as any other There really is moreover a great deal of the woman s nature in the cat Like a woman pussy prefers a settled home to leading a roving life Like a true woman she is fond of fireside comforts Then she is so gentle in all her ways so kind so loving and so forgiving On your return from business the very look of her honest face as she sits purring on the hearth rug with the pleasant adjuncts of a bright fire and hissing tea urn tends to make you forget all the cares of the day When you are dull and lonely how often does her punky humour her mirth provoking attitudes and capers banish ennui And if you are ill how carefully she will watch by your bedside and keep you company How her low song will lull you her soft caresses soothe you giving you more real consolation from the looks of concern exhibited on her loving little face than any language could convey On the other hand like a woman she is prying and curious A locked cupboard is often a greater source of care and thought to pussy than the secret chamber was to the wife of Blue Beard I m sure it is only because she cannot read that she refrains from opening your letters of a morning and only because she cannot speak that she keeps a secret Like a woman too she dearly loves a gossip and will have it too even if it be by night on the tiles at the risk of keeping the neighbours awake Oh I m far from sure that the Arab isn t right after all Pussy from the very day she opens her wondering eyes and stares vacantly around her becomes an object worthy of study and observation Indeed kittens even before their eyes are opened will know your voice or hand and spit at a stranger s The first year of pussy s existence is certainly the happiest No creature in the world is so fond of fun and mischief as a kitten Everything that moves or is movable from its mother s tail to the table cloth must minister to its craze for a romp but what pen could describe its intense joy its pride and self satisfaction when for the first time it has caught a real live mouse This is as much an episode in the life of a kitten as her first ball is to a young lady just out Nor do well trained and properly fed cats ever lose this innate sense of fun and love of the ridiculous They lose their teeth first I have seen demure old cats of respectable matronly aspect cats that ought to have known better leave their kittens when only a day old and gambol round the room after a cork till tired and giddy Illustration BLACK and WHITE First Prize Owned by J BRADDEN esquire Illustration WILD CAT Half Bred First Prize Owned by A H SEAGER esquire Cats of the right sort never fail to bring their kittens up in the way they should go and soon succeed in teaching them all they know themselves They will bring in living mice for them and always take more pride in the best warrior kitten than in the others They will also inculcate the doctrine of cleanliness in their kits so that the carpet shall never be wet I have often been amused at seeing my own cat bringing kitten after kitten to the sand box and showing it how to use it in action explaining to them what it was there for When a little older she entices them out to the garden Cats can easily be taught to be polite and well mannered It depends upon yourself whether you allow your favourite to sit either on your shoulder or on the table at meal times or to wait demurely on the hearth till you have finished In any case her appetite should never get the better of her good manners We always teach our cats writes a lady to me to wait patiently while the family are at their meals after which they are served Although we never keep a dish for them standing in a corner as some people do yet we never had a cat thief Our Tom and Topsy used to sit on a chair beside my brother near the table with only their heads under the level of it They would peep up occasionally to see if the meal were nearly over but on being reminded that their time had not come they would immediately close their eyes and feign to be asleep Poor old Tom knew the time my brother came in from business and if five or ten minutes past his time he would go to the door and listen then come back to the fireside showing every symptom of impatience and anxiety He knew the footsteps of every member of the family and would start up before the human ear could detect a sound and hasten to the door to welcome the comer He knew the knock of people who were frequent visitors and would greet the knock of a stranger with an angry growl Tom would never eat a mouse until he had shown it to some member of the family and been requested to eat it and although brought up in a country village made himself perfectly at home in Glasgow although living on the third floor But poor faithful fellow after sticking to us through all the varied changes of fourteen years one wintry morning he had been out all night when I drew up the window to call him he answered me with such a plaintive voice that I at once hastened down to see what was the matter He was lying helpless and bleeding among the snow with one leg broken He died Cats will often attach themselves to some one member of a family in preference to all others They are as a rule more fond of children than grown up people and usually lavish more affection on a woman than a man They have particular tastes too as regards some portions of the house in which they reside often selecting some room or corner of a room which they make their sanctum sanctorum Talking of her cats a lady correspondent says Toby s successor was a black and white kitten we called Jenny Jenny was considered my father s cat as she followed him and no one else Our house and that of an aunt were near to each other and on Sabbath mornings it was my father s invariable custom to walk in the garden closely followed by Jenny afterwards going in to visit his sister before going to church Jenny enjoyed those visits amazingly every one was so fond of her and she was so much admired that she began to pay them visits of her own accord upon weekdays I am sorry to say that Jenny eventually abused the hospitality thus held out to her For as time wore on pussy had unknown to us been making her own private arrangements for an event of great interest which was to occur before very long And this is how it was discovered when it did come off Some ladies had been paying my aunt a visit and the conversation not unnaturally turned on dress Oh but said my aunt you must have a sight of my new velvet bonnet so handsome one pound fifteen shillings and came from London I do trust it won t rain on Sunday Eliza go for the box under the dressing table in the spare bedroom Although the door of this room was kept constantly shut the window was opened by day to admit the fresh air It admitted more it admitted Jenny and Jenny did not hesitate to avail herself of the convenience of having her kittens in that room Eliza had not been gone five minutes when she returned screaming Oh murther murther that is all she said She just ran back again screaming the same words and my aunt and friends hastened after her The sight that met their gaze was in no way alarming it was only Jenny cosily ensconced in the box the bonnet altered in shape to suit circumstances looking the picture of innocence and joy as she sung to six blind kittens Summary and condign was the punishment that fell on the unlucky Jenny The kittens were ordered to be instantly drowned we managed to save just one and pussy sentenced to be executed as soon as the gardener came in the morning This sentence was afterwards commuted to transportation for life from my aunt s house and it was remarkable that although Jenny took her Sabbath morning walks as usual with my father she never entered my aunt s dwelling but waited patiently until my father came out Jenny s master died Jenny seemed to miss my father greatly She used to go to the garden on a Sunday as usual but walked up and down disconsolate and sad and on her return would take up her old position outside my aunt s door and wait and wait always thinking he would surely come This constant waiting and watching for him that would come again no more was the first thing that softened my aunt s heart to poor Jenny and she was freely forgiven for the destruction of the velvet bonnet and took up her abode for life with my aunt on whom she bestowed all the affection she had previously lavished on my father Kittens like the young of most animals mankind included are sometimes rather selfish towards their parents A large kitten that I knew used to be regularly fed with mice which its mother caught and brought to it from a stack yard Instead of appearing grateful he used to seize the mouse and running growling to a corner devour the whole of it His mother must have thought this rather unfair for after standing it three or four times she brought in the mouse and slapped him if he dared to touch it until she had eaten her share the hind quarters then he had to be content with the rest I knew of a cat that in order to avoid the punishment which she thought she merited on committing an offence adopted the curious expedient of having two homes Her failing was fish If there had been no fish in the world she would have been a strictly honest cat She warred against the temptation but it was of no use the spirit was willing but the flesh weak and the smell of fish not to be resisted As long as she could steal without being found out it was all right things went on smoothly but whenever she was caught tripping she bade good bye for a time to that home and took up her quarters at the other distant about half a mile Here she would reside for a month or more as the case might be until the theft of another haddock or whiting caused her to return to the other house And so on this cat kept up the habit of fluctuating backwards and forwards between her two homes as long as she lived She was never thrashed and I think did not deserve to be It is a common thing for a she cat if her kittens are all drowned to take to suckling a former kitten even a grown up son has sometimes to resume the office and duties of baby to a bereaved mother and is in general no ways loath to do so There is a horrid cat in a village in Yorkshire who every time his mother has kittens steals them taking them one by one to the cellar and eating them When there are no more to eat filial piety constrains him to suckle his dam until she deems it fit that he should be weaned He has been weaned already four times to my knowledge If a kitten has been given away and for some reason or other returns again to its mother s home the first thing that mother does is to give him a sound hiding afterwards she receives him into favour and gives him her tail to play with by way of solatium Mothers will sometimes correct their very young kittens for instance if it squeals when she wants to get away for a short time two or three smart pats with a mittened paw generally make it go fast asleep The cat s love of fun is perhaps one of the most endearing traits in her character Who has not laughed to see the antics performed by some pet cat whom its mistress wished to bring into the house for the night Pussy has been walking with her mistress in the garden but the night is fair and moonlit and she hasn t the slightest intention of coming in for at least half an hour yet So round the walks she flies romping and rollicking with tail in the air and eyes crimson and green with the mischief that is in them always popping out when least expected and sometimes brushing the lady s very skirts Now she walks demurely up to her mistress as if soliciting capture and just as she is being picked up Ah you thought you had me did you and off she scampers to the other end of the garden Anon she is up a tree and grinning like an elf from the topmost branches and no amount of pet names blarney or coaxing will entice her down or into the house until as they say in the north her ain de il bids her Pussy s fondness for frolic has led to strange results sometimes as the following will testify In an old fashioned house in an old fashioned parish in the county of Aberdeenshire there lived not many years ago a farmer of the name of D His family consisted of his wife two marriageable daughters and a beautiful tabby cat This cat was well fed and cared for and being so was an excellent mouser Indeed it was averred by the farmer that no rat would live within a mile of her The house stood by itself some distance off the road but though surrounded by lofty pine trees it had by no means the appearance of a place which a ghost of average intellect and any claim to respectability would select as the scene of its midnight peregrinations Besides there was no story attached to the house No one had ever been murdered there so far as was known No old miser had ever resided within its walls and though several members of the family had died in the old box bed they had all passed away in the most legitimate manner Old granny was the only one at all likely to come back but what could she have forgotten The old lady was sensible to the last and behaved like a brick She told them candidly she was wearin awa sat up in bed and in a sadly quavering voice sang the Old Hundred then handed over the key of the tea caddy where she kept her trifle siller with the remark that they would find among the rest two old pennies which she had kept especially to be placed in her eyes when her candle went out In spite of this however the honest farmer and his family were all awakened one night by hearing the parlour bell rung and rung too with great force They couldn t all have been dreaming Besides while they were yet doubting and deliberating lo the bell rung a second time John and his wife shook in their shoes That is merely a figure of speech for properly speaking they hadn t even their stockings on The marriageable daughters would have fainted but they had only read of fainting in books and had no idea how it was done It must be allowed matters were alarming enough Who or what dreadful thing was thus urgently demanding an interview at that untimely hour of night in that lone house among the pine trees The bell rang a third time and urged by the entreaties of his wife to be brave for once and go she did not say come and see John at last reached down his old brown Bess it had been loaded for five years and with a candle in his other hand his wife holding on by the skirts of his night dress and the marriageable daughters bringing up the rear prepared to march upon the parlour In Indian file and all in white they might have been mistaken for a party of priests going to celebrate midnight mass No ghost could have withstood the sight of that procession It must have burst out laughing unless indeed a very grave ghost When at last they reached the parlour neither sight nor sound rewarded them for their heroism Everything was in its usual place and nothing was disturbed A search all over the house proved too that the doors were all locked the windows fastened and no one either up the chimney or under the beds So the mystery was put down to super human agency or as the good wife termed it something no canny and they all went trembling back to bed and lay awake in great fear till the cock crew For nearly a fortnight after this almost every night and sometimes even by day the same strange disturbances occurred and all efforts to solve the mystery were fruitless So it got rumoured abroad that the house was haunted All the usual remedies were had recourse to for the purpose of exorcism but in vain The parson came twice to pray in the room He might as well have stopped at home Equally unsuccessful were the services of an old lady whom her enemies called a witch her friends the wisest woman in the parish Things began to look serious The goodwife was getting thin her daughters hysterical and John himself began to lose caste among the neighbours It was openly hinted that some deed of blood must have been committed by him in that same house and room Nor could his thirty years of married life and unblemished reputation save him He had been too quiet people said and too regular in his attendance at church besides he had a down look about him and on the whole hanging was too good for him Some averred that strange sights and sounds were seen and heard by people who had occasion to pass that house at night among other things a light gliding about in the copse wood No they would not believe it was only John locking up the stable and the devil himself in the shape of a fox was seen at early morning coming directly from the house Of course the devil had a fine fat hen over his shoulders but that had nothing to do with the matter Poor John it had come to this that he had serious thoughts of giving up his farm and going to America when a rollicking young student in the neighbourhood who did not believe in spirits except ardent proposed to the farmer that they should wake the ghost Wake the ghost said the farmer ye little ken lad He s wide enough awake already Wake him repeated the student sit up at night you know and wait till he comes John turned pale I ll sit with you continued the young man If he s a civil ghost we can hear what he has got to say for The darkest nicht I fear nae deil Warlock nor witch in Gowrie Very reluctantly John consented but he did consent and that night the two met in the haunted chamber alone just before the old clock on the stair told the hour of midnight What have you got under your arm inquired the student The ha Bible replied John in a sepulchral voice is that a Bible you ve brought No it s whisky said the student about the only spirit you are likely to see to night and there won t be the ghost of that left by cock crow So they waited and watched John reading the student smoking steadily and drinking periodically One o clock came and two o clock and the candle was burning low in the socket when suddenly Hist said the student and Hush said John They could distinctly hear footsteps about them in the room but no one visible They were really frightened now Then something rushed past them and the bell rang and there lo and behold from the rope dangled John s decent tabby cat And the Lord s name be praised said John piously closing the book Such ghosts as these said the student are best exorcised with a broom handle but see this explains He held up the rope to the end of which country fashion was attached a hare s foot CHAPTER III See Note C Addenda PUSSY S LOVE OF CHILDREN The cat is more than any other creature the pet of our early years Almost the first animal we notice when we are old enough to notice anything is pussy with her beautiful markings her well pleased homely face sleek and shining fur and soft paws which she never ungloves in the presence of childhood Children and cats especially young ones have so very much in common Both are innocent sinless and easily pleased and both are full of fun and frolic Children will often play with a kitten until they kill the poor thing In the country pussy s place may easily be supplied by some other toy but to a poor little gutter child the loss is simply irreparable and she will nurse her dead kitten in the mud for a week The way children use poor patient pussy is at times anything but commendable and while deprecating the conduct of parents in allowing them to treat the cat so we cannot but admire pussy s extreme forbearance and uncomplaining good nature under what must be considered very trying circumstances It is nothing to see Miss Puss or Master Tom dressed up in a shawl and neatly fitting cap and lugged about as a doll carried by the tail over the child s shoulder or worn as a comforter round his neck Yet pussy seems to know that there is no harm meant and that the children really love her dearly so she never attempts to scratch far less to bite All experience goes to prove too that it is generally the child that uses her the worst to whom pussy is most attached The dead playmate is a picture you will often see in real life I saw one not a month ago A pretty little child with round wondering eyes swollen with recent tears sitting in the corner of a field in the summer sunshine On her lap lay among a handful of daisies and corn poppies a wee dead kitten life had but lately left it When I spoke to her her grief burst out afresh O sir my pussy s deaded my pretty pussy s deaded There would be no more games of romps in the garden no more scampering together through the green fields after the butterfly no more making pussy a doll She would go lonely to bed to night and cry herself asleep for pretty pussy was deaded In the adjacent street to where I now live is a fine large red tabby Tom He is a famous mouser a noted hunter and a gentleman every inch He was faithful in love and dauntless in war When I tried to stroke him he gave me a look and a growl of such unmistakable meaning that I mechanically put my hands in my pockets and whistled He makes no friends with strangers Yet Tom has a little mistress not much over three years old whom he dearly loves and from whom he is seldom absent He lies down on his side and allows little Alice to lift him although she can hardly totter along with her burden which she carries as often by the tail as any way else She sleeps beside him on the hearth rug Tom winding his arms lovingly around her neck and little Alice declares that pussy carries his kisses on his nose Wee Elsie S though only six years old has completely tamed as far as she herself is concerned what might almost be called a wild cat it having been bred and brought up in the woods This cat has only two good qualities namely his great skill in vermin killing and his fondness for little Elsie Neither the child s father mother nor the servants dare put a finger on this wild brindled Tom but as soon as Elsie comes down in the morning and puss is let in with a fond cry he rushes towards her singing and caressing her with evident satisfaction He then does duty as a doll all day or follows the child wherever she goes and sleeps with her when she sleeps In our nursery writes a lady correspondent there was always a cat which was the favourite companion of the children submitting to many indignities which a dog would scarcely have endured with so much patience One handsome tabby cat named by us children Roland the Brave used to hold his place in front of the nursery fire with the utmost patience and good humour in spite of kettles boiling over on him nursery maids treading on his paws and tail and children teasing him in every possible way The tom cat which I have at present says another keeps my children company in their walks and is indeed more careful of them than the maid who sometimes has forgotten her duty so far as to leave the perambulator to look after itself while she is talking and laughing with a tall man in red But Tom is not so thoughtless and sticks close by the children showing signs of anger when any one approaches He seems moreover imbued with the idea that the every day food of that domestic quadruped the dog is babies and if any one is foolish enough to come snuffing round the perambulator Tom mounts him at once and proceeds forthwith to sharpen his claws in his hide On one occasion when my family were absent for a few days Tom was so disconsolate that he refused to take his food To show his love for the children I made the remark to Tom in presence of some friends that baby was in the cradle the cat jumped up and went directly towards it and examined it then returned mewing most mournfully because of the disappointment Pussy s love for babies is always very noticeable In fact with very little training she may be taught if not to nurse at least to mind the baby I know a cat which as soon as the child is placed in its little cot lays itself gently down at its back and this is not for sake of warmth and comfort as some may allege but from pure love of baby For pussy lies perfectly still as long as the child sleeps but whenever she awakes even before she cries the cat jumps down and runs to tell her mistress runs back to the cradle and with her forefeet on the edge looks alternately at baby and its mother mewing entreatingly until the child is lifted Contented now it throws itself at the mother s feet and goes quietly off to sleep Another cat I know of that goes regularly to the harvest field with its mistress and a young child The cat remains with the child all day guarding him and amusing him by playing at hide and seek with him until evening when the mother who has only visited her child two or three times during the day returns generally to find baby and puss asleep in each other s arms Cats too not only mourn the absence of their little master or mistress but will try to follow them if they can A certain party of my acquaintance says a lady had a large cat called Tabby who was a great favourite with all the family Tabby seemed to reciprocate the attachment of the different members but its fondness for the youngest daughter was something wonderful It would follow her about wherever she went and if she ever left home for a short time poor pussy seemed quite wretched until her return At one time the child went to reside for two months with some friends many miles distant You may fancy her surprise and delight when one morning after she had been about a week in her new residence in marches her dear friend and companion Mistress Tabby and nothing could induce her to leave again Pussy took up her abode with the girl stuck by her all the time and at the end of the visit faithfully accompanied her back to their home A woman whom I know has a tom cat which watches constantly by the baby s cradle when its mistress is absent One day when hanging up some clothes in the garden she became suddenly aware of an awful row going on in the room she had just left She entered just in time to see Tom riding a large shepherd s collie round the room and back again and finally out at the door Tom was a most cruel jockey sparing neither bit e nor spur as the howls of the unhappy collie fully testified That dog hasn t been seen in the immediate vicinity since The cat mentioned in the following anecdote was surely worthy of the Humane Society s bronze medallion as much as any Newfoundland ever was A certain lady s little son was ill of scarlet fever The period of inflammation and danger was just over but the poor child was unable to sit or stand Through all his illness he had been carefully watched by a faithful tom cat who seldom ever left his bedside by night or by day for Tom dearly loved the little fellow who though now so still and quiet used to lark and roll with him on the parlour floor But since his little master s illness Tom had never been known to make the slightest attempt at fun One day the child was taken by its mother from bed and laid on the cool sofa by way of change and when he had fallen asleep she gently left the room Tom being on guard as usual She had not been gone many minutes and was engaged in some household duties when Tom entered squirrel tailed and mewing most piteously looking up into her face and then running to the door plainly entreating his mistress to hurry along with him It was well she did so Poor Tom ran before her to the room in which she had left her boy when she found that in attempting to get up the child had fallen on the floor along with the rugs in such a position that death from suffocation would have inevitably followed but for the timely aid summoned by this noble tom cat I think I have said enough to prove how fond pussy is of children and how forbearing towards them and surely this trait in her character should endear her to us all But I do thoroughly deprecate pussy s being made a plaything of whether she be cat or kitten It is exceedingly cruel of parents to allow it and is taking an unfair advantage of the cat s good nature and sense The way she is lugged about and tormented by some children is very prejudicial to her health and appearance It often does her grievous bodily harm injures her heart and lungs and stops her growth even if it does not induce paralysis and consequent death Let your children love pussy pussy loves your children only kindly point out to them the essential difference between a play thing and a play mate CHAPTER IV See Note D Addenda PUSSY POLL The following sketch of cat life is contributed by one who loves all things both great and small We give it in extenso Even supposing it to be endowed with the nine lives ascribed to the race was it at all probable that

none	none	be successful in rearing to mature cathood that dripping little wretch Such was the question which not without doubt I asked myself while attempting to dry a kitten some two weeks old which I had just saved from death in a neighbouring horsepond Arrived at home I put in practice as many of the Royal Humane Society s rules for the treatment of the apparently drowned as I found applicable to the case in hand and soon had the satisfaction of seeing my charge comfortably sleeping in a bed prepared in an old cap by the fireside Not less successful were my efforts at nursing and in a few weeks Poll for so I named my pet had grown to be the daintiest thing possible the very impersonation of mischief and fun without thought or care from morn till night except that of Turning to mirth all things of earth As only kittens can Time passed on however and with years or rather months came troubles one of the first causes of which to puss was a mirror To her it was a mystery which cost many hours of deep thought and serious study but never could she understand why the cat which was always visible in front could neither be seen felt nor heard behind the glass Numerous experiments were made to solve the puzzle but the most common one was for Poll to seat herself in front of the mirror and critically examine her vis a vis The thing seeming so real she next would give the glass a pat with her paw and run round to the back but nothing being found there one paw was then put in front and the other kept behind She would then peep round into the glass and still seeing puss there would renew her efforts to catch her This was repeated almost daily for some time but at last puss seemed to have resolved that the mystery should remain one no longer so struck at her opponent with full force and of course seemed to receive a blow in return In an instant Poll sprang to her feet and assumed a position of defiance but her foe nothing loath for the fray was equally ready A moment s pause and puss hurled herself on her foe There was a crash A cat rushed wildly out of the door and I proceeded to gather fragments of a mirror from off the floor At meal times puss regularly seated herself on my shoulder and waited patiently for what she considered her due proportion but if I seemed to neglect her she gently reminded me of her presence by patting my cheek with her paw If that was not sufficient the paw was pressed on my cheek the claws slowly protruded and my face drawn round towards her Success invariably attended this manoeuvre and after receiving her share she thanked me by rubbing her head against my cheek and licking my face In due course a young family of kittens appeared but of course they all save one met the fate from which I had saved their mother With the family came family cares Soon the kitten was old enough to begin to receive its education and then mice at any time varied occasionally with a rat or two were to be found lying about the floor As the kitten got older and was able to be left for longer periods alone Poll extended her hunting excursions one morning she brought home four or five young partridges and the following day one of the parent birds The next great hunt produced as many young rabbits and although to such games I had no great objection to offer yet when frogs toads or lizards were the produce of a day s sport as was sometimes the case I did protest On one occasion while the kitten was playing out of doors it was pursued by a dog belonging to a neighbour but escaped through a hole in a wall close by Poll who at some distance had seen the whole affair at once darted to her kitten s side and did her best to quiet its fears telling it doubtless that she would take an early opportunity of teaching that dog better manners The opportunity was not long wanting Next day the dog again passing was noticed by puss who ran and hid behind a corner near which he would come and there waited his approach Just as he turned she sprung on his head and with teeth and claws took hold so firm that he in vain endeavoured to shake her off Going to his assistance I with considerable difficulty disengaged puss but not before his head was badly torn But although thus ready to do battle when occasion required puss knew also how to evade a foe when so inclined Always treating the game laws with that respect of which they are worthy puss was of course never disturbed in her rambles by gamekeepers and so twas quite an accident when being in the middle of a field she was chased by a dog belonging to one Possibly on that particular morning she may have remembered that discretion is the better part of valour and so when she saw the dog coming she made for the cliffs by which on one side the field was bounded But the dog was swift and ere half the distance was passed he was upon her Just however as he was about to seize her she sprang on one side and stopped the dog rushing forward some half dozen yards While he was stopping and turning she darted past and thus continued to elude him till the cliffs were reached While Poll and I were taking a walk one evening a curious incident occurred A rook flying overhead seemed struck with some peculiarity about puss for suddenly checking himself in his flight he circled once or twice round us both and apparently satisfied with the survey darted away to the opposite side of the field where a large flock of rooks were feeding He took not time to alight but gave several peculiar caws in a tone which seemed to me expressive of great excitement What his communication was I know not but it seemed perfectly intelligible to the other rooks which instantly took wing and following him as their leader bore down on puss who by this time had mounted on the top of a fence and was quietly taking a survey of the surrounding scenery At first I expected to see them attempt to carry her off bodily but if such was their intention none of them had sufficient courage to begin the attack Sometimes indeed one bolder than the rest would make a near approach but as on these occasions puss endeavoured to make a capture they preferred keeping at a safe distance For fully five minutes they thus continued to circle around filling the air with a perfect Babel of sound and then as suddenly departed as they had come This was almost the last adventure of note which we two had together Shortly after having to remove to a distant part of the country where I could not take my darling with me it became necessary either to leave her with some acquaintance or destroy her With increasing years her temper never good towards strangers did not improve and being afraid that if I left her behind me she might be subjected to bad treatment I determined to adopt the course which seemed the lesser of two evils On the day of my departure we paid a last visit to the ocean A splash a plunge and all was o er The billows rolled on as they rolled before and puss my most pleasant companion and faithful friend had met the fate from which I saved her so many years before Sic est vita CHAPTER V See Note E Addenda SAGACITY OF CATS Few people now a days think of denying that man s noble friend the dog possesses a large amount of what can only be termed reason I myself believe that almost every animal does but in these pages I shall only claim the gift for our mutual friend the domestic cat Reason I consider is quite different from mere instinct Instinct is born in an animal reason is that instinct matured by experience I hardly think that you can find a more sagacious animal than the cat I doubt indeed if the dog is for pussy s peculiar mode of existence the many enemies she has to encounter and the struggle she often has to obtain sustenance sufficient to keep life in her poor little body bring all her faculties into better play and tend to the development of her reasoning powers Before you can fully fathom what a wonderfully clever and wise creature even the commonest cat is you must study her life in every phase both out of doors and at the fireside No relation of mere sporadic acts of sagacity such as unfastening a door to get out breaking a window to get in or pulling a bell rope to call the servant can do justice to pussy s wisdom Everything she does has a reason for it and all her plans are properly schemed and thought out beforehand for she never fails to look before she leaps Why my reader with all due respect to your intellectual powers if you were to be changed into a cat for four and twenty hours and had a cat s routine of pleasure and duty to perform with all your wisdom you would be as dead as a dried haddock before sun down Let us try to imagine one day in a cat s life Pussy wakes in the morning as fresh as a daisy for she has slept the sleep of the just and temperate She finds she has been shut into the parlour but though it is broad day light the family won t be stirring yet for another hour A long weary hour for puss although she has the patience of Job Now she thinks if a mouse would only pop out from under the fender sometimes one does But watching won t bring it so she jumps upon the window sill and gets behind the blind to gaze out at the bright morning and watch the sparrows and think of all she will do to day At any rate she muses I shan t be shut in here another night So silly of me to go to sleep before the fire And happy thought I ll go and see yes I must go and see him to night he ll be at the old thorn tree I know dear dear Tom The hour has worn away and at last Mary comes to do out the room N B Stand by to bolt through between her ugly legs Done successful Now upstairs to mew hungrily at her mistress s door that ensures a cuddle and so pussy sings while her mistress dresses Down to breakfast at last Soles Oh she doats on soles But why does her mistress get up and leave her alone for a minute with the cream and the soles and she so hungry too What a chance to dip one paw in the cream jug or help herself to only just the tail of that inviting sole But no she won t and she doesn t though the temptation was very great Then mistress returns and pussy is rewarded for her honesty with a delicious breakfast and duly purrs her grace after meat Two hours afterward she is in her mistress s boudoir alone Oh saint Anthony Alone with the canary Her eyes are drawn magnetically to the cage her mouth opens of its own accord her teeth water and unconsciously she fires off a series of miniature mews expressive of extreme desire One little spring and that beautiful bird would be hers But again she won t she ll only just look at it and if a cat may look at a king surely she may at a canary Reader have you ever eaten a canary A live canary feathers and all No then I fear there is but little chance of your giving pussy half the credit due to her for resisting that sore temptation and letting birdie live But rats and rabbits what has pussy done now While canary gazing she has been standing on the escritoire and inadvertently spilled all her mistress s purple ink and to make matters worse that young lady enters in time to witness the accident and see puss making a face at the canary Oh you wicked wicked ungrateful cat Pussy flies and hides beneath the sofa Those cruel unjust words how they rankle in her breast She will never never speak to her mistress again nor to any one in the world not even to Tom She will die beneath that sofa So in doleful dumps she spends two whole hours How very irksome If her mistress would only speak now she might come out perhaps but she only knits knits Suddenly down rolls the ball of worsted Hurrah out pops puss like an animated arrow and darts round and round the room after it like a mad thing Her mistress smiles and pussy is up on her lap in an instant singing for joy because she is restored to favour Somehow pussy in the afternoon accidentally finds herself in Farmer Hodge s pigeon loft She has merely come to have a look at the pretty creatures being fond of that sort of thing Hark though a footstep on the ladder and enter Farmer Hodge himself Poor pussy s intentions in the pigeon loft have been vilely misconstrued by that rude man and she herself kicked right out of the gable door a fall of twenty feet at least however she has the presence of mind to whirl round and alights on her feet and thus saves her neck It is only a quarter of a mile to run home so she is off hotly pursued by the farmer and his horrid collie There is one tree on the way and she gains it just in time to save her back and the ugly dog stops and barks up at her A long way astern comes puffing and blowing the farmer himself and when he arrives he will stone her One minute to get her breath then down flop on the back of the collie jumps pussy Round and round the tree she rides him twice then dismisses him howling The dog runs back to his master with a bloody nose and one eye seriously damaged while pussy scot free regains the shelter of her home just in time for dinner Now my little lady says pussy s mistress about bed time I see you are watching to get out and indeed you mustn t so come with me A little deceit is absolutely necessary now if pussy wants to gain her ends After all it is only policy so pussy purring complacently accompanies her mistress to her bed room But having duly sung the young lady asleep she quietly steals from her side and creeps to the window Luckily it is open Fifteen feet is a tallish jump though but she remembers that when Farmer Hodge gave her a hint to leave the pigeon loft she leaped twenty feet She feels that hint on her rump even now but here goes She has done it and is safe Then what a delicious sense of freedom and prospective bliss And hark yonder is Tom s melodious voice in the distance and pussy is off in the moonlight to meet him and she won t go home till morning Cats are very sensitive to kindness and are never ungrateful for benefits received A certain labouring woman got a cat to which she became greatly attached When the time came round for her absence for six weeks at harvest in a distant part of the country she took her cat and the one kitten it was giving suck to and gave it in charge of a brother who lived three miles from her own village But here poor pussy wasn t happy The children beat and otherwise annoyed her so she returned to her own home in the village leaving the kitten behind her Finding the house shut up she sought shelter in a kindly neighbour s house and having established herself in her new home she set out for the house where she had left the kitten She did not attempt to remove it however but simply gave it suck and left again Twice a day regularly for three weeks did this queer pussy trot those six long miles to suckle her kitten until one day she found it drinking milk from a saucer After this she never went back On her mistress s return from harvest pussy again became her faithful companion clearly showing that although she was grateful to the neighbour she knew she did not belong to her But every year pussy stayed all the harvest with her benefactress until the return of her mistress and this habit she kept up all her life fourteen years How do cats know certain days of the week such as Saturday or Monday A shopkeeper whom I knew had a nice Tom tabby which he kept night and day in his shop to protect his wares from mice and rats On Saturdays Tom was allowed to accompany his master home a distance of nearly a mile and to remain at home until the following Monday Pussy got used to this and as the shop was always kept open until ten o clock on Saturdays Tom used regularly to leave the place and go home fully three hours before his master On the Monday morning he was always quite ready to accompany him back again When this cat grew a few years older he began to tire of night duties He no doubt thought he had done enough when he had been on guard all day So to get off the night shift he used to leave the shop when his master made signs of putting up the shutters He would wait at a convenient distance till his master came but finding that he was invariably captured and carried back he fell upon another plan he took to leaving the shop an hour before closing time His master used to meet him half ways home but never could put a finger on him This same cat had been rescued from an ugly death when quite a kitten by a son of his master Tom was greatly attached to this boy When the boy grew to be a man and only visited the house once a year Tom still knew him and manifested great delight in seeing him Cats however do not show the joy they feel on meeting again with a long lost friend in so exuberant a manner as the dog On first seeing you they exhibit surprise then quietly show how glad they are by rubbing round you singing and following wherever you go as if afraid of being again separated A dog is a more excitable animal and more demonstrative in every way than the thoughtful pussy Every one knows how cats can open doors by jumping up and pressing down the latch this trick is more common in tortoise shell cats than in any others and often descends from generation to generation A lady s favourite cat the other day saved the life of her pet canary The door of the bird s cage having been by some accident left open Dickie flew out and at once made for the outside door which happened to be open The cat however immediately gave chase and captured the bird in the lobby Tom at once returned and placed the poor bird half dead with fright at his mistress s feet I know of a cat not at all a moral specimen that took a fancy to eat one of her master s rabbits Knowing that she could not well do this within sight of the dwelling house she managed to chase one or rather walk one for she was too wise to hurry it nearly a quarter of a mile from the house She was just beginning her feast when discovered A cat that dwelt in an outhouse was seen one day to deliberately take a portion of her dinner and place it in front of a mouse hole in a corner She then retired to a distance and set herself to watch Not many minutes after a fine plump mouse came out gave one look round and seeing nothing suspicious commenced to eat the crumbs while doing so pussy sprang upon and captured it easily It is a common custom in the north of Scotland and I suppose is so in other places for the household cat regularly to attend at the milking of the cows and to receive her allowance squirted directly from the cow s pap No matter to what distance it is sent pussy will adroitly stem the current with open mouth and eyes closed with delight A friend of mine once saw a cat attempting to suck a quiet good natured cow She failed however but walked directly up to where the gentleman was standing and mewing in his face ran back and sat down below the udder plainly requesting the favour of his assistance He good naturedly complied and every day for weeks afterwards the cat used to come for him to perform the same kind office There is an old old man lives in K who has an old old cat He is over one hundred years and the cat is gone nineteen in that long time they have come to know each other pretty well One evening some years ago pussy was sitting in a particularly studious attitude before the fire as if it had something important to tell and didn t know how to begin The old man was looking at her thoughtfully That cat he said presently has something on her mind haven t you puss Pussy to his grandchild s no small astonishment at once mewed in reply and jumping up patted the old man s leg and commenced trotting to the foot of the stair looking over her shoulder and asking him to follow Go you Lizzie said the old man and Lizzie went following the cat up the stairs and into an old lumber garret There the cause of pussy s anxiety was soon discovered a litter of five fine kittens which pussy had had without the knowledge of any one in the house Cats are as fond of bird nesting as any school boy A cat last summer found a starling s nest in the gable end of an old barn There were five eggs in it at the time but these pussy did not touch she preferred waiting until they were hatched She was seen to go sometimes as often as three times a day and have a peep into the nest When at length she was rewarded for her patience with the sight of goslings she coolly put in her paw drew out the little things one by one and devoured them before their distracted parents eyes I did not feel at all sorry for that bereaved mother starling for she and her impudent husband had rummaged every sparrow s nest about the place and eaten the eggs Illustration TORTOISESHELL and WHITE First Prize Owned by J HURRY esquire Illustration TABBY and WHITE First Prize Owned by J GAMBLE esquire A man of the name of Claughie shepherd to a nobleman in the West of Ireland had an enormously large Tom cat who as far as milk was concerned was a notorious thief the result no doubt of a deficient education in his youth However Tom was in the habit of committing depredations in the milk house almost every night Being always forgiven by the shepherd s wife he became at last quite a nuisance and the shepherd determined to give him one sound hiding He caught Tom in the very act of stealing cream and he warmed him accordingly Tom went out in high dudgeon and no more was thought of it But that night Tom returned and with him a number of other cats Having surrounded the hut they proceeded in true Fenian style to break the windows and force an entrance The shepherd afraid of his life fled to a loft drawing up the ladder after him His wife however showed more courage She at once produced two large pansful of cream and invited the intruders to drink They did not require a second bidding and having regaled themselves they departed in peace and came no more But cats will often leave a house and never return if they have been threatened with a severe licking A man residing in Ireland had a nice cat which was fully eleven years of age and which he had reared from kittenhood One day this cat received correction for some offence and that same night it disappeared It not only disappeared itself but enticed a neighbour s cat along with it Neither of them ever returned The two cats had always lived on terms of great intimacy with each other Another cat had succumbed to temptation and stolen some fish she was so afraid of getting whipped for the theft that she did not enter the house for two whole days At the end of that time she was coming quietly in when the goodwife half in fun seized hold of the poker and shaking it at the poor delinquent Go out you thieving hussy she cried and never darken my door again The cat drew back and slipped away and was never seen more in that neighbourhood Of the eggs of fowls some cats are exceedingly fond and if they once acquire a taste for this particular luxury nothing can ever break them from it and they will always find ways and means of indulging in the propensity A cat of my acquaintance used to content herself with two or at most three a day She belonged to a grocer and was quite honest with regard to everything else It was the shopkeeper himself who was to blame for this fault in poor pussy for in unpacking his eggs he would occasionally drop one then call pussy s attention to the fact saying Here pussy you take that So in process of time the cat took rather a penchant for eggs She would jump on the counter whenever the whim struck her and take an egg from the basket then with a face beaming with mischief she would proceed to make a mouse of it paw pawing it until it rolled over on to the floor as if by the merest accident in the world Then it was amusing to see the air of astonishment pussy adopted as she peered wonderingly over the edge of the counter as much as to say Hullo broken Here pussy you take that And down she would jump and lick it up CHAPTER VI See Note F Addenda A CAT THAT KEEPS THE SABBATH Yes far seeing reader you are right it is a Scotch cat In England a deficient educational scheme is dead against the chance of any such anomaly In some parts of bonnie Scotland you daurna whistle on the Sabbath the dogs daurna bark the cows daurna low and the cock is confined beneath a barrel to prevent him giving expression to his independence England is looked upon as a poor benighted country living in darkness and ignorance and a tourist is termed a poor daft Englisher or a gangrel body But now for the cat This pussy completes a family circle who dwell in a remote village of Forfarshire It is the only live stock they possess is an old old fashioned cat and of course a great pet It has a daily round of duties from which it never varies any more than the clock does It sleeps with the children and gets up at the same hour every morning It first strolls round all the rooms watching for a little every mouse hole where it has ever killed a mouse It then goes to its mistress s bedroom wakes her and sees her dressed trots before her to the door and is let out coming in at the same hour every day for breakfast and showing signs of indignation if its porridge and milk are not ready waiting or if they are too hot which it ascertains by a preliminary touch with its toe Breakfast over comes a long hour s sleep before the parlour fire in winter or in the sun in summer time Then comes the time for the forenoon constitutional a mere walk for pastime true if a sparrow pops down before its nose it is nimbly caught and eaten but at this early hour pussy prefers lighter amusements catching butterflies turtle turning frogs climbing trees or dancing ghillie callum on the back of the shepherd s unhappy collie dog She is always at home a quarter of an hour before her master with whom she dines Reinvigorated by the mid day meal pussy now starts on a hunting expedition the scene of action being a wood about a quarter of a mile from her residence Here this cat stays bird catching among the trees until the sun sets and there isn t a bird to be seen and then comes trotting home A drink of sweet milk forms a light but nutritious supper and not a bad narcotic then this methodical puss curls herself up at the bairnies feet and sings herself and them to sleep Such is pussy s week day work never varying day by day and year by year But on Sunday she does no work and neither fights nor hunts but keeps the house dumb and demure like the pious little puss she is musing with half shut eyes over the fire or basking in the sunshine on the garden walk What an example to the wild strath vagrant Sabbath breaking cats of other places Early to bed and early to rise who can doubt this pussy s wisdom Who can doubt that in her rural home She ll crown in shades like these A youth of labour with an age of ease CHAPTER VII See Note G Addenda HONEST CATS Numerous instances of the honesty of well trained cats might be given My own cat and travelling companion Muffie has always taken her place on the table at meals and I have never had reason to repent of the indulgence Even should I leave the room for half an hour nothing could tempt her to lay a paw upon anything neither will she allow any one else not even the waiter to touch the viands without my permission If I go to sleep on the sofa she immediately mounts guard over me and it would be very incautious in any one to come within reach of her nails All sorts of property she guards just the same and of my starling she is particularly careful A gentleman of my acquaintance used to have a cat which brought home wild rabbits almost daily but he knew his master s tame ones and many a romp and rough and tumble they had together on the lawn Tom s master had a mavis This bird did not live in a cage but roamed about the house at its own sweet will yet pussy never made any attempt to injure it in fact seemed to like it What was most singular the cat was in the constant habit of bringing in live birds sparrows larks and sometimes even a mavis which she quietly devoured beside Dickie he standing on the floor in front of her looking on and whistling to himself Birds being the natural prey of the cat the foregoing anecdote just shows to what a high state of training they can be brought and how well worthy pussy is of being trained There is as much too in the breeding as in the educating for you always find that honest cats have honest kittens and vice versa Of course it is contrary to nature to expect a cat to live on terms of intimacy with a bird and not sometimes make a mistake An old toll keeper in Stirlingshire had a favourite cat and a pet canary at the same time Living all alone and having plenty of spare time he had the pussy taught to allow the bird to take any liberties with her he chose and to perch on her back or head whenever he had a mind Indeed Dickie was seldom in his cage when he could be with the cat Many people came to see them and to remove all scepticism the toll man used to open the cage door when the bird would immediately fly out alight on pussy s head and at once burst into song One day when working in his garden a cat passed mister Tolly apparently in a vehement hurry with a bright yellow bird in its mouth and hurried away towards the wood Losh said Tolly sticking his spade in the ground and scratching his poll that can never be my cat sure ly and Lord have a care o me he added that can never surely be my bird With a beating heart he rushed towards the house and there got proof positive it was both his cat and his bird for the cage door was open and puss and Dick had both disappeared It was a case of elopement or rather abduction of the most forcible nature Poor Tolly was now a very lonely man indeed for well aware of the heinous nature of the crime she had committed and afraid of the consequences the cat never returned In our city house writes a lady to me we have a fine grey and black cat This cat is the most honest of creatures and guards our larder from the predatory inroads of the neighbour s cats On one occasion a stray cat was observed to run away with a cold stewed pigeon Our cat rushed after the thief and with some difficulty induced it to drop the spoil she then brought the pigeon back and laid it down at its master s feet It is by no means an uncommon thing in Scotland to see a large tabby on a shopkeeper s counter kept to look after bigger thieves than rats or mice Some of these animals I have known to especially hate little boys and indeed to raise serious objections to their being served at all I remember one cat in particular a very large and powerful Tom who used daily to mount guard on the counter to protect his master s wares He used to walk up and down generally keeping close to the shopkeeper and his quick eye on the customer If the latter paid the money down he was allowed to take up and pocket the articles but if he put a finger on any little package before paying Tom s big paw was down on him at once a hint that never required repeating to the same customer It is almost needless to say that Tom himself was the pink of everything that was fair and honest he was never under any circumstances known to steal One day the merchant had gone for a few minutes into the back shop leaving Tom sitting apparently asleep beside a large piece of butter which had just been weighed An urchin who happened to be passing seeing the state of affairs the coast clear and the sentry asleep determined not to let slip so golden an opportunity he had a large piece of oat cake in his hand He would butter that at least he thought He had just got the knife stuck into the butter when quick as lightning Tom nabbed him Deeply in through the skin went the cat s claws and loudly screamed the urchin Tom raised his voice in concert but held fast and the duet quickly brought the shopkeeper to the spot Tom appeared to have great satisfaction in seeing that little Arab s ears boxed I know an instance of a cat which brought home a live canary in its mouth which she presented to her mistress The bird was put in a cage and turned out a great pet and pussy and the bird were always great friends the cat one day punishing severely a stray puss that had been guilty of the unpardonable crime of looking at the canary CHAPTER VIII See Note H Addenda THE PLOUGHMAN S MYSIE Ten miles along dusty roads in a hilly country and on a hot summer s day was rather fatiguing and I was glad to find the ploughman s cottage or rather hut at last It was placed in a picturesque little nook at the foot of the Ochil mountains and consisted simply of a butt and a ben with a potatoe patch and kail yard in front The mistress was at home her goodman she said was busy sowing turnips But she kindly asked me in and showed me into the best room with its mahogany chest of drawers old fashioned eight day clock and bed with snowy counterpane in the corner While I rested the good woman produced her kebbuck of last year s cheese a basin of creamy milk and some delicious oat cakes a banquet for a hungry king and bade me eat apologising that she had no whisky in the house And so she said you ve come a this lang road too see our Mysie Well pointing towards the bed yonder she is sir I was certainly a little disappointed Mysie was a tortoise shell and white pretty well marked but small and with an expression as I thought of bad temper about her little face which just then seemed the reverse of pleasant but this wore off when I patted and caressed her Is there anything remarkable about her I asked Weel sir said her mistress she can catch mice like winking Cats generally do said I laughing anything else She s a queer cratur She has never slept a single night in the house since her e en were opened and But you re no eating sir I praised the cakes and kebbuck and remained silent The fact is sir she said at last she saved my husband s life last fa o the year For George is a proud proud man and would never accept meal or maut that he hadna worked or paid for one But he had been lang lang ill and ae day when I followed the doctor to the door he told me that my poor man must die if he didna have his strength kept up Flesh and wine said the doctor flesh and wine and plenty of both Ah little he kenned So I put awa pledged my marriage gown and ring to get him wine but we had naething in the house but milk and meal Surely sir it was the Lord Himself that put it into that cat s head for that same night she brought in a fine young rabbit and laid it on the verra bed the good woman was weeping now and the next night the same and every night the same for a month whiles a rabbit and whiles a bird till George was up and going to his work as usual But she never brought onything hame after that She s maybe no bonnie sir but God bless her she is unco good and wiser than many a human By this time I could perceive no expression on Mysie s face but that of unalterable fidelity and unchangeable love You wouldn t like to part with her would you Part wi Mysie sir No for a the warld s wealth So I bade them good bye not now regretting my long walk to the Ochil mountains and the ploughman s faithful Mysie CHAPTER IX See Note I Addenda TENACITY OF LIFE IN CATS As many lives as a cat and a cat has nine lives are sayings which we hear almost every day The truth of the latter we must all acknowledge not indeed as regards the imputed plurality of lives in the cat but as illustrative of the extreme tenacity of the one life she possesses As an Irishman would say pussy may be many times kill t but only once kill t entirely or as a Zanzibar nigger would have it she may be often times dead but only once gone dead Joy was a farmer s cat a beautifully marked lady tabby She was extremely fond of horses used to jump on their backs and often sleep there at night She was consequently nearly always in the stable One day however one of her pets kicked her accidentally it is to be hoped but so severely that one of the men found her lying cold and stiff beside the wall He lifted her up and laid her on the dunghill until he should find time to give her a decent burial Here the poor animal lay all day in the sun and here she was found at milking time by a kind hearted servant girl Thinking she perceived some tokens of life about it and remembering the proverb she took the pussy into the kitchen and rolling it carefully in a flannel petticoat placed it in front of the fire When she came in from milking she was rejoiced to find that pussy was so much better as to be able to lift her head and taste a little warm milk With three days careful nursing the cat recovered She lived to a goodly old age but abjured the turf she never backed a favourite again Another cat found in a trap was cruelly beaten about the head by a brutal keeper until the blood gushed from both ears He finally cut off the poor thing s tail as a trophy of his bravery and left her on the ground for dead Her mistress hearing of what had happened was soon on the spot and carried home what she thought was the dead body of her cat She tried every means of resuscitation nevertheless and in three weeks had the satisfaction of seeing pussy as well as ever and as full of fun only it was now a Manx cat an artificial one Pussy must often have seen her own tail hanging on the game keeper s wall in company with a dead hawk an owl and a few hoody crows The man had the tail frizzed up to make it look big and pointing it out to many a cockney sportsman used to relate a story of a dreadful encounter he had with a real wild cat sir which he at last slew and yonder he would always add hangs the buffer s tail A man going one morning into his dovecot which in this case was an attic at the top of a house eight storeys high found his own cat killing the pigeons right and left Greatly enraged he kicked the animal through the open window On going down shortly after rather ashamed and sorry for what he had done he was greatly surprised to see pussy gather herself up and slink in at the back door Apparently she was none the worse of her rather hurried descent from a height of over fifty feet In the case of the cat which the keeper kill d there was no doubt fracture of the skull In the following case the apparent death was no doubt due to severe concussion of the brain or stunning A boy in going to school one day saw a large cat sitting not far from its master s door Without meaning to hurt the pussy but with that recklessness of consequences which characterizes most school boys he picked up a stone to have just one shy at her He struck her on the head and pussy dropped to all appearance as dead as the stone itself Afraid of the consequences of detection he picked the cat up and threw it in a cornfield not far off As murderers are said to haunt the scene of their guilt so the boy every morning for the three following days found himself irresistibly drawn towards the field of corn and every morning there lay his victim stark and still On the fourth morning however she was gone and in returning from school the same evening the boy s astonishment was very great indeed on seeing the identical cat washing its face at its master s door as if nothing had ever occurred to annoy it Kittens too possess the same tenacity of life which is so remarkable in the full grown cat A friend of mine for example had a cat which gave birth to a litter of five kittens four of which were ordered to be drowned The execution of the sentence was duly carried out the same evening in a pail of water When full time had been given to the kits to give their final kick the pail was emptied on a heap of manure Next morning however all the young pussies were found alive and well in their happy mother s arms She was allowed to rear them I do not know what means pussy adopted to revivify her apparently drowned offspring or I should at once send the recipe to the Royal Humane Society and patiently wait for a silver medallion by return of post I remember when a boy seeing a horrid old woman dig a hole in the earth and deliberately bury three kittens alive The ground heaved above them and she clapped the earth with the spade till all motion ceased The same aged wretch used to toast snails in a little flannel bag before the fire in order to extract the oil for sprains and I have often shuddered to hear the snails squeak but this of course has nothing to do with the subject of cats I went and told my little sister of the cruel interment and watching our chance we really thought the old woman would bury us if she caught us we dug up the kittens fully an hour after and were successful in nursing two of them back to life We reared them on the spoon The following anecdote might perhaps have been more properly related in the chapter on cruelty to cats however as illustrative of the subject in point we give it here At a certain farm town about ten years ago one of the men servants conceived a great antipathy to his master s cat The cat had been guilty of some little delinquency in the bothy or farm servants hall for which the man had punished pussy The farmer had taken his cat s part and scolded the man and hence the casus belli The man swore vengeance on poor pussy whenever an opportunity should occur Nor had he long to wait a fast day came round and nearly every one had gone to church The brutal fellow got the cat in the stable and commenced putting her to death with a horsewhip This he had well nigh accomplished when puss by some means effected her escape She was unable however to make much use of her legs so he whipped her round and round the farm steading until the poor creature took refuge in a hole which happened to be in the barn wall This hole was a cul de sac having no opening on the inside of the wall It now occurred to this fiendish lout that he might easily accomplish pussy s death and burial at the same time and he forthwith proceeded to build up the hole with stone and lime The cat was missed and a whole week elapsed without any tidings of her and although suspicion fell upon the right party there was no proof A whole week elapsed when one evening the farmer was standing near the barn wondering if ever he would see his little friend again Suddenly his eye fell upon the servant s handiwork That wall he thought was never repaired by my orders my poor cat is buried there To fetch a pick and tear out the stones did not take many seconds and then from her very grave he pulled the pussy Strange to say she was alive and though dreadfully emaciated by careful nursing she got all right again in a few weeks She had been eight days immured in a cramped position Only fancy her sufferings Some schoolboys not long since stoned a poor cat till she fell down apparently dead Afraid of what they had done they determined to kill it outright and bury it in an adjoining field This they endeavoured to do by dashing the cat s head against a stone fence not succeeding however and being in a hurry to get off to escape detection a grave was hurriedly dug and pussy interred The ground was still moving over her when the young wretches left Bad news travels apace and the owner of poor puss hearing of her favourite s death and burial hastened to the grave and dug her up There was still life in her and by careful treatment she made a good recovery and was seen about her old haunts four or five days after The following case of suspended animation may seem almost incredible it is authentic nevertheless and not unaccountable either on scientific grounds The owner of a black and white cat determined for private reasons to get rid of her He had not the heart to hang her or he was not sufficiently enamoured of Calcraft s profession to do so there was no poison in the house and as he lived away up in the centre of a hilly country there was no water without walking a long distance sufficiently deep to drown her Thinking however that suffocation in whatever way produced was as easy a death as any he got a small bag in which he placed the cat tying the mouth of the sack He then dug a hole in the garden and lowered her down I ll no hurt ye poor puss he said as he pressed the earth firmly but gently over her and ye ll no be lang o deeing there God she canna live wantin breath This grave was merely meant for a temporary resting place so next morning the man went to open it with the intention of placing her remains at the foot of a tree To his surprise pussy jumped out of the bag alive and well well enough at any rate to make her feet her friends That cat thought she had lived long enough in that part of the country The same black Tom mentioned in a former chapter as guarding his master s wares and keeping his eye on questionable customers was certainly very exemplary in his honesty but as every pussy has one little failing so had big Tom An egg was Tom s stumbling block He could have got dozens of them on his master s counter but that would have been theft besides he preferred his eggs new laid and not imported So with the intention of ministering to his cravings Tom used to pay occasional visits to the henneries of the neighbours He also had a habit of making a pilgrimage to an adjoining village and calling at the house of a man called Archie a weaver and customer of his master s Archie was very fond of Tom and always made him welcome Not so however a man called Dan who lived in the next house For this man openly accused Tom of stealing his eggs and there was no doubt some truth in it for Dan s wife swore she had seen Tom more than once coming out through the hen hole in the barn door with his beard still yellow with the yolk of a stolen egg Dan resolved to be revenged and at once set about encompassing the poor pussy s death He so arranged a bag beneath the hen hole that on Tom s going through he would be certain to pop into it and so make himself prisoner The first time the bag was set Dan only captured his own cock the next time a stray hen of a neighbour but this only made him the more determined and eventually he was successful Tom was a prisoner and condemned to instant execution by Dan and his wife Bell Bell indeed was even more bitter against the cat than her husband Just then pussy s friend the weaver happened to come upon the scene and hearing what had occurred and what was about to follow he pleaded long and hard for his little friend s life and even threatened the terrors of the law but Dan was inexorable Die Tom should he said if he himself should hang for it He kill d the cat by dashing the sack many times against the gable wall of his own house He s quiet enough now said Dan Make siccar said Bell and she commenced hitting Tom with the spade she had brought to dig his grave You ugly black brute she cried you ll steal nae mair eggs in this warld Dan then threw the sack over his shoulders and accompanied by his wife as grave digger and Archie the weaver as chief mourner they proceeded to the garden to bury the unfortunate Tom A grave was dug at the foot of a gooseberry bush and Dan opening the mouth of the sack proceeded to shake out the mangled remains of the cat You may judge of the chagrin and disgust of Dan and his cruel Bell when those same mangled remains no sooner touched the ground than they got together again somehow and springing out of the grave made their way like greased lightning out of the garden and off The tables were turned Dan was chief mourner now Curse the cat he roared Dan s wife was equal to the occasion You re a fool gudeman she said and indeed he did not look much unlike one the cat s the deevil and you can fill in the grave yersel CHAPTER X See Note J Addenda NOMADISM IN CATS There are few if any cats that can withstand the temptation to occasionally roam abroad and lead for a while the life of a gipsy puss Perhaps pussy thinks she has as much right to her holiday as master or mistress Home life must at times grow monotonous and irksome and a change no doubt highly desirable Besides cats are of a more social disposition among their species than dogs are They like to meet and exchange ideas with their fellow cats Night is the season almost invariably chosen for these social reunions There is then more seclusion and less likelihood of their being disturbed They know that dogs stick closely at home after dark and that little boys are sound asleep By night moreover the voices of the gentlemen who give addresses are more easily heard Everything else being so still each inflection and intonation of voice is beautifully distinct It matters not that the nervous lady in No five is kept awake till the close of the meeting and can t sleep a wink after that that No three can t get her baby to sleep or that No two is writing a letter to the Times and can t follow out any single idea the concert in the back garden of No four goes on all the same How sweetly that old tabby cat imitates the harmonies of a bass violin How grandly that black Tom s voice rises and swells floats and soars on the night breeze How beautifully those five cats in the corner are imitating the dulcet strains of the great highland bag pipe Three of them are told of as drones the other two do the lilting and the effect is quite startling So at least thinks that old bachelor wretch in the two pair back who now throws open the window and rains curses and cold water on the influential meeting momentarily interrupting the flow of harmony Only momentarily however Move on a garden or two suggests black Tom that old beast has no soul Illustration STRIPED or BROWN TABBY First Prize Owned by MISS M E MOORE Illustration RED TABBY First Prize Owned by MISS FORSHALL And the concert goes on as before Cats are republicans of the rubiest red Communism is rampant in their ranks and indeed they seem to thrive on it In our day we hope communism will always be confined to the cats There is no respect of persons shown among cats One cat is as good as another and the sharpest claw and the strongest arm rules supreme for the time Beauty rank and breeding are alike despised At pussy s balls and assemblies there is no such officer as master of ceremonies Any gentleman may introduce himself to any lady he chooses provided always she does not spit in his face and box his ears for in this way the lady never hesitates to express disapprobation of her partner In so outspoken a community boredom is thus practically done away with and there is a freedom from all affectation which is highly refreshing There you may see my Lord Tom noddy whose noble form rests by day on a tiger skin mat by a sea coal fire whispering nay rather howling soft nothings in the ears of Miss Pussy Black leg whose mistress keeps a marine store at Wapping Old stairs and sits up nightly to wait for Jack Yet no one can doubt the genuineness of his lordship s proposals who marks his earnest manner or listens to the impassioned tones of his voice as he beseeches her to Fly fil ly with him now ne ow w The young and beautiful Lady Lovelace with fur so long and white and softer than eider down with eyes of himmel blue who sleeps all day on a cushion of scarlet and sips her creamy milk from a china saucer is yonder in a corner flirting with the coal heaver s Bob Bob s ears are rent in ribbons his face is seamed with bloody scars he is lame his fur nearly all singed off and he has only one eye and half a tail but his voice that is what has won the heart of the young beauty and when the ball is over he will convey her home in the moonlight to her splendid mansion in Belgravia he himself will be content with an hour s nod in the coal cellar The pretty pussy s mistress is anxiously waiting for her darling and will not sleep till she comes But witness this lady cat s slyness she kisses Bob fondly on the top of the conservatory then with bushy tail and fur erect she springs to the bedroom window and enters growling and casting frightened glances behind her and her doating mistress caresses her gently and tries to calm her fears And did the nasty Tom cat follow my litsy prettsy darling then And was it nearly frightened out of its bootiful tootiful lifie Ah pussy now then now Sly sly puss Is slyness confined to the cat creation or is it ever found among females of a higher persuasion female women to wit Cats are remarkably fond of comfort and when the usages of society compel her to be up all night at a ball or concert she goes to bed immediately after breakfast and sleeps off every vestige of fatigue I knew a cat that used to travel over six miles every other day to visit and have a gossip with another cat for which she had contracted a violent fancy They were both lady cats but strange to say I never saw the other cat return the visit Cats will often make almost incredibly long journeys and endure fatigue and hardships innumerable in order to find a lost master or mistress One cat I know travelled nearly a hundred miles into Wales in search of her master who had gone and left her She had been three weeks on the journey and when success at last crowned her efforts she was so weak and emaciated that she tumbled down with a fond cry at her master s feet The difficulty of wandering cats is well known You may wander a dog easily but not pussy for if so inclined she will assuredly find her way back somehow at some time You may shut her up in a basket or bag and take her for miles through the most intricate streets or over a covered country but in all probability she will be back in a day or two if indeed you do not find her on the door step on your return A gentleman in the neighbourhood of London before going to reside in the city gave his cat away to a friend Two years after she turned up at his city residence and although very thin and impoverished manifested great joy on seeing her old master Whether or not the party to whom the cat had been presented had come to live in London and brought the cat with him I do not know but the story is a fact Moreover the cat could not have been taken back on purpose as she came by the tiles There can be no longer any doubt that pussy possesses some power or instinct which enables her to find her way back ever so far to the place where she has once resided and that too unerringly We cannot pretend to understand this any more than we can the principle that guides the carrier pigeon but true it is there are more things in heaven and earth than we dream of in our philosophy CHAPTER XI See Note K Addenda IS CATS TO BE TRUSTED Is cats to be trusted was to have been the title of an essay from the pen of poor Artemus Ward Is cats to be trusted my starling has been taught to repeat and often does so while running round the cat on the floor examining her tail opening up her paws with his beak and occasionally making determined attempts to open up her nose also and peep down her throat As far as she is concerned the bird is I think perfectly safe for although she often pats him with her gloved hand when he gets too insinuating she never otherwise attempts to molest him I fear in his essay Artemus meant to have had a few jokes at pussy s expense My aim is a more serious one A question like this which to pussy is a most momentous one affecting not only her comfort and happiness but her standing as a social pet and her very existence itself cannot be treated lightly in a work like the present My own opinion is and always has been that if cats are properly fed and cared for they will do anything rather than steal But not content with giving my own experience which some might say was exceptional I have placed pussy in court as it were and given her a long fair and impartial trial summoning evidence pro and con from every part of Great Britain and Ireland The trial has lasted for months and the Tichborne Case as a Yankee would say isn t a circumstance to it in regard to the number of witnesses examined The judgment has been overwhelmingly in pussy s favour and the verdict of the jury as follows Cats are not as a rule thieves but quite the reverse In every case investigated where the theft was proved it turned out that the cat was either starved or illtreated or spoiled Moreover the witnesses for the prosecution in the minority were to use a homely phrase a foggy lot rude and illiterate people with no definite ideas about their h s whose capitals were sown broadcast who wrote i Know and spelt cat with a k while those for the defence were in every way the reverse both socially and orthographically people with crests and monograms who wrote on one side of the paper only and all letters prepaid So Miss Puss I think may stand down she leaves the court without a stain upon her character Now while boldly asserting that cats are as a rule honest I do not mean to say that all are so There are rogues among cats as well as among men but just as we find that the law often makes men thieves so likewise will cats become thieves if badly treated What can be more disgraceful than the habit that some people have of systematically starving their cats under the mistaken notion that they will thus become better mousers or the custom of many of putting their cats out all night no matter how wet or cold the night should be Such treatment of pussy is greatly to be condemned and only tends to foster habits of uncleanliness of thieving and of prowling By regular feeding good housing occasional judicious correction when puss is found tripping and kindness you may make almost any cat honest Pussy does not soon forget having been corrected for a fault Black Tom mentioned in a former chapter never went back to Dan s hen house again A Tom cat called Bruce lived some years ago at a farm house near Dundee This cat honest in every other way could never resist the temptation to steal the cream All efforts to cure him of this habit were resorted to in vain But one day Bruce much to his own satisfaction found himself shut up in the milk house When all was quiet Bruce came from his corner and had a look round What a grand and imposing array of basins of milk and tubs full of cream One of the latter stood on a table beneath the window the edge of the tub being on a level with the sill It was the largest tub in the room and blessing his luck up jumped Bruce and began to lick It was so delicious and Bruce closed his eyes to get the full flavour of it Just then however some noise outside startled him he knew he was sinning and was consequently nervous and in turning round he missed his feet and fell heels over head into the tub Although half choked so soon as he came up Bruce struck out boldly for the shore but the sides of the vessel were too slippery even for a cat to hold on to besides the weight of the cream clogged his movements He would fain not have screamed but death stared him in the face and the idea of dying in a tub of milk as he had seen mice die was awful so he opened his mouth and gave vent to a smothered yell That yell loud resounding through the house brought ben the good wife and Bruce s life was saved at the expense of about three pints of cream but never more did that cat go near the milk house He was a reformed cat from that day a burning and a shining light to all the cats in the country side I know a cat a Tom as usual who always sits on his master s counter surrounded by provisions of all sorts but he was never known to steal This cat has a penchant for pickled herrings and although he might easily help himself by day or night he always prefers asking his master for one This he accomplishes in the usual cat fashion by running towards the barrel and mewing up in his master s face and of course this appeal is never made in vain Cats are remarkably fond of fish The other day a bonnie fishwife was standing on the pavement with her creel on her back Suddenly she was heard to scream aloud For the love o the Lord sir she cried to a bystander tell me what s that on my back The party addressed looked about just in time to see a pussy disappearing round a corner with a large fish in its mouth That was what the newspapers would call an impudent theft and it was certainly a clever one If not properly trained and cared for pussy comes like the Ladrone islanders to look upon stealing as a virtue and no wonder for she must think it hard to starve in the midst of plenty and in her master s house Besides there is always two ways of viewing a matter Out on the coast of Africa I have often gone on shore for the fun of the thing with a party of other officers to assist in replenishing our larder by the addition of a few fat fowls a sucking grunter or a kid of the goats I rather think we stole them but we called these little trips cutting out expeditions still we swore pon honour and wore our swords none the less clankingly on a Sunday morning nor would it have been safe for any one to have hinted that we were dishonest Just so with poor pussy She is often tempted by hunger to make a little reprisal It is vulgar to accuse her of stealing the steak nailing a fish or boning a cold chicken cutting out is the proper term It is a feline virtue from the path of which she must be seduced in early kitten hood and by good treatment But poor pussy is often made the scape goat for the sins of others Mary bring up those cold pigeons O ma am how ever shall I tell you That thief of a cat The cat must be drowned says her mistress Oh no ma am Poor thing no ma am It wouldn t exactly suit Mary s book to have pussy drowned It would seriously interfere with those nice little suppers she is in the habit of having with Matilda Jane Sarah we ll have the remains of that cold lamb for supper Oh

with a stripe round one forearm and a belt about his waist and X ninety nine on the collar of his coat The following is the story of a real feline Jack Sheppard I have no excuse to offer for this cat I can only say that if he was a thief he was a swell at it In a sweet little village not far from the famous old town of bonnie Dundee lived and I believe still lives Peter McFarlane a shoemaker and his wife Tibbie two as decent old bodies as you would see in all broad Scotland They were honest and industrious and as a rule agreed or as the folks say they both said one way except when Peter took a dram when it must be confessed the ashes did at times find their way up the chimney along with the smoke They had no family but one a cat A fine gentlemanly fellow he was too dressed in the blackest of fur and faultless to a degree barring that he was the biggest thief ever known in the village or whole country side Every one complained of Tom and as he got older his delinquencies were ever on the increase Allowing thieving to be a virtue among cats of his class Tom was a saint and ripe for glory long ago The butcher do what he liked could not save his kidneys it was remarkable that Tom never touched the sausages he was always content with kidneys although if none were to be had to pussy s honour be it said he did not despise a lump of steak or even a nice lamb chop Tom was a regular customer at the fish monger s his weakness here being for Loch Fyne herrings they were handy but he delighted also in the centre cut of a salmon and in half pound sea trout It has even been said that Tom did not share his custom equally among the shop keepers spending too much of his time at the fish monger s counter but as his biographer I must defend his name from any such allegation Although it must be admitted he never paid ready money still he was never too proud to carry away his purchase Tom used to enter the poor people s houses about dinner time watch his chance and purloin the meat from under their very noses Once he lifted the lid from a broth pot and decamped with the boiling chicken This cat was never known to drink water when he could find a milk pan nor milk either if the cream jug was at all handy He was even accused of having sucked the cows and when hard pressed with hunger he did not despise a piece of cheese or a tallow candle from the grocer s round the corner He never troubled himself catching mice chickens came handier and tame pigeons he found were more satisfying than sparrows Tom could break in or out of any place climb anything and jump the neighbours all said the d l s height I don t know how tall that gentleman is at Dundee but he must be over twenty feet for Tom could do that easily and alight on his pumps At long last the cat became so notorious and the outcry against him so loud and universal that the shoemaker and Tibbie yielding to the entreaties of the villagers resolved to have him drowned On a cold winter s night then honest Peter and three of the neighbours might have been seen had there been light enough to see them trudging along towards the pier with the unhappy but virtuous Tom in a sack Arrived at the place of execution a consultation was held as to how the job should be done There wasn t a stone to be had and Peter said he wasn t going to lose his sack it was bad enough to lose the cat so it was resolved to take Tom out and swing him clear off into the water More easily said than done Tom was no sooner out of the bag than by a successful application of tooth and nail he wriggled himself free and in a moment more was lost in the darkness Peter scratched his head the neighbours scratched their three heads and they all felt funny and foolish They determined however not to make laughing stocks of themselves so they returned to Peter s house with the joyful intelligence that Tom was a cat of the past Here were the fishwife and the milkwife and the grocer and his wife and the butcher who hadn t a wife all assembled to hear the good news and it was unanimously resolved to celebrate the event by making a night of it and although the people of Dundee and round about are generally glad of any excuse to make a night of it still it must be admitted that the present occasion urgently called for cakes and whuskey So the fishwife brought salmon the milkwife brought milk the butcher brought steak and the grocer whiskey galore Tibbie with her best new mutch did the cooking and they all sat down to eat and to drink and be merry No Indian villagers just released from the dominion of a man eating tiger could have felt jollier than did those good folks at the thoughts of thieving Tom s demise May the deil gang wi him was one of the toasts to Tom s memory And a the ill weather was another If there be said the fishwife an ill place for the souls o cats that black beast ll hae a hot neuk in t Ay but said the grocer a godly man and an elder of the Free Church speak nae ill o the dead Eppie but pass the whuskey and I ll gie ye a bit sang He sung the death of Heather Jock which was by no means inappropriate And so the nicht drave on wi sangs and clatter and the fingers of old Peter s eight day clock were creeping slowly towards the wee short hour ayont the twal when Well neighbours says Peter the hypocrite we re a glad the cat has gane we a his weight o crime on his sinfu shou ders Let us eat that last pound o steak finish the bottle and gang to bed There is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip and scarcely had Peter done speaking when the door opened apparently of its own accord The cold night wind blew in with a ghostly sough and the candles were extinguished But lo on the table in their very midst and dimly seen by the smouldering firelight stood Tom himself with back erect and gleaming eyes Never was such kicking and screaming heard anywhere The fishwife fainted and the milkwife fainted and the godly grocer and his wife fainted and the butcher who hadn t a wife at all fell down on top of the others for company s sake But Peter and the three guilty neighbours stood in a corner dumb When order was at length restored and the candles re lit the old shoemaker told his true version of the story and was very properly forgiven But where was Tom Tom was gone and so was the beef steak And from that day to this never again was Tom heard of in that sweet little village near bonnie Dundee That cat was a thief CHAPTER XII See Note L Addenda PUSSY AS A MOTHER A careful and fond mother is our pussy cat In no case is her wisdom and sagacity better exhibited than in the love and care she displays for her offspring Weeks before the interesting event comes off pussy has been upstairs and downstairs and in the lady s chamber looking for the snuggest corner or the cosiest closet in which to bring forth her young In this matter different cats have different opinions Some prefer a feather bed when they can manage it some a bundle of rags some an old newspaper or humble straw while others believe the acme of comfort is to lie inside a lady s bonnet or a gentleman s wig Wherever pussy has chosen to have her kittens there in that room or closet she prefers to nurse them and should they and she be removed to another she will persist in carrying her offspring back to the old place however comfortable the new bed may be This proves that pussy like human beings of the same gender has a will of her own I know an instance of a cat whose kittens were removed by her master from the attic in which they were born to a snug little berth in the barn The cottage doors were closed against her but missus Puss was not to be balked and next morning found her and her family comfortably re ensconced in the old quarters during the night she had smashed the attic sky light and carried her kittens through one by one Pussy gained her point and was happy I know a lady whose cat has had a litter of one kitten It is her first and if she had produced ten she could not possibly be prouder of the performance It is amusing to watch the care and affection she bestows on her ae ae bairn two Her whole heart I was nearly saying and soul seems bound up in it She sits and studies it by the hour no doubt it is its father s image dresses it at least a dozen times a day and whenever she has occasion to go out she takes this miserable little object of her love and rolls it carefully in the sofa tidy so that it may neither catch cold nor come to harm When a cat finds out that there is not proper room or convenience in her owner s house for the proper rearing of her family or that there is some chance of molestation or danger from the inmates she never hesitates to go elsewhere for the event She generally selects an out house or in the summer time goes to the woods but she never fails to return to her old abode as soon as the kittens can take care of themselves Mary is an old old maid an old maid from choice so she tells me she could have been married if she had liked Mony a harum scarum ne er do weel says Mary came blethering about me when I was young and bonnie but I ga e them a their kail thro the reek wi their calves faces and phrasing mou s Na ne er a man gave me a sair heart and what s mair never shall I don t suppose they ever will for even the probability of Mary s having been once young seems mere tradition Besides Mary has centered all her earthly affections on her cat and there is every likelihood that puss will live as long as she herself The old lady apologises for loving it on the ground that it is So clean and clever sir and catches mice as easy as wink and whenever a dog barks on the street she runs to see that her pet is safe Some months ago this pussy gave evidence that she would soon become a mother Now as the room in which poor Mary resides is only about twelve feet square it was very evident there was but small accommodation for a decent cat s accouchement The same idea struck both pussy and her kind old mistress at the same time and while Mary was busy going the round of her neighbours seeking in vain for an asylum for her favourite pussy was absent on the same errand and apparently with more success for she did not return Mary was now indeed a waefu woman for days and nights went past and no tidings came of puss Some evil thing must have happened to her thought the old lady Perhaps she was shut up in some lonely outhouse and starving to death or tumbled down a chimney cruel boys may have stoned her or drowned her cruel keepers may have trapped her or more likely still that rieving rascal Rover may have worried her He was just like the dog to do a deed of the kind aye and glory in it at any rate she should never see her more Alack a day and Mary s tears fell thick and fast on the stocking she was knitting till she even lost the loops and couldn t see to pick them up again Marvel not oh reader at the old maid s emotion pussy was her one ewe lamb her all she had in the world to love And weeks went past as weeks will whether one s in grief or not and it was well into the middle of the third and getting near evening when lonesome Mary cowering over her little fire heard a voice which made her start and listen she heard it again and with her old heart bobbing for joy she tottered to the door and admitted her long lost favourite Pussy had no time for congratulations she had a fine lively kitten in her mouth which she carefully deposited in Mary s bed and made straight for the door again She was back again in twenty minutes with another which she gently put beside the first then she went back for another then another then a fifth and when she dropped the sixth and turned to go out again Lord keep us Topsy said old Mary How mony mair is there Are ye goin to board a the kits in the country on me But the seventh was the last and Topsy threw herself down beside the lot and prepared to sing herself and them to sleep It turned out that Mary s cat had taken up her abode in a farmer s hay loft fully half a mile from her owner s house but no one had seen her until the day she carried home her kittens She had no doubt subsisted all the time on rats and mice for she was in fine condition when she gladdened the old maid s heart with her return You may often observe that if two she cats are living together or in adjoining houses one always gets and retains the mastery over the other until that other happens to be nursing when she in her turn becomes mistress and her companion is glad to give her a wide berth Cats will go through fire and water to save the life of their kittens and fight to the bitter end to protect them A dog will seldom dare to attack a cat while she is nursing her young My own cat actually imposes the duties of dry nurse on my Newfoundland Theodore Nero His finely feathered legs make a delightful bed for them He seems pleased with the trust too and licks them all over with his tongue In Muffie s absence he lies perfectly still seemingly afraid to move lest he should hurt them When they get a little older and more playful they make tremendous onslaughts on his nose and ears and tail which the honest fellow bears with the most exemplary patience for he loves Muffie although many a wild chase he gives her numerous lovers He can t bear followers The other day a playfellow of his a large Irish water spaniel looked in at the door just to ask if he would come for a romp for an hour as the sun was shining the breakers running mountains high on the beach and any number of little boys to throw in sticks to them Theodore Nero was nursing But Muffie went and I should think that dog felt sorry he had ever turned out of bed at all that morning The cat rode him at least fifty yards from her own door battering him unmercifully all the way Then she came back and sang to Nero Poor Coolin staggered down the road half blinded with blood and shaking his beautiful ears in a most pitiful manner but his sorrows were only half over for not seeing very well where he was running he stumbled right upon a clucking hen and chickens And she gave it to him next If the cat warmed one end of him she restored the equilibrium and warmed the other so true is it that misfortunes seldom come singly Cats have been often known to leap gallantly into the water after a drowning kitten and bring it safely to land A case occurred only a few days ago Some lads stole a cat s only kitten and after playing with it all day proposed drowning it With this intention they went to a mill dam and threw it far into the water But the loving little mother had been waiting and watching not far off and stimulated by the drowning cry of her kitten she bravely swam towards it and brought it on shore I know another instance of a cat that saved the life of a kitten which belonged to another cat Her own kittens had been drowned a whole week before but evidently she had not forgotten the loss and one day seeing four kittens being drowned in a pool she plunged in and seizing the largest brought it to bank and marched off with it in triumph She reared it carefully The children baptized it Moses very appropriately too and it is now a fine large Tom tabby A poor cat some time since nearly lost her life in the Dee attempting to save the life of her kitten The river was swollen with recent rains and the kitten was in the centre of the stream but nothing daunted pussy like the brave little heroine she was plunged in and finally reached it Here her real danger only began for the current was very strong and pussy was whirled rapidly down the river After struggling for nearly half an hour she succeeded in landing at a bend of the river nearly a mile below She had stuck to her poor kitten all the time but the little thing was dead A family in Fifeshire were about removing to another farm about four miles distant from the one they then occupied Part of their household gods was a nice large she tabby and being kind hearted folks they never thought of leaving her behind so having found a home with a neighbour for pussy s one kitten they took the mother with them to their new residence Next morning pussy had disappeared and they were just beginning to put faith in the popular fallacy that cats are more attached to places than persons when back came pussy and with her her kitten That kitten pussy thought wasn t old enough for weaning and so she had gone back all the way to steal it She was right Owing to the peculiarities of his matrimonial relations the happy father of a litter of kittens shares none of the responsibility and has none of the care and trouble of rearing them because he does not as a rule reside in the bosom of his family When he does live with his wife however he is never exempted from family duties And Tom always shows himself a thoughtful husband and loving father A male cat of my acquaintance was most exemplary in his attentions on his wife at one of the most interesting and critical periods of her life Made aware goodness knows how of her approaching confinement he not only selected the closet for the occasion but even made her bed for her and stood sentry at the door till the whole affair was over Every morning for weeks he trotted upstairs first thing to see if his wife wanted anything and to gaze enraptured on his darlings I am sorry to say however that this little woman rather bullied her doating husband If she happened to be in good humour when Tom entered then well and good she returned his fond cry and chaste salute If not her brows fell at once and she let him have it straight from the shoulder Poor Tom in the latter case used to mew apologetically and retire It was Tom s duty every morning to bring in a very young rabbit a bird or at least a mouse and it seemed to be an understood thing that he should bring it all alive ho When he brought it dead she slapped him Sometimes he brought a herring then she slapped him Indeed she lost no opportunity of slapping him She slapped him if he looked fond and foolish at her and she slapped him if he didn t One day he was put to nurse the kittens The kittens commenced an unavailing search for tits among Tom s fur As a wet nurse Tom was a failure He was slapped and sent off accordingly Tom seemed to have business that took him down town every day Whenever he came back he was snuffed all over and examined to see whether he had been with lady friends If he had been then he was properly slapped So there was a good deal of slapping His wife was fond of him however for once when he absented himself without leave for a whole day and a night she made the house ring with her melancholy cries She half killed him when he did return nevertheless Such is conjugal felicity Although as a rule all the duties of maternity seem to end with the weaning of the kitten still the motherly affection does not die out and in cases of sickness in any of her children pussy at once resumes the cares of nursing as the following little story will illustrate GINGER AND JOSIE And Josie was Ginger s mother She was a good mother There had been originally five but the others were born to sorrow and were accidentally drowned so that all mother Josie s love was centred in her one son Ginger Ginger therefore not only got all the love but he got all the milk so he grew up thumpingly and fat Nothing remarkable transpired during Ginger s kittenhood He neither had the measles nor strange to say the hooping cough and he played the usual antics with his mother s tail that all kittens do and have done since Noah s cats kittens downwards When Josie found her milk getting scarce she weaned her son Ginger this she accomplished by whacking him and endeavouring to carve her initials on his nose No doubt Ginger thought himself absurdly ill used We have all thought the same on a similar occasion But Ginger was amply repaid for the loss of his tits by the mice which his loving mamma never failed to supply him with daily So he grew up burly big and beautiful and at the age of one year had become a mighty hunter Then came six long days and nights wherein Ginger never appeared and poor mother Josie went about the house mourning unceasingly for her lost son At the end of that time a pitiful mewing was heard outside proceeding from the bottom of the garden and on walking down his owners to their dismay found poor Ginger to quote his mistress s words in a most lamentable plight thin to emaciation and coiled up on the ground apparently lifeless his fur once so glossy and bright now all bedraggled in blood and mud The cruel keepers had been the cause of Ginger s misfortunes He had been caught in a trap For five days without food or water had the poor animal languished in a field On the sixth he had managed to crawl some little way dragging the trap after him till he came to a gate This he managed to get through but the trap getting entangled held him fast until some kind Samaritan seeing his miserable plight set him free from this impediment He then crawled home jumped the wall and sunk exhausted on the ground where he now lay Tenderly was Ginger borne into the house and laid on the hearth rug His leg was broken swollen and entirely useless so it was determined to have recourse to amputation The extremity was accordingly cut off by the owners and although long confined to his mat pussy lived Josie was very happy to see her son again maimed and bruised as he was and at once set about performing the duties of nurse to him She seldom or never left him except to procure food for him but Ginger had a regular daily supply of dead mice birds and other feline dainties until he was able to get about and cater for himself Ginger s accident happened upwards of two years ago He is still alive and well and as strong and active on his three legs as other cats are on four Ginger is a fine large cat but has always exhibited the greatest aversion to strangers CHAPTER XIII See Note M Addenda HOME TIES AND AFFECTIONS Are cats more attached to places than to persons I have taken considerable pains to arrive at a correct answer to this question and not satisfied with my own judgment and experience as in the case of pussy s honesty I appealed to the country I am happy to find that the opinion of all cat lovers nearly all cat breeders and the large majority of people who keep a cat for utility is that cats are as a rule more attached to their masters or owners than to their homes This question then must be considered as set at rest and a stigma removed from the name and character of our dear little friend the cat The popular fallacy that cats are fonder of places than persons first took its origin in the days long gone by when cats were kept for use only and never as pets and it only obtains now among people who look upon pussy as a mere animated rat trap and who starve neglect and in every way ill treat the poor thing Pray don t mistake me reader I am not saying that pussy isn t fond of her home in fact I am going to prove that she is immensely so but I most emphatically deny that she ever allows that fondness to obscure her love for the hand that feeds and caresses her or the kind voice of a loving master or mistress Six years ago an intimate friend of mine who loveth all things great and small went to reside for a time with a family in town A fine blue tabby was an inmate of the same house That cat said the mistress belongs to the family that lived here before it has been five times removed and always comes back My friend only remained there for six weeks when he changed his residence for a house he had taken only a few streets off but when he left that bonnie blue tabby trotted by his side all the way home and it has not returned yet But there is no doubt pussy is extremely attached to her home and nothing I think shows her warm heartedness more than her willingness to leave that home with a kind owner A cat has so many home ties that we need not wonder at her unwillingness to change her residence Custom has so endeared her to the old place that she cannot all at once like the new She knows every hole and corner of it knows every mouse walk the cupboards the cosy nooks for a quiet snooze and the places where she may hide when hiding becomes a necessity she is acquainted with the manner of egress and ingress and is familiar with every sound so that her rest is undisturbed by night and her finely strung nervous system not put on the rack by day Out of doors too everything about the old place is familiar the trees on which the sparrows perch the field where she often finds an egg the distant meadow corner where the rabbits play and the path that leads thereto which she can traverse unseen and free from danger either from farmers dogs or boys with stones and above all the dear old trysting place where she knows she can always meet her lovers in the moonlight But if she changes her quarters all this knowledge has to be learned over again New dangers have to be encountered fresh troubles and bother of every description Her new residence and everything about and around it has to be thoroughly surveyed mentally mapped out and got by heart before she can feel anything like at home So that if pussy has not the love of a kind human friend to counterbalance all her trials it is no wonder she will do anything or walk any length to get back to the place where she was so happy And when she goes back what does she find A change Faces and footsteps and all things strange She is treated as a stray cat and sent adrift every time she dares to put her unhappy nose inside the door But nevertheless she will hang about her old home for days and weeks until impelled by the pangs of hunger she casts aside the mantle of virtue becomes a thief and revenges herself on the new inhabitant s pigeons rabbits and chickens Facilis descensus Averni Having once robbed a roost she would rob a church so she takes to thieving as a means of subsistence The way of the transgressor is hard her coat becomes dry and hard her ribs stick out she loses all respect for her personal appearance frequents low neighbourhoods keeps low company makes night hideous with her howling and in a general way does everything she can to earn for herself and the whole cat community a bad name and finally in a few months if not sooner by accident succumbs to disease and dies on a dunghill It is with a feeling of deep regret that even the best treated cat bids farewell to a place which has so long been her home You shall often see poor pussy after all the furniture and fixings have been packed in the vans run back and take a walk all round the empty desolate chambers then return and submit herself to be quietly taken off to her new abode On arriving there her very first act will be to make a tour of inspection through every room and corner of the house she will then count the members of the family and if all she loves are present if she gets a drink of milk and especially if there be a good fire she will at once settle down and begin to sing Some time ago a pussy of my acquaintance was condemned to death for taking a slight liberty with the canary in fact she ate him It was certainly very thoughtless of poor puss however she suffered for it although not to the extent that was intended She was confined in a sack with a large stone and sunk in the adjoining river Nothing more was seen or heard of pussy which under the circumstances wasn t considered at all surprising for a fortnight when one evening she walked in and laid herself down before the fire as if nothing had happened Wherever she had been the cat had lived well for she was both plump and sleek Probably on escaping from the river she had thought that a two weeks holiday in the woods would both benefit her health after treatment so rough and give time for the evil impression which her crime had induced to wear off If so she was right for she was received with open arms and freely forgiven and is still alive and well A cat will travel almost incredible distances to regain her home I know of a cat that along with her three kittens was sent in a hamper a long journey across country to a mill where it was intended she should mount guard over the rats Pussy however had no such intention and next morning to the great surprise of the inmates she was found sitting at her own door with one kitten beside her She disappeared that same evening and next morning returned with another kitten In the same manner next night she brought home the third and last and so settled quietly down to rear her family This cat I think showed great determination and a knowledge of country that would have pleased Von Moltke himself Dozens of such anecdotes might be given but I will only trouble the reader with one more There is a river in Scotland called the Spey that I suppose is no news You will also know that this river is celebrated for two things salmon and celerity it being the most rapid river in the kingdom Near this river on one side is the farm of Dandilieth and on the other but four miles distant stands the dwelling house of Knockan Once upon a time then the tenants of Dandilieth were removing to Knockan and after the household furniture was packed on the carts a search was made for the household cat She was found in a corner of the empty house on some straw faithfully nursing her family of three blind kittens A bed was made for her in the lap of one of the children and in due time all arrived safe at Knockan and pussy and her family were duly installed in the new house But pussy was not happy She longed for her old home at Dandilieth and to think with her was to act and this she did to some purpose for on the farmer returning next day to his old place for the purpose of conveying home the farm implements he was astonished to find the cat in her old corner and the three kittens safe beside her Now as the nearest bridge is twenty miles distant it is quite evident that pussy must have swum the Spey five times in a single night three times with a kitten in her mouth to say nothing of the long journeys backwards and forwards between the two farms Although of a nature not so demonstrative as that of the dog still a cat is capable of loving its master or mistress with a love equally strong if not stronger Absence makes the heart grow fonder may certainly be said with regard to pussy Don Juan says a lady is a beautiful dark tabby with back almost black legs ringed like those of a tiger short ears honourably scarred by various encounters with rats stoats et cetera which he has succeeded in killing long tail also ringed with tabby rich tabby shirt around which there are beautiful rings of black and tabby paws with black pads a most loving and lovable old cat Two years ago we left home for a parson s week during which time the house pussy included was in the charge of servants The first sound which met us upon opening the garden gate on our return was a most pitiful scream from poor Juan who recognized our voices and came bounding across the garden to greet us For more than a week he could hardly be persuaded to leave us but spent his time in purring and rubbing round us as though to assure himself of our presence My own cat writes a lady correspondent although greatly petted by its master appears quite wretched whenever I go on a visit After mewing piteously at my door for a day or two it leaves the house often remaining away for weeks but his delight at seeing me the fond rush towards me and his song of joy are very pretty The same lady gives an account of a venerable old tortoise shell puss who goes to sea with its master officer in an East Indiaman and keeps watch with him by night or day in all weathers No wonder he is fond of her I know an instance of a cat that was very strongly attached to a boy When this boy was sent to a distant school pussy after mourning for him several days took to the woods and never returned There is surely strong proof of how deeply a cat loves its owner in the anxiety and sorrow it evinces on seeing that owner in grief or in pain I have an instance of a cat that is extremely attached to a little boy This young gentleman has very great objections to having his nails cut Whenever this necessary operation is being performed he sets up a howling which very speedily brings his faithful playmate pussy to his aid She comes running with all speed and growling in unmistakable anger She jumps on his knee and after giving him one hurried kiss and embrace as much as to say Be of good cheer I shan t let them hurt you she wheels round and stands on the defensive and the nurse has to retire and wait for a better opportunity Another cat is extremely attached to a little girl whom she follows about wherever she goes When the child comes to grief in some of the various ways incidental to early years pussy does all she can in her humble way to pacify and comfort her rubbing herself round her and caressing her and saying Oh oh in the same fond pitying tone she uses to her kittens I was called the other day to see a lady in a hysterical fit and it was most affecting to witness the grief of her poor cat Hearing her mistress s screams she darted into the room and at once threw herself on the lady s breast licking her neck and hands and face in the most passionate manner stopping only occasionally to look about and growl fiercely at me as if I had been the cause of her mistress s illness The following anecdote shows I think in a very marked manner how deeply attached pussy can be to her master and how forgiving is her nature Robert D a young man of nineteen lived in the same house with his mother and sisters He was by no means an exemplary youth In fact if he had had his due the ravens according to Solomon would have made short work with his eyes He had early taken to habits of dissipation and was in the constant custom of bullying his poor mother for money to continue his debauches He must have had some little good in him however for he was fond of his mother s beautiful black cat Not so fond however as pussy was of him for poor thing she never seemed happy save in his company One morning he was leaving his mother s room after an unusually stormy scene when pussy met him at the top of the stair running towards him with a fond cry and singing as she rubbed herself against his leg Curse you he cried and kicked her to the door mat The look the poor cat gave him would have softened a less hard heart in him it only roused the innate devil You re like the rest he shouted and seizing the unhappy puss he dashed her with all his force over the banisters The poor creature was not killed outright but was so severely wounded that she died in three hours Although bleeding all the time and evidently in great pain never a cry escaped her only a low moaning mew For one moment only she brightened up a little when her hard hearted but still loved master came in to see her before she expired She even tried to sing apparently anxious to show she had forgiven him and actually died licking his hands I know the case of an old gentleman who was extremely fond of a very pretty cat he had and pussy loved her master dearly Indeed cats seem always particularly partial to the aged They love to sit beside them at the fireside and soothe them with their low murmuring song for they seem to know by instinct that age is but a second childhood with only the grave beyond The gentleman in question died at an advanced age Every one missed and mourned him but none so sincerely as pussy She never sung again and nothing could induce her to leave his sitting room She would sit and gaze for hours at the vacant arm chair as if she couldn t understand why her eyes no longer beheld him she loved This went on for a fortnight then one morning poor pussy was found lying stiff and dead on the hearth rug She had died of grief I may close this chapter with another similar instance of pussy s affection for a kind master He was an old fiddler who dwelt all alone in a cottage on a moor He had lived to see friend after friend laid under the sod and now he had none on earth to care for him Ah yes he had one friend his cat This little pet cheered him in many a lonely hour and when sickness came at last she never left his bedside Then he died She sat like a dazed creature as she saw him lifted and placed in his coffin and she followed the loved remains to their long home and saw where they laid him She never left that churchyard living For three days she sat on the grave and it would have made your heart bleed reader to have heard her pitiful cries Oh she seemed to say to every passerby he is here my master is here with all this load of earth on his breast Will no one come and help me On a cold sleety morning in November she was found stretched on the grave in a hole she had scraped dead Has this gentle and affectionate creature met her master Is there no hereafter for pussy The sun of her sinless life set in sorrow Alas for love if this be all And nought beyond an earth

none	none	A gentleman tells me that he once possessed a cat that made a regular habit of swimming across the river almost daily for the purpose of killing birds in a wood on the opposite side 
8758_291168_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Gibbey was a fine large brindled Tom 
8758_291168_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He was a noted fisherman and a daring and reckless poacher so much so that the gamekeepers threatened to kill him whenever they could catch him 
8758_291168_000011_000002	train-clean-360	They did not mind they said his taking a good clean sea trout occasionally but the beast fished in season and out of season

8758_291168_000011_000004	train-clean-360	When the salmon came up the shallow streams to spawn in thousands all waggling under his very nose and to be had for the mere lifting out he couldn t stand that

8758_291168_000015_000000	train-clean-360	One day when out shooting I met a large white cat

8758_291168_000015_000004	train-clean-360	I hate to be done 
8758_291168_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Five minutes afterwards I was at the cottage door

8758_291168_000030_000003	train-clean-360	She was also great in catching water rats which she seized and killed as eagerly and speedily as any English terrier would 
8758_291168_000031_000000	train-clean-360	But not only can cats swim and fish but they have been known to teach their offspring to do so and a knowledge of the gentle art has been transmitted in some cat families down to the third and fourth generation 
none	none	At the mill of P in Aberdeenshire some years ago there lived a cat an excellent swimmer and fisher and as fond of the water as an Irish spaniel When fishing she did not confine herself to any one portion of the stream and whether deep or shallow it was all one to pussy The boys too of the neighbourhood were not long in finding out that by whatever part of the rivulet they saw the miller s cat watching there they would find trout in greatest abundance 
8758_291168_000033_000000	train-clean-360	This cat not only fished herself but taught her children to do so too The way in which she managed this was very amusing and shows how extremely sagacious feline nature is 
8758_291168_000033_000001	train-clean-360	When the kittens came of sufficient age she would entice them down some fine sunny day to a part of the stream where the water was very clear and shallow 
8758_291168_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Here the smaller trout fry and minnows would be gambolling and making a spring pussy would seize one of these and bring it out alive 
8758_291168_000033_000003	train-clean-360	After letting it jump about for some little time to amuse the kittens and attract their undivided attention she would kill and return it to the stream jumping after it and playing with it in the water to entice a kitten in 
8758_291168_000033_000004	train-clean-360	Thus in course of time the kittens could all swim and fish and rivalled even their mother in quickness and daring 
none	none	If space permitted I could give many more instances of pussy s fishing exploits but I think I have said sufficient to prove that they are not so averse to wet their pumps as some people imagine 
8758_291168_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I have a fine tom kitten which I intend training to catch fish

MUFFIE the mother of Blinks and queen of cats three PRETTY DICK a starling who speaks oftener than he is spoken to four THE OGRE The Author five THEODORE NERO champion Newfoundland six THE CRICKET OF THE HEARTH MEW I The Birth of Blinks The entrance into the world of the immortal hero of the following adventures is veiled in the darkest and most inky obscurity Whence he came or where he had resided previous to his arrival no one can tell All that is positively known about the matter is this I the writer retired to rest about ten by the clock on a cold and sleety night in winter Previous to jumping into bed I as usual locked barred and bolted the door of my room then candle in hand I peeped in below the bed keeked into the cupboard and under the toilet table and even cast an eye up the chimney in order to be certain there were no robbers or midnight assassins concealed in the premises Being satisfied that the only occupants of the room besides myself were Nero Muffie and Pretty Dick I extinguished the candle and crept quietly beneath the sheets Now at that time there was no Blinks Well in the morning like a good old boy I awoke at seven and after rubbing my eyes and untying my flannel night cap I put my hand once more below the bed clothes for I could distinctly feel something moving on my breast I seized and hauled this something forth to the blessed light of day and lo and behold Blinks blind little Blinks Good heavens cried I in astonishment for the windows were fastened the door still closed and the key hole not unreasonably large where in the name of all creation did you come from And Blinks replied in a whisper but I could not catch what he said Now from some concomitant circumstances namely the birth of five kittens on the evening of the same eventful day all of whom were consigned to a watery grave next morning as soon as they had taken breakfast I say from these circumstances I think there can be little doubt but that Blinks is the son of my beloved cat and faithful servant Muffie and that the name of his other parent is and must ever remain a mystery Blinks was a lovely kitten and is a lovelier cat Of the brightest and most varied tortoise shell with stately limbs and bushy curling tail he stalks abroad a very prince among the feline tribes His paws are white as mountain snow and when he presents one to a human friend it feels as soft as the finest velvet But woe be to the mouse or rat or rabbit on whom those paws descend for sharp and deadly are the daggers hidden between those silken toes His ears are long his brow is broad and his eyes beam with intelligence love seems to float in their liquid depths as he purrs to some fair young lady cat but fires of hate and scorn flash from them as he gazes on a feline foe Such is Blinks MEW II Blinks s Eyes When another week had glided slowly away and the earth this world into which Blinks had been so unceremoniously thrust had made seven somersaults and was preparing for the eighth Blinks who was gently reclining in his mother s arms opened his little red mouth and whispered My ma Yes my chee ild Muffie replied When will I get eyes Ever my Ma Yes my chee ild When my Ma On the ninth day my chee ild said Muffie She spoke in a mournful tone of voice for she had not yet ceased to lament the untimely fate of her other five children Oh my eyes cried Blinks not heeding his mother s grief won t it be a jolly lark and straightway he sucked himself to sleep Strange is it not that any mortal creature should sleep without any eyes to sleep with but so it was Blinks slept MEW III Blinks opens his Eyes His first thrilling Adventure The ninth day dawned a day to be big with the fate of the young and innocent Blinks who was on that auspicious morning to open his eyes for the first time on a world that heretofore had been as dark to him as if he had been living in an empty stone bottle with the cork in or like a frog in a buried teapot or like a toad in a stone This day the cork of the bottle so to speak was to be drawn the teapot dug up the stone to be broken He had innocently asked his mamma where the eyes were to come from and she in the beautiful imagery which only Muffie could make use of told him that a wee angel cattie with snowy fur and wings all golden would fly gently down while he slept and hovering over him softly insert a little bright eye on each side of his head and by and by he would awake and see Well the sun rose the bats and the owls all went to roost in haunted castles and lonely groves cocks clapped their wings and crew hedgehogs fell asleep among the dewy grass and weary authors went to bed but Blinks like one of the ten foolish virgins slumbered and slept Why slumbereth our hero Blinks had determined to lie awake the whole of the preceding and eventful night in order to meet the first glimpse of the early dawn with open eyes and study the wonders of nature with his newly acquired sense of sight I say this is what Blinks had determined to do it isn t by any means what he did do for long before the shadows of night had begun to battle with the light of coming morn poor weary Blinks s eyes only half open were sealed in sleep and so he slept far into the day His fond mother had eaten her matutinal meal and lain down again to watch him Nero had had his breakfast and a long walk with his master the starling had been piping and chattering from an early hour carts and cars and carriages had been rolling and rattling past trains had shrieked and puffed and stopped and backed and puffed and gone on again and still Blinks was slumbering A very prolonged scream from an express train awoke him at last however and our young hero sprang to his feet gave a jerk with his brows a nod of his head and behold his eyes like the eyes of Adam and Eve were opened and like Tam o Shanter Vow he saw an unco sight Strange too that at the same moment one of Her Majesty s ships that lay in the bay began to fire a salute of twenty one guns Blinks here bids me say there was nothing strange about it No wonder then that Blinks thought himself lord of the universe and monarch of all he surveyed no wonder a pair of real eyes and a salute of twenty one guns Ho ho Funny looking eyes they were too light grey and glassy and with scarcely any visible pupils or centre bits Blinks stood for a moment evidently in a very undecided frame of mind like one who has too much to do and can t tell where to begin He appeared to be looking very earnestly and inquiringly at nothing in particular and was withal rather shaky about the extremities It was only for a minute however for on turning his head on a pivot his eyes fell on the well pleased and admiring face of his mamma who had paused in the very act of washing her face with a spittle or two that she might gaze on her youthful prodigy So intent indeed was she that she did not even lower the fist she had been licking but sat with it raised in an attitude of such grace and beauty that had it been done in the theatre royal would have brought down the house Now although Blinks had had a long and intimate acquaintance with his mother s honest face it must be remembered that he only knew her by the touch or feel and not having seen her before how should he Blinks be expected to tell who or what she he or it was that now gazed on his face Might it not thought Blinks be some dreadful foe Good heavens might it not be a wild mouse The thought was certainly alarming enough and he determined to at once act on the offensive so as a commencement of hostilities he gave a warlike leap backwards in order as he afterwards remarked to make the spring the more dreadful This backward leap did to be sure cause him to lose his balance Blinks here begs me to substitute the word equilibrium for balance as the latter is not soldier like and reminds him of shop keepers and such Having found his balance Beastly says Blinks who as I write is sitting on and looking over my shoulder beastly English Can t you say regained his centre of gravity you dolt Well well Blinks got on his pins again then was his back erected like unto a Gothic arch on which the hair did bristle like unto a fretful porcupine or a cheap ham his tail was transformed into a miniature bottle brush and from his jaws came a sound intended to be at least awe inspiring but which an impudent author might liken to the striking of a lucifer match All this was but the work of a second and only preparatory to a grand spring a spring which it is needless to say would have resulted in the total demolition of all good looks in the face of his worthy parent But just then struck with admiration at the pluck of her son Muffie burst into a song of praise Blinks listened He closed his eyes and listened again That voice he cried them music it is it is my ma My chee ild my chee ild cried the fond parent and Blinks in the twinkling of of of a little star was encircled by the hairy arms of his dear dam with a tit four in each hand and one in his mouth Then and not till then did pretty Dick say Bravo bravo MEW IV Further Adventures of Blinks After the dreadful adventure related in chapter third exhausted nature coveted nutrition that is Blinks felt thirsty and for the suck seeding succeeding sixty minutes Blinks was busily engaged discussing a dinner of tit bits He wandered from one tit to another and from the other tit to the next and so on to the last and then back again to the first Couldn t he stick to one tit No sirree Blinks would have replied the foremost tits contain butter the next cream the next sweet milk and the last whey My brethren and sistren should have got the whey they should but then my brethren were drowned in the sistren cistern good joke that for a nine days wonder Eh Having at length satisfied the cravings of nature and filled his belly Blinks fainted when he heard this expression and on reviving bade me try again well then having laid up a little store of the lacteal fluid against further claims for sustenance Blinks carefully put aside the skim milk tit as a thing all very good in its way but which a hero two hundred sixteen hours old and with real eyes ought to despise He laid it past and wheeling carefully round on one end stood up staggered for an instant and finally reopened his new organs as wide as he could and stared right in front of him apparently with no very decided intention of what to do or how to do it Just then there fell upon his listening ears he had two one for each eye and was very proud of them too a sound which made him start and turn red so to speak with indignation Was it possible he mused DID his ears deceive him DID he hear a laugh A laugh nay even a sneer a low snigger He gazed steadily in the direction from which the noise seemed to proceed and dang his eyes if it wasn t repeated wantonly repeated daringly done again and evidently the insult was aimed at him for there not many miles away at most were two great round goggle eyes a glowering at him over a book and a horrid great fleshy face all round them with tufts of bristly hairs hanging from the cheeks and a mouth with lips from which again came the sneer the low insulting snigger Now Blinks in the days of his darkness had often heard the same despicable sound and Blinks s mamma called the voice Master What thought he Blinks have a master Blinks the nine days wonder Blinks with two real eyes But dash those same two eyes the thought was slavish No he wouldn t give a suck for himself if he would bear it and then that laugh that snigger come he would at once go on the war path find out this ogre which his mamma the old idgit idiot called master and demolish for ever and crush into the minutest smithereens the mouth that dared to sneer the lips that dared to snigger Dash his eyes if he didn t that was all Walking was difficult though so Blinks continued to muse and talk over a confounded rug too Would his ma kindly take her stupid awkward looking stump of a tail out of his way So ho oh Gently Hang it all With this last exclamation Blinks tumbled off the rug fell three long inches through the air and screamed lustily for his ma My ma my ma roared Blinks My chee ild my chee ild cried his ma I am with thee my chee ild and he was forthwith carried by the nape of his warlike neck to his downy bed and happy thought he would have a drink and then ask his ma to get him a little golden carriage with four white mice as horses and a boy mouse in buttons behind For why He Blinks was never made to walk nor meant to walk nor did he mean to walk for it was mean to walk and he couldn t wouldn t shouldn t So from thinking Blinks came to dreaming then he once more slumbered and slept while his mother sitting over him nodded and sang MEW V The Ogre Blinks Goes Abroad into the World But it was fated that Blinks should not slumber long he was soon awakened by the rattling of plates or to speak more poetically The deafening din of dindling delf The clinking clang of knife and fork As some poor wretch regaled himself On early greens and roasted pork He gazed in the direction of the sound which seemed to him like the noise of fifty bulls and a corresponding number of steam hammers turned loose in a china shop The goggle eyed ogre was feeding himself His huge form was perched aloft on a wooden erection supported by four massive pillars In one hand he held a large knife bigger than Blinks s body in the other he grasped a mighty trident and our hero gazed in mute and mewless astonishment at the immense shovelfuls of mash and the tremendous lumps of sodden flesh the gigantic monster made disappear down his maw and the oceans of coloured water that went gurgling down his gullet Then began Blinks to reason with himself and commune with his own thoughts after the following fashion The world must be rid of such a monster the Herculean labour must fall on him Blinks Would he flinch No Perish the thought And then had he better slay the ogre at once and mingle his blood with his Irish stew or wait until he had gorged himself The latter plan after much deliberation our young and hairy hero determined to adopt for and because no doubt and to wit in all probability after the ogre had eaten his fill he would give a grunt like a satisfied mother sow give a grunt tumble down in a corner and sleep for a fortnight and Blinks swore by every hair in his Blinks s whiskers he never again should wake in this world His mind being now fully made up Blinks carefully washed his face using up two spittles for that purpose He had thought of having a bath but then that would have taken time and ten spittles and he was in a hurry and deliberating had dried his mouth He then lowered himself gently over the edge of the rug and for the first time in his life stood alone in the world Many and varied were the sensations that stole over his innocent mind as he stood for a moment to gaze wonderingly admiringly around him The words of Byron came to his lips And now I m in the world alone And eating kitchen fee five Why should I not the butter bone For the d l a mouse I see Now said Blinks I will go abroad upon the surface of the earth and walk about to and fro like a roaring lion seeking whom I may devour My chee ild my chee ild cried his fond and doating dam from the rug Your grandmother answered the irreverent son Stay oh stay exclaimed his sorrowing parent catching a fly and swallowing it in her anguish Stay my too sensitive chee ild and recline your little head on this here hairy bosom Which is much too hot to be happy said Blinks Oh stay with me continued Muffie Will you not be the prop of my declining years Never a prop quo Blinks Then said the parent I myself abroad shall go But Blinks was off crying Not for Joe MEW VI A Terrible Sight Carefully advancing one foot a time our young hero slowly made his way across what appeared to him an interminable desert The ground was soft and mossy and here and there clusters of mighty pillars which he afterwards found were called chair legs towered skywards He passed a great many strange things and heard a great many strange sounds that he could not tell the meaning of at last he arrived at the foot of a tall iron wall the fender round which he waddled for many a feline mile but finding no gate at which to knock he resolved to scale the barrier and solve the mystery So he raised himself on his hind legs thinking at the same time how handy hind legs were and how happy he was to possess such appendages then he gazed over the wall The sight that was presented to him would have turned a hero less brave into whinstone But Blinks was Blinks It appeared to be a great blazing volcano surrounded or rather ribbed in by gigantic bars of steel in fact it looked like a small bad place in which he had no doubt the souls of dogs and the gizzards of birds were getting purified of their sins On the top thereof was a mighty cauldron and the steam therefrom rose in dense clouds and disappeared in the blackness of darkness and there was much smoke and flame and a loud spluttering noise accompanied by hissing and crackling And lo even as he gazed a mighty ball of fire was thrown out by a small and ugly fiend that dwelt below the cauldron in the midst of the ardent element and the ball of fire fell within a whisker length of our gallant Blinks who just then remembered that he was getting thirsty and could spare time to gaze no longer So after casting one defiant glance at the ugly little fiend that crouched beneath the cauldron he left the little Hades and journeyed on in quest of adventures MEW VII The Cricket of the Hearth Pretty Dick Blinks had not travelled many legs leagues till he was met by a very funny little ill shaped gentleman He was like a very wee mahogany table but not much bigger than Blinks s mamma s red nose if it had been a mahogany table and he had two big nippers hanging down in front of him and Blinks observed that he also had too small black eyes like the points of as many needles and very shiny they were and altogether very knowing and wicked looking Blinks stopped and the little mahogany gentleman laid a dead fly on the ground and did the same Ho ho mister Fluff said the latter looking up at Blinks with one eye and shutting the other as if he had no immediate use for it and thought that one was enough for the occasion Ho ho mister Fluff so you re learning to crawl are you Eh Does your mother know you re out Eh Blinks was highly indignant at this style of address and also at being called Fluff so he replied with considerable dignity I am not Fluff sir I am Blinks Blinks sir and I may inform you sir that my maternal relative is entirely cognisant of my being abroad sir Blinks are you said the little fellow not at all abashed Blinks He he he a pretty Blinks you are Let me see you And the small brown gentleman commenced running round him so quickly that Blinks in trying to wheel on a pivot fairly rolled over on his back and the man of mahogany was forced to hold his sides with laughing He he he e he laughed and Ha ha haa a and Ho ho hoo o and then He he hee e again and then Oh dear he cried I shall split and the tears ran out of his needle points and down over his nose and nippers To say that Blinks was angry would but poorly describe the torrent of wrath that raged within his youthful breast After carefully gathering himself up again he confronted the wee brown gent and Sir cried Blinks imp or devil tell me who you are and where you dwell and should it even be in yonder evil place beneath yon horrid cauldron a friend of mine shall wait upon you in the morning I said the mahogany one drawing himself up to his full height which was not much after all I sir I am sir the cricket of the hearth sir the cricket of the hearth sir and I have a good mind to pull your nose sir here he shook one pair of his immense nippers and the nose sir here he shook his other pair of nippers of the ignorant old lady your mother who allows her fluffy fools of children to trespass upon and insult grown gentlemen on their own policies The little gent would have added much more but just then he was interrupted by a loud voice apparently in the air making the remark Bravo br r ravo bravo And looking up Blinks espied a very large bird perched on a high wooden erection the cricket of the hearth was observed to turn very pale at the same time I say he turned pale and he also turned tail and muttering Fire and fury made off as fast as six legs could carry him I ll fluff you cried Blinks and was about to give chase when the bird alighted on the ground in front of him and almost at the same time the cricket disappeared as suddenly as if he had vanished from the face of the earth and indeed that is precisely what he had done Why said Blinks what has become of our little mahogany friend This question he put to the bird who was now standing in a very ludicrous attitude with his head and neck all awry and a big swelling or lump in his throat as if he had been improperly hanged Did you hear me said Blinks as the bird made no immediate answer and appeared slightly convulsed Ca can t you see said Pretty Dick for it was no other and he spoke with great difficulty can t you see I m chic chu choking at last getting out the word and straightening his neck at the same time I ate him bravo Pretty Dick whew whew whew and he burst into the Sprig of Shillelah and finished off with two bars of Duncan Gray Good heavens cried Blinks standing aghast did you real you don t mean to say that you positively swallowed him you know Positively damme said the bird Tse tse tse whew whew whew hurra hurra hurra Bravo Dick He is now engaged turning over the stones in my gizzard and counting them I fear I am two or three short After that job is finished I shall bring him up again break him in pieces and eat him properly Whew whew whew Bravo Dick Sugar snails and brandy Tse tse tse Monstrous said Blinks Is the darling starling pretty snails Sir said Blinks Yes said Dick I thought you spoke said Blinks Oh no said the bird I often talk to myself What is that between your toes So saying the bird hopped up to Blinks and separating his toes with his beak in a very rude manner he gazed between them Don t do that again if you please said Blinks Certainly not if you desire it Cock a doodle doo sugar and brandy pretty darling but what is that in your nostril Sugar snails And before our hero was aware the starling s bill was inserted opened like the toes of a compass and the nose of poor Blinks nearly torn open This was too much of a good thing and Blinks aimed a cuff and fired a lucifer match at the bird causing that gentleman to spring quickly backwards and ejaculate Hurrah hurrah you rascal Love is the soul of a nate Irish snail you rogue After which he brought up the poor cricket again and he glad to see day light again said Thank you sir and was moving off No you don t now said the bird seizing him by the hindermost leg How many stones in my gizzard you unhappy little wretch Mercy mercy cried the cricket I entirely forget Then down you go again said the starling and down the cricket went Blinks stood gazing horror stricken when the bird piping a few bars of a tune wheeled suddenly round and made a determined effort to compass out Blinks s eye Is that an eye said he as if he didn t know Rather said Blinks a little proudly Then give us a bit cried Dick Chickey chick chick whew w w whew whew Snails and brandy Pretty starling bravo Do you know said Blinks it strikes me you re a fool No I ain t said the bird only a foolosopher always gay you know Love is the soul of a darling pretty starling but I say you know you and I will be excellent friends and you shall play in my cage and I will give you sugar snails and brandy Quack quack quack Don t be frightened it s only my fun and now I must be off master will want me to sing to him after dinner He has just finished his sucking pig he plays the fiddle and I sing Just fly up with me on the table but oh I forgot you awkward creature digging Blinks in the ribs you haven t the vestige of a wing well my master The ogre said Blinks Bravo cried the bird just you call him an ogre and he will soon have a new string to his fiddle What do you mean inquired Blinks Why said the starling he has a pretty little box called a violin filled with the souls of defunct cats your brothers and sisters are all there and their insides are made into strings and stretched all over and when he tickles the strings with a hair they all cauterwaul Master sings and pretty Dickie sings Chick chick chick chirl chirl chirl But snails and brandy I m off And away flew the beautiful bird who was all shiny with black and blue and silver and Blinks sat for quite a long time gazing up after him with his lack lustre eyes and then getting to his feet he commenced walking homewards musing on all the strange things he had seen and heard MEW VIII Terrible Adventure with a hairy Snake Blinks s ma lived away in a corner on a rug of large dimensions and he had a very long way to walk over the trackless plain over the pathless desert over the bounding prairie and night too was beginning to creep down and Blinks thought he could perceive enemies lurking in every corner and monsters hiding in every shade so that had he been anything less than Blinks he would certainly have thought it worth while being afraid but being Blinks he marched bravely on only just by way of caution he gave an occasional glance over his right shoulder then one over his left then one behind all the while keeping a sharp look out ahead Happening to look round to his astonishment he beheld something like a snake with its head reared high in the air apparently following his every footstep This caused Blinks to quicken his pace He soon looked round again The creature whatever it was was still there waving its head from side to side and evidently looking at Blinks with all its might although never an eye it had at all that he could see Then thinks Blinks I ll spring smartly round and seize it No sooner said than done and brave Blinks jumped suddenly about and attempted to catch the snake which was twice as tall as himself and covered with hair by the throat But the creature was too wide awake and when Blinks turned round so did it So round and round spun Blinks and round and round went the hairy serpent and always kept directly in our hero s rear when he stopped it stopped and when he went round again it went round again At long last poor Blinks began to feel dizzy but he was much too brave to think of giving in till finally he tumbled on his back and then the snake peeped up between his hind legs that is Blinks s hind legs for serpents never have hind legs by any chance Ho ho says Blinks mister Sea snake I ll have ye now without any more going about the bush So saying he caught the creature by the end just where his eyes would have been had he had any he caught it and bit it and as he did so Blinks himself uttered a sharp cry of pain and bit the snake again and then cried again and licked the part of the snake he had bitten tenderly with his tongue this went on with great vigour for a length of time At last Blinks desisted and Well I m jiggered says he if it isn t a part of myself I ve been a running from and a fighting with and a chewing at all the time How provoking and I don t know any bad words else wouldn t I swear Memo to make my ma teach me to say bad words Bravo Brr r ravo cried pretty Dick who perched on a stool had been watching all the performance with singular interest Bravo yourself cried Blinks indignantly but he felt very foolish nevertheless And that was how Blinks came to the knowledge that he possessed that very useful and ornamental appendage called a tail and that extremity was ever afterwards viewed by him with great interest and treated with the utmost respect Blinks conducting himself with conscious pride and dignity as behoves an animal of the feline persuasion who is possessed of two eyes and is followed about wherever he goes by a living moving gracefully waving tail MEW IX Daring ascent of a Volcanic Mountain After another half hour s walk Blinks arrived at the foot of a great black mountain all covered with rank black grass The mountain had much the resemblance of a huge lion couchant Seems a long way to walk round said our hero I ll even go over and I ll get a fine view of the surrounding country from the top So saying Blinks mentally girded up his loins and began to climb It was very steep and very high and he had to pause many times to take breath but he cast no longing lingering look behind that wasn t his nature So he muttered Excelsior putting a great emphasis on the r which is the pet letter of the feline race After much toil and trouble he stood on the highest peak of Mount Black and saint Mary what a scene burst upon his astonished eyes The sun had gone down behind the distant window frame but the ogre had just lighted two moons and placed them conveniently on the end of brass pipes for which kind action Blinks postponed his execution sine die Everything was thus rendered nearly as bright as day As far as his eye could reach nothing was visible but the flowery prairie the ogre s legs and the great beams supporting the universe The view was bounded by flowery walls which he doubted not was the end of the world while far away in a corner the well pleased and foolishly affectionate looking face of his mamma looked up from her rug She spied her son even at that distance and turned up the white of her breast to lure him down The old idiot said Blinks to himself how can she be so ridiculous and unromantic Would Livingstone s mamma do that to her son if she espied him far away on the Peak of Teneriffe No Blinks was gazing skywards and thinking that if he were spared to return to his native rug he would write a book that would astonish the weak nerves of the tea guzzling universe and beat all creation when he began to fancy he could hear a low rumbling noise beneath his feet and perceive a slight heaving motion in the body of the mountain He bent down and listened Yes there it was there could not be a doubt of either fact and terrible thought he stood on the summit of a living volcano But he did not fear nay he even caught himself singing for joy but in a moment his joy was turned to very particular grief and his wonder to something as nearly akin to fear as the heart of a Blinks could beat time to For says Blinks isn t it rising I am Isn t it bigger and bigger the mountain is getting There was no longer any question of it at all and Blinks hurried down the side of the mountain as fast as four legs could carry him but judge if you can of his astonishment to find that the hill itself had four legs as well as he himself had so that unless he could manage to creep down one of these he would have to leap through the sky down down down to the vast plain below For a moment only he stopped to think to bring all the wonderful powers of his great mind to bear upon the terrible situation but just then his deliberation was brought to a speedy conclusion for wonderful to relate the whole head of the hill turned about and looked him directly in the face with a pair of eyes as big so thought he as fish ponds while at the same time a great cold nose was thrust right beneath him and he was hurled headlong to the plain below and the volcanic mountain which cats jealous of the immortality of Blinks have since averred was nothing else but the ogre s large dog Nero shook itself and walked away to the other end of the boundless prairie And Blinks confessed many days afterwards that at that moment though by no means afraid he would not have undertaken to say whether his head or heels were uppermost After all no wonder for at that precise moment Blinks lay on his back and the world consequently had an up side down look about it MEW X The Ogre The Baptism of Blinks It might have been thought that the trials and adventures of Blinks were now at an end for one day but no he had still another to add to the list He had come through fire and earth and air he was now to come through water One other weary mile he had yet to wander ere he could lay his war worn head on his mother s breast and this mile he was engaged placing behind him when suddenly and ere he was aware a gigantic hand was laid upon him and he was carried swiftly through space wheeled quickly round and immediately found himself face to face with horror of horrors the ogre Ho ho my little gentleman so spoke the ogre you ve been and gone and got a couple of peepers that is what the ogre termed Blinks s eyes such desecration of terms can scarcely be credited but it is indeed true a couple of peepers queer blue grey blinkers they are too so so you must be baptized then It may be observed here that although our hero had got a name the ceremony of baptism had not yet taken place The ogre then pronounced these remarkable words swinging our little hero through the immensity of space at every word and finally plunging him feline fathoms below water in a dark wooden bound lake of murky water bucket In the name of your father and your mother and your sister and your brother who all made a living in the software line I baptize you Blinks Down down down did the ogre plunge Blinks and the

none	none	See Note O Addenda HUNTING EXPLOITS 
8758_291170_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Catching mice is to a proper minded cat a mere parlour pastime only to be resorted to on rainy days or of a night when too restless to sleep 
8758_291170_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It stands to pussy in the same relation that indoor croquet billiards or reading a book in bed does to our noble selves 
8758_291170_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Rat catching is only just one degree better and principally enjoyed by cats who have not reached maturity in body and intellect cats in fact in their hobble de hoy hood 
none	none	To the matured cat especially if highly bred belong all the joys and excitement of the chase a field 
8758_291170_000004_000004	train-clean-360	There is as much difference between the hunting of an animal of the cat kind and that of one of the canine order as there is between the skilled tactics of German warfare and the wild rush to battle of Arab cavalry 
8758_291170_000004_000005	train-clean-360	There is more honesty in the one more craft and cunning in the other 
8758_291170_000004_000006	train-clean-360	A dog is singularly destitute in what is called in Scotland canniness He also wants patience but the cat armed with this gift combined with cunning and skill gained from experience is master for anything in the field which she considers game and chooses to square her moustache at 
none	none	Even to a human being stalking one s prey is infinitely more engrossing than the mere hunting of it 
8758_291170_000004_000008	train-clean-360	The latter is pleasing certainly but the former is charming 
8758_291170_000004_000009	train-clean-360	Pussy prefers the charming while our friend the dog merely runs down his prey and takes little pains to show skill even in that 
8758_291170_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Leaving rats and mice along with blue bottle flies in the category of mere kitten s play pussy s game list includes hares rabbits stoats weasels water rats and moles besides everything that flies or has feathers from the humble household sparrow to the black cock of the mountain 
none	none	Not before a cat reaches maturity viz three years of age does the propensity for out door hunting become a passion with her but once imbued with it the desire never leaves her as long as she can run Pirnie is a little female pussy belonging to a labouring man 
8758_291170_000006_000001	train-clean-360	At the time I write she is over twenty years old but hale and hearty and as playful as a kitten 
none	none	She is a perfect adept at catching all sorts of vermin but more particularly goes in for mole catching 
8758_291170_000006_000003	train-clean-360	When she spies a mole hill she at once sets herself down to watch it nor will she raise the siege for hours until the little gentleman in velvet gives signs of his presence by casting up a few grains of earth 
8758_291170_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Then is pussy s opportunity She springs nimbly on the bank and plunges her arms up to the shoulders into the earth and never fails to bring poor molie to bank and the daylight has hardly had time to dazzle his eyes before he is dead 
none	none	Last year Pirnie being then nineteen years of age had a thrilling adventure with a large hare The hare which was at least double the size of pussy had been enjoying a quiet nap during the heat of the day in a field not far from the house when Pirnie stumbled across its trail and on following it up the battle ensued
8758_291170_000007_000002	train-clean-360	 The hare says my informant fought with great vigour and often floored her antagonist but Pirnie sent in her claws and teeth till blood flew like rain and fur like drift driven snow and the hare soon becoming exhausted Pirnie seized it by the throat and its plaintive screams were presently hushed in death 
none	none	Graysie was a tom cat and rather famous for his hunting exploits One day Graysie being on the war path encountered a very large weasel and it was at once mutually agreed to try conclusions in a fair stand up fight 
8758_291170_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The battle was witnessed by Graysie s owners and lasted the greater part of the afternoon and ended triumphantly for pussy in the defeat and death of the weasel 
none	none	When Graysie found out that his fallen foe was indeed dead he took it up in his teeth and carrying it home deposited it on the front door steps intending it no doubt as a present for his mistress as well as a trophy of his own prowess 
8758_291170_000009_000000	train-clean-360	A cat never springs on her prey unless sure of catching it and her aim is most unerring 
none	none	I know a cat that killed over a score of large rats in one day and on one of these she sprang from a height of no less than twelve feet 
8758_291170_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I counted one day no less than three hundred fifty mice which a cat had killed single handed at the removal of a rick of oats in a farmer s yard 
8758_291170_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He was a fine noble red tabby and it was quite a sight to see the surprising strength and agility with which he worked 
8758_291170_000010_000002	train-clean-360	He killed most of them with his paws seldom putting a tooth in one 
none	none	Every time there was a lull in the flow of vermin he took the opportunity of clearing the ground of the slain which he carried to a convenient distance and placed all together in a heap When all was over to see honest Tom set himself down in front of this heap of carnage and thoughtfully and complacently contemplate his bloody handiwork would have been a study for the great Landseer himself But not one of his slain victims did Tom eat 
8758_291170_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Indeed high bred cats seldom care to eat mice unless they are very hungry they much prefer fish to anything else and the flesh of birds they consider a greater luxury than even that of rabbits 
none	none	Solomon or Habakkuk or Nebuchadnezzar or some great Hebrew authority says Coneys are a feeble folk Doubtless they were so in those days and taken singly so they are in our day but combinedly they are powerful indeed as many a poor ruined farmer can testify 
8758_291170_000011_000001	train-clean-360	They are very wise too and this wisdom is especially displayed in the number of doors they have in each of their dwellings so that should an enemy in the shape of a pussy or a ferret pop in at one door Bunny would just pop out at the other 
none	none	I knew a cat in the Isle of Man she had no tail worth mentioning who used to make this very habit of the rabbits a means of securing her prey She used to enter one hole suddenly and as suddenly reappear stern first 
8758_291170_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Of course Bunny by this time was scampering off to the opposite hole and there at the door pussy would nab him just as he came out 
8758_291170_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Cats almost invariably bring home their prey to be either leisurely eaten given to their kittens or presented to their owners 
8758_291170_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A man in Banffshire rented a small farm from a game preserving laird 
8758_291170_000013_000001	train-clean-360	This man was ruined by rabbits and turned out of house and home by them 
8758_291170_000013_000002	train-clean-360	They first ate up all his oats his grass and turnips so that only potatoes could be grown on the place 
none	none	By and by they took to eating the stems of even those as soon as they appeared above ground so that all the poor man s live stock was reduced to one in number namely a big tabby cat This cat throve upon the foe 
8758_291170_000013_000004	train-clean-360	She also took a few youthful prisoners whom she brought home to play with and amuse a fine family of kittens which she had in the cottage garret 
8758_291170_000013_000005	train-clean-360	These young rabbits lived and grew and burrowed and made nests in the thatch 
8758_291170_000013_000006	train-clean-360	It was the awful row this happy family used to make every night which first led to the discovery 
8758_291170_000013_000007	train-clean-360	When the farmer found out one night the cause of the disturbance he came down and awakened his wife and 
8758_291170_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Jane said he and he looked almost sublime as he stood on the cold damp floor with a penny candle in one hand in rather scanty shirt tails and red Kilmarnock night cap he was a study for a Rembrandt Jane I ve been a duffer too long 
none	none	Those rascally rabbits they ve eaten up everything we have out of doors now they ve stormed and taken our castle By and by they ll eat the bed from under us then they ll eat ourselves but Jane to morrow morning I m off this he said self sacrificingly I m off Jane to the lands of America And the good people went leaving pussy and the feeble folks in undisputed possession of house and farm 
8758_291170_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Gamekeepers do all they can to destroy the life of poor pussy by setting traps for and shooting her wherever met 
8758_291170_000015_000001	train-clean-360	But some cats come to know all about the treacherous wires and how to avoid them 
8758_291170_000015_000002	train-clean-360	They know too that hares and rabbits often fall into these snares and accordingly they turn this knowledge to good account and when they find a half strangled animal in the gin they quietly despatch and if possible carry it home 
8758_291170_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Cats are great enemies to birds in the breeding season but it is surprising with what terrible fierceness even the smallest birds will defend their nests from the inroads of predatory cats whose evil intentions are thus often frustrated 
none	none	Pussy has many enemies to contend with on the hunting ground 
8758_291170_000018_000000	train-clean-360	A poacher the other day was returning home in the grey light of early morning when he observed a large fox coming in his direction with what the man took to be a hare over his shoulder 
8758_291170_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The man fired and Reynard dropped 
8758_291170_000018_000002	train-clean-360	His burden was a fine large cat 
none	none	Poor pussy had been promising herself a nice plump rabbit for breakfast the fox thought he should like a fine healthy cat for a change
8758_291170_000018_000004	train-clean-360	 There s many a slip twixt the cup and the lip and the poacher s gun brought matters to quite a different conclusion 
none	none	I know a case of a cat that returned from hunting with two moderate sized but full grown rats in her mouth and both alive and staring 
8758_291170_000019_000001	train-clean-360	They were no doubt sitting cheek by jowl when pussy made the spring 
8758_291170_000020_000000	train-clean-360	If I tell the reader of a cat that is so clever that she can catch swallows on the wing I suppose I may be allowed to close this chapter in peace 
none	none	It does seem a little yankee doodlish I confess but it is nevertheless a fact 
8758_291170_000021_000000	train-clean-360	At the foot of a certain post master s garden flows a stream in which his cat takes many a good salmon trout 
none	none	This stream is spanned by an old fashioned turf covered tree bridge without any parapet 
8758_291170_000021_000002	train-clean-360	On this bridge crouches this sagacious cat and often secures a swallow as it skims out from under 
none	none	That s all CHAPTER XVII See Note P Addenda COCK JOCK AND THE CAT Cock Jock as he was called was the most famous of a famous breed of cocks our family had possessed for many years Descended from the black cock of the mountain with plumage like jet save one bright spot of crimson and gold on each wing short stout legs and strongest of spurs he had never met his match in field or pit Many a brave but unfortunate bird he had stood upon and crowed over as he trampled out its last breath I am speaking of twenty years ago when cock fighting in private was still a favourite pastime with many otherwise sensible and honourable men in the far north of Scotland Cock Jock possessed in the highest degree all those princely and chivalrous qualities for which animals of his species and breed are so justly celebrated He was a perfect gentleman after his own fashion He never would touch a morsel of food himself until every member of his large harem had filled her crop and thus his own share was at times small enough If two hens quarrelled and had recourse to their nebs he used to peck them both time about until they desisted he then gave them a sound rating pointing out to them in forcible language the extreme impropriety of such conduct among ladies of a well regulated harem Cock Jock went to roost every night with his old mother how beautiful is filial piety on one side of him and a large white hen his pet wife on the other Then he always crowed at the proper time and place never under any circumstance would he mistake moonlight for morning as some foolish brutes do Dogs he especially disliked He used to steal a march upon them pretend to be busy eating till he turned their flank then before the poor dog could say wow he had two inches of spur in each hip and that tickled him He was very affectionate and tame enough to eat from your hand but if you dared to go near or molest a hen he would assuredly lame you for a month Once upon a time when a little bantam cock was sick Jock never went to roost for weeks but took the bantam to a nest and nursed it under his wings as a hen would a chicken and tenderly fed it daily till it grew well again I knew a great deal of what that cock said for the language of the lower animals is by no means difficult to understand His remarks had reference principally to his food its quantity and quality his wives their virtues and vices and to his battles He always backed himself to win He used to ask every human stranger he met in a manner not at all calculated to give offence if he mightn t have just one shy at your shins He one day offered me a snail He came a long distance out of his way too to give it to me He offered me the delicious tit bit with much ceremonious tick tucking and in quite a patronizing manner as if like old King Thingummy I had advertised for a new pleasure and he was about to introduce me to it I m sure I hurt his feelings by refusing it But I couldn t help it I think I could eat a snail now if hard pushed although I am told they taste a little green But after one has lived on Navy weevils for many years one isn t so particular but I was very young then I remember a gentleman s satin hat being blown off near to his cockship I wouldn t have been that hat on any consideration Heavens how he battered it and tugged at it and tore it finally he jumped on it and crew over it and at the owner Twenty shillings cried that unfortunate thrown to the winds Curse the cock Jock looked at him as much as to say Perhaps sir you would like to come a little nearer and repeat that expression But the gentleman didn t He preferred going home bare headed I one day met a poor woman carrying a large stuffed cock Like the cheeky brat they called me I induced her to come and show the thing to Jock She did so Jock very soon laid bare the bird stuffer s art Cotton wool and wires and all went to leeward Jock had never met with so curious a foe in his life before and he treated him accordingly My father came Jock crew The woman wept and I ran and hid One fine summer s day my sister left a pillow in the garden We were all in the parlour Presently it came on to snow apparently and the room got darkened We soon discovered that it was not snow flakes but feathers My father said In the name of all creation My mother put on her glasses and remarked Every good thing attend us Then we all took umbrellas and went out When half choked we reached the garden we discovered a clue to the mystery Cock Jock had spied the pillow and could not resist having one kick at it One kick led to another and when the eider down began to come out Jock lost his temper and went at it with a will He had some extra animal energy to expend that morning and he did it so successfully too that for a whole week never a bit of work was done about the place The horses had a holiday and we had cold mutton every day the servants being all engaged culling the feathers from the grass and trees and picking the fluff from the flowers Now to Cock Jock was granted the honour of walking about wherever he pleased a privilege which was denied to the members of his harem and it was on the garden walk the battle took place which I am about to describe Gibbey my father s famous red Tom tabby had a saucer of milk on the foot path with which although he did not drink it himself he did not choose that any one else should meddle The cat and the cock had always been on friendly terms till now and being thirsty and presuming on this friendship Cock Jock walked half apologetically up to the saucer and dipping his beak in to fill it raised his head to swallow it It was just as his eyes were thus turned heavenward that Master Gibbey sprang up he was always too ready with his hands and without taking his gloves off struck honest Jock a sound slap on the ear The cock shook his head but knowing he was in the wrong he did not get angry yet but attempted to reason with the cat For Cock Jock had this peculiarity he never lost temper at the first blow from any creature he thought he was a match for A strange bantam and we all know how plucky and self important they are once alighted on Jock s dung hill and immediately struck at him Avast heaving my little friend said the big cock or words to that effect you must be aware that I could knock you into the minutest smithereens in the twinkling of a foretop sail Oho thought the bantam you re afraid are you take one for your nob then and he struck him again Hang it all you know roared Jock now fairly enraged He gave the bantam one blow and where that bird was sent to has never been ascertained to this day never a feather of him being found And so Jock attempted to reason with the cat Cock a ro ra kuk What does this mean Master Gilbert I own to having been in the wrong but a blow sir a blow He hadn t long to wait for another either this time without the gloves and then as the Yankees say his dander riz The cock hopped nimbly over the saucer and the battle began in earnest Cock Jock showered his blows like wintry rain But pussy adroitly avoided them all and returned them with such practised precision and skill that the poor cock s pretty head was soon a mass of blood and gore Jock getting confused held his head ground wards as if fighting with another cock instead of a cat thus giving Gibbey all the advantage The fight had now lasted fully five minutes and as yet pussy rejoiced in a whole skin I was beginning to think it was all up with the cock when crunch the advantage came at last one stroke with that murderous spur and Gibbey was stretched among the flowers to all appearance dead Cock Jock bent cautiously down examined him first with one eye then with another and then apparently satisfied he jumped on his side and crew loud and long But Gibbey did not die He was out of the sick list in four days but he ever after gave the cock a wide berth and plenty of sea room Poor Cock Jock he died at last on the field of battle His life was literally trodden out of him by a band of hostile turkeys Superior weight did it CHAPTER XVIII See Note Q Addenda NURSING VAGARIES

none	none	These are curious examples of mistaken affection and may be put down to a species of feline mania somewhat analogous to that which is sometimes though rarely seen in human beings Women enceinte have often curious tastes as witness the lady whom nothing would please but a bite of a baker s shoulder 
8605_291172_000004_000003	train-clean-360	She had the bite and was satisfied 
8605_291172_000004_000004	train-clean-360	We trust the baker was

none	none	A lady of my acquaintance she was a savage and lived in Lamoo on the East Coast of Africa had twins a very little baby boy and a big fat baby girl I saw her some days after squatting in front of her bamboo hut and singing low to her little son

8605_291172_000009_000000	train-clean-360	A gentleman the other day had a very nice fox terrier bitch

8605_291172_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I know of another similar instance where a cat was house mate with a rather valuable bitch this bitch brought forth a litter of seven pups The cat had five kittens at the same time

8605_291172_000011_000000	train-clean-360	One day she gave birth to her kittens in an out house and at once leaving them to shift for themselves she entered the dwelling house and insisted on giving suck to the dog of her first adoption

8605_291172_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The mother was of a quiet domesticated turn of mind and preferred fire side enjoyments to out of door sports but the daughter was quite the reverse

8605_291172_000014_000001	train-clean-360	There being no chance of finding homes for so many they were all drowned with the exception of three

8605_291172_000014_000003	train-clean-360	No one cat they thought could nurse and suckle ten kits and it was equally evident that three kittens did not require the services of two cats 
none	none	So they concluded that the best plan would be to put the shattered remains of the two families Your one kitty missus Tom and my two together in one bed and take turn about in nursing them 
8605_291172_000014_000005	train-clean-360	This was accordingly done and turned out to be a very satisfactory arrangement for all parties concerned for either cat could now go abroad when she pleased happy in the thought that nothing could go wrong at home 
8605_291172_000015_000000	train-clean-360	NURSING A HARE A certain carpenter whom I knew had a cat which in due season as all cats will produced a litter of kittens which very cruel and thoughtless was the action were all drowned 
none	none	Poor pussy mourned her offspring for many days but she was a female philosopher that may seem a paradox but she was so she communed with herself on her bed at night thus My inhuman master has most unfeelingly slain all my pretty little babes and has not left me one but he cannot dry up the fountains of a mother s love with which my heart runs o er besides I m taking the milk fever But behold day is gently breaking 
8605_291172_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I ll seek the mountain and be it what it may I ll have something to love something to suckle me 
none	none	That day she found or more probably stole a fine young hare which she nursed and reared as tenderly as if it had been one of her own kittens 
8605_291172_000018_000000	train-clean-360	NURSING SQUIRRELS This is by no means uncommon in cats 
none	none	They will rear them either along with their own kittens or by themselves and a very pretty sight it is to see 
8605_291172_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Squirrels thus reared make most delightful little pets 
8605_291172_000019_000000	train-clean-360	NURSING CHICKENS I know several instances of cats supplying the place of their lost kittens with a chicken 
8605_291172_000019_000001	train-clean-360	One cat for example had had all her offspring it was her first litter drowned she went at once out into the court yard where a hen was gathering crumbs to a large brood of chickens 
8605_291172_000019_000002	train-clean-360	One of these pussy watching her chance sprang upon and seized by the neck and although hotly pursued by the enraged mother managed to reach the house in safety and went straight to her own bed 
none	none	Here she deposited the chicken and lying down beside it commenced to sing clearly intimating that she wished her little adopted one to have a drink But unfortunately chickie s mouth wasn t adapted for sucking but it cowered beside her for warmth and as there were plenty of crumbs on the kitchen floor it did not want 
8605_291172_000019_000004	train-clean-360	So it became a sort of household pet and when not eating it was always cuddling down beside its funny foster mother 
8605_291172_000019_000005	train-clean-360	I may mention here that next time this same cat had kittens they were all drowned again but this time she did a wiser thing She found out that a cat belonging to one of the neighbours was the happy mother of three kittens which she had been allowed to keep 
8605_291172_000019_000006	train-clean-360	Off goes puss to this neighbour s house and having thrashed the mother to begin with she kidnapped and carried home one of her family 
8605_291172_000019_000007	train-clean-360	Several times was the kitten taken back and each time pussy went and stole it again and as she never failed to give the other cat a preliminary hiding it was at last deemed most prudent to let her retain it 
8605_291172_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Miss G is an old maid and a great lover of cats and poultry 
8605_291172_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Once she had a cat nursing a litter of kittens and one of the chickens in the yard being rather deformed and not thriving Miss G brought it and flung it to the cat thinking it would be a great treat to her 
none	none	It was a treat to her though hardly in the way she expected for pussy commenced licking it all over and forthwith adopted it and nursed it along with her kittens She continued to do so until it grew into a large leggy and withal rather ungainly hen and the most ridiculous part of the business was that if at any time Tuckie longed for the society of her feathered fellow creatures pussy went after her like a shot and seizing her by the neck lugged her back into the house and jumped with her into Miss G s bed where her kittens were 
8605_291172_000021_000000	train-clean-360	A gentleman in New Deer also possessed a cat who reared a chicken to hen hood 
8605_291172_000021_000001	train-clean-360	In this case the adopted chicken was nursed alone pussy s kittens having been drowned 
none	none	This fowl s neck was actually crooked with the cat s carrying her about so much in her mouth so she always held her head very much to one side and was upon the whole a very ugly hen 
8605_291172_000021_000003	train-clean-360	We see then that chicken rearing by cats does not give that amount of satisfaction which is desired 
8605_291172_000021_000004	train-clean-360	It might pay though if they could do the hatching but cats at present cannot be taught to sit upon eggs 
none	none	There is no saying what the future may bring forth though for a much more gifted animal will be the coming cat

8605_291172_000023_000000	train-clean-360	NURSING HEDGEHOGS Yes three of those thorny little things were actually nursed suckled and reared lately by a cat belonging to a gentleman who is very fond of trying experiments of this sort 
none	none	When they grew up and were in good feather they were very tricky and funny but pussy soon found out that they didn t stand correction well If she lifted a paw to them pooh they were transformed into three round prickly balls before the blow fell and pussy s paw had the worst of it Then the poor cat would look sulkily from one little ball to another and turning about walk off in disgust 
8605_291172_000023_000004	train-clean-360	But three pairs of bright beady eyes were keeking at her from among the thorns and before she had reached the fender the little pigs were all unfolded and after her at the galop 
none	none	Round would wheel the cat and up would roll the hogs again then pussy would seat herself in front and keep them thus for an hour at a time by gently tapping each ball as it attempted to unroll itself 
8605_291172_000024_000000	train-clean-360	SUCKLING RATS Some years ago there was a cat in Scotland who when three of her kittens were drowned supplied their place by bringing in three young rats to make up the number 
none	none	She must have known something of arithmetic too for when one of the little rats died she went out and carried in another still to have the number five 
8605_291172_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But still another died and probably she could not find any more for she contented herself with nursing and tending the two remaining ones along with her own two kittens 
8605_291172_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I never heard what eventually became of the rats 
8605_291172_000024_000004	train-clean-360	I don t think she would have eaten them 
8605_291172_000024_000005	train-clean-360	More probably they lived and grew and went back as missionaries to their own people 
none	none	CHAPTER XIX See Note R Addenda PUSSY S PLAYMATES I have already shown in former chapters how loving and affectionate pussy is towards her master and mistress and how thoughtful and kind a mother she is But to her playmates also she is ever gentle and true whether that playmate be another cat or an animal of quite a distinct breed I have never known a cat cement a friendship with any creature without such friendship lasting till death How very wrong then to accuse pussy of being treacherous With almost any animal that happens to be domesticated about the same house a cat will strike up a friendship and will be ready at any time to fight for it and protect it from harm It is quite a common thing to see a cat amusing itself playing with rabbits or guinea pigs at hide and seek among the bushes or on the lawn There is often a distinct understanding between some old horse or cow about the place I have known a cat live entirely in the stable and invariably go to sleep on a particular horse s back the horse in his turn used to welcome her with a fond neigh when she came home at night In a village in the Highlands of Scotland where I resided there was a crow a very very old bald headed crow used to come morning and evening for many months and sit on the fence opposite until I threw him a slice of bread or a cold boiled potato One morning I was surprised on opening the door to find the old Bird o freedom as I called him standing on the step Instead of flying away he hopped past me into the room and perching himself on the fender looked so knowingly first at me and then at the fire that for the life of me I could not help thinking about Poe s raven and shuddering fully expecting the bird would presently say Nevermore If he could have spoken I am sure he would have addressed me something after this fashion Doctor you re something of an animal fancier and I know you re not a bad hearted chap on the whole Now the fact is I m feeling rather poorly and the forest winds are cold of a night besides I m not so young as I have been I m nigh on ninety lad so I intend for my few remaining days to take my pick in a homely way at your fireside The cat won t bite will she In fact Muffie had fully made up her mind to turn him out of doors there and then and with that hospitable intention was now approaching him But Bird o freedom opened his mouth and gave vent to two such caws as nearly shook the house I never heard any bird have such lungs Muffie was fairly startled and scampered off with her tail in the air but in a few days the cat and he were as thick as thieves In truth Bird o freedom was a thief at least as far as eggs went If he spied one in the cupboard he watched his chance and when it came one dig laid the egg open and next second the contents were down his throat with one almighty gulp I allowed him two eggs a day but he would not take them if I offered them to him or before my face I had to lay them one by one in the cupboard and give him the pleasure of stealing them Muffie was never better pleased than when he was eating and she sat and sang to him while he drank the milk from her saucer Then she would sit and sleep cheek by jowl with him for hours A cat with whom Muffie had never had any words before once looked into the room Muffie drove her out with terrible suddenness and thrashed her properly outside the door When the candles were lit in the long winter evenings Bird o freedom perched upon the fender used to look up at me so slyly and yet so solemnly with one wicked eye that I used to doubt whether he wasn t the devil entirely and fly to my fiddle to dispel the thoughts The poor crow had a fit one morning and died on his back on the hearth rug and when he was dead the cat was chief mourner She went about for days searching for her lost favourite and mourning all the while for her grief was really sincere Tabby writes a lady to me had been poisoned Shortly before her death we had her brought upstairs and laid down on the rug in front of the fire she was very ill and unable to lift her head Tom came bouncing as usual into the room and sitting down beside her with his paw playfully patted her on the face but getting no response it actually then seemed as if he understood how serious the case really was because with the same paw he gently raised her head up a little and kindly licked her all over It was very affecting and was more than we expected from him but certainly he got great credit for the good deed and ever after had the character of being the warmest hearted of cats and poor Tabby died in his arms Every one knows what a warm friendship will often spring up between a cat and a dog both resident in the same house How they will sleep in each other s arms eat together fight for one another how generous the dog is towards any weaknesses she may display and how grateful pussy is in return They will have their little tiffs occasionally of course I have seen my cat jump on the piano stool more than once in order to slap Master Nero in the face upon which the dog swearing like the British in Flanders hauled her off and rubbed her well on the carpet but did not really hurt her THE CZAR AND WHISKEY Whiskey in this case does not mean something to drink It was the name and a very appropriate name it was of a little Scotch terrier who lived in a village in the far north of Scotland In the same house with him dwelt the Czar this was a large bluish black cat who was said to have been imported from Russia hence his name No two animals in the world could have loved each other more devotedly than did the Czar and little Whiskey And Whiskey was the gamest of the game yet he never showed his teeth to his feline friend From the same dish they took their meals Whiskey merely premising that he should have all the bones They were together all day save when Whiskey s duty to his master called him away and at night they shared the same couch the Czar fondly taking Whiskey in his arms because he was the biggest I m not sure indeed whether the Czar did not waken Whiskey when that little gentleman took the nightmare However they were as loving as loving could be And once or twice every week this kindly couple used to go out hunting together They did not care for game laws and heeded not the keepers they were a law unto themselves On these occasions they used to go out together in the morning and after spending all the long day among the hills and woods they invariably came home before dark This coming home before nightfall was doubtless a suggestion of Whiskey s for a dog can neither see so well in the dark as a cat nor can his constitution so well withstand the dews of night But the very fact of the Czar s keeping early hours to please Whiskey is another proof of how he loved him And almost every night these sons of Nimrod brought home with them some trophy from the hunting ground Sometimes it was a rabbit more often a bird if the latter Whiskey generally had the honour of carrying it and very proud he was of the distinction if a rabbit the Czar bore the burden And so things went on till one mournful night poor Whiskey came home later than usual and all alone He came in but lay down on the door mat out of which he would not budge an inch He refused his porridge and all consolation and lay there in a listening attitude starting up every minute at the slightest sound His mistress went to bed and left him It must have been long past midnight when Whiskey came dashing into his mistress s bedroom knocking over a chair in his hurry and barking wildly as he dashed hither and thither like a mad thing When his mistress got up at last poor little Whiskey preceded her to the door barking and looking very anxious and excited A pitiful mew was heard and on the lady opening the door in rushed Czar the cat on three legs he had left the other in a trap Nothing could exceed the kindness of Whiskey to his wounded playmate He threw himself down beside her on the rug whining and crying with grief and gently licked her bleeding stump And every day for weeks did Whiskey apply hot fomentations with his soft wee tongue to pussy s leg till it was entirely healed But they had no more romping together in the fields and woods for the Czar s hunting days were over in this world at least CHAPTER XX See Note S Addenda PUSSY AND THE HARE In the parish of P Aberdeenshire there lived some years ago a crofter and his wife and a little boy their only son A fine she tabby cat who nightly sang duets with the kettle to welcome the master home was the only other member of the family One day while roaming over the moorland in search of birds nests the boy found a young hare sound asleep among the heather Such a prize was worth any number of birds eggs and the lad carried it tenderly home and presented it to his mother and it was that night placed in a box in the cow byre Next morning it was gone puss had eaten it no doubt and no one could blame her Pussy had had kittens only a day or two before and they had all been drowned For about a week after the disappearance of the hare it was observed that pussy was not so regular in her attendance on the house as usual She never lay by the fire the kettle might sing its duets by itself she ate her meals hurriedly and greedily and then escaped out It s the hare she ate that s no agreeing wi her said the goodman There s mair in it than that said the canny goodwife and with a woman s instinct she followed pussy out and up into the hay loft and lo and behold there lay the cat in a snug little bed suckling the lost hare and singing as sweetly as a linnet Pussy reared the hare and they became inseparables At breakfast pussy always waited until the hare had finished and when there happened to be broth for dinner a dish the hare did not relish the cat never failed to beg for a piece of bread which she carried at once to her strange foster child The cat and hare went everywhere together sometimes indeed they might be seen fully a mile from home This cat was a famous hunter and always brought her dead rabbits home It was funny at times to see the pair coming from the fields at even the cat with her dead quarry in her mouth creeping stealthily along her eyes in every direction and the big hare rather out of breath bringing up the rear and looking very foolish as if he didn t exactly know what it all meant and rather deprecated the cat s conduct than otherwise This cat could fish for one day a gentleman hooked a large salmon in the river and after running it for nearly two hours his line broke and he lost it Now this salmon was found next morning on the cottar s door step The cat and hare were both present and as there is no account on record of hares fishing we think the credit of the capture must be given to pussy For two years this strangely matched couple were friends and bosom companions for they slept together But one fine summer s day they were lying in front of the house half asleep in the sunshine the hare at one side of the door pussy at the other and the cottar s wife knitting between them The whole scene was one of peas and might have remained so only tragedy in the shape of farmer Dick s big disreputable collie was at that precise moment peeping round a corner and taking stock Hullo said the dog to himself it s a no it isn t yes it is hang me if it isn t a hare as cheeky as you like too I ll teach him And he did The poor hare never required another lesson Nor did pussy lose any time in giving the dog one Rendered frantic by her poor friend s death she sprang on his back and tore him with tooth and nail One of the dog s eyes was entirely destroyed and it need not be added he ever after gave that house a wide berth After the untimely fate of her foster child pussy was extremely disconsolate moping about and never caring to leave the house She had not long to mourn for him however for some months after she fell a victim to her own curiosity for like women cats are extremely prying The cottar s wife was one day melting some tallow in a large tea pot which after using she left by the fire side and that night when every one was in bed pussy who had been dying all day to know what was inside that tea pot pirled off the lid and popped her imprudent head in Alas she never got it out again About midnight the honest couple snug in bed were awakened by a dreadful clattering noise in the kitchen along the passage and on the stair Geordie Geordie rise and see said the good wife nudging her goodman Jean Jean rise and see yersel said he nudging her in turn It s Hallow E en Geordie cried Jean and there is a deil or deils rather in the house I ken For the reader must bear in mind that though banished from English soil fairies bogles and all that ilk still linger among the breckans of our Scottish glades and glens and annually on the night of thirty first October they play a thousand pranks under the direct supervision of the archfiend himself This superstition proved fatal to poor puss Gradually the noise got less and soon ceased entirely Next morning the cottar s wife was up betimes and downstairs She soon returned wringing her hands and weeping bitterly Oh Geordie she cried come doon and see what the deil has done to our poor pussy CHAPTER XXI See Note T Addenda THE MILLER S FRIEND A TALE You might have travelled many a long summer s day and not met with such another The very look of him was enough to dispel all ideas of hunger he was so big and so stout yet withal so rosy and hardy His voice had a cheery ring with it which combined with the merry twinkle in his eye set you on good terms with yourself at once if indeed it did not make you laugh outright As for his laugh to hear it once was to remember it for ever It was hearty it was musical in pitch something between the Ha ha ha and the HO HO HO and it rang through the old mill wakening a dozen sleeping echoes and causing the old bulldog to bark although that quadruped had to lean against a pillar to perform the feat The miller wasn t a young man by any means but though he had no wife he was the jolliest widower ever you saw albeit his hair and whiskers were like the powdery snow But his voice ay that was the bit you should have heard it rising in song snatches and rolling high over the double bass of the grinding wheels and the shrill clack clack of that merry old mill He was honest moreover No one in the parish had ever been heard to accuse him of giving light weight or adding sand to the meal to make it turn the scale sooner And as a matter of course he was a general favourite especially among the farmer s daughters and servant maids so much so indeed that all round the country it became the general custom to take meal by the stone instead of by the bushel that the errands to the mill might be all the more frequent And indeed however dull a lass might be when she was going to the mill she never left it without a rosier blush on her bonnie cheek and a smile playing around her lips as she trundled cheerily along with her bag upon her head Yes indeed had he wanted a wife the miller might have married the youngest of them all Such was the miller and such too were the race he sprang from they were in the habit of getting young again just at the age that other folks began to get old They were in their prime at eighty and never thought of departing this life until the dial shadow of their existence began to creep near the hundred Then all at once it used to strike Old Death that he had forgotten all about them so he would lift his scythe and cut them down smartly and suddenly And as the miller was jolly so everything about that old mill was jolly too There was music in the mill lead as the waters leapt joyously from under the sluice and hurried along to their task and the great wheel itself as it turned slowly and steadily round seemed actually bursting with suppressed merriment Then you should have seen the sweet little bit of scenery the mill was set down in Ah English tourists have yet to learn that there is one part of Scotland yet unhackneyed yet uncockneyed yet unspoiled but still romantic enough to repay a journey from London town The mill was built by the banks of the wimpling Don built in a dingle green rolling braes sloping up at one side steep rocks on the other and the river here broad and fordable rippling between On the top of the rocks waved a tall pine forest some of the trees hung by their roots over the cliff just as the storm had left them Twas sweet in summertime to hear the birds singing in that forest or to see the crimson glow of sunset glimmering through the branches but how tall and dark and weirdly looked those trees as they stretched their branches up into the green frosty sky of a quiet winter s gloaming To my friend the miller this wood had an especial attraction for within its shade he had wooed his first his early love If you had scaled the little foot path that struggled up through the rocks at the place where they were less precipitous and finally gained the cliff just at the point where Snuffie Sandy tumbled over in the dark and broke his neck you would have come to a little foot path that went windingly away among the tall solemn Scotch pines to the roots of which the sun never penetrated even at noon and whose massive trunks might have been mistaken in the sombre light for the pillars in some gigantic cavern Onward for a quarter of an hour and you would suddenly have found yourself in a clearing in the midst of the forest This clearing was fully a square mile in extent and was tastefully laid out as a little farm neat cottage and garden barnyard field and fence and all complete as snug a little place as you could wish to see Owing to its situation there was quite an understanding between the domestic animals and the denizens of the surrounding wood In summertime the hare and the rabbit browsed peacefully beside the cows and the sheep the birds came regularly to the latter for a supply of wool to line their nests the hens and ducks shared their oats amicably with the wild pigeons and old Dobbin the horse who used to be tethered among the clover didn t mind the crows a bit they used his back as a sort of moving hustings on which to debate politics or have an occasional stand up fight and when Dobbin lay down to rest they lovingly picked his teeth And everything immediately around the cottage was as natty and neat as the little farm itself The greenest of garden gates led you into the sprucest of little gardens the box was neatly trimmed never a blade of grass grew on the gravel and although there were not many flowers it did one s heart good in early spring to see the blue and yellow crocuses peeping through the dun earth and the sweet scented primrose discs diamonded with dew reclining on the delicate green of their tender leaves There was a rustic porch around the cottage door it was formed of the unbarked stems of the spruce fir tree with just an inch of branch left on for effect and the door itself boasted of a brass knocker bright enough to shave at and had you knocked and been invited ben to the best parlour you would have found everything there too both trig and trim There was nothing either on the mantle piece or on the walls to offend your feelings There were no hideous ornaments or foxy lithographs but shells and grass and moss and a few modest engravings and photo s of friends Instead of a chiffonier there was a neat chest of drawers and instead of a piano a spinning wheel At this latter Nannie when not milking or attending to household matters sat birring all day long making music which if not operatic was at least natural and suited Nannie and pleased the cat to a nicety Nannie of course was the presiding goddess of the cottage and farm The place was all her own She kept a man and a laddie to do the out work and a tidy bit of a girl to assist her in doors Nannie from all accounts must have been alarmingly near forty though she looked a full dozen of years younger and beautiful for even that age beautiful in regularity of features in just sufficient colour and in a lack of all coarseness Taking her figure and all combined you would have said that if not a lady she was at least born to adorn a higher sphere She had never been married but didn t look an old maid by any means For Nannie had had her little history And merry and cheerful as she always was during the day still when the day s duties were over and she had retired to her little chamber after she had read her chapter and psalm and sat down to muse there would come a strange sad look in her eyes and at times a tear stood there as she took from her pocket a portrait and a lock of dark brown hair And that portrait on which she grazed so fondly although the face was younger was the miller s his too though different in colour that lock of hair tied with blue that seemed to cling caressingly around poor Nannie s finger For the miller and she had loved each other all their lives long Oh their story is quite a common one a lover s quarrel a harsh word and a silent parting that was all And the miller had gone off in a pet and married a woman double his age The marriage was as uncongenial as snow in summer but now though his wife had been long in her grave the miller though he knew he could get forgiveness at once from Nannie never went to ask it feeling he had erred too deeply to deserve it So they had lived for years those two loving hearts with only the dark pine forest and the broad river between them One dark Christmas morning the miller was astir long before his usual time for there was more to do than he could well manage There was barley to prepare for Christmas broth and meal for Christmas brose so long before the sun had dreamt of getting out of bed he had hauled up the sluice The waters rushed headlong on towards the great mill wheel the great mill wheel turned slowly round and suddenly the old mill previously as silent and dark as the grave itself became instinct with life and sound It was a good quarter of a mile walk from the mill dam sluice to the mill Hundreds of times he had gone the road before but on this particular morning somehow or other the miller felt peculiarly nervous It was so dark and everything was so still and being Christmas morning what more likely than that he should see a ghost He tried to sing but for once in his life he failed and he felt quite a sense of relief when the farmer s cocks awoke and began hallooing to each other all over the country So in no enviable frame of mind he reached the mill and opened the door The old dog came to meet him and he struck a light and shaking off for a time his superstitious fears he donned a dusty coat and set to work in earnest First there was the corn to spread upon the kiln That done he went below to put a match to the kiln fire which was already laid In this furnace it was not coals that were burned nor wood either but the outside husks of the oats themselves what are called in Scotland shealings This made a roaring fire and was easily lit All was darkness when the miller went down but he soon had both light and heat Indeed from the latter he was fain to stand back and so leaning on his shovel as he contemplated his work with the firelight playing around his handsome face and figure and the darkness behind him he would have formed no mean study for a painter But suddenly the spade dropped from his grasp his face turned pale pale as it never would be again until death set his seal on it and the perspiration stood in big drops on his brow while his frightened gaze was riveted on the furnace before him He had seen a face in the fire apparently that of a demon what else could it be black and unearthly looking with white teeth and green glaring eyes it showed but a moment and disappeared again in the smoke beneath the kiln For a few seconds which seemed like ages he stood there transfixed then again that awful face in the blaze and this time a horrid yell which seemed to rend the very mill and something sprang wildly from the furnace sprung at him over him through him somehow or anyhow the miller could not tell he had tumbled down in a dead faint Daylight was just coming in when he awoke The fire was black out and the mill still grinding away at nothing in particular Outside the snow lay on the ground to a depth of several inches it was no wonder then that the poor miller began to shiver as soon as he gathered himself up He shivered and when he thought of that terrible apparition he shuddered as well as shivered An awfu visitation he muttered to himself a truly awfu visitation on a Christmas morning and he began to wonder what he had ever done to deserve it He went over his whole life honest man it had been anything but a chequered or eventful one and finally came to the conclusion that it must be a judgment on him for forsaking his early love Poor lonely Nannie he sighed as he dragged himself wearily away to begin his work The miller was a steady sober man but he did feel glad when visitors began to arrive at the mill and being Christmas morning bring a bottle with them But he could not find exhilaration in the whisky no nor consolation either He simply could not get warm only his face seemed to glow and there was a weight at his heart as if he had swallowed one of his own millstones When at last the day wore over and he found himself at home he thought he had never felt so tired in his life before His decent old body of a housekeeper marked how ill he looked and insisted on putting him to bed at once with a bottle of hot water an extra blanket and a basin of gruel Next day the miller was in a raging fever and for many weeks he seemed only hovering between life and death missus Fowler as his housekeeper was called could not have been more kind to him if he had been her own son But one day she said to herself as she looked upon his poor worn face I see I canna cure him and the man will die if assistance doesna come soon I ll try it I ll try it What the trying it had reference to we shall soon see missus Fowler put on her Sunday s gown and bonnet put on her scarlet shawl and her sable boa and telling the miller she would soon return went out into the keen January air and took her way to the bridge that spanned the rapid Don For the good lady was far too old to try the ford or climb the rocks or trust herself in the dark little footpath that led through the forest to Nannie s house She arrived there in good time for all that Nannie was spinning but strange to say she was always glad to see missus Fowler So she put aside the reel and bustled about to get tea ready And is he getting any better asked Nannie at length referring to the miller The question was asked in seemingly a half careless tone but none knew but herself how her heart was beating all the while Na na poor man said Janet for that was her maiden name he is no long for this world Nannie had turned away her head and buried her face in her hands Presently she was sobbing like a child Janet spoke not Oh cried poor Nannie I must I shall see him before he dies Then Janet spoke And God in heaven bless you my bonnie bairn for those words for you re the only one in this weary world that can save his life No but said Nannie if he really is going to live you know I a Oh the inconsistency of women A moment before and she would have given all she possessed in the world for one glance of the loved face now because he was going to live oh dear But Janet hastened to tell her all the story how in his wild delirium he had spoke of no one raved of no one save her and now that the fever had subsided and left him weak as a baby how he always led the subject on to Nannie his early love their rambles in the pine forest and his cruel desertion of her and how he always wound up with the melancholy reflection that he knew poor Nannie would forgive him when she saw him being carried to his lang hame And so well did Janet represent the whole matter and argue her case that Nannie gave her consent to go along with her even then And she laughed and cried at the same time in quite a hysterical way as she said Well Mistress Fowler he he he you know best and he he if you really think it will do the poor man good I ll go and but oh Mistress Fowler I must have a cry And she did And it really seemed to do her good for she smiled quite calm and happy like afterwards the heightened flush in her cheeks making her look ten times prettier and she was soon dressed and ready to march Just as she was going out however her countenance fell and Oh Mistress Fowler my poor cat cried Nannie Your cat said Janet Aye woman my cat replied Nannie come and see the poor darling Somehow or other it got dreadfully burnt about three weeks ago and it isn t better yet come and see That a cat said Janet with uplifted hands and eyes dearie me dearie me In good sooth it might have been taken for a kangaroo or anything else you liked There wasn t a hair on its whole body and although the wounds and scars were healed it was still in a state of prostration and debility It purred kindly however when its mistress gently stroked it showing how fully it appreciated her kindness You ll even take the poor thing wi you Nannie said old Janet Three whole hours said the miller to himself as he lay in bed and looked up at the old fashioned eight day clock whose melancholy ticking had been his only solace since Janet left three whole hours and she promised she would be back in one Presently big flakes of snow began to fall slowly ground wards and the poor man s spirits seemed to fall along with them It was so gloomy being all alone in the still house the very fire had forsaken him and he shivered as he gazed out into the fast closing winter s day He remembered how different had been his feelings one evening long long ago when he had stood with her by his side looking upwards through the maze of snow flakes how they had crept closer together from the cold and sworn to be for ever near each other Ah that lost love He was sure he was dying even now and how dreadful he thought it was to die all alone He wondered if she would feel sorry when she heard of his death And then he slept a nasty fitful starting sleep with painful racking dreams now he was climbing interminable precipices every moment ready to fall now he was walking over long trackless moors that would never never have an end and now he was toiling at the mill with wheels wheels all around him and horrid shapes with brown skinny arms that tried to clutch and pull him down among the dark grinding machinery then he screamed or tried to scream and at once his dream took another form He seemed to be lying in his own room and could hear the ticking of the old clock but it was no longer dark and dismal the blinds were drawn the lamp was lit a cheerful fire burned on the clean swept hearth and the kettle sang on the hob and ah blissful vision there beside the bed sat Nannie his Nannie as he had seen her years and years ago a bright blush was on her cheek and her bonnie eyes were bent on his face with so sad a look The miller held his breath lest the vision should vanish into darkness Oh oh cried poor Nannie he doesn t know me he doesn t know me and she hid her face on his breast and sobbed aloud Now he knew it was no dream He stretched out his arms but it had all come so suddenly everything seemed to swim before his eyes and his head sank like lead on the pillow He had fainted When he opened his eyes again it was only to meet once more Nannie s loving anxious gaze he could only smile as he pressed her hand and fell into a sleep sweeter than he had slept since childhood Well may the poet call sleep Nature s sweet restorer But there is something more important than even sleep itself and without which refreshing sleep can never come happiness and contentment Psychics or mental treatment is not now overlooked by medical men as it used to be and if ever the philosopher s stone or the secret of making men immortal be found it will be through this science It was far into the middle of next day before the miller awoke He felt a sensation of happiness at his heart even before he opened his eyes or remembered the cause The cause indeed was just then busy getting ready his breakfast It was a clear frosty day outside with the sky ever so bright and blue and the whole landscape white with dry powdery snow and inside everything was as neat as new pins How pretty and home like Nannie looked bustling about with her peachy cheeks and her nut brown hair It was quite refreshing to look at her at least so the miller thought and he gave a big double shuffle sigh like what a child does when it is just finishing a good cry Oh you re awake are you said Nannie going to the bedside and taking his hot hand between her cold little palms I ve been keeking at you from under the coverlit for mair than an hour said the miller honestly And what made ye come Nannie I heard you were dying John Oh bless you bless you poor lassie it is mair than kind it s what only an angel would do But if ye knew what I ve suffered a these lang lang years I do know John Janet has told me everything And bye gones are bye gones and I m forgiven Bye gones are bye gones John and you re forgiven Nannie said the miller emphatically that wee deevilock imp that lap oot at me through the kiln fire was a saint I ll be sworn It s here said Nannie Eh said John somewhat nervously Here continued Nannie and she held up the cat which had been sleeping cosily at the miller s feet all the night Dear me dear me said the invalid Well well and the deevilock was a cat your cat after all Well Nannie it s no bonnie but Lord bless it give me it till I take it into my bosom Pussy purring was duly deposited under the bed clothes and then Nannie enjoined her patient not to talk any more But she added you do feel better don t you Better Nannie quo John if I had any mortal thing on besides my sark I would rise this vera minute and dance the reel o Bogie It was a treat to John to see Nannie infusing the tea in Janet s best brown stone it was a treat to see her kneeling there making the toast and then putting on the butter and crushing the hard edges with the knife and seaming it across and across that the butter might find its way to the interior and it was a treat to see the way she placed the little table at his pillow side and spread a clean white towel over the tray that held the plates for the toast and the pot with the fragrant tea But when she placed her own cup on the same tray and sat down beside him John was indeed a happy man and scarcely a mouthful could he swallow for looking at her although she had cut the tender juicy steak into the most tempting tiny morsels that ever were seen Now although the miller began to revive from the very day that Nannie first became his gentle nurse still he had a hard tussle for his life and the winter s snow had melted the ploughed fields dotted here and there with sacks of golden grain were changing from black to brown in the spring sunshine ere leaning on Nannie s arm he could take even a short walk It was wonderful though the amount of good even that first little outing did him It seemed to put new life into his veins to see the buds coming out on the trees the grass turning green and the sturdy farmers busy scattering the corn with the reverend looking rooks in swallowtail coats religiously following at their heels Oh bless you it was the worms not the grain they were gobbling up To the upper moorland the peewits had returned and the curlew was mingling his shrill scream with their laughing voices and of course there was the lark up yonder in heaven s blue all a quiver with song and ever and anon cocking his head and giving another look down to see if that hussy of a hen of his who couldn t sing a stave to save her life was duly appreciating his efforts to amuse her Well then if I tell you that the soft spring wind was blowing balmily from the south west as properly educated spring winds always ought to and do blow you will not marvel that when the miller at last sought the house there was a brighter look in his eye and that the roses of returning health had already begun to bud on his cheeks Old Janet met him in the door and noted this Ay my lad she said with a cheery nod you ll live yet awhile That same evening Janet beckoned Nannie into her own room and having closed the door Now she said my dear lassie I m just going to tell you you ve done your duty like a Christian Wi the blessing of God ye hae saved John s life You think he is really out of danger then asked Nannie anxiously He ll be in danger lang eno if you bide ony mair wi him answered Janet with Scottish bluntness Ye ll even gang home the morn my lass and I ll make John himsel come over and thank you for a you ve done for him as soon as he can walk as far and mark my words he won t let that be lang So next morning Nannie took her departure back to her little farm in the pine forest But pussy had no such intention She had quite recovered the effects of her late incineration and had got a complete new coat of the silkiest fur Besides she had taken quite a fancy to the miller for here again cats are like women allow them to nurse and attend you when ill and they are sure to love you There were water rats to catch in the dam mice in the mill and plenty of trout in the mill lead and this cat was madly fond of sport so she stayed Nannie was right about the miller s recovery Every day he extended his walk a little farther and by and by was quite able to superintend matters at the mill Well one fine morning when the country side was busy laying down the turnips John dressed in his best with a smart cane in his hand for the day was to be big with his fate took the road and shaped his course for Nannie s farm Mind you all the time that Nannie was nursing him John never breathed a word of his love for her or his hopes for the future he was much too honourable to take so unfair an advantage Nannie was busy in her little garden and either the pleasure of meeting the miller or the excitement of labour had flushed her cheeks and made her look very pretty indeed I just came over to help you with the garden a bit said John the hypocrite for thanks to you Nannie I m just as strong as a young colt So they worked in the garden most industriously all day just like a second edition of Adam and Eve and at sunset Nannie set out to convoy the miller through the pine wood Now although they had both been chattering all day like a couple of magpies neither now had a word to say Nevertheless they took the path as if by instinct that led down into the hazel copse that overlooked the wimpling Don There were yellow primroses growing here and wild sorrel and a mossy bank and on this our lovers sat Ah said John it does seem strange but this is the very spot where we parted years ago and in anger dear lassie Nannie was silent You ll marry me now won t you continued John A soft warm hand placed in his was the reply a wee mouth held up to kiss and a face all wet with tears What little fools women are to be sure In the first harvest moon the miller and she were married There was a wedding breakfast a wedding dinner ay and a wedding ball To this latter came all the flower of the country it was held in the old mill and began as early as six in the evening Never before in the country side had such a rant been seen or heard tell of There were three small fiddles and a blind bass besides a clarionet and a squinting fifer what do you think of that for music And there were four and twenty sweetie wives seven round the door with baskets full to the brim and they were all sold out before morning think of that Now the English reader has little notion how important a personage a sweetie wife is at a country ball The sweeties are made up in little ornamented sixpenny bags and to these a young man treats his partner after a dance so you may tell how any girl is appreciated by the number of bags of sweeties in her possession Highest of all is the belle of the ball herself a lovely and stately girl who will only dance with men with beards and who has so many bags that her pockets will hold no more so she keeps dealing them out with a queenly hand to her plainer and less fair friends Then there are stars of lesser magnitude with enough but none to spare and minor constellations with perhaps a dozen bags and there are ten bag beauties and seven bag beauties and five bag beauties three bag beauties and beauties with never a bag at all who have only been thought worthy of getting their sweeties in loose handfuls Ay that was a ball The miller had given orders that the lads and lasses should dance the day light in and that not even a sweetie wife should go home sober Then hey how the fiddlers played Hey how the dancers danced and hey how the sweeties flew And when during a lull the miller himself and his pretty wife came in to dance one reel just for fashion sake oh dear wasn t the floor quickly filled The fiddlers played as they hadn t played yet and the way the old blind bass screwed his mouth and turned up the whites of his eyes was a caution to see The tune was that rattling old Scotch strathspey The Miller of Drone and you should just have heard the cracking of thumbs and the hooch ing if you had had a single drop of Scottish blood twelve generations removed you would have been on your pins at once But when they came to the reel the hoochs were fired off like pistol shots till they ended in one jubilant hurrah and the rafters rang as the music stopped Then steaming whiskey punch was handed round in bumpers from buckets and all drank the miller s health and the miller s wife s health and long life and happiness and three times three with Highland honours Then the miller and his bride drove off in a real carriage and pair mind you with wedding favours on the horses heads and tassels at their ears oh none of your half and half affairs and eight and forty old shoes from four and twenty old sweetie wives came whistling after them as they rattled round the corner and were lost to view I am in a position to state that John and his Nannie spent a most happy honeymoon in the Highlands of their native land in that most pleasant of all seasons when the bloom still lingers on the heather and the autumn tints are on the trees Years have fled since then but the old mill wheel goes merrily round as in the days of yore and Nannie and John are still alive and likely to live for many a long year And when the miller returns from his labour of an evening to his home in the pine wood there are a clean fireside and a singing kettle to welcome him and better still a little curly haired boy with his mother s eyes and a wee baby girl with its father s dimples and its mother s smile Pussy is getting old but in the long fore nights of winter she loves to play with the little ones on the rug or lull them to sleep with her drowsy purr but when summer days are fine she will follow them far a field and the children gather gowans on the leas and string them into garlands to hang around her neck and at sundown pussy they think must be very tired the good natured cat humours the bairnies fancy and pretends to be nothing short of dead beat and so they carry pussy home ADDENDA NOTE A I deem it fair both to myself and to the reader to supplement my own evidence on the Curiosities of Cat Life by giving the names and addresses of my authorities for those of my anecdotes which may seem to run contrary to the generally received opinions concerning cats at the same time thanking those ladies and gentlemen who have taken so much interest in the progress of this work and expressed themselves willing to vouch for the truth of the incidents herein related by me I have tried to make the anecdotes as readable as possible and as humorous as I know many people think cats a dry subject but in no single instance have the interests of truth been disregarded My anecdotes are what might be called sample anecdotes as I have many hundreds more of the same sort my object being to describe pussy as she really is and thus to gain favour for an animal hitherto understood only by the few and abused by the many And nothing would give me greater pain than the reader to have an idea that my cats are exceptional cats for I distinctly aver that no cat mentioned in this book has either done or suffered anything which any other cat in the kingdom cannot do or suffer INDEX OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES Anderson Alex mister New Fowlis Crieff N B Anderson Jane Miss Old Meldrum Aberdeenshire Bird Miss

and defended from dogs and cats and all comers It was especially observed says mister Ford that she never brought them mice and birds as she always used to do with her kittens Nursing squirrels Every

nightly sleep together on the hearth rug Pussy and the hare from incidents related by mister Tyndal NOTE T The Miller s Friend This is a tale based on fact The cat mentioned in the story was twice nearly burned alive in the kiln It was strange that although she took up her abode for a time at the mill she went home to have her kittens When the different members of her family could provide for themselves she went back She was very expert at fishing and catching water rats For the incidents of the story I am indebted to mister Philip The following anecdote was kindly sent me by mister Catto of The People s Journal CURIOUS STORY OF A MONTROSE CAT About five o clock on Friday morning the loud walin of a cat was heard at a door in Castle Street Montrose Mither exclaimed Johnny to his parent that s Tammie at the door Na na said his mother it canna be him for I threw him ower the brig and drooned him a fortnight since Nevertheless the wals became more loud and frequent The good woman became terrified and cried out Oh dinna lat him in Johnny it s his ghost Notwithstanding the terrific appearance of the cat which all who have seen agree in acknowledging as something indescribably horrible Johnny rose cautiously approached the door and with bated breath whispered through the keyhole Is that you Tammie Three mild responsive wals were given Thus encouraged Johnny opened the door and in trotted Tammie hearty and hale How he escaped from the strong ebb tide that was ruthlessly sweeping him away in the dread darkness of the night is a mystery which he has not yet told Perhaps he is reserving it for future publication The narrative will be deeply affecting and on its appearance we shall not hesitate to give copious extracts from it Tammie is not to be drowned again and his mistress thus explains why she made the attempt Weel ye see it s the auld story Tammie is gey good lookin and had ower mony lasses rinnin after him and them and him made sic a disturbance upon the stair that I was determined to get rid o him END OF VOL I Illustration Abissinian The Property of missus CAPTAIN BARRETT LENNARD Brought from Abissinia at the conclusion of the War CATS CHAPTER I eight ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF THE DOMESTIC CAT Gentle Reader I throw myself on your leniency The other day my publisher beckoned me into his private office behind the shop a sanctum chiefly remarkable for the solemn air of dusty gloom and the aristocratic cobwebbiness which prevails in it and says that gentleman to me You must give us a chapter on the origin and antiquity of the D C But I implored I m not writing about the ancestorial cat plague take her It is the history of the present puss with glimpses of the coming cat that I wish to give Never mind said he say something people expect it It will be so dry I continued Then make it all the shorter Heigho it is very like shoving a man forward by the shoulder and asking him to make a speech when he feels that he can t say Bo to a goose or putting a fiddle into one s hand and asking him for a selection from his favourite opera when he isn t in the humour to play when in fact the fiddle feels like a pair of bellows and the bow as heavy as the kitchen poker Origin and antiquity indeed I dreamt about origin and antiquity all night and had origin and antiquity on the brain for a week after However needs must when the devil hem I mean one s publisher drives Determined therefore to write a most learned essay on the origin and antiquity of the D C I ordered a cab one morning and Where for says Cabby and British Museum says I Arrived at the reading room N B I had taken a ream of foolscap with me a box of Gillott s extra fine and my brandy flask filled for this once only with ink I want said I to a man who came at my beck all the books you may have in this little place which may bear reference directly or indirectly to the subject of cats CATS sir I repeated more emphatically because I thought he smiled Bring Herodotus the father of cat history and Lady Cust the mother of ditto bring Jardine and Rueppel and Pennant and Bell also Temminck Lonnini and Hietro dello Valli bring Daubenton the Egyptian and Sulliman the Persian Professor Owen the erudite Darwin and the learned Faust and Mephistopheles too if procurable and look here just throw in a few Russian Hungarian and Turkish authorities and don t forget to bring lexicons to match The man groaned and went for a barrow Half an hour afterwards I was seated at my desk and if ever book man had cause for joy I was that individual The illustrious authorities were piled so high above me that an accident would have resulted in burial alive they were behind me before me I sat upon them and I had them for footstools But still I was not happy I leant my head on the ream of foolscap and tried to compose myself before I composed anything else Presently I was roused from my reverie by hearing some one close alongside of me make the remark Hem hem clearing his throat as if to speak On looking up I beheld on the desk before me the queerest little old man ever I saw in my life Taking him all and all he couldn t have been anything like a yard long His legs not longer nor thicker than sheep shears were encased in silken hose and knee breeches his shrivelled body bedecked in tight fitting velveteens with long hair tied in a cue and worn as a tail while his face looked for all the world like a piece of ancient parchment which had got accidentally wet and been dried before the fire And he sat with one leg crossed over his knee on a folio nearly as big as himself and took snuff Ahem he remarked again take your pen sir and write I hastened to obey merely asking parenthetically On cats On cats was the reply Far away in sunny Greece continued the little man four hundred eighty four years before the birth of Christ and on a beautiful morning when all nature looked fresh and gay a fair and lovely girl might have been seen hastening Ah said I this will be interesting heave round ancient cockalorum Hastening sir for the midwife If the day was bright and fine still more enchanting was the scenery for it was the suburbs of the city of Halicarnassus now called Budron in the province of Caria And that morning exactly at ten o clock was born into the world a sweet little babe afterwards the great and illustrious Herodotus He wrote indeed I may say sang for his whole history is one noble poem of the ancient Medes and Assyrians and of the long line of Persia s kings he sang the wars of Cyrus and told the sad tale of the kingdom of Lydia and he sung the wars of gallant Darius and the Scythians and told of conquering Cambyses and Egypt of the olden time and last but not least sir he wrote on Cats and Cat life Ay sir in Egypt in the good old times pussy had her rights had appreciation had justice If a boy had killed a cat with a stone or a man murdered her with a dog Lynch law would have been had on the very spot Pussy was gently tended cared for and loved even to veneration while alive and after death her little body had the honours of embalmment her virtues were written on monumental tablets and her memory cherished by the bereaved owners until the day of their death In Turkey too and especially in Persia cats have been household pets as far back as man can remember In many places hospitals were built for them something after the style and fashion of your modern cat homes and in so great esteem was she held that bloody riots and war itself were not unfrequently the result of injury done or insult offered to pussy In the quaint but beautiful love songs of ancient Persia so full of splendid imagery do we not often find the poet comparing the bright eyes of his mistress to those of gentle pussy or her winning ways to those of the domestic cat The origin of the D C did you say sir There is the tiger of Bengal which you have seen at a distance preferring no nearer acquaintance There is the tiger cat or spotted leopard of Central Africa which I will do you the justice to say you have shot and there is the kolo kolo of Guiana Isn t insinuated I one kolo enough for a cat It is sir said the little man severely a cat of two colours and a very vicious beast he is besides There is the small serval of Africa and the ocelot all too well known to need a description But from none of all these springs the domestic cat Neither does it descend from the wild cat still common enough in Skye and Sutherland in the mountains of Ireland and spread here and there throughout Europe It must be regarded as quite a distinct species Domestic pussy will at odd times escape to the hills and becoming a nomad breed with the wild cat but the kittens will be found far different both in markings and shape No sir and here the little old man got very much excited and took snuff so vehemently that the tears coursed down his wizened cheeks No I fully believe with the to be immortal Darwin that mankind is descended in a direct line from the oyster And how deliciously said I our forefathers eat with buttered roll and stout The oyster sir he repeated not heeding the interruption and I do unhesitatingly believe that cats sprang in an equally direct line from the mussel The little man then got into such an apparent ravel among hard names and great unspellable authorities that my head again drooped on the desk before me and the next thing I remember is the man not the little old man he had somehow or other mysteriously disappeared touching me gently on the shoulder and giving me to understand that it was time to be moving I did move And I left the reading room as wise if not wiser than when I entered it on the origin and antiquity of the domestic cat CHAPTER II See Note A Addenda CLASSIFICATION AND POINTS As the present work is not by any means intended to partake of the scientific but is written solely with the view of gaining for the domestic cat her proper position in society it will I think serve my purpose better to describe the classification of cats generally adopted at pussy shows instead of dividing them as otherwise they ought to be into the different species and breeds Had I adopted the latter method I should have felt bound to give a minute description of the cats of various countries and climates such as those peculiar to India China Abyssinia Russia and Persia as well as those inhabiting our own land The classification adopted at the Crystal Palace Show and also at Birmingham is with one exception to be mentioned further on as good as any we can at present have The cats are divided into long haired and short haired of both sexes the latter being mostly English the former including the various species of Angora or Persian CLASS I And first on the list comes Tortoiseshell Tom For many a long year this cat was considered a myth and an impossibility and this belief seemed to receive confirmation when at the first Crystal Palace Show no Tortoiseshell Tom put in an appearance He was all there however at the second and people scratched their heads and stared as they looked at him and said Well then to be sure who would have thought it He isn t a beauty by any means I have seen some seals not unlike him about the head and he looks as though he would take off his gloves on very slight provocation This cat belongs to mister L Smith Clerkenwell London but I have no doubt there are many other Tortoiseshell Toms in the world A friend of mine was telling me last week that he had had one but that it only lived for three months I myself know of one other I sent a humble but enthusiastic friend of mine to treat for its purchase but in vain they would not part with the cat although they have not the slightest notion of its value By George Doctor says my humble but enthusiastic friend if they won t sell him I ll steal him For shame Fred say I And I have suggested cutting out nine as a more honourable expedient On the whole nature seems to abhor a Tortoiseshell Tom as it does a vacuum or a chicken with two heads Tortoiseshell cats are as a rule neither very large nor very prepossessing They have a sinister look about them as though they would as soon bite you as not I question too if they exhibit the same affection as other species They are however excellent hunters and brave to a fault They will often fight with and defeat cats double their own weight and size Judged by The comparative distinctness of markings length and texture of pelage ten it ought to be longish and very soft and glossy deepness of the shades of colour entire absence of white and general plumpness CLASS II Tortoiseshell and White Colour to be red yellow black and white This cat ought to be in size rather larger than the former not too leggy with a round well pleased head and bright eyes with the patches of colour evenly and tastefully arranged and the tints very decided Judged by These qualities and general condition of body and pelage CLASS III Brown Tabby Colour to be rich brown striped and marked with black no white This is a class of very fine noble cats They are the true English cats and if well trained possess all pussy s noblest attributes to perfection They are docile honest and faithful fond of children careful mothers and brave fathers though seldom taking undue advantage of their great strength and it is of them nearly all the best cat stories are told Judged by General size They ought to be very large long massive body with shortish legs especially fore legs and exhibiting great power with suppleness Head ought to be large and round with perpendicular stripes converging rather towards the eye brows and branching off horizontally over the cheeks The face ought to have an intellectual look not sinister and the ears especially in the males must be short The ground work of brown should be of a rich colour and the markings on the body deeply black and uniformly arranged The pelage to be longer on the chest and marked with one bar at least giving the appearance of a Lord Mayor s Chain The legs also ought to be striped transversely with black Tail long and moderately bushy CLASS IV Blue or Silver Tabby Colour to be blue or silver grey striped and marked with black I do not know a more lovely cat than this same Silver Tabby They are really quite elegant cats Of a size rather smaller than the Brown Tabbies They are more gracefully shaped more lithe and quicker in all their movements The head is also smaller and not so blunt and the eyes piercingly bright the ears too are a shade longer Judged by General contour and brightness of markings Ground colour to be something like the grey of Aberdeen granite and markings to be deep and well placed Pelage close and glossy CLASS V Red Tabby Colour to be reddish or sandy marked with darker red no white This splendid cat is I am sorry to say getting only too rare and sadly needs encouragement for if it is allowed to die out where shall we get our favourite red and white cats Where even our tortoise shell In some parts of the country there is a very unjust prejudice against the colour of this cat I beg then humbly to suggest to the committees of management of cat shows that they ought to give a little stimulant to the breeding of this beautiful animal in the shape of a rather higher prize Indeed I think it would be a good plan to make the amount of prize money in all classes bear some sort of relation to the comparative rarity of the breed This sort of handicapping would I am sure tend to equalize the number of entries for each class The Red Tabby ought to approach in size and shape nearly to the Brown They are the same kind hearted good natured animals as their brown brethren and as a rule are better hunters They go farther afield and tackle larger game and seldom forget to bring home at least a portion of each day s game bag They are often moreover very expert fishers Judged by Size and general appearance urbanity of countenance not to be overlooked Markings the ground colour to be a nice sandy colour and the stripes a rich deep red and in all respects the same shape as those on the Brown Tabby The eyes deep set and a beautiful yellow CLASS VI Red and White Tabby Colour to be reddish or sandy marked with white These are very fine cats although perhaps not very fashionable but some that I have seen were very beautiful especially one I remember in Wales a very large cat the white ground was like the driven snow and the spots about the size of half crowns spread prodigally all over like those in a well bred Dalmatian dog I do not think that two spots in all his body coalesced Judged by Size you want this cat largish Brightness of colouring and regularity of markings Tail is long and not very bushy and eyes yellow mostly CLASS VII Spotted Tabby Colour to be brown blue or light or dark grey marked with black or white At most cat shows a good deal of confusion exists about what this cat ought really to be like even among the best judges There is plenty of latitude given as to colour I like the brown and the blue and light or dark grey and the black but I abjure the white at all events we can very easily dispense with it The cat I have in my mind s eye at the present moment comes I think well up to the mark of what a Spotted Tabby should be like He was a large sonsy animal with broad brow and chest short ears and well pleased face quite the cat to sing lullabies at the farmer s fireside or to romp in garden or on parlour floor with the squire s bright eyed English children His markings were as follows The ground colour was dark grey a broad black band ran along his back and down his fine tail and diverging from this band came dark stripes of colour down the sides converging round the thighs and swirling round his chest in two Lord Mayor s chains but the stripes had this peculiarity they were all broken up into spots CLASS VIII Black and White Colour black evenly marked with white This is something more definite The Black and white Tom cat is a large handsome gentlemanlike fellow a sort of cat that you could not believe would condescend to do a dirty action or would hardly deign to capture a miserable mouse and his wife is a perfect lady I have never seen a more handsome specimen than Miss F n s prize cat Snowball His eyes sparkle like emeralds his nose and upper lip are pure white but his chin is black His shirt front is spotless as the snow He wears white gloves not gauntlets gauntlets he told me were snobbish and only fit for low cats and beautiful white stockings This cat knocks with the knocker at the area door when he wants admission Judged by Evenness of the markings not too much white Miss F n s is a good example Pelage to be thick and glossy whiskers white and eyes a deep sea green CLASS IX Black Colour to be entirely black no white No not a morsel of white can be here tolerated not even on the point of the chin although we often see pure black cats on whose coats Nature seems to have been amusing herself by planting long single white hairs all over them This is sometimes but not always the result of age This cat is above all others the best adapted for house hunting for his hearing and sight are extremely keen and while seeing well in the dark he is himself unseen He is invaluable to those whose goods are liable to become a prey to vermin He is a fierce cat when angered but not naturally quarrelsome Judged by Size They ought to be large but with more grace of motion than the Brown Tabby Colour all jet black and pelage glossy and thick Whiskers to be black as well Eyes green eyes better than yellow but hazel or brown better than either CLASS X White Colour to be entirely white no black These cats make very pretty parlour cats when they are bright in colour Millers often prefer them as hunters to black cats thinking perhaps with reason that they are not so easily seen among the bags A perfectly white cat is a very nice and affectionate pet but they are often dull and apathetic Some of them too are deaf Judged by General condition of pelage and symmetry of body Ought to be graceful and not too languid looking Must be entirely white Eyes ought to be blue although they are too often yellow Eyes ought to be both blue It is a defect to have eyes of different colours CLASS XI Unusual Colour Colour to be any remarkable hue not otherwise classified Judged by Colour shape size and symmetry A very beautiful and graceful little cat I saw at the Birmingham Show It belongs to a mister S Lawrence and is called Maltese although I never saw anything like it in that island It was all of one colour a strange sort of slate colour or blue even the whiskers were of the same hue The nose was tipped with black and the eyes were orange yellow CLASS XII Any other Variety or Abnormal Formation Any colour but of singular form such as Manx or six clawed cats This class I think deserves but little encouragement What do we want with cats with six claws and this is sarcasm cats without tails ought to be ashamed of themselves Besides if you bring me young kittens I shall with the aid of a gum lancet and a needle and thread make you Manx cats as fast as winking and I think I could do so less clumsily than has been done to some Manx cats I lately saw at Birmingham And talking of Birmingham there was one cat exhibited there in this class which as a Naval officer I must be permitted to have a shy at Was it a Manx No very much the reverse for whereas a Manx cat has no tail this brute had no fewer than nine It was labelled Garotters back biter and hailed from Millbank prison I wish it were confined to that prison or to any prison By all means use it on the backs of garotters Tickle them up with it three times a day if you choose But why in this civilized age should this brutal weapon be still raised against our brave blue jackets who defend our coast and homes and fight our battles both by sea and land Soldiers are now exempt from the lash are sailors less deserving If not why should a naval seaman be classed in the same catalogue and used in the same way as that most mean and cowardly of all creatures the garotter Ugh the scenes I have witnessed in my own short time in the service I would not chill the blood of the reader by describing But this cat o nine tails has been and is still often used in the service by officers in command not as an instrument of punishment but of wrath and revenge against some poor fellow who may have unwittingly incurred their displeasure Then look at the demoralizing effect it has on the mind and character I have seen a brave honest man lashed up to the grating and receive his punishment in silence and I have seen the same man pale and ghastly cast loose the blood from his bitten lips trickling over his neck but how changed good no longer but reckless And I ve marked his future career and seen him in plain language go posthaste to the devil Can you conceive of anything more cowardly than to tie a poor fellow hand and foot and make a brutal attack on his person I have seen a commander thank God such men are few smirking to himself as he looked on a strong man writhing in silent agony and I have glanced from the one to the other and thought He is the hero you cocked hat sword and all are the villain Discipline must be upheld if we would continue to rule the seas but banish the cat it can easily be dispensed with or if it must be retained let it be the terror only of thieves If a man errs punish him shoot him where he stands if his crime deserves it but Avaunt dishonour do not flog him On the judging of long haired cats very few words will suffice The classes are Tortoiseshell and White Tabby Red Tabby Pure White Black and Unusual Colour These classes must be judged by Markings which are wanted as distinct and well arranged as possible Size they ought to be large cats Pelage ought to be very long silken and glossy The eyes should be of the same colour as in the short haired classes The head of the male Persian should be very broad and characteristic and the ears short well feathered internally and pointing downwards and forwards In the female the head is much smaller and sharper In the pure Black cats the hair is not so fine and it is at times parted down the centre like that of a well bred Newfoundland dog Miss Hales s Angora Selim is a very fine specimen slate coloured on the body the face vandyked with white and a beautiful snowy apron in front His eyes are green and sparkling and from his cage he glares out at you with a look of surly grandeur highly characteristic of his noble breed The same lady s Zuleika a pussy imported from Smyrna is a most lovely and engaging little thing all white with small round head long hair and pitiful eyes as if it wanted so much to be petted in fact just lived to be loved and nothing else It is a pet fit for a princess It is the classification of the Cats of no Sex which I think might be altered for the better By the bye what a ridiculous denomination cats of no sex I think I see Lord Dundreary after reading the catalogue moralizing on his finger ends Catth of no theckth that ith neither mathculine nor feminine let me thee why they mutht be neuter catth catth without life Hi Tham I thay old man they re going to hold a thow of dead catth Children and ladies often ask ridiculous questions about these wonderful cats of no sex Why not boldly adopt the terms Entire cats and Non entire cats and stick to them Honi soit qui mal y pense eleven Now non entire cats are excellent hunters and good home pets and if well cared for they become very large and beautiful although they do at times become lazy and fat Why then should they not have as many classes to compete in as the entire cats But there is a greater mistake still made in the judging They are judged by weight only The reader can easily see then that there is no encouragement given to any one to breed a beautiful cat and at all cat shows you will be surprised to find very ugly cats labelled first and second prize next cage to a perfect beauty whose only misfortune was that he had no appetite for breakfast that morning and consequently lost the prize by two ounces of beef steak No these cats must be judged by their other qualities of course giving a certain number of points for extra weight Example I happen to know a cat which I ll back for ugliness against any puss in the three kingdoms He was originally white but is now beautifully ornamented with cinder holes all over his face is seamed with bloody scars got in honourable conflict and you ought just to see that cat throw back the remains of his ears and scowl I ought to have entered him at last Birmingham Show he would have been first but as the lassie said I didna like But if there is no alteration by next year Egad he shall go to Birmingham and the Crystal Palace too and I think for weight he ll beat at both places Wild Cats These animals are still to be found in some of the most solitary regions of Skye and Sutherland and I am told they are sometimes seen in the mountainous parts of Connemara Like the brown Tabby of domesticity they vary considerably in their markings but they can never be mistaken for any other As a rule the ground colour is yellowish grey with dark stripes the markings being at times as even and beautiful as those of the Bengal tiger The tail is shorter and more bushy than that of the domestic cat and the head if once seen or the voice if once heard can never be forgotten Those I have seen killed were all anything but fat or even in very good condition showing I think that their life must be rather a hard and miserable one On the north west shore of the Isle of Skye between Kilmuir manse and the romantic ruin called Duntulm Castle stands a mountain or rather one half of a mountain the other half by some gigantic agency is levelled to the ground and lies spread over the sea shore in acres of large boulders the precipitous sides of the cleft mountain rising up at one side and the waves of the Atlantic for ever thundering on the other A road has been made straight over these boulders Late one summer s night I was coming home along this road all alone with the exception of a little wire haired terrier called Kooran I was just about the centre the moon was well down in the West and cast my shadow far over the heaps of stones I was gazing up at the beetling cliffs above me and wondering whether any one would ever find the hidden treasure of gold and precious stones which they say lies buried in a cave somewhere on this mountain s side watched over by a malignant fairy see Note B Addenda when I was startled from my reverie by a sound which I should in vain attempt to describe It was partly growl partly scream angry mournful horrible Kooran s tail sought instant refuge between his legs and although I had on a decent sized Scotch bonnet which might weigh somewhere over two pounds I think my hair raised it at any rate my legs seemed suddenly to become ethereal and I did not feel the ground beneath my feet until I had rounded the distant corner and left both cat and mountain a good mile behind me The prey of the Wild Cat is principally rabbits and game of different sorts and in the month of May they sometimes commit great depredations among the young lambs Of course the keepers trap and shoot them on every possible occasion It is not very often however that they manage to get a shot at them it being the habit of the wild cat to lie perdu all day coming out only at night to hunt their quarry or at early morning Several stories of adventures with these dreadful creatures could be told if space permitted I shall only mention one which I do not think has yet found its way into print See Note C Addenda Liddesdale it will do the reader no harm to know is the southernmost parish in Roxburghshire Some years ago a shepherd who used to reside here left for the Highlands He had a family of boys One day while these lads were running about among the hills and woods they started a large wild cat and for keepers children know no fear at once gave chase Puss took to a tree Thinking they were now sure of her one of the boys took his jacket off and prepared to climb and dislodge her while the others stood round with stones to do for her when she came down They saw their brave companion climb the tree they saw the monster come down to meet him and fasten on his neck They looked up horrified there was scarcely a cry save the low growl of the cat a few drops of blood came pattering down and then the children ran off screaming towards home The father was soon on the spot joined by some men with dogs One of these instantly drew his knife and commenced to climb the tree The enraged brute now left the boy and came down to attack the man but the struggle was brief the cat was dashed wounded to the ground where it was speedily despatched by the dogs and men But there was no sound from above The poor boy was found lying on his back athwart the branches his head and arms drooping downwards dead CHAPTER

713-291178-0001	train-other-500	which she evinces under sufferings sometimes the most acute We talk about dogs being game and taking their death easy and so they mostly do under excitement
713-291178-0002	train-other-500	but in long lingering illnesses pussy is a much better patient Pussy moreover is blessed with extreme good nature and will pardon almost any injury from one she loves
713-291178-0003	train-other-500	I have no patience with people who say that cats are unforgiving or that a friendship of years may be cancelled in a moment by an accidental tread on its tail or feet Look the same parties will tell you
713-291178-0004	train-other-500	how patiently a dog will bear a like accident Ay but say I you must bear in mind three things First a dog is generally larger than a cat and a tread is consequently a mere trifle to him
713-291178-0005	train-other-500	Secondly a cat is ten times more sensitive to pain than a dog And thirdly a cat has so many enemies of all sorts that she must be for ever on the alert to avert danger not knowing
713-291178-0006	train-other-500	when a foe may pounce upon her she has to sleep even with open ears Is it any wonder then that when roused from slumber by a cruel and painful tread on her tail she should start up
713-291178-0007	train-other-500	and show fight or run off growling perhaps indeed only half awake But malice she never harbours in her heart and in half an hour when she has thought the matter over
713-291178-0008	train-other-500	she will creep from under the sofa or bed to fondly caress the very one who hurt her No animal appreciates kindness more than a cat Witness the gratitude even a poor stray will evince
713-291178-0009	train-other-500	to any one who may have fed it when hungry Not long ago writes a lady to me a cat one of the kind kept as a machine used to frequent our garden starved enough poor thing as its knotty fur betokened
713-291178-0010	train-other-500	so having a trap set in our house to catch mice and being always more or less successful in catching the vermin I one day took the trap with a mouse in it to the garden and by dint
713-291178-0011	train-other-500	of very little persuasion managed to get near this cat waif and give it the mouse That was quite enough it got them ever after so long as it was in life
713-291178-0012	train-other-500	and invariably from that date whenever it saw me in the garden it would come bounding to me And I am sure by its dumb delight it well repaid me showing that it fully appreciated both the voice
none	none	 and hand of kindness See Note D Addenda It is this same patience in her nature 
713-291178-0013	train-other-500	that makes our domestic cat such an excellent hunter and vermin killer We all know how patiently she will sit in a corner and watch for a mouse or rat She knows very well it will come sooner or later
713-291178-0014	train-other-500	and she is always rewarded with success She is the same in the hunting field waiting for hours at the door of a rabbit burrow till poor Bunny or some one of her children peeps out
713-291178-0015	train-other-500	then I ll have you says puss and forthwith walks it off Or hidden under a heather hillock or a turnip leaf she will wait and wait and never weary until she can secure
713-291178-0016	train-other-500	a beautiful grouse or plump little partridge Witness their patience and long suffering with children this I have already spoken about and need not repeat having proved
none	none	 in a former chapter that they not only bear but even seem to like 
713-291178-0017	train-other-500	a certain amount of rough treatment at baby hands Tucker was about the best natured lump of a cat I ever knew You might have done anything with him flung him over the church for instance
713-291178-0018	train-other-500	If you had I dare be sworn Tucker would have alighted on his feet at the other side
none	none	 and gone quietly off to sleep No he was not a particularly good hunter he was hardly cruel enough to kill a mouse but he had a spirit of his own for all that and if you had shaken your finger at him he would have let you have it straight from the shoulder See Note E Addenda Tucker used to submit himself quietly to be tied up in a towel and placed in a scale opposite a leg of mutton 
713-291178-0019	train-other-500	or Scotch cheese He was once sent a distance of thirty yards trussed up in this fashion to a shopkeeper s place to be weighed Tucker went through the operation so patiently that the grocer never suspected
713-291178-0020	train-other-500	till the very last A good solid hare he said feeling the bundle but bless me isn t he warm Do you think he is really dead
none	none	 Err a wa ow 
713-291178-0021	train-other-500	said Tucker popping out his head at a corner as much as to say Not just yet friend and the laugh was all against the grocer How patiently a cat will wait for her dinner until every one else is served
713-291178-0022	train-other-500	reminding you only then by her loud singing and demonstrative kindness that there is still a little hole in her stomach that wants filling And how patiently sit and wait
713-291178-0023	train-other-500	and watch for the return of her master or mistress be they never so long absent She knows their footsteps and jumps up at their knock and runs to the door to meet them I know of a poor cat
713-291178-0024	train-other-500	that was for a whole fortnight in a trap The cruel keepers had left him for all that time without either food or drink he was afterwards discovered by his owner
713-291178-0025	train-other-500	and taken home Although a beautiful large Tom tabby when he left home he was reduced to a perfect skeleton His leg had to be amputated but he bore the operation without flinching
713-291178-0026	train-other-500	struggling a little at first only but giving vent to no expression of pain He made a very good recovery but being one of the mighty hunter persuasion as soon as he was perfectly recovered
713-291178-0027	train-other-500	he hopped off to the woods again He did not return however and for two years was not seen again but one dark night his master on passing through a wood had his attention attracted by the cries of a cat
713-291178-0028	train-other-500	The animal was in a tree and on the gentleman s approach it sprang down and commenced rubbing round his legs with every expression of affection and kindness On bending down to caress it
713-291178-0029	train-other-500	the gentleman was surprised to find it had only three legs It followed him home and he then made certain it was none other than his long lost pet It stopped at home for many a day after this
713-291178-0030	train-other-500	and seemed in no way inconvenienced from the loss of its hind leg But travellers never can settle and puss took to the woods again
none	none	 and this time fell a victim to the keeper s vengeance See Note F Addenda Another cat of my acquaintance 
713-291178-0031	train-other-500	was in like manner caught in a trap and had to endure amputation of the leg although in much suffering and pain
none	none	 it bore it without a murmur I witnessed only last week says a young lady while residing with my married sister down in Kent an instance of great patience and endurance in a cat A Dandie Dinmont dog was dragging her round and round the garden walks by the tail and instead of being annoyed pussy seemed really to enjoy it See Note G Addenda Cats know as well as a human beings that when you are examining and treating their hurts 
713-291178-0032	train-other-500	whether inflicted by traps or stones you mean to do them good Cats even strange cats often lick my hands when I am probing a wound and inflicting the most severe pain on them
713-291178-0033	train-other-500	Cats always show gratitude by licking your hand it is the greatest compliment a cat can pay you for they are not so ready as dogs to sow their kisses and caresses broad cast I was amused the other day
713-291178-0034	train-other-500	at seeing the care and attention a little girl was bestowing on a pet cat Tom had been out all night and came in next day on three legs the one he carried was wounded bruised and much swollen
713-291178-0035	train-other-500	and Tom himself looked generally seedy and out of sorts Now had it been a boy instead of a girl he would in all probability have done nothing useful But females are always practical
713-291178-0036	train-other-500	and this embryo Miss Nightingale after having a good cry set about at once to put matters straight for poor Tom
none	none	 She bathed the leg in warm water and encircled it 
713-291178-0037	train-other-500	with a large poultice Then she rolled him in an old shawl and put him to bed in a basket Tom kept his bed for ten days during which time she fed him from a plate not allowing him to get up
713-291178-0038	train-other-500	and every time the poultice was changed the cat licked her hand in evident gratitude In fact Tom made the best of patients being more like a sincere Christian than anything else
713-291178-0039	train-other-500	and his little nurse was finally rewarded by having her pet gambolling around her as usual A cat some time ago received a charge of ragged shot in his shoulder
713-291178-0040	train-other-500	He fainted from loss of blood and afterwards had high fever just as a human being would have done under like circumstances The greater portion of the shot was extracted or worked out in the process of healing
713-291178-0041	train-other-500	one portion however pussy carried to his grave with him During the painful process of having his wounds probed for shot
none	none	 pussy never even groaned See Note H Addenda But it is in long and severe illnesses 
713-291178-0042	train-other-500	that pussy s patience is best exemplified A poor cat many years ago took a severe illness jaundice He was a fine large Tom cat of the name of Tacket
713-291178-0043	train-other-500	and a very great pet but in a short time he got reduced to a mere bag of bones
none	none	 his fine fur came out in parts and in parts hung about him like tassels 
713-291178-0044	train-other-500	So pitiful an object looked he that his master and mistress had the sin of keeping him alive forcibly pointed out to them by their friends Indeed he was now so weak as to be unable to move
713-291178-0045	train-other-500	from his bed by the kitchen fire On the tenth day when he was at his very worst a little raw meat was given him and his head being supported he managed to swallow it
713-291178-0046	train-other-500	This was the turning point of his illness he began to rally and soon got well and plump and sleek and the other day died at the age of twelve But it was a treat to see how
713-291178-0047	train-other-500	patiently poor Tacket bore his illness Every morning when his master went to see him although he could not rise he tried to sing But the power of purring left him as he got weaker
713-291178-0048	train-other-500	on the ninth day he could just sing one bar and on the tenth day only one note This cat had a great dislike for months afterwards to milk in any shape or form
none	none	 from having been continually dosed with it while sick he used positively to shiver at the sight of it See Note I Addenda But I have I believe said enough to prove pussy s claim to the virtues of both patience and gratitude Illustration ANGORA First Prize Owned by MISS M ARMITAGE Illustration PERSIAN First Prize Owned by MONGREDIAN esquire Habits of Cleanliness in Cats It must be allowed 
713-291178-0049	train-other-500	that of all our domestic pets pussy undoubtedly bears the bell for personal cleanliness Nature has adorned her with a most beautiful coat of the softest silkiest fur and loveliest of colours
713-291178-0050	train-other-500	and she spares no pains to keep it clean and smart I firmly believe that the cat is very proud of her appearance and likes to cut a dash here again by the bye
713-291178-0051	train-other-500	she resembles the female of the human family Pussy is for ever cleaning and washing at herself If a well bred parlour cat she will never allow a speck of dirt to sully her fur
713-291178-0052	train-other-500	I can always tell whether a cat is properly cared for and has sufficient food by the appearance of her coat If she is allowed to be hungry or is badly housed she soon loses all taste in herself
713-291178-0053	train-other-500	and doesn t care a rat s tail how she looks When a cat s coat begins to appear rough and stare it is the first indication of approaching illness and this symptom
none	none	 will never be unattended to by those who love their pet I have known cats take ill and die from having their coats accidentally soiled beyond remedy CHAPTER IV TRICKS AND TRAINING Some of the tricks which cats perform are highly amusing Of course I refer to our fireside puss and not to publicly performing cats these require special training and a large amount of educating But almost any cat will either of her own accord or with very little teaching perform antics and capers enough to amuse children at least if not indeed to make older people smile Cats must be trained when young and the very first thing you must teach them is to love you If you can accomplish this they will learn almost anything Cats have great jumping power naturally and this power can be greatly increased by proper exercise in the days of their kitten hood They can spring almost incredible distances either up or down My own favourite when one year old used to jump clean over the parlour door fetching away a bit of meat that had been placed on the top The best method of instructing a cat in leaping heights is to place bits of food at different elevations and encourage her to bring them down She will soon be able to spring seven or eight feet easily and this same exercise will stand her many a good turn in her predatory excursions in the field or her amatory perambulations on the tiles I have seen a cat thus trained spring from one house top to another a distance of fully ten feet there were three other cats but none dared follow her I know of a cat of the extraordinary weight of twenty two lbs that springs with apparent ease from the parlour floor on to a door over six feet high See Note K Addenda At Preston the other day my lady Muff chose to declare herself on the spree As usual on such occasions half a dozen Toms came to serenade her and loudly they sang of her charms The night being muggy and wet I determined to keep her ladyship within doors so Theodore Nero was sent out to reason with her lovers while I shut puss up in the bedroom In this act of incarceration I was encouraged by the starling who was busy examining the anatomy of the pin cushion but who left off boring holes to say Bravo doctor Br ravo I ll bravo you presently if you don t mind said Muff as plainly as eyes and eyebrows could speak Muff was exceedingly wroth Is is is cats to be trusted remarked Dick musingly to himself as he re commenced playing Old Harry with the pin cushion Now the bed room window was just twenty feet from the ground and had been left open at the top When I went up to bed I unlocked the door and entered cautiously for I knew all her tricks and manners The starling was perched on the looking glass asleep and Muffie was gone The blind was disarranged She had jumped over I went down with a carpet bag to look for her remains but there weren t any Muffie came in at tea time next day seedy rather but triumphant Another capital plan to teach a cat to leap a height is to attach a hare s foot to a piece of string at the end of a fishing rod and set it in motion You can thus regulate the elevation to pussy s daily increasing capabilities I have seen a cat bring her kittens to this gymnasium and teach the whole four of them to jump and seize the hare s foot which she herself used to set in motion A very common trick is to teach pussy to jump through your arms Begin by holding them low between your legs having taught her to leap thus hold them to one side and make her jump either way backwards and forwards Gradually increase the height till standing erect you form a large P and puss springs through the bend of it Then hold your arms right above you slightly bending your neck and your cat presuming the reader is anything under seven feet high shall leap right over your head Very pretty and effective exercise for a cat is hoop leaping It costs little trouble to teach and every cat will learn it For this you must be provided with a little switch not to hit the cat but merely to make a noise in the air Pronounce the word hoop each time you hold the article in front of her and she will soon learn to go through in whatever position you hold it Or you may have a series of hoops at different elevations placed in the garden a few yards apart or better still hung from the couples of a barn or grain loft On these last a young and healthy cat soon becomes quite a wonderful performer and if you wish her to be still more highly educated in the hoop business you can dip your hoop in methylated spirits of wine and set fire to it she will go through just the same Or cover the hoop with thin tissue paper and teach her to go through it At first the paper must be oiled so as to be nearly transparent A friend of mine coming home at twelve o clock the other night heard an awful noise and rattling in an out house which he had fitted up as a cat gymnasium On going in with a light he was surprised to find two full grown kittens performing they had been giving a dark seance on their own account After any performance you must never forget to reward poor puss with food and water which latter on these occasions she will prefer to milk Cats you know are not very fond of music still I have known them taught to move rhythmically to it The hearth rug is the arena on which puss may be taught to perform a variety of tricks I know a cat that if you ask her to show you how a hare lies in the market throws herself on the floor on her side and stretching her fore legs and hind legs in a line with her body lies there to all appearance dead till you bid her rise I know a cat that turns somersaults on request You can easily teach a cat to beg after the fashion of a broken haired terrier as also to give a paw right or left and to jump on your knee and placing its two fore legs one on each side of your neck execute quite a theatrical embrace Or you may make her stand in a corner on her hind legs until requested to drop down I know a pussy that jumps on a chair at the bidding of her mistress and placing her fore paws over the back rests her head on them and simulates sleep Indeed nothing is more easy than to teach a cat to open or shut her eyes at the word of command See Note L Addenda There are two things which every household puss may and ought to be taught viz to come and lie down quietly by the fire or on the sofa when told and to watch that is to sit by a mouse hole where you know a mouse to be until she catches it but you must never deceive her I know of a daft little puss who sits on her master s shoulder at dinner and when he is about to treat himself to some specially tempting morsel cleverly snatches it from the fork as he is putting it to his mouth and transfers it to her own She does it with such an apparent appreciation of the fun of the joke that no one could be angry with her See Note M Addenda You can easily teach your cat to become an expert fisher by throwing half dead minnows on the top of the water and encouraging her to jump in and seize them Cats can be taught to ring the bell and to open the door But whatever other tricks or performances you may care to teach her it is very much for pussy s future welfare that she should when young have plenty of leaping exercise and if at the same time you make a good retriever of her she will form the habit of always bringing home her prey For with all due respect for the game laws I do like to see a cat come trotting home in the gloaming with a nice young leveret or a plump partridge in her mouth nobody is any the poorer and her master has something nice for supper You teach a cat to retrieve with a hare s foot Teach her in the parlour first then by flinging the plaything out of doors She will soon learn to bring it in and lay it at your feet A freshly killed bird may then be used and you will very soon have the satisfaction of seeing her invariably bring home her quarry In the country but only in the country you may teach your cat to follow you in your walks just like a dog and she will never lose you either by night or day Cats come to your whistle much better than to any other call In training this interesting animal you must have every consideration for her failings and weaknesses and must never forget that she will do almost anything for one who loves her and treats her with kindness Inculcate habits of cleanliness in grown cats There are times when through accident or having been shut in a room even the most highly trained cat will deviate from the paths of decency Never altogether overlook a thing of this sort Take the cat gently but firmly to the place and show her you are angry cats are dreadfully frightened at a scolding this will generally prevent a repetition of the offence But if the same thing should occur again and there is no excuse of a closed room or a locked door then corporeal punishment becomes necessary But it must not be severe or all remembrance of her crime will be lost in the pain of the correction Cats are very delicate and easily injured about the head Carry her at once to the scene of her misdemeanour and ask her if she sees it then with a little bit of whalebone switch her several times across the fore paws or tips only of the ears and turn her outside the front door But in no case should correction partake of the nature of revenge If the cat fancier will attend to these simple rules he will have cats that he will be proud of and they will be proud of him CHAPTER V CRUELTY TO CATS I think it my duty to warn the reader that this is essentially a chapter of horrors so that if her or his feelings do not tend in that direction it may be skipped If it pains any one to read it it must be remembered that it was much more painful to me to write it and only the hope of enlisting the sympathy of the kind hearted and benevolent in pussy s favour could have induced me to do so How far I have been successful time will tell Indeed I believe the day is not far distant when it will become the fashion nay even a portion of our religion to treat all animals from the dog downwards with kindness and consideration and when necessity determines life to be taken to take it in the least cruel and most humane manner possible A good and noble work has been begun by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals All honour to it and success to its organ The Animal World The field is indeed a wide one and one can scarcely help feeling almost despairingly as he looks abroad upon the world and sees the vast amount of cruelty there is to suppress But stone by stone old Rome was built and as the good work advances the labourers will increase and success in the end is certain As the case now stands I think the assistance of the pulpit by precept and of the great and rich by example is sadly wanted to support the cause The efforts of the Society are at present more particularly directed to obtaining convictions against offenders for ill treating overloading or torturing horses and donkeys for improperly conveying and starving cattle calves pigs and goats for cruelties to birds and for ill using dogs and cats Alas poor pussy comes last and least But as the world advances in civilization and becomes more humane new laws will have to be framed anent the great ocean of cruelty the waves of which we see tumbling and breaking around us every day and making us apathetic because of their very number and our own inability to oppose them Why should horses be for ever worked to death or till death Why should their labours and hardships be increased with their increasing years and infirmities We care for and love them when young and handsome when they grow old we forget their former services ill treat and starve them and finally thrash them into the knacker s yard Why should donkeys those patient much enduring animals be all their poor lives treated with such systematic brutality Why should cattle of all sorts be driven to the markets or conveyed by rail or steam boat for long dreary journeys without either food or water Why should they be slaughtered with so little regard to their sufferings when the sting of death could be so easily drawn ere the fatal blow was struck Why should turkeys fowls geese and ducks be carried to market with feet tied and hung over poles head downwards or huddled together in cramped baskets and kept sometimes in such pain and suffering that death itself must be sweet relief Why should pigeons and other smaller birds be shot in so cowardly and inhumane a manner as is the fashion at matches in the present day Cockfighting itself is much less cruel for there each bird has a chance of life and the wounded are slain For the numerous cruelties inflicted on fishes we can hardly name a remedy yet but has the reader ever thought of the agony which must be endured by the lobster and crab in being boiled alive All these outrages on animal life might be prevented or greatly ameliorated by just and proper laws England I trust will be the first to take the lead in this matter and depend upon it that nation s arm will always be the strongest on the day of battle that in the time of peace is employed in labours of love and in the advancement of civilization and humanity The Mohammedans are far before us in kindness to the lower animals Accursed be he who spilleth blood is one of their sayings Now the Hindoos for instance are a much older nation than we are They were clothed and in their right minds thousands of years before we were out of pig skin kilts and paint We are trying to learn from theory what they have found out from long experience and will no doubt arrive at the same conclusions after the loss of much valuable time I know a gentleman who puts faith in no statement in the abstract even if the speaker should be as old as Methuselah which isn t often the case and as wise as Ahab until he has carefully ground as it were the syllogism in his own mill thoroughly sifted it and microscopically examined it then he looks surprised smiles and says By George old Thingummy was right after all He can t help it however it is the result of a too liberal education He is constantly grinding away at a proverb Now I think proverbs are the pith of a nation s experience the wisdom of a country is skimmed off boiled evaporated to dryness burned to get rid of organic impurities and the residue washed and distilled and the essential oil bottled in a proverb But my learned friend on first hearing one says Oh nonsense Can t be The proverb haunts him however both by night and day for perhaps a fortnight perhaps longer until it is properly thought out in all its bearings then he believes it not before He would save much time by having a little more credulity but he is getting wise and if he lives long enough he will be very wise indeed although the process may cost him his teeth he is bald already The Hindoos have long ago come to the conclusion that it is wrong to take life and accordingly they don t barring that they murder their wives when it is required I think they are right although I myself draw the line at naval cockroaches and the fact that they are disagreeable things to kill may have something to do with my sparing them Besides a cockroach has so many relations and these all come to his funeral and insist on seeing him decently interred This ceremony they perform by tasting tasting at him until nothing remains I was one day counting my pieces to my Indian washerman on the deck of my cabin when out from the bosom of a nightshirt dropped a nine inch long centipede in the full vigour of health and intellect and began making the best of his way to the nearest shelter Giving instant chase and having the advantage in length of legs if not in number I should soon have run him down had not the impudent Hindoo at the very last moment pulled me back by my frock coat tails Such an indignity to a British officer on board a British man o war was hardly to be borne with impunity I turned and looking him full in the face in my most impressive manner Sir said I are you aware that Britons never never NEVER will be slaves The dobee salaamed Then continued I what have you got to say that I should not punch your head or kick your rascally shins for conniving at the escape of yonder centipede that has just gained his crevice and is even now making faces at me with impunity The dobee drew himself up Sahib said he you can kickee my head you can punchee my shin all same Allah is good and the Koran say Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not kill repeated I why the man must have learned the Shorter Catechism he can t be such a heathen after all The dobee triumphed I shook him by the hand and he had my washing ever after Enter my servant one day I was living in a room on shore at Bombay Man come for your little ones Sahib said he Pandoo said I in a solemn voice what do you mean I m a respectable unmarried man and never deserved any The man who entered behind Pandoo carried a shovel a brush and a basket and I soon discovered that my little ones meant all the earwigs bugs centipedes and crickets of which I had a fair sprinkling of each sort and he came not to destroy but actually to carry them away He swept my room and bed moderately clean and I afterwards found that he had taken the contents of the basket to the corner of a field and emptied them among some straw For no true Buddhist takes life and when cows and horses get infirm they are regularly superannuated and sent to an asylum where they may end their days in peace The scenes of cruelty to the lower animals which one witnesses in the streets and lanes of our own country are almost enough to make one doubt the goodness of God In many cases a person at all sensitive cannot refrain from interfering and unless he can show some proper authority for so doing he will in most cases come off second best and do harm to the very victim he meant to protect I have often constituted myself a sort of knight errant to distressed quadrupeds and I flatter myself I have at times done some good either by going quietly up to the perpetrator of the cruelty and trying to reason with him or with a pretended show of authority demanding his name and address A man of this sort is always a coward and usually funks at once I once had my nose broken though in a row with a butcher about ill treating a cow That brought my knight errantry to a bloody close for a fortnight but thanks to good surgery the organ is none the worse Last February while walking in a lane in the neighbourhood of a rural village I met a fellow certainly the most brutal lout ever I saw driving or rather pushing along two unhappy sheep The creatures had walked a very long distance and appeared completely exhausted for the wind was very high and the cold rain and sleet were beating in their faces and stupifying them Besides the scoundrel had been striking them with a strong black thorn cane and as he dared not touch them about the body for fear of injuring the appearance of the mutton for mutton they soon would be it was across the forehead and nose he hit them so the blood was trickling down in streams and as they shook their heads with pain their pretty fleeces were all besmeared Oh the amount of misery depicted in their poor patient eyes The very dogs seemed ashamed of their master s conduct It s to be killed they are to be at any rate said the fellow when I remonstrated with him on his conduct and curse them he cried I ll make them go And again the blows began to fall The sheep moaned low and I closed with my friend A vicious tussle and the stick flew over the hedge Then the lout flew at me He hit my fist a tremendous blow with his lower jaw the result of which was that he immediately took the world on his back like old Atlas he took the world on his back several times before he seemed tired of it Then I gave him to understand that by way of recompense for knocking him down I should at once find a policeman to take him up unless he immediately accompanied me to a neighbouring killing house to get a butcher to slaughter the sheep He reluctantly consented and the sorrows of those two dumb creatures soon came to an end About the commonest if not the simplest form of cruelty to poor pussy is that of neglecting to feed her regularly and at the proper times Many people are guilty of this who would not willingly do an unkind action they err through ignorance or want of thought Pussy they imagine can easily pick up all she needs about the floor There could hardly be a greater mistake or one more fatal to pussy s existence as a pet For the mere fact of her having to look out for her own food will make her dishonest Others starve their cats to make them catch mice the very opposite is the case It is your plump well fed sleek grimalkins that are the best mousers a starveling has not courage nor heart enough to kill a midge let alone a mouse Higher in the scale of cruelty is the only too common practice of leaving pussy at home to shift for herself when the family moves to the seaside or country in holiday season In some instances the cat has access to and from the house by some private door of her own In this case she will generally manage to eke out a miserable existence from the scraps she picks up on the dung hill or she will become a thief and make raids on the pigeon houses or rabbit boxes of the neighbours At all events she is usually successful in sustaining her life until the return of the family But it is very different with pussy when she is entirely imprisoned in an empty house without either food or water save perhaps an occasional mouse which chance may throw in her way I know of one unhappy cat that lived for three whole weeks on dry oat meal alone Another instance I can just recall to memory and I am sorry to say it is only one of many thousands that are happening every day In this case the family had gone to the country for a month leaving Tabby as affectionate a little cat as ever lived and the constant pet and playmate of the young children shut up in the house The building was a new one there were consequently no mice so when the family at length returned almost the first thing that met their gaze was poor Tabby lying stark and stiff on the parlour hearth She was a perfect skeleton while the sardonic grin on her mouth showed how much she must have suffered Such a death in that lonely house almost makes one s flesh creep to think of A still more shocking case of cruelty recently came to my knowledge which shows very forcibly how dreadful must be the sufferings of a starving cat and how great the sin of those who leave them thus to perish In one of the principal squares of the city of Edinburgh lives missus Blank a lady who can carry a high head in the best society of which the Scottish metropolis can boast She subscribes to all the charities and feeds and clothes the poor daily of course she is only lending to the Lord and expects the principal returned on or after the Day of Judgment with very good interest But that is neither here nor there This lady had a cat a very fine one too on which she lavished an unusual amount of affection and this affection was amply reciprocated for pussy cared for no one in the house but her mistress But in process of time Jenny had the exceedingly bad taste to give birth to two pretty little kittens and of course could not spare so much time as usual on her mistress s lap So when the family had packed up and were about to move into the country for the holiday this lady gave the order to have that horrid tiresome old cat and kittens shut up in the house until her return Pussy was shut up accordingly For a whole fortnight after the people in the adjoining house were disturbed by melancholy cries proceeding from the empty house and at last unable to endure it any longer the assistance of the police was called and an entrance effected through a back window A most horrible sight met their view Poor pussy thin even to emaciation lay upon her bed in the corner nursing the heads of her two kittens She had eaten their bodies Fancy the sufferings that must have triumphed over her motherly love Not only however had she eaten the kittens but rendered wild by the pangs of hunger she had actually torn from her own thigh a large piece of flesh and devoured it It is a wonderful instance of the tenacity of life in cats that this pussy by careful nursing made a good recovery She took up house with her kind preservers but never afterwards darkened the door of her cruel lady mistress See Note N Addenda The sagacity of the cat is very often beautifully shown in the means she takes to provide for herself food and shelter in the absence of her owners On these occasions pussy has often been known to become a beggar from door to door For example one morning early a workman mister D Stoddart ninety two Rose Street Edinburgh on going to his work observed a large black cat trotting on before him with tail erect and evidently on the best of terms with herself Her good humour however must have been simulated for the occasion for she was very hungry indeed Presently she stopped and looking earnestly in the man s face all her happiness seemed at once to forsake her and she mewed in a most pitiful manner The good hearted fellow at once opened his little napkin and gave pussy part of his dinner He was rather surprised next morning to meet the puss exactly at the same time and place In fact the cat had adopted the working man in a small way and every morning regularly for six months it met him and gratefully received its breakfast After this it used to walk along with him for some distance singing a little song to him the while then took her departure One day however pussy was missed and it was a long time before anything else was heard of her Some months after in passing a gentleman s gate in a different part of the town who should come out to bid him welcome but his quondam friend and companion the cat She was sleek and fat and apparently happy as the sunshine On making inquiries it afterwards transpired that during the six months that pussy used to meet the working man the family were on the Continent So common a thing has cruelty towards the feline race become that one can hardly take a walk along the streets or into the country without seeing the mangled body of some poor puss which has been stoned beaten to death or worried by dogs more than likely in the open light of day Indeed a cat s foes are so very numerous that the only wonder is how she escapes with her life so often Instead of nine lives it would I think be more convenient for her to have ninety and nine Most common among pussy s numerous enemies may be mentioned Firstly Gamekeepers It must certainly be very annoying to keepers to have cats prowling indiscriminately among the preserves destroying eggs birds rabbits and game of every description but after all the amount of injury done must be comparatively small whereas the cruelties practised on pussy by these men are at times quite revolting To kill a cat by shooting her may under some circumstances be deemed justifiable but to wilfully lay traps for its destruction in which the poor thing may linger for days before death ends its misery is surely far from humane Even after pussy is relieved from the trap it is in most cases only to have her brains dashed out against the nearest tree or to have her tail cut off and her body left to die on the ground Secondly Street boys Seldom can a boy see a cat anywhere on the street or at large without lifting the nearest stone to shy at her And not boys only but even grown up men have I heard boasting of their vile exploits in cat killing Thirdly Men with dogs The only way I like to see a cat said a gentleman to me the other day is with a dog at her heels and I m sorry to say such sentiments are far from unfrequent I know indeed it is an usual thing for young men to go out of an evening with dogs generally bull and terriers for the express purpose of slipping them at the first cat that chance throws in their way In these cases any hope of escaping with her life is for the poor cat very small indeed unless under very exceptional circumstances The other day a friend of mine who isn t very soft hearted was taking a walk in the suburbs of Manchester with a bull terrier dog and a bitch of the same breed both champion prize takers by the way A cat was started and pussy made directly for the door of her master s house Both the back and front doors were open The cat darted in by the back closely followed by the dog while as if to cut off all chance of escape the bitch rushed round and entered by the front The family were just at breakfast when pussy sprang on the table attacked simultaneously in front and rear by her canine foes They literally tore her in two across the table and before her owner s eyes Of course the damage done to the crockery was something very considerable and my friend had to pay five guineas to hush the matter up and Serve you right I remarked when he told me See Note O Addenda And fourthly Cat skin Collectors In nearly every large town in the kingdom there actually exist parties who make a living by buying cats for the sake of their hides They of course have to pay a pretty large price for a good skin and this in its turn gives rise to another branch of industry namely cat hunting The cat hunter is lower in the social scale and much more cruel and hardened than even the bird catcher The occupation seems to be thoroughly demoralizing and its followers live in the most squalid dens and infamous purlieus of the city leading an idle dissipated life and if not dead of disease before the age of twenty five it is because a grateful country has provided them with board and lodging free at stony Portland or muddy Chatham Chance took me not long since to a beautiful rural district in one of the southern counties of Ireland Paddy Taffy as he was called from as he himself expressed it his mother being a Welshman and his father Irish was a farmer s lad and used to bring me the most beautiful butter milk and the freshest of duck eggs every morning as certain as sunrise He was just the right boy in the right place he knew every rock and bog and corrie in the parish besides all the most frequented rabbit hills and the pools where the fish were never shy He was always catering for fun for me and was never so happy as when he had found me a new pleasure Well one day Paddy Taffy comes to me with the eggs and butter milk as usual and grinning like a grampus Augh sir says he but it s the raal bit of fun yer honour will be having this blessed morning if you ll only be after coming to the river with Taffy And I will that Paddy says I for I had nothing better to do I ll go home first though says he and then meet you at the side of the strame A walk of two miles over the hills took me to the place of appointment I forgot to say that Paddy was never unaccompanied by two dogs one a very decent well bred water spaniel the other a funny looking frolicsome imp of a colley On this day when I met him he had the dogs as usual and moreover what in all the world should he be carrying under his arm but a butter tub Before I had time to inquire the use of the singular utensil singular under the circumstances It s meself says Paddy that s glad you ve come and by the same token yonder come the boys with the cat On looking round sure enough there were three more boys of course boys is a mere figure of speech they were all including Paddy himself grown up men with three more dogs one of which a large white and black Newfoundland carried a basket in his teeth Suspecting that some scene of mischief or cruelty was to be enacted I asked Paddy to tell me right straight away what the game was to be Sure your honour said he it s only this we put the cat in the tub and float her down the strame and send the dogs ahint her It was in vain that I tried to persuade Paddy to give up a scheme which seemed to me little short of diabolical for I fully expected to see poor pussy torn limb from limb in the water Paddy s reasoning was something after the following fashion If it s the dogs you re afraid of sir sure enough they ll deserve all they ll get and more if it s the cat then you needn t be afraid at all she s been three times at it before Och she s the raal taring blood and wounding captain of the butter boat besides she has kittens at home and that makes her the devil himself sure Moreover sir here he lowered his voice the boys is ugly boys and they ve ugly bits of timber below their flippers and they wouldn t let us spoil the sport for the dear life itself So making a virtue of necessity I stopped to see the fun and fair play The river here was broad and still and deep The basket was taken from the Newfoundland and all the dogs were led out of sight behind an adjoining hillock Then the cat a wild looking tortoise shell was taken out placed in the tub and the tub shoved well off into the stream Away went puss with the current whirling round and round in her awkward boat and looking anything but happy for she evidently knew all about it Then a shout from the boys and down rushed the dogs helter skelter taking the water in grand style the spaniel first the Newfoundland following springing right on top of the foremost dog and sinking him by way of a lark Up they all swam to the tub which was still whirling slowly down stream but puss was all ready and stood by cleverly to repel boarders evidently determined to sell her nine lives dearly The spaniel was the first to place a paw on the tub and his nose was at once laid open in consequence The colley followed suit and sung small immediately after The other dogs had no better success for each in his turn and sometimes two at a time were wounded and had to haul off and lie too Tableaux four defeated curs paddling harmlessly round the tub barking futilely puss erect and frizzly with one paw impressively uplifted growling defiance at the lot All this time the big Newfoundland had been swimming about taking apparently no notice of the unequal contest Now however he seemed to think the state of affairs justified his interference in order to uphold the prestige of the canine race Poor dog he at least had no intention of killing the cat but only thought of hauling her tub and all safely in shore With this kind intention and in that thoroughly business like manner only to be seen in dogs of his class he paddled directly up to the vessel and seizing it by the rim almost lifted it out of the water as he put about with tail hard a port to swim to land Sharp and condign was the punishment Captain Puss administered to that dog s nose for his unasked for aid Nelson dropped the tub like a red hot shot and with a howl of injured innocence wheeled round and set out for land in disgust But puss had no idea of letting him off like this for the vessel rather leaky at the best had been filling for some time and was fast settling down and pussy saw at a glance it must be abandoned Then what better refuge than to make a life boat of that Newfoundland s head and shoulders They just seemed cut out for it so she didn t think twice about it but at once made the spring If poor Nelson swam quick before he now seemed to cleave the water like a new born steam boat Pussy however had no intention of letting him land with her being doubtful as to the consequences accordingly when only a few feet more of water had to be passed with one good parting kick she sprang nimbly to bank and made off for the woods as fast as four legs could carry her The dogs all looked very foolish and presently like true Paddies they all fell foul of each other and fought in the water and out of the water to their heart s content See Note P Addenda On the whole I think pussy had the best of it CHAPTER VI PARLIAMENTARY PROTECTION FOR THE DOMESTIC CAT Now after reading the chapter on cruelty to cats surely every honest man and kind hearted lady in the land will agree with me in thinking that it is high time our Legislature should do something to put an end to the persecutions against 
5424-291181-0000	train-other-500	and to protect our very useful pet pussy Laws have been framed for the good of horses dogs and game nay even the very wild birds of the field have their friends in Parliament but the poor cat is left out in the cold
5424-291181-0001	train-other-500	In the columns of a paper called The Bazaar a few months ago a correspondence was kept up for several weeks on the subject of Cat Extermination No doubt it is highly annoying to have one s beautiful flower beds torn up
none	none	 and one s pet pigeons and rabbits worried at night by prowling cats But the methods proposed for their destruction were in some cases diabolical Poison of all sorts was to be freely used and sponges dipped in tallow 
5424-291181-0002	train-other-500	worse torture than giving a shark a red hot brick or a lady s steel crinoline fastened up with hide and wire fences so constructed that the cat might find easy access into a garden but no egress and so be torn to pieces with dogs
none	none	 With mair o horrible and awfu Which e en to name would be unlawfu 
5424-291181-0003	train-other-500	But I would fain enlist even these men on pussy s side not certainly for sake of the cats but for their own comfort for no good unless the gratification of a feeling of revenge can accrue from attempts at extermination
5424-291181-0004	train-other-500	and only from legislation can they hope to get redress You may exterminate the Modoc Indians extirpate the Maories and annihilate the Ashantees
none	none	 but you ll have no chance against the cats Now I should ask nay claim parliamentary protection for our domestic cat for many reasons Here I shall only mention one or two First then because she is a pet a pet 
5424-291181-0005	train-other-500	in many a nobleman s and gentleman s family and still more so at many a poor man s fireside who cannot afford to maintain any larger domestic animal and because
none	none	 pussy is so beautiful 
5424-291181-0006	train-other-500	so gentle loving and kind and capable of such high training
none	none	 because she is so affectionate towards her owner 
5424-291181-0007	train-other-500	and because she loves the children so She is indeed the pet par excellence of babyhood and infancy Secondly because we are Christians
none	none	 or live in a Christian land and because the cruelties that are practised every day in our midst against this defenceless creature 
5424-291181-0008	train-other-500	are harrowing to all our feelings
none	none	 and a disgrace to a civilized country Thirdly and lastly at present 
5424-291181-0009	train-other-500	because the cat is an animal of great utility Putting aside then all sentimentality let us look at the matter in a plain business point of view We ought to do all in our power for the protection and improvement
5424-291181-0010	train-other-500	of every domesticated animal under our care whether kept for use or ornament no one will think of denying that But there is no creature under the sun which is so systematically ill used and carelessly treated as pussy
none	none	 The cause is easily understood we do not thoroughly appreciate the good the cat does 
5424-291181-0011	train-other-500	and even if we do being all naturally selfish we like to have and hold all we can for the least possible outlay and trouble Thus
none	none	 pussy s services are poorly repaid and ungratefully received because she is so patient and uncomplaining

none	none	 they would quickly deteriorate in value 
5424-291181-0013	train-other-500	but the cat looked upon as a mere vermin killer is different her presence alone however skinny and lean being generally enough to frighten away those pests rats and mice Indeed very few of us I fear
5424-291181-0014	train-other-500	fully appreciate the amount of real good done or the large amount of valuable property saved annually in a preventive way alone by cats More quickly than almost any other animal do rats and mice multiply Take the field mouse for example

none	none	 one thing at least is certain the law ought to protect the domestic cat CHAPTER VII FELINE AILMENTS Of course in one chapter and that is all my available space it will be impossible to notice all or even the greater part of the evils that feline flesh is heir to I will endeavour however to lay down a few simple rules for those who wish to keep their cats in health and for their treatment in the most common diseases Prevention is better than cure I believe that is not an original remark but it is nevertheless a very true one as regards the ailments of the domestic cat almost all of which may be kept at bay by even ordinary attention We all have a duty to perform to the animals under us even to animals of mere utility and much more cheerfully ought that duty to be performed if the creature is kept for the beauty that pleases our eye or for the love it loves us with So long as your pet is in health and happy and lively you can easily forgive yourself for many little acts of neglect towards her but when she falls ill when she is writhing in pain and looking in your face with eyes that implore your aid then indeed I do not envy your feelings if coupled with your sorrow for her sufferings you have the sad reflection that many a time you might have been better to her There is more room for improvement in the breed and condition of the domestic cat than in that of any other animal I know and no creature so soon repays its master for the care and attention he may bestow on it Instead of the meagre looking small short haired guilty thief that used to fly and get up the chimney whenever it heard your footstep you have a large honest plump pussy with glossy fur and loving eye that runs to meet you with a song and jumps on your shoulder to have the pleasure of giving you the first caress a thing of joy and beauty for well for a matter of fifteen years at least And these are the sort of cats I wish to see throughout the length and breadth of the land I like to see people fond of their cats Some will tell you it is unmanly to love a cat Fudge Man s manliness consists in doing in a straightforward manner whatsoever is natural and right and not fearing the face of clay in the doing of it But said I the other day at Birmingham somewhat mischievously interrupting a sporting friend of mine who was indulging in a long diatribe on the comparative merits of two bull terriers But have you seen the cats Confound the cats he answered testily and after a pause D ye know what I should like to do Look see There are a hundred and twenty fox terriers yonder well I d just turn them into the cat show and close the doors Well at all events said I come and see them Arrived in the building my friend walked along the rows of cages peeping into each with an air of amusing perplexity At last he stopped before a beautiful Persian and D n it all said he his language was not very choice these aren t cats Doctor they are some foreign beasts Foreign only to bad treatment I said The upshot of it was that I had to buy him a kitten one of great promise He took it away in his pocket I ll be good to it he said and when it s big if it s game and all that I ll look see I ll give it a dozen rats every Sunday morning hang me if I don t He is a rough nut my friend but good at the kernel In order then to keep pussy in perfect health pelage and temper and worthy of taking her place before the parlour fire or on the drawing room couch we must attend to three things viz her food her drink and her housing FOOD I have no doubt that cats were originally admitted to the society of mankind on account of their proclivities for killing rats and mice We can have some clue to the seeming mystery of the veneration in which cats were held in ancient Egypt if we remember the large stores of grain et cetera which its inhabitants were in the habit of laying up No country in the world depended more for its very existence as a nation on its cereals than did Egypt We can imagine then a time when cats were unknown even to the Egyptians and a particular year when the crops had nearly failed when the grain was hoarded carefully and when with famine came a plague of rats and mice threatening death and annihilation to all in the land We may easily fancy the reign of terror and gloom that would ensue and then we can understand the exuberance of joy and general rejoicing on the introduction by some Magi from a far country of their new found friend the cat A nation saved by cats Something of the kind must undoubtedly have occurred and thus the stringent laws framed for pussy s protection and the love and regard lavished on her by all classes of the people may more easily be accounted for We ourselves have always had cats since the conquest by the Romans and can neither fully appreciate their value nor use but think reader just for a moment what the consequences would be and how great the destruction of property by vermin were cats to be suddenly exterminated If then only for the sake of making pussy more valuable as a vermin killer she ought to have regular and sufficient food A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day Let her have a dish to herself put down to her and removed when the meal is finished Experience is the best teacher as regards the quantity of a cat s food and in quality let it be varied Oatmeal porridge and milk or white bread steeped in warm milk to which a little sugar has been added are both excellent breakfasts for puss and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh Boiled lights are better for her than horse meat and occasionally let her have fish Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child If you want to have your cat nice and clean treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter It not only acts as a gentle laxative but the grease combining in her mouth with the alkalinity of her saliva forms a kind of natural cat soap and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself and become beautifully clean N B If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream when she licks herself the effect is wonderful Remember that too much flesh meat especially liver which ought only to be given occasionally is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea looseness Do not give your pet too many tit bits at table but whatever else you give her never neglect to let her have her two regular meals Never give a cat food in an unwashed dish DRINK It will save you a great deal of trouble if you have a proper dish for pussy s drink and let it stand constantly in the same corner of the room It must be a double dish that is two saucers joined together one for water and the other for milk and remember it must be carefully cleaned every morning for a highly bred cat will not drink milk if it is the least unsavoury nor water unless it is pure and free from dust It perhaps is not very generally known that cats nearly always prefer pure water to milk when they are really thirsty A great treat for pussy when she is a little bit seedy of a morning perhaps after having been on the spree all night and the best of cats will go on the spree occasionally is a saucer of nice creamy milk made warm with water and slightly sweetened with sugar It sets her all to rights straight away and you will not find her ungrateful for such kindness HOUSING It is not at all an uncommon practice in some parts of the country for people to turn their cats out at night before they themselves retire to rest They do so they will tell you to prevent pussy from misbehaving in the house Now such a practice cannot be too severely condemned First and foremost no well trained cat unless under the most extreme circumstances such as sudden illness et cetera will make any filth in the house where she resides for as I have said before there is no animal in the world more cleanly in its habits than the domestic cat Secondly the practice of turning pussy out of doors at night is the very thing to engender filthy habits in her during the day And lastly people who treat their cats in this manner are accountable for all the weight of crime that falls upon pussy s shoulders Badly housed cats become vagrants and thieves poor starved looking beggarly brutes and adepts at all mischief besides being unhealthy ugly and filled with fleas These are the cats that plunder pigeon lofts steal chickens tear up beautiful flower beds and murder valuable rabbits in cold blood They Sleep all day and wake all night And keep the country round in fright A cat that has been well fed and cared for by day will seldom want to go out at night If she does not feel sleepy she will betake herself to the cellar and have a little innocent flirtation with the mice or rats or kill cock roaches when everything else fails her Make your pussy s bed on a couch or on the parlour sofa or let her make it herself Apropos of making beds the other night I was lying on the sofa prior to turning into bed I had lowered the gas and admitted the moonlight when Muffie entered apparently in a great hurry to go to sleep Seeing her master lying there she placed her two forepaws on the sofa and looking in my face Will you kindly get up out of that and let me lie down she said speaking with her eyes Not till I m ready I ll see you hanged first replied I speaking with mine Very well then said pussy and she went straight to the table jumped up and pulled off the cloth deliberately rolled herself in it and went to sleep She pulled down the ink along with it and soiled the carpet but that was a matter for me and my landlady to settle between us puss did not care a rat Never turn your cat out at night unless she asks to go Never shut her up in a room all night but let her have free access to kitchen or attic you will thus have a healthy cleanly puss and never be troubled with mice The simplest form of medicine for a cat and one which either in town or country they should never want is grass It is an excellent anti scorbutic keeps pussy s blood pure and acts always as a gentle laxative and at times as an emetic according to the quantity taken and of this pussy herself is the best judge In the country a cat can always find grass for herself but in the town it ought to be given to her People who are cat fanciers should never take a walk into the country without culling a bunch of nice fresh grass for pussy When you go home the best place to keep it will be the cellar or lumber room to which pussy has access held fast by the ends between two flat stones or bricks a bit of wetted flannel being placed beneath the upper stone to keep the grass fresh and the cat will soon know where to go when she finds the need for it Although good and regular food with proper attention will generally succeed in keeping your cats healthy still these animals have many troubles which call for medical aid I give a very few of the commonest with the treatment appropriate for each Diarrhoea This for obvious reasons is a very troublesome complaint in a cat It is generally induced by irregular feeding or exposure to wet and cold Fat meat will also bring it on or too much liver It very soon reduces the creature to a mere skeleton and if not attended to will end in dysentery and death Begin the treatment by giving the little patient half a small teaspoonful of castor oil Give a still smaller dose about six hours after to which two drops of laudanum or solution of muriate of morphiae has been added Afterwards give three times a day either a little chalk mixture with half a drop of laudanum in each dose or a teaspoonful of the following mixture R Vin Ipecac doctor j Tinct Kino doctor iij Decoct Haematox oz iv Give no flesh diet you may give the cat fish however in small quantities and arrowroot with bread and milk A few drops of solution of lime may be added to each diet with advantage In diarrhoea and in all cases of severe illness the cat should be turned into an empty room with a little fire a warm bed and a box of earth or sand To give a cat medicine Roll her all but the head in a sheet and get some one to hold her Do not alarm her if possible mind your fingers and pour the medicine little by little down her throat If a pill or bolus dip it in oil and put it well down and against the roof of her mouth Chronic inflammation of the stomach This is a frequent disease among cats It often follows the administration of poison supposing the cat to have escaped immediate death She refuses nearly all food has frequent attacks of vomiting gets thin and altogether unhealthy looking without any apparent cause In these cases I generally recommend the trisnitrate of bismuth about a grain to be placed on the tongue twice a day Occasional doses of castor oil or tincture of rhubarb with milk diet and fish and if there be much wasting raw beef may be given twice a day Bronchitis Cats are very subject to this complaint as they are very liable to catch cold especially if much exposed It begins with the symptoms of a common cold such as staring coat shivering and slight cough Then the cat becomes very ill for a day or two with the acute stage of the trouble which however soon passes into the chronic form There is now apparent difficulty of breathing the cat is constantly coughing with the tongue hanging over the lower lip she has an anxious expression about her face and the eyes water and are mattery She gets rapidly thinner and moons about refusing all food or at times eating voraciously and with depraved appetite Treatment Begin by giving a simple dose of castor oil if no diarrhoea present if so the dose to be combined with two drops of laudanum Confine her to the house and feed her on beef tea and bread or milk arrowroot with beef tea If the disease becomes chronic I know of no medicine better than Extr Conii Pil Scillae company a a gr xv made into a bolus with sufficient bread crumb the bolus to be divided into twenty pills and one given every night Keep up her strength and complete the cure by a small tea spoonful of cod liver oil twice a day for a fortnight This latter often acts like a charm A certain form of mange often accompanies the disease Consumption This is not necessarily although often a lung disease in cats Whatever disease induces general wasting of the body deterioration of pelage an unhealthy state of the system with refusal of or distaste for food if there be no bilious vomiting may be called consumption The treatment which in most cases is successful is regulation of diet careful housing and attention raw meat in small quantities twice a day and cod liver oil twice or thrice a day Cod liver oil must be the sheet anchor in these cases but if there is much cough a little mixture like the following will not fail to give relief R Tinct Opii Camph doctor j Syr Scillae doctor jss Sol Mur Morphiae m x Aquae cum Syrupo ad oz ij M A teaspoonful occasionally Fits Cats are subject to various sorts of fits delirious and otherwise The great thing is to give instant relief Try first a common smelling salts bottle held to the nostrils or a pinch of dry snuff if that does no good pussy must be bled I make a minute incision on the lower part of the ear behind with a fine pointed lancet and then foment with a sponge and hot water The after treatment will depend much on the condition of the cat If too fat or heavy the diet must be lowered and regulated sheep s liver and melt being given three times a week if she is thin and emaciated we must trust to plenty of milk and raw meat with cod liver oil with one tenth of a grain of quinine twice a day If the cat be subject to fits the following will be found useful R Bromid Potass gr x Iod Potass gr ijss Zinci Sulph gr iv Mix with bread crumb to form twenty pills and give one morning and night Mange I merely use this term because it is a handy one Cats never have mange as found in the dog but they have many kinds of skin diseases both pustular and scaly They may all be treated in a similar manner Attention to diet let it be nourishing moderate in quantity and not heating Let the cat have plenty of exercise and free access to grass A lotion of carbolic acid may be used with advantage not stronger than one part of the acid to seventy of water It must be very carefully mixed and washed off again in two or three hours Afterwards an ointment of sulphur and hellebore may be used which any chemist will make for you and arsenic must be given internally The liquor arsenicalis is the medicine to be used drop six drops into an ounce bottle of water and give pussy one teaspoonful twice a day in her milk There is no taste with the medicine Continue this for a fortnight then omit for three days and resume again until a cure is effected and the hair begins to grow again The Yellows This disease is often as fatal in the dog as in the cat It is caused by derangement of the liver and is most common in large overfed cats which get little exercise The disease is ushered in by general feverishness loss of appetite and shivering Sickness next comes on accompanied by vomiting of a bright yellow or dark green fluid mixed with froth The vomiting continues and is at times very distressing and diarrhoea and dysentery may supervene and cause death If taken in time give her about half a small tea spoonful of glauber salts well diluted with water This even if it should cause vomiting will thereby do good by clearing the stomach besides the shock may tend to check the fever If the vomiting continues try a pinch of white bismuth placed on the tongue or from one to three drops of laurel leaf water or take one drop of creasote a few grains of aromatic powder and sufficient fresh bread crumb to form ten pills and give one three times a day Give for four or five nights half a grain of calomel on the tongue and if much diarrhoea is present give her a grain of white bismuth three times a day with one or two drops of laudanum at night and complete the cure by infinitesimal doses of quinine with cod liver oil and raw meat if there be much emaciation Dysentery This is a very serious complaint and nearly always fatal It is best treated by castor oil to begin with afterwards minute doses of opium and ipecacuanha with generous diet and occasionally a little port wine Milk Fever On no account should a cat s kittens be taken from her all at once Indeed one should always be left to be reared In milk fever the paps are swollen and painful the secretion of milk is suppressed and the cat is either highly excited sometimes attempting to kill her kittens or dull and stupid like A little bleeding will give relief if there is delirium The tits are to be well fomented with warm water and a little wine given occasionally with cream Three or four drops of compound tincture of camphor twice a day will tend to allay irritability Inflammation of one or both eyes is not uncommon among cats either through injury or from cold Remedy A lotion of sulphate of zinc two grains to an ounce of water or a few grains of common alum in warm water as a fomentation will generally effect a cure For ulcers and sores of external ears or cheeks touch them occasionally with blue stone and apply R Sulph Zinci gr x Tinct Lavandula doctor j Aquae oz iv If they are very inveterate they will only yield to red precipitate ointment and arsenic internally as for mange Cats stand operations of all sorts well If a cat s leg is broken and lacerated by a trap cut it off Don t be afraid Only leave sufficient flesh to cover the bone and have ready a strong red hot wire to cauterize and stop bleeding then bring the flaps together by a needle and thread Many cats die of apoplexy many of paralysis I have dissected some who had well marked softening of the brain And many die in their sleep As a general rule if your cat seems ailing you can t do wrong to give her an emetic try a little weak salt and water or let her have fresh grass and either a dose of castor oil or a very little grey powder I have often seen cats lives saved by giving raw beef and cod liver oil When a cat is in bad health either her stomach bowels liver or kidneys are out of order and as a rule we can generally only conjecture which A medicine therefore that acts gently but effectively on all the organs would be a sort of specific for cats complaints In the Cat s Medicine Chest advertised at the end of this book I have placed a medicament of this nature which I have often prescribed with excellent results There is everything in that little box to make a Pussy well and keep her happy CHAPTER VIII ODDS AND ENDS When my pet cat read the heading of this chapter she sarcastically remarked Humph I suppose you mean that cats tails are the ends but what s the odds Theodore Nero raised his chin slightly from the carpet to add So long s you re happy You brute said Muffie You don t know what you re talking about you always are half asleep But touching cats tails it wouldn t be the best policy to touch every cat s tail however a lady asked me seriously at dinner the other day Why does a cat waggle its tail Such a question at such a time was a poser and to comfort me she added that she really was asking for information I answered as Dundreary Becauth a cat ith sthronger than its tail if the tail wath the sthronger the tail would waggle the cat Cats are extremely proud of their tails Pulling a Jew s beard and a cat s tail are indignities of an equality Doubtless did mankind possess these appendages he would be equally jealous of their honour But they have been overlooked somehow in the outfitting But just imagine how gingerly we gentlemen would use them How elegantly we would carry them under our arms while walking and how we would flare up if any one trod on our tail Imagine Paddy at a fair Twelve o clock and no foight yet Will any gintleman just spit on the point of my tail How useful too tails would be in many ways in riding driving or boating On a rainy day one s umbrella might be tied to it so as to have both hands free and in mobs and crowds it could be worn out of sight How handy to dig your neighbour in the ribs with and say Sly dog or Don t you see don t you see when you d made a bad pun How useful to the orator for elegant gesticulation to give point to an argument or to indicate derision For example Lord Chief Justice Did you poke your tail at me sir Claimant No my lord I L C J Very well sir don t do it again that s all How convenient the British sailor would find a tail when aloft reefing topsails and sure wouldn t Jack also use it as a tobacco stopper If men had tails the medical profession would be benefited thereby There would be several new diseases and new operations How beautifully this would sound for instance Compound comminuted fracture of the middle third of caudal extremity or Amputation at the tenth caudal vertebra which would give rise to advertisements like the following Turner s Circular Splint and Beautiful easy fitting Caudal Appendages equal to Nature patronised by the illustrious Duke of Dunmore whose tail was carried away by a five hundred pounder at the battle of Dorking during the famous charge of the gallant London Scottish Only seven and six The ends of justice too would be assisted New laws would be added to the penal code Garotters would be condemned to Two years imprisonment and deprivation of caudicity Lesser offences punished by Six months and six inches off tail Thus we should easily know a rogue in the street when we met one I must stop I feel I should warm to the subject and one of such vast ramifications ought to have more space for its consideration than I can afford However to band masters acrobats public speakers parsons painters and policemen tails would indeed be invaluable and upon my honour when I come to think of it I only wonder how human beings have come to be overlooked in this little matter Cats it may be observed wag their tails when pleased when angry they lash them and when excited and about to spring on their prey the tail quivers This is all involuntary on the part of pussy and is an index of the state of her feelings the tail being principally supplied with nerves from the spinal chord and along this chord the nervous force is carried from the brain Why do cats always fall on their feet This question is by no means difficult to answer When she first falls from a height her back is lowermost and she is bent in a semicircle If she fell thus fracture of the spine and death would be the inevitable result But natural instinct induces her after she has fallen a foot or two to suddenly extend the muscles of her back and stretch her legs the belly now becomes the convexity and the back concave thus altering the centre of gravity and bringing her round then she has only to hold herself in this position in order to alight on her feet One day lately a lady who lives in the fourth story of a house in Dundee hung the cage with the canary on a nail outside the window The cat from the inside watched it for some time till unable any longer to withstand the temptation she made a spring and somehow missing the cage fell to the ground some forty feet But she alighted on her feet and walked off as if nothing had occurred See Note R Addenda Cats are wonderfully sure footed I saw a cat one day taking an airing along a housetop where Blondin could hardly have walked without a pole She had a kitten in her mouth too to make her performance all the more entertaining Another puss I saw sitting on an iron rail a few feet from the ground and apparently fast asleep The rail was only about one inch in diameter and she sat there fully an hour Very few cats care to drink spirituous liquors Dogs are not so particular One dog I had once on board ship a Labrador retriever used to attend the call of Grog O every day and get his allowance along with the men He never got drunk though and he showed his wisdom by taking it well watered I know a little bull terrier bitch who goes to a hotel every day she has a chance Her favourite tipple is beer poured upon a salver As she cannot speak she sits in a chair and thinks a lot As she always meets plenty of friends willing to stand treat she never comes home sober I saw her a few weeks ago trying in vain to cross the street At last she sat down in the middle and barked to me I was sorry to see a well bred young lady in such a condition so I helped her home for which she showed gratitude next day See Note S Addenda But my father had a cat a big Tom whom the servants used to make drunk at any time His beverage was Scotch whiskey brose i e oatmeal and whiskey and I ve seen him come staggering into the parlour and tumble over the leg of the table Then he would fall asleep Cats as a rule do not like music although if brought up in a musical family they learn to tolerate it A cat is easily taught to come when whistled upon A friend of mine has a cat who if he commences to whistle a tune immediately jumps on his breast and rubs her head all over his face as if trying to comfort him having the notion no doubt that he is in some sort of anguish But if he puts out his hand to take down his fiddle in her presence she at once erects her back and tail and growls at him in unmistakable anger However in this she shows her good taste for her master is certainly the most execrable performer that ever tickled hair on gut There are many old superstitions regarding cats still extant and many foolish notions about them that had much better be unlearned Sailors believe that if the ship s cat be lost overboard shipwreck or some such disaster is almost sure to follow My own old captain Commander McH was imbued with this notion hence his extreme care to retain the black cat on board as depicted in the tale which follows this Chapter The Skipper s Imp Witches are supposed by some to be constantly attended by an evil spirit in the shape of a black cat To dream of cats is considered very unlucky In some of the more unfrequented districts of Scotland the good folks are still very careful to shut up their cats in the house on Hallowe en i e the thirty first of October And they tell me that those cats that have managed to escape incarceration that night may be seen by those brave enough to look scampering over hill and dell and across the lonely moors each one ridden by a brownie a bogle a spunkie or some other infernal jockey in fact a devil s own steeplechase And they say those cats never produce young again or if they do the sooner the kittens are put out of sight the better they are subject to startings in their sleep no wonder have a weird unearthly look about their eyes and soon pine away and die and go we shudder to say whither Cats are supposed to be capital prognosticators of the weather If a cat is seen washing her face with more than usual assiduity it is going to be stormy and if pussy sits much with her back to the fire you may expect frost and snow in winter and thunder and lightning with hail in summer Some portion of pussy s person seems indeed to retain the power of foretelling the weather even after death as witness that common toy which poor people use instead of a barometer a wee wee man and a wee wee woman living together in a wee wee house one of them pops out every day if the day is to be fine the lady comes if not like a loving wife she sends her good man out the secret is the little couple are suspended on catgut which twists or untwists according to the state of the atmosphere Illustration LONG HAIRED BLACK First Prize Owned by MISS ARMITAGE Illustration MANX First Prize Owned by P WILLIAMS esquire There is a very common popular fallacy regarding cats sucking an infant s breath and killing it The idea is simply preposterous Cats being extremely fond of children naturally like to get into the cradle to lie beside and watch them They often crouch upon the child s breast this may impede breathing more or less according to the relative size of the cat to the baby If the cat actually sits upon the child s face then indeed the poor creature may be suffocated But such an occurrence is so very rare that it is hardly worth mentioning Many more deaths occur from bad arrangement of a baby s pillow in which case the mother must be glad when there is a cat to put the blame upon Cats have any amount of wiliness about them A dog would scarcely think of hiding below a bush until its prey came within reach but cats are adepts at an ambuscade A cat knows by experience that a bird say a sparrow looks almost in every direction saving directly beneath it and so pussy always steals a march on it from below If a bird is foolish enough to alight on the top of a clothes pole pussy has a very easy victory It is that same habit of never looking downwards which causes those large birds which alight on a ship s yards at sea to be so easily captured by the sailors Instances of jealousy are by no means uncommon in the feline race Jealousy is an indication of a sensitive nature and no animal in the world is more sensitive than a cat A lady had a pretty little pussy which she had saved from drowning This cat was excessively fond of its mistress was never absent from her while in the house and outside used to follow her like a dog But in course of time this lady bought a parrot and pussy must have thought her mistress was paying the bird too much attention for all of a sudden the cat s nature seemed entirely changed It did not respond to the lady s caresses it would sit for an hour at the time looking with gathered brows at the parrot and instead of accompanying her mistress abroad she remained sulking in doors In truth the cat was breaking her heart her glossy fur got dry and rough and at last she refused all food so as she really loved her cat this lady parted with her parrot although with great reluctance Pussy recovered at once the effect seemed magical and in a few days she was herself again the same fun loving frolicsome loving wee cat she had been before A gentleman had a cat whom he called Pimento the pimento tree the reader will remember is said to permit no rival plant to grow within its shade There was another cat in the same house but Pimento although otherwise a nice cat and gentle and loving in the extreme would never allow his master to pay the slightest attention to this cat If he did there was a row at once and if his master protected the other cat then Pimento at once left the room growling and in high dudgeon See Note T Addenda In a house where I resided says a correspondent see Note U Addenda there were two cats a young and an old one The young one was a smart clever animal with a decided turn for humour the other liked to be taken notice of One day I was paying some attention to the latter which of course was highly pleased With tail erect it walked backward and forward The young one which had been pretending to be asleep suddenly seized hold of the tail of the other with its paw gave it a sharp pull and was again in a sleeping attitude ere the other had time to look round The old one turned about saw the young one apparently asleep and me laughing It immediately retired to a corner of the room thinking no doubt that I was a double villain Did the reader ever observe how very fond cats are of sitting on paper One can hardly have a pet puss and not observe this trait If you have a book in your lap up jumps Pussy and seats herself right on top of it If you are writing a letter Pussy creeps along the table singing so that you can hardly be angry with her and places herself on the writing materials My present puss prefers the Daily Telegraph to anything else for a bed at night or to have her kittens on indeed if the Standard is lying on the same sofa and she gets on to it by mistake she will very soon get off and on to the Telegraph Are cats revengeful Never as a rule Yet they do sometimes display little pettish outbursts of temper They would not be like women if they did not do that A lady tells me that when she is writing her cat will sometimes come and plant herself right in the way and when gently pushed off she suddenly loses her temper and pitches the writing materials right and left on to the floor The following anecdote is highly illustrative of the kind and quantity of pussy s revenge Now for the story of the cat she was a lovely black and white Kabul cat the same as Persian with hair like floss silk as long as one s finger and as wise as a great many human beings She had a great dislike to roast mutton cold and when I had nothing else to offer her her resentment was most marked she refused my caresses and walked straight off to my dressing room where on the top of the chest of drawers stood my bonnet box She jumped up and administered slaps to the box until it fell on the floor when she would come away at once her revenge being gratified This occurred on several occasions and only when she was offered a cold mutton dinner Was not the knowledge of what would distress my feminine feelings a wonderful piece of intelligence We quite looked out for it after the first few times and would watch her walking off to my room and then in a minute or two there would be bump bump and my husband would say There goes your bonnet See Note V Addenda I only know one instance of what might be called revenge proper It was a large black cat of the name of Imp The poor fellow was exceedingly ill used by the servant maid who used to beat him on every occasion possible Imp s dislike to the girl was very great although he evidently was afraid to attack her but one day this servant was coming downstairs with a tray of dishes and seeing both her hands full Imp thought he ought not to miss such a golden opportunity for retaliation He accordingly flew at her and scratched both her arms and face severely So we see that cats although gentle and forgiving in the extreme to those who love them do not easily forget an injury from the hands of a stranger or cat hater See Note W Addenda The reader must have often heard that cats seem to possess some wonderful instinct which enables them to predict certain kinds of coming calamities such as earthquakes and different sorts of explosion Personally I know one instance of this although I cannot explain it viz our ship s cat taking to the rigging and sitting on the main truck before our vessel was discovered to be on fire Another I have from my grandfather an officer in the first Royals at the time of the last Anglo Franco war My grandmother was bending down taking something from a chest on the floor when suddenly the whole window was blown to splinters dust almost around her with the thunder of some dreadful explosion It was a transport that had entered the harbour Kiel I think some days before laden with war munitions and which had blown up with all hands But it was remarked by every one on the quay that the ship s cat had been sitting all the morning of the explosion on the vessel s main truck Cats are sometimes very fond of horses I know an instance of this where the stable cat was very much attached to a certain horse and that animal evidently reciprocated the cat s kindly feelings And Pussy used to stand quietly and allow the horse to lick her fur the wrong way and indeed seemed to enjoy it See Note G Addenda We all know how proud Miss Puss is of her song Barring a certain drowsy monotony which acts like a narcotic both on herself and kittens and at times even on human beings there isn t much melody in it however This power of singing becomes lost in sickness and also in extreme old age I know of a cat of very advanced years that had given up singing for many a day until a kitten a famous musician in its way came to reside at her house Then poor old Pussy tried hard to get out a bar or two and her efforts to succeed were quite ludicrous Being laughed at she flew into a passion and put her spite out on the happy little kitten The more this spirited pussy was thrashed however the louder it sang so the old cat left the room in disgust The days and years of a cat s life are on an average fourteen but many live very much longer Fifteen and seventeen are very common ages for Pussy to die at The longest time I have ever known a cat live was till its twenty second year but I have heard of them dying at the age of thirty It is quite a common thing for a cat to feed itself with milk or cream by dipping her forepaw in the jug and then licking it Pussy is very awkward at drinking water from a crystal tumbler At first she will generally thrust her head too far in which will make her sneeze then she will sit and eye the glass for a time as if considering how far the water comes up Not content with ocular demonstration she will next put a paw cautiously in until the extreme end of her toes touches the water and thus after marking the distance she can drink in comfort A certain cat which had been reared on the spoon used when full grown to sit up on her hind legs and reaching down the spoon to her mouth with her paws swallow the contents The same cat used to drink milk if poured into her mouth from a jug or any dish with a spout to it So expert at that trick did she become that sitting up as usual she used to receive and swallow a continuous stream poured into her throat from a height of three feet See Note X Addenda For the subject matter of the remainder of this chapter I am indebted to a lady who takes a great interest in feline nature See Note H Addenda It is certain she says that cats have some strange instinct that sends them when lost or starving to certain people They have followed me in gay crowded streets and met me in fields I have gone into shops and bought milk and rolls for the starvelings and have gone again to the same place and they were gone doubtless cats on the tramp and destitute I have known a friend s cat lost for five days and it never attempted to make its sorrows known until I passed before the window of an underground room when her shrieks were horrible to hear and so prolonged that the passers by stopped to listen I remained speaking to the poor creature whose claws were rattling against the shut door until the key was brought and pussy set free She relates an instance of a young surgeon who was on his way to join his ship to sail to the antipodes and who was followed to the very boat by a pretty little kitten As it seemed bent on being a sailor the surgeon put the poor thing in his pocket It was presented to a lady on board who was interested in its story and is now doing duty among the cats of South Australia a country by the bye where cats are more fully appreciated than here Beda was a beautiful blue tabby One summer s morning down in Devon she had been missed for hours and on being called a viper glided out from a thicket in the garden closely followed by the cat The snake until killed by a lady kept moving off but every moment turning round and hissing at Beda who however was in no ways put about The following also tends to show that cats have no fear of snakes At Artea in the province of Orissa a cobra had his den under a mulberry tree near a garden walk One day our English tabby cat Beda had been missing with all her kits for some hours She was found at the foot of the mulberry tree teaching her children to pat the cobra on the head every time he popped it out When the head was protruded too far a stroke from puss herself caused its speedy withdrawal Thinking the game dangerous the cobra which measured two inches in diameter was dug out and killed We were afterwards told by the natives that no snake will kill a cat as they dislike the fur Cats are like dogs and generally have a favourite among the litter the handsomest Once when Beda was nursing in India a wild cat sprang in by the open window and tried to seize the kittens Beda made off with her pet and the wild cat was beaten out Beda however forgot where she had hidden the favourite nor would she be consoled with the other members of her family A search was accordingly made and the pet kitten at last found on a sofa in an adjoining bungalo This lady s cat never attempted to touch the canary nor indeed any birds about the place CHAPTER IX THE TWO MUFFIES A TALE While I was yet a little school boy there came about my father s house and premises a plague of rats They came in their thousands as if summoned by the trumpet tones of a rodentine Bradlaugh or Odger They took the farm yard and outhouses by storm laid siege to the dwelling house and from the thoroughly business like manner they conducted their operations and went into winter quarters it was quite evident they meditated a stay of some duration Sappers and miners or royal engineers were employed to drive tunnels and galleries under every floor with passages leading to the grain lofts above Foraging parties were appointed to every stack of corn and rick of hay The henhouse was laid under contribution to furnish eggs and feathers and black mail was levied from the very cows The eaves of the well thatched barns and byres were apportioned to their wives their aged and infirm while the poor sparrows were dislodged from their comfortable well lined nests to make room for little naked baby rats and so effectually was every department worked and so well did every branch of the service do its duty that Cardwell himself nay even Bismarck Moltke company could not have suggested anything in the way of improvement At all these doings my honest father looked very blue and employed his time principally in expending various sums of money in vermin killers and in reading works on toxicology The result of his study was that many tempting morsels and savoury tit bits were placed in convenient corners for the benefit of the invaders It seemed indeed for their benefit they didn t care a straw for tartar emetic appeared to get fat on arsenic while strychnia only strengthened their nervous systems and morphia made them fierce Now Gibbie was the house cat a very large and beautiful red tabby In his prime he had been a perfect Nimrod of the feline race Scorning such feeble game as the domestic mouse his joy was to ramble free and unfettered among the woods and forests by the loneliest spots at the river s brink and among the mountains and rocks often prolonging his hunting excursions for days together but never returning without a leveret or fine young rabbit These fruits of the chase he did not always bring home but often presented to his various human friends in the adjoining village for Gibbie was known far and near and even his lordship s surly old gamekeeper though he raised his gun at the sight of the cat forbore to fire when he saw who the bold trespasser was Many a rare and beautiful bird did Gibbie carry home alive among others I remember a beautiful specimen of the corn crake nor can I forget pussie s manifest disgust when the bird was allowed to fly away Just two days after he brought home a crow but this time the head was wanting By the banks of the Denburn he one day fought and slew a large pole cat this he carefully skinned and dragged home Gibbie was as well known in the country side as the witch wife or the pack merchant and more respected than either and people often came to our house to beg for ae nicht o Gibbie as the rottens rats at their town farm were gettin raither thrang and cheeky The loan was always granted Gibbie go was all my mother would say and off trotted puss by the party s side with his tail gaily on the perpendicular for he knew as well as cat could that rare sport and a rich treat of the sweetest cream would be the reward of his compliance But Gilbert did not confine himself to hunting only he was an expert fisher For hours he would watch at one spot on the banks of a river with his eyes riveted on the water until some unhappy trout came out to bask in the sun s rays This was Gibbie s opportunity For a moment only his lips and tail quivered with extreme anxiety then down swift as Solan goose he had dived with aim unerring and seized his finny prey with which he came quietly to bank and trotted off homewards to enjoy the delicious morsel in some quiet corner all to himself Rabbits hares and game of all kinds Gibbie parted with freely but a trout was a treat and he never shared it with man or mortal But Gibbie was now old Nineteen summers had come and gone since he had sky larked with his mother s tail and his limbs had waxed stiff and his once bright eyes were dimmed He seldom went to the woods now and when he did he returned sorrowfully and minus He preferred to dose by the parlour fire or nurse his rheumatism before the kitchen grate and while nodding over the embers many a scene I warrant of his earlier years came to his recollection and many a stirring adventure by flood and field stole vividly back to memory and thus he d fight his battles o er again and kill his rabbits thrice Gibbie said my father one day thoughtfully removing his pipe from his mouth Gibbie you ve got some game in you yet old boy Oh aye said Gibbie for he was the pink of politeness and never failed to reply when civilly addressed Well continued my father you shall have a good supper and a night among the rats in the grain loft Wurram replied the cat which doubtless meant that he was perfectly willing and that it would be a bad job for the rats So the programme was duly carried out and Master Gilbert was shut up among the foe Early in the morning my father who had not closed an eye all the night opened the door and lame and bleeding out limped his old favourite shaking his poor head raw with wounds in the most pitiful manner possible The brave beast had fought like a tiger all the night long nearly two score of rats lay dead around while the blood lay in pools on the decks with as much hair and fluff as if a dozen Kilkenny cats had been contending for victory and got it That night s ratting proved fatal to old Gibbie The dreadful wounds he had received never healed and after much deliberation it was determined that an end should be put to the poor animal s sufferings So honest Hughoc the stable boy was sent with Gibbie in a bag to drown him Is he gone said my mother anxiously when he returned And we bairns were all in tears Gone ma am replied Hughoc aye if he had been a horse and beggin your pardon a deevil forbye the river would hae ta en him doon sic a spate flood I never saw in my born days Notwithstanding all this Gibbie was at that moment finishing the contents of his saucer and drying his wet sides before the sitting room fire and when we entered he was singing a song to himself like the ancient philosopher he was But the poor cat lived but one short week longer He died as bardie Burns has it a fair strae death in his own nook and was slowly and sadly laid to rest beneath an aged rowan tree at the end of the garden And the berries on that tree grew redder ever after at least we thought so but we never dared to taste or touch them they were sacred to the memory of poor dead and gone Gibbie In the meantime the plague of rats continued unabated and their ravages seemed rather to increase than diminish But their reign was nearly at an end One day my father received the joyful intelligence that a splendid young lady kitten was in need of a comfortable home salary no object Away with a basket trudged my little brother and self and after a long walk came to young pussy s residence and had the satisfaction of finding both kitten and mistress at home The former indeed a beauty and faultlessly marked was engaged alternately in drinking butter milk and washing her face before a small looking glass Aye my bonnie bairn I was the bonnie bairn not my brother she s a perfect wee angel and ye maun be good till her ye maunna pu her by the tail and ye maun gie her lots o milk and never let her want for a lookin glass We promised to grudge her nothing that could in any way conduce to her happiness and comfort and were allowed to carry her off Before we reached home we had taken her from the basket and with all the solemnity the occasion demanded baptized her in a running stream and called her name Muffie Once fairly established in her new quarters the kit lost no time in commencing hostilities against the rats and blood not butter milk became her war cry One day as she sat admiring herself in the glass a large rat unexpectedly appeared in the kitchen and although but little larger than himself Kittie at once gave chase not only to his hole but into his hole For the next three minutes the squeaking was quite harrowing to listen to but presently pussy re appeared stern foremost and dragging with her the rat dead This she deposited before the fire growling whenever any one went near it as much as to say Lay but a finger on it and you yourself may expect to pay the same penalty for your rashness The little thing indeed seemed swelling with pride and importance and must have felt considerably bigger than an ordinary sized ox and as fierce as a Bengal tiger In one moment she had bounded from kit to cat hood Buttermilk and a looking glass Bah Blood alone could satisfy her ambition now Little Muffie was left that night in sole charge of the kitchen and next morning no less than five large rats lay side by side on the hearth as if waiting a post mortem and wee pussie with her white breast dabbled in gore exhausted and asleep lay beside them In less than a week she had bagged upwards of forty and no doubt wounded twice that number And now fear and consternation began to spread in the enemies camp Such doings had never been heard of among them even traditionally The oldest inhabitant shook his grey muzzle and gave it up but added Friends brethren rodents it is time to shift No one knows whose turn may come next True it is a pity to leave such jolly quarters when everything was going on so pleasantly We have seen our fattest wives and our biggest braves borne off our helpless babes have not been safe from the clutches of that dreaded monster with the ferocity of a fiend in the skin of a mouse and lest worst befall us go we must And go they did Old Tom Riddle the parish clerk who might have been seen any night staggering homewards in the short hours was well nigh scared out of the little wits that remained to him by meeting as he said Thoosands upon thoosands o rottens haudin up the road in the direction o the farm o Brockenclough Confoond it he added when some one ventured to cast a doubt on his statement wasn t it bright moonlicht and didn t I see them wi my ain een carryin their wee anes in their mooths and leadin their blin wi a strae Whether old Tom exaggerated or not is hard to say but sure enough next morning there was not a rat to be seen or heard about my father s premises and it is likewise correct that about the same time the honest farmer of Brockenclough began to complain loudly of the destruction by these gentry of his straw and oats He liked he said to see a few o the beasties rinnin aboot a farm toon That was a sign o plenty but when they could be counted by the score it fairly beat cock fechtin For the next twelve months of her existence Muffie led a very quiet and peaceful life She was now in her prime and a more beautifully marked tabby it would have been difficult to imagine but as yet no male of her species had gained her youthful affections But her time soon came for strolling one day in the woods trying to pick up a nice fat linnet for her dinner Muffie met her fate and her fate followed her home even to the garden gate then darted off again to his native woodland His history was briefly this He was not born of respectable parentage and I question too whether his parents were at all more honest than they ought to have been His mother was a half wild animal brought by a half cracked colonel from the West Indies and she bore him in the woods and there she suckled and reared him and it was no doubt owing to the wild gipsy life he led and the amount of freedom and fresh air he enjoyed that he grew so fine an animal At any rate I never have seen his match An immense red tabby he was with short ears on a massive head splendid eyes and a tail that no wild cat need have been ashamed of Muffie and her lover used to hold their meetings in the ruins of an old house near a wood and my brothers and I made a rash vow to attempt the capture of the beautiful stranger in this same building Accordingly one fine moonlight night missing Lady Muff and guessing she was on the spoon we sallied out and made our way to the ruin My brothers were told off to guard the door and windows and on me alone devolved the somewhat unpleasant duty of bagging the cat With this intention I entered as cautiously as a mouse and sure enough there sat the happy pair contentedly on the cold hearthstone So engrossed were they in looking at each other that they never perceived me until quite close upon them With the agility of a young monkey I threw myself on the Tom cat and seized him by the back That is exactly what I did His proceedings were somewhat different and considerably more to the point for after making his four teeth meet in the fleshy part of my middle finger he slid from my grasp like a conger eel and went hand over hand up the chimney followed by the justly indignant Lady Muff and I was left lamenting For the next six weeks I had the satisfaction of going to school with my arm in a sling I say satisfaction because my misfortune was the cause of a great alteration in the manner of the schoolmaster towards me Previously it was usual with me to be thrashed ter die and well shaken which was not at all nice on a winter s day but now all this was changed and I was not beaten at all The pedagogue spoke to me subduedly and with a certain amount of conciliatory awe in his manner and I observed that he always kept a chair or form between my person and his lest I should at any time take hydrophobia without giving sufficient warning and bite the poor man Seeing how well the sling worked I did not hesitate to wear it for fully a month after my hand was quite healed with the exception of the cicatrices which the grave only will obliterate Although beaten in our first efforts we did not give up the idea of capturing this vagabond Tom tabby yet it was only through the instrumentality of Muffie we eventually succeeded We kept her at home put a saucer full of creamy milk in a shady nook of the garden for her lover and whenever he appeared which he always did at the hour of gloaming his betrothed was permitted to meet him and although he invariably beseeched her to fly with him she was prevented from acceding to his very reasonable request by being tethered to a gooseberry bush by a long string Love and time tamed this feline Ingomar He left his abode in the forest exchanged the wild wood s shade for the stable s roof bartered his freedom for the ties of matrimony or catrimony in short he married Muffie adopted civilisation and became barn cat par excellence But no amount of persuasion could ever entice him into the dwelling house nor did he ever suffer a human finger to pollute his fur I am sorry to say that Ingomar did not at all times behave well to his wife in fact at times he was a brute It was his pleasure that she should sit for hours together in the garden simply that he might look at her if she as much as hinted at retiring he treated her exactly as the Lancashire clod hoppers do their wives he knocked her down and jumped upon her Muffie had five bonnie kittens and she put them to bed on the parlour sofa Ingomar detested refinement as much as Rob Roy did The sons of McGregor weavers Bring those kittens forth and place them here on straw I will see to their rearing That is what Ingomar said and Muffie mutely complied and those kittens grew up as wild as himself From sparrows they got to chickens from chickens to grouse and game generally and then got into trouble with the keeper and had the worst of the argument which on his part was double barrelled In the early days of his betrothal Ingomar threw daisies at his beloved and gambolled with her in mimic strife but latterly his song was hushed at eventide and spits and clouts and flying fluff were too often the order of the day Poor Ingomar He was cut down in his prime slain by a wretched collie dog Slowly and sadly we bore him in his beautiful fur all dabbled in blood and his once bright eyes fast glazing in death and tenderly laid him at the widowed Muffie s feet Now listen to the remarkable behaviour of that lady The widowed Muffie did not weep neither in consequence of not weeping did she die she did an attitude though then growled and spat and spitting growled again and finally gave vent to her feelings by springing through the parlour window and escaping to the woods And here with shame and sorrow for female inconstancy but in the interests of truth be it written not only did Muffie not remain long a widow but that brief widowhood even was stained by many acts of levity to the memory of the murdered Ingomar His skin beautifully preserved by twelve that skin she did not hesitate to use as a mat nay she even gambolled with the tail of it and although she often paid a visit to her husband s grave it was not to weep she went there no but literally to dance on the top of it Such is life Such are relicts The rest of this pussy s life was entirely uneventful One circumstance only deserves relating She was exceedingly fond of me in fact quite adored me Oh that is nothing other females have done the same but Muffie did what I daresay other females wouldn t she at any time would eat a little bit of the end of a candle or a bit of greased peat from my hand while refusing beef steak or cream from any one else When I was sent to a distant school and could only visit my home once a week or fortnight the house bereft of me had no longer any charms for poor Muffie and she took to the woods Perhaps she enjoyed rambling amid scenes hallowed by the recollection of her early love She seldom returned home until the day of my accustomed arrival when she was always there to welcome me Now that she should have known the usual day for my appearance was nothing remarkable but it was strange that if anything interfered with my coming puss was also absent nor did my arrival on any other day prevent her from being at home at least an hour before me One day alas that one day that must come to all created things my Muffie was not there to meet me and she never came again After a long search I found her beneath a tree stark and stiff Her gentle eyes were closed for aye I would never feel again her soft caress nor hear her low loving purr dear Muffie was dead But dry your eyes gentle lady and listen to the story of MUFFIE THE SECOND I call my present cat Muffie partly in remembrance of my old favourite and partly because I think it such a cosy little name for a pet puss Bless her little heart she is sitting on my shoulder while I write and no slight burden either her fighting weight being something over twelve pounds A splendid tabby she is evenly and prettily marked her lovely face vandyked with white and her nose tipped with crimson like a mountain daisy She is six years of age and the mother of over one hundred kittens Three fourths of these have found respectable homes most of them were bespoken before birth and if they have only been half as prolific as their mother Muffie must be progenitor of thousands Illustration WHITE First Prize Owned by R H YOUNG esquire Illustration BLACK First Prize Owned by mister J HARPER A very ambitious kitten you were too my pretty Muff I first picked you up at an hotel when no bigger than a ball of worsted Your brothers and sisters and even your big ugly mother turned and fled but you stood and spat didn t you puss and that fetched me Your favourite seat too was the top of the parlour door and during the first twelve months of your existence sure didn t you tear to pieces three sets of window curtains didn t you smash all the flowerpots weren t you constantly clutching down the table cloth and breaking the china and glass running along the key board of the piano and jumping down the stool What chance did a silk umbrella stand with you What hope of existence had my patent leather boots Was it fair to catch flies on my Sunset on Arran before the paint was dry Was it right to upset my ink bottle on the table cloth or to break the head off my praying Samuel which head you coolly made a mouse of and finally hid in my shoe Or was it at all proper to make such earnest though happily unsuccessful endeavours to hook your master s eyes out as soon as he opened them in the morning But marriage sobered you Muffie and I never can forget the extreme joy you manifested on the birth of your first kittens Your first idea I m told was to make mousies of them then you thought of eating them But how anxiously you waited my arrival on that auspicious morning You came twice to my bedroom to hurry me down and I dared not stop to shave Then each kitten in succession was held up between your forepaws to receive its just meed of admiration But I hardly think Miss Muff your song of joy would have been quite so loud and jubilant had you known I was selecting two to drown And each succeeding period since then you have tried to have your kittens in my bed and twice you have been only too successful There now go down my shoulder aches besides I have to address the British public Muffie like her master has been a wanderer and she prefers it To her home and master are synonymous terms Were I to make my bed in the midst of a highland moor she would not desert me If I were to place my sea chest on the top of dark Loch na gar and that would be no easy matter and leave it there for a month I should find Muffie on the top of it when I returned It might very naturally be supposed that a cat would form but a poor travelling companion and be rather troublesome It is all custom I suppose Miss Muff at the smallest computation must have travelled nearly twenty thousand miles with me and she can always take care of herself much better than a dog can From constant experience she has become quite cosmopolitan in her habits On the evening before flitting day she is more than usually active ambling round and snuffing at each box as it is being packed and rubbing her shoulder against it singing all the while in a most exhilarating manner As night closes she as a rule with few exceptions disappears for a time going most likely to bid good bye to her friends whom she seldom sees again in this world but never fails to be back early in the morning when after a hurried breakfast she curls herself up in her little travelling creel and goes quietly off to sleep In a railway carriage or steam boat she is allowed to roam about at her own sweet will but by night her place is by her master s side and a more faithful watch he could not have On arriving at an hotel after dinner pussy is permitted to go out to see the place The first night of her sojourn in a strange town is always spent by Muffie in the open air and wonderful to relate she always enters in the morning by the front door although put out at the back How she can find her way round with accuracy sometimes a distance of half a mile of strange streets or how she can tell the hotel door from any other I cannot say but she does Once I gave her basket in charge of a railway porter at a London station to take upstairs while I got my own ticket and the dog s The poor fellow soon returned with bleeding face and hands to say that the cat had escaped and disappeared in the crowd There was no time to wait to look for her my luggage was on board and the train about to start so I hurried off to take my seat Very much to my surprise I was hailed from a first class carriage by my pet herself who appeared rejoiced to see me and indeed was much more calm and self possessed under the circumstances than her master Once in a strange town Liverpool Muffie disappeared in the most mysterious manner and was absent for three whole weeks From some words that I had heard the landlady s son drop I suspected foul play so I went straight to the offices of the City Scavengering Department to prefer a very modest request viz to have all the ashpits cleaned out within a certain radius of my lodgings All this work for a cat said the chief inspector Why such a thing has no precedent and he smiled at my cheek I suppose But said I you can make this case the precedent and it is so valuable a cat you know Aid came from an unexpected quarter One of the officers was a Scotchman and took my part like everything Valuable property he argued had been stolen and destroyed and if we should wait until the usual time for cleaning the ashpits all hope of putting the blame on the right party would be lost for ever What chance said his good natured chief have I against two of you So the order was given and the ash pits emptied This took two or three mornings work and many dead cats were found in fact every day I held a post mortem examination on one or two poor brutes and of course the men wanted a glass of grog so that the business cost me a power of rum But no dead Muffie appeared In the meantime I had to go to London without my puss and a few days after Lady Muff likewise arrived by train She had returned to my rooms at Liverpool exactly three weeks from the day she disappeared and had kittens one hour after Muffie I do not think ever killed a mouse although very fond of catching them All she cares for is the sport She invariably brings her little victim into my room and placing it on the hearth rug looks up in my face and mews as much as to say Just observe master the fun I shall have with this little cuss and see what a clever mouser your Muff is While she is saying this the mouse has escaped but is speedily recaptured and returned to the rug After throwing it up in the air two or three times and catching it before it falls the wee cowering timorous beastie is left to its own freedom Muffie walking away in a careless meditative sort of mood and the mousie makes good his escape Not finding a hole it hides below something from under which something it is soon raked out again and so the cruel game goes on till the trembling little creature with its shiny eyes grows sick with hope deferred and faints away Seeing this pussy after turning it over once or twice with mittened paw jumps on my shoulder with a fond purr rn and begins to sing The play is over and by and by the mouse revives and is graciously permitted to retire which it sets about doing with becoming modesty and an air at once subdued and deprecatory Muffie is still on my shoulder benignly singing Their eyes meet and a little dialogue ensues Mousie says with hers Oh please your ladyship may I go ma am I feel so all overish your claws are so sharp and your teeth so dreadful and I m but a little little mouse To which pussy replies Yes you may go I shan t eat you to day only don t do it again But why you ask should I permit such cruel sport Because intelligent and gentle reader any interference of mine would change the play from a comedy in the parlour to a tragedy in the cellar I have neither fishing nor hunting exploits to tell of about Muffie She is celebrated only as a great traveller for her faithful devotion to her master and for her care over even his property Last summer I spent a month in a beautiful sequestered village in Yorkshire My companions were as usual my Newfoundland Muffie a pet starling and another dog Muffie is very much attached to this birdie allowing it to hop about her like a crow on a water buffalo This starling I think is the most amusing little chap in all creation He is a good linguist and an accomplished musician and is never silent if he is he is either asleep or doing mischief As he says whatever comes into his head and interlards his discourse with fragments of tunes and Bravos the effect is at times startling The way he jumbles his nouns together and trots out every adjective he knows to qualify every noun is something worth listening to In the summer evenings we used to go out for long rambles in the country lanes The dog Theodore Nero felt himself in duty bound on these occasions not only to look after his master but even to take the cat under his protection The starling stalked flies from my shoulder Sometimes he would stay longer snail hunting behind a hedge than I deemed prudent a glance from me was all Muffie wanted to be after him I would wait and listen and presently I would hear Dick excitedly exclaiming Eh eh What is it a favourite expression of his What is it You rascal you rascal and back he would fly to his perch apparently quite thunderstruck at the impudence of the cat Muffie bids me say she is quite happy and all alive And I would add she is very much all alive most interestingly so in fact But that did not prevent her last night from preparing for me what was doubtless meant for a very pretty surprise and a high compliment The cats in the neighbourhood hearing that I was writing a book in their favour with Lady Muff as chief musician resolved to serenade me and they did Being Christmas eve I took them for the waits at first I am sorry now that I so far forgot myself as to throw cold water over the assembly but I sincerely trust that they did not know that the gentleman in white who appeared on the balcony and so unceremoniously checked their harmony was the illustrious author of CATS CHAPTER X BLACK TOM THE SKIPPER S IMP TOM S INTRODUCTION No one in the ship had the slightest idea how Tom came on board or who brought him or where he came from He made his first appearance in public while outward bound we were crossing the Bay of Biscay that strange mysterious sea beneath whose waves the bones of so many of our bravest countrymen lie bleaching It was a roughish night squally rather without much sea on but the wind changing its mind every minute whisking into foam the crests of the inky waves and carrying the spray far into the rigging It was a night to try the sea legs of any one so jerky and uncertain was the vessel s motion and the oldest sailors staggered like drunken men and were fain to cling to rigging or shrouds I was smoking on the quarter deck just before turning in it had gone six bells thirteen in the first watch and everything was snug for the night when something black as Erebus whisked past me visible but for a moment in the binnacle s light and disappeared in the darkness forward I looked inquiringly at the man at the wheel a serious old seamen who in answer to my mute appeal turned his quid twice in his mouth and addressing the compass That s the devil sir said he begging your pardon sir Came on board to night when we close reefed topsails durin a squall There was nothing disrespectful in the man s tone or bearing indeed he spoke almost with an air of solemnity Usual accompaniment I suppose said I laughing blue fire and a perfume not Rimmelian Dunno what ship that is sir said he somewhat curtly but there was a flash young gentleman Seeing the man was disinclined to continue the subject I went below and thanks to the ship s motion was soon in the land of dreams Next day broke bright and clear both wind and cloud had fled the sea had gone down and the vessel was under easy sail A flock of gulls were circling in the morning air screaming with delight as they picked the crumbs that floated astern and all went merrily oh Presently the commander fourteen came up looking anything but sweet and all hands were immediately summoned aft for a speech Officers and men of Her Majesty s gunboat Tickler contrary to the customs and rules of the service and without my knowledge to say nothing of sanction I find that a cat has been brought on board Will the officer or man who owns the animal kindly step forward Here the officers verbally and the men by their silence disclaimed all ownership of poor puss Then continued the commanding officer as no one seems to own it I have but one course Bring up the cat All eyes were instantly turned towards the stern grating which naturally caused the captain to wheel round and there sure enough as mim as a mouse with his tail curled round his legs for warmth and looking on the very best of terms with himself and all creation sat a large black Tom cat He lowered his brows as he returned the skipper s glance and his eyes sparkled crimson and green Midshipman of the watch was the order see that cat overboard Ay ay sir sang out the middy Forenoon watch cat walks the plank heave with a will cheerily does it Puss was on his legs in a moment back erect hair on end and tail like a bottle brush spitting sputtering and behaving altogether in a highly mutinous and insubordinate manner This conduct very nearly led to a fatal termination by a whole shower of belaying pins which however hurtled harmlessly over his head An inch of a miss is as good as a mile thought Tom while there s life there s hope and I ll give you a race for it my lads And he cleared the deck at three bounds and dived below followed by the whole watch Three minutes trampling and howling below then up through the fore hatch came pursuers and pursued pussy leading and the sailors astern Up the rigging shinned the cat Follow your leader roared the men The chase now became general and most exciting and with a cheer all hands joined evidently more for the fun of the thing than with any intention of harming the cat Up the rigging and down the stays alow and aloft out on the flying jib boom and along the hammock nettings Sure never before were such feats of agility seen on board a British Man o War the men seemed monkeys the cat the devil incarnate With a strength seemingly supernatural Tom at length scrambled up and took refuge above the main truck where the Dutch Admiral of old hoisted the broom swearing as only Dutchmen can that he would sweep the English from the sea and the men returned to the deck gasping and red from their futile exertions to await further orders BLACK TOM SPEAKS A PIECE Curses on the brute muttered the commander Am I to sail the seas with a black cat on my main truck Steward bring my revolver The revolver was brought but the captain s aim seemed unsteady he fired all the six chambers without any further result than chipping the main top gallant yard Poor Tom seeing the serious turn matters had taken and that his death was compassed determined to speak a few words in his own behalf and with this intention he lifted up his fore paw and now looking below now appealing to heaven he delivered an harangue the like of which none of us had ever listened to on shore much less afloat His meaning however was perfectly plain Around him he said behold a waste of waters he was far from land he had no boat and though he knew he could swim although he never tried he would rather die than wet his feet Had we no compassion no bowels of mercies He wanted to harm nobody What good could shooting him do He was willing to remain where he then stood for the rest of the voyage in fact to do anything or everything if his life were only spared The captain smiled I thought said he I was a better shot however give the devil his due And he ordered all hands to treat the cat kindly if ever he came below again Tom retained his elevated seat for fully two hours and finally fell sound asleep Waking calm and refreshed and perhaps somewhat dizzy he stretched himself a leg at a time for he hadn t much room yawned did an attitude and came slowly down on deck He walked at once to the quarter deck and to show that he harboured no ill feeling he actually went and rubbed his big black head against the captain s leg TOM BECOMES SHIP S CAT Henceforward Tom was no longer a mere passenger on board his name was borne on the ship s books and he was tolerated both by officers and men Somehow Tom became no favourite The questionable manner in which he had made his first appearance and the latent devil that seemed to lurk in his eye acted like a spell on the natural superstitions of the sailors more than one of whom was heard to express an opinion that That black alliterative term of endearment used by British seamen will bring the ship no good luck Now whether out of gratitude for having his life spared or for some other feline motive known only to puss certain it is that Tom attached himself to our commander and to no one else on board for whenever that officer came on deck so did the cat trotting by his side and enlivening his walk by a song When any other gentleman happened to be walking with the captain Tom used to take his station on the hammock nettings and follow every motion of his beloved adopted master with eyes that beamed with admiration This show of affection was at first indignantly resented by the skipper and many a good kick Tom used to have for his pains but the more he was kicked the louder he sang so at long last yielding to the force of circumstances the skipper ceased to mind him and the two became inseparable TOM GOES ON SHORE FOR A WALK Nothing very unusual happened during our long voyage to the Cape Tom went on shore at saint Helena like any other officer and it was fondly hoped he would take up his abode on that beautiful island But having visited the principal places of interest nearly murdered a poor little dog in James Town and this is only conjecture taken a rat or two at Napoleon s tomb Tom came off again in the officers boat ON BOARD AGAIN The cat might in time have come to be a general favourite in the ship but he suffered no advances to be made by any man Jack as the saying is and scowled so unmistakably when any one attempted to stroke him that he was unanimously voted to Coventry and allowed to do what he liked Tom had a regular allowance of ship s provisions like any one else but his greatest treat was milk preserved and rum thickened with oatmeal For this he used to come regularly once and often twice a day to the dispensary His favourite seat was on the weather bulwarks and there he would often remain for hours gazing thoughtfully down in the blue clear depths of the tropical ocean He do be counting the jelly fish and looking for sharks one man remarked Nay said another he s a thinking o home May be he has left a wife and babies in old England Then said the first speaker what a tarnation fool he was not to stop on shore Sure no one sent for him Hush said the first he s an evil spirit Bill as sure as a gun and he belongs to THE SKIPPER You may easily guess from the foregoing conversation that the captain himself was no great favourite He was a little red haired foxy faced man a Scotchman save the luck but a Scotchman who hated the land of his forefathers Whose heart had ne er within him burned et cetera et cetera in fact retaining but one trait of Scottish character namely his love for Scotch drink Once round the Cape and north on our cruising ground the Mozambique Channel the skipper shone out in his true colours His face and nose got daily redder and the sinister smile that seemed printed there never left his lips Such a smile I have never seen before nor since except on the face of a Somali Indian The first victims to the skipper s wrath were the poor black Kroomen one of whom was always stationed at the mast head to look out for strange sails Now the commander had an eye like a fish hawk and generally managed to sight a vessel before even the out look God help the out look when this occurred He was ordered down at once and in one minute more was lashed to the rigging by both wrists and writhing and shrieking for mercy under the infliction of two dozen with a rope s end laid on by the sturdy arms of a fellow Krooman The men for the slightest offence had their grog stopped for a week or weeks and as the proceeds went to swell the sick fund a fund to purchase comforts for the patients I had usually more money in my hands than I knew how to expend until I happily thought of a plan to get rid of the surplus cash Brown I would say to an officer after the cloth had been removed you look unusually seedy to day in fact looking round the mess you all look rather pale effects of climate poor devils I am afraid I have hardly done my duty towards you Steward bring in those bananas from the sick bay bring also the pineapples the mangoes the oranges the ground nuts a pomola and a bottle of madeira Liquor up my lads let us drink the skipper s health The sick bay fund is unusually flourishing so don t forget in every port we come to to ask me for honey for your rum milk for your tea and orange blossom to perfume your cabins withal Anything approaching insubordination among the boys or men or board was punished with flogging four dozen lashes with a different bo swain s mate to each dozen was the usual dose TOM AT A FLOGGING Tuesday was flogging day and to add if possible to the terror of the condemned wretch after the gratings were rigged and the man stripped and lashed thereto sawdust was sprinkled on the deck all round to soak up the blood But at every flogging match There sat auld Nick in shape o beast at least in the shape of Tom the cat who would not have missed the fun for all the world There on the bulwark he would sit his eyes gleaming with satisfaction his mouth squared and his beard all a bristle He seemed to count every dull thud of his nine tailed namesake and emitted short sharp mews of joy when towards the middle of the third dozen the blood began to trickle and get sprinkled about on sheet and shroud Though I never disliked Tom still at times such as these I really believed he was the devil himself as reputed and would have given two months pay for a chance to brain him When the flogging was over Tom used to jump down and purring loudly rub his head against his master s leg By at least one half of the crew Tom was assuredly believed to be if not old Nick himself possessed of an evil spirit A good deal of mumbo jumbo work therefore went on for the men tried to find favour in Tom s eyes and many a dainty morsel did this cat of evil repute thus receive so that he grew and flourished like a green bay tree while his coat got glossier and his figure plumper every day HOW TOM USED TO FISH Although well fed and cared for Tom at times used to forage for himself not that I ever heard he was a thief to his honour be it written but he fished and very successfully too without so much as wetting the soles of his beautiful pumps His modus operandi was as follows On dark nights in the tropical seas he used to perch himself on the bulwarks aft and bend his glittering eyes downwards into the sea He never sat long thus without a flying fish sometimes two jumping past him or over him and alighting on deck Then Tom would descend and have a delightful supper and if not fully satisfied resume his seat and continue the sport Tom must have gained his knowledge from experience although the success of his method of fishing is easily explained It is well known that these fish always fly towards a light which is therefore often used by the sailors to catch them The cat required no other light save the glimmering of his two eyes which in the dark shone like a couple of koh i noors TOM TAKES CHARGE OF A GUN Tom was in the habit of going to sleep in the large pivot gun we used for shelling running away slavers For a forenoon nap nothing could have suited him better it combined the pleasures of solitude with retirement and moreover was both dark and cool One fine sunny day we were in chase of a particularly fast dhow which taking no heed of our signal howitzers evinced a strong disposition to edge in towards the shore the order was accordingly given to fire at her with our Big Ben Before loading the gunner keeked in to see that all was clear and sure enough there was Tom by no means pleased at being disturbed in his siesta Neither could any amount of cheety pussying entice him from his snuggery while tickling with the end of a ramrod only made him spit and sputter and make use of bad language What s the delay cried the captain Cat in possession of gun sir was the reply Dear me dear me whined the captain Rouse him out and be quick about it After a pause He won t rouse out no how sir said the gunner I m hanged roared the skipper if that rascally dhow isn t landing her slaves inshore Rouse him out I say Fire a fuse con found the cat Shoal water ahead sir from the man at the mast head Hard a port stand by both anchors and round we went just in time to save us In the meantime a fuse had been inserted in the touch hole of the gun Bang and thus attacked in rear Tom came out of the gun faster than ever he had done in his life and took to the rigging with hair on end and eyes all a flame Lower away the first and second cutters was now the order It shan t be said that a cursed cat kept us from capturing a lawful prize D the beast For the benefit of those who love strong language alias swearing it must here be stated that in courtesy to my lady readers I abstain from giving the skipper s language verbatim for in that respect he would have pleased a Lancashire coal heaver he was a don in the use of expletives although to his credit be it recorded while freely launching forth anathemas at the limbs of his men and consigning their eyes to perpetual punishment he just as freely let his own eyes have it Oh he wasn t particular by any means he gave it to us all alike officers and men cat and Kroo boys He captured that slaver though went in the boats personally to do it and that night the sea was lighted up for miles with a blaze that spoiled pussy s fishing for once It was a caution to slavers on shore and sharks at sea At a good mile s distance we could see to read our last letters from home by the light of that burning dhow We were not surprised to see the captain come on board black with smoke and begrimed with gunpowder for we had heard desultory firing but we were slightly taken aback to see Tom meet him in the gangway and to observe the captain stoop down and tenderly caress him Perhaps he wanted to make up to him for his former roughness I ve given that chap Carrickfergus he remarked in a sort of a general way to us officers and to me he added I suppose the men may have a glass of grog doctor Certainly I said Steward splice the main brace Then the skipper dived below and got drunk which he had the knack of doing on the very shortest notice THE CAT S CANTRIPS Of Tom s adventures on board the saucy little Tickler very much could be written Somehow he never was safely out of one scrape till into another A dear wee mongoose was once brought on board and would doubtless have become a great pet if Tom had not broken its back on the first night of its arrival A monkey was received as a visitor and with him Tom at once declared war and kept it up to the bitter end The monkey s favourite mode of attack was to run aloft with a belaying pin and biding his time let it drop as if by accident on poor pussy s head But Tom let him have it sharp and fierce whenever he caught him Once I remember the monkey was sitting on his hind quarters on deck stuffing his cheeks with cockroaches and looking as serious as a judge Tom spied him and ran cautiously along the bulwarks then springing on his foe he seized him round the neck with one arm and with the other administered such a drubbing as the poor thing never had before in his life The monkey with bleeding face at length escaped to the maintop and there cried itself asleep Whether or not Tom was the Jonas who caused all the mishaps that fell upon our little vessel during that four years cruise I shall not pretend to say although all hands forward firmly believed he was Like the witch wife in Allan Ramsay s Gentle Shepherd Tom Got the wyte o a fell oot and certainly Snarley yow and his master were never more detested than that black cat and the skipper eventually came to be LIFE BOAT S CREW AHOY Once I remember we experienced a spell of weather so dark and unsettled that a general gloom prevailed in the ship fore and aft We were rounding the Cape in mid winter First we had a gale of wind our bulwarks stove in forward and a boat washed overboard Then several days with no wind but a heavy sea on and the horizon close aboard of us on every side The nights were pitchy dark with thunder and lightning so appalling that no one thought of turning in till far on in the middle watch Scenes like these can never be described They are painted with the finger of awe on the beholder s memory and time cannot efface them I can see even now our little vessel hanging bows on to the side of that dark wave the hill of water rising above us the inky gulph beneath her wet and slippery decks and the faces of the men that cling to the cordage ghastly in the lightning s glare A moment more and we are on the brow of the wave then down we drive into the very trough of the sea where for a few seconds the ship lies trembling as if every timber in her sides was instinct with life On such a night as this Tom fell overboard This may seem like a descent from the sublime to the ridiculous It is a fact however and was a very disagreeable descent indeed for poor Tom The life buoy was almost instantly fired and let go by the commander himself who alone saw the accident Ease her stop her he roared Away life boat s crew Up tumbled the crew the boat was lowered and in two minutes more they had dropped astern and were pulling with might and main for the now distant life buoy The storm had by this time passed over save an occasional flash of lightning For fully ten minutes each time we rose on the crest of a great wave we could distinctly see the life buoy s light burning bright and beacon like away to leeward of us then it flickered feebly and finally went out Gracious heavens exclaimed the Captain that light was never extinguished it has gone out Five minutes ten fifteen minutes elapsed in dead silence We leant over the bulwarks and could feel our hearts throbbing against them as we peered into the darkness and listened for the slightest sound only an occasional glimmer played along the horizon only now and then the splash of a breaking wave Hours passed by and still no signal from the deep to tell us aught of life was there and all that long dismal night rockets were let off bluelights burned and big guns fired But the sea gave never a sign How anxious we all were No one had a thought of retiring The captain spent his time in alternately pacing frantically up and down the deck and in diving down below we all knew for what At last he wept like a child and tore his hair out in handfuls I felt sorry for him at first until I heard him curse his own evil fate because his fourteen years service would all be lost It was self not the poor men he was thinking of But the longest time has an end and morning came at last and just as the horizon was becoming dimly visible through the rising mist and silence was reigning fore and aft for both men and officers were tired out with suspense and long watching we were all startled and rendered as wide awake as ever we were in our lives For borne along on the morning air breeze it could hardly be called came a faint shout One moment all hands listened it was repeated Shout my lads cried the captain all his manhood returning at once and such a ringing cheer was sent over the waters as only could proceed from the lungs of Britain s sailors fifteen My how every face brightened and my how every eye glanced and glittered as that boat loomed out from the fog She was soon alongside all hands were safe and the first on board was the skipper s imp There was one old sailor who had been very quiet all the night but who now burst into such sobbing as I never heard before The poor man s son had been in the boat Did we splice the main brace Rather We spliced it on deck and we went below to the ward room and spliced it again in fact that main brace took a good deal of splicing then we turned in and slept till noon and I dreamt I was spliced myself SHIP ON FIRE If I remember rightly we were somewhere in lat seventeen deg South and a good way off land We had been cracking on all the forenoon under steam after a Northern slave ship which we had finally boarded captured and taken in tow A fine pair of heels she had shown us too We had to burn hams to get within shot of her But we did at last and there she was with a prize crew on board and the fiery old Arabs glaring like evil spirits at us as they leaned over her taffrail A breeze had sprung up towards four o clock and the orders were given to bank fires and set sail I was sitting in the ward room reading when Look Jim I heard some one on deck remark Where is that thundering old cat going to now Bedad then said Jim but he s taking the rigging like a good one anyhow Shouldn t wonder now if he was going to give us another spache I ran up just in time to see the cat shin hand over hand up the main top gallant mast and seat himself on the very truck in the exact spot he had occupied in his first adventure on board when the captain fired at him It had gone three bells in the first dog watch sixteen we had just finished tea and gone on deck to smoke our evening pipe We were making ourselves very comfortable on the stern gratings and our Scotch engineer naval engineers for the most part are Scotch was singing For we are homeward bound not that we were homeward bound by a long chalk but it gave us the idea we were don t you know and made us feel all the jollier when the quartermaster came aft and addressing the officer of the watch I beg your pardon sir he said leisurely turning his quid in his mouth but I think sir there be a strong smell of fire right amidships We went forward The second cutter lay bottom upwards between the fore and main masts and from under its gunnel were curling little puffs of light blue smoke for all the world as if some one were smoking a cigar beneath the boat But the smoke had the smell of burning wood Ding ding ding ding ding ding Ah had Edgar Allan Poe heard that bell he might have added one other stanza to that strange wild poem of his Ding ding ding ding You never heard it did you reader Well it is a pleasure you still have before you The breeze was freshening every minute the sea was getting its back up and darkness thickening around us But what mattered darkness we should soon light up old ocean with our burning ship Ding ding ding up tumble the hands at the dread summons The hoses are laid the pumps rigged and manned as if by magic and before the last sound of the bell is borne away on the breeze every man is at quarters steady grave and silent waiting Waiting Aye fancy having to wait for a single moment with the fire crackling under the broiling deck and tons of powder under hatches But service is service the captain alone has not responded to the alarm and the officer of the watch has gone to call him Worthy man he was Not fou he just was glorious O er a the ills of life victorious Oh he said ship s on fire is she Then go you to blazes He came up soon however and every man that night did his duty Nothing in the world save British pluck and coolness could have conquered that fire It was the padding at the back of the boiler that had caught and burning through had kindled the coals behind and when the decks were scuttled the scene below was like a red raging hell In less than two hours however the flames were got under and the fire extinguished and saving the watch on deck the crew tired and bruised and many of them scalded had gone below while the carpenters were busy repairing decks for in a man of war every trace of recent danger whether from wind or fire or foe is speedily erased A shoal of sharks that had been following the ship expectant disappointed sought deeper water and black Tom the cat came down from his perch on the main truck singing a song of deliverance MINOR MISHAPS It would take a long time indeed to narrate all the misadventures we had in that cruise We got quite used to running on shore being awakened any night with that strange grating noise beneath our keel and the sudden cessation of all motion which tells the experienced sailor better than words can that the ship has struck One bright moonlight night far on in the middle watch we ran aground on the Lyra reef Luckily the tide was not full nor the wind blowing By next morning we had lowered the boats and sent over the guns to lighten ship and lay waiting for the tide A bright sky and a blue blue sea all around with never a sail in sight nay not even a bird The waters so pellucid and clear that leaning over the bulwarks we could see the yellow sand at the bottom see forests and gardens of marine plants and flowers pink petalled or tender green gently waving to and fro in the current see the transparent medusae disporting their rainbow beauties and see the thousand and one strange looking tropical fishes of colours so bright and shapes so grotesque that they seemed the fishes of our dreams or caricatures of animal life Fast and sure on that reef we lay for upwards of forty eight hours and it was only by lightening the ship of coals and buoying her with empty rum casks that we got safely afloat at last The men were in good spirits all the time because forsooth the cat was singing like all possessed NOTHING TO EAT It was the last voyage of the cruise We were steering from Zanzibar to the Cape under orders home We had on board with us no less a personage than the bishop of C A and his learned curate doctor Blank Now we had not been to sea over three days when lo and behold one half at least of the casks of beef and provisions supposed to be full were found to be mere dummies It was nobody s fault it always is nobody s fault in a case of that sort but the upshot of it was that all hands were put upon short allowance and as our mess having got into debt was just then living on ship s provisions we officers had to suffer the same privations as the men Besides we had neither beer wine nor spirits on board very little water and no coals to spare to distil more This was a very pretty look out for a three weeks voyage to the Cape in mid winter And poor Tom came in for more cursing now than ever Everybody cursed him everywhere they cursed him below and cursed him aloft cursed him on the quarter deck and cursed him in the cook s galley But Tom only sung the louder It was all along of that blessed cat the sailors said and they added that it was a good thing we had my lord bishop on board to counteract the evil effects of the skipper s imp The poor bishop suffered too but mostly from sea sickness He kept his bed all the voyage He was a stout man at Zanzibar but he got considerably thinner before we reached the Cape But his curate was more to be pitied he was a thin man didn t get sick and had a stomach like a brewer s horse and the more sorrow for that same there being so little to put into it Our biscuit must I think have been baked before the flood each morsel while black with cockroaches filth outside entertaining a whole colony of weevils inside we ate the weevils however merely tapping each morsel on the table to get rid of the superabundant dust before conveying it to our mouths We had neither potatoes nor butter We had white beans though and black rice and fried sardines to which latter we used to add a little turmeric and cayenne by way of flavouring We actually got mean in our hunger and used to say little snappish things to each other about our share of the victuals things which we would have been ashamed to say under any other circumstances No one I can assure you was above helping himself to the last spoonful of rice or beans out of a delicate feeling of consideration for his neighbour In good sooth sometimes three or four spoons would meet at the dish at once in most undignified haste Gentlemen gentlemen our little good natured assistant paymaster would say better is a dinner of rice and fried sardines where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith We should just have liked to have seen the stalled ox that s all But this assistant paymaster was a stout bulky little chap and didn t suffer half what we did I m certain he lived on his own fat all the way to the Cape just as the sheep in the Highlands do when they have the misfortune to be buried in the snow for a week or two Our conversation all the dinner hour when we weren t quarrelling used to be about this glorious feed and the next glorious feed which we once had and it would certainly have been amusing for an outsider who wasn t hungry himself mind you to have heard us enlarging on all the dainties that had been set before us in happier times Our conversation would have been somewhat after the following fashion S But by George when I was in the P O company s Service ay old fellows that was the place to live there is where we used to get the spreads All Yes yes tell us there s a dear boy What had you for dinner S Well you know the bill of fare used to be two yards long and a yard and a quarter wide We had two soups and then All No no tell us first what the soups were S Well say vermicelli and macaro Oh hang it all Moreton that s the third time to my certain knowledge that you ve helped yourself to rice Moreton To morrow s pea soup day never mind S But I do mind All Go on with your yarn S Well vermicelli and macaroni and then a bit of delicious white turbot with oyster sauce and All Yes yes go on S All very well to say go on but I shall have those three beans you greedy beggars Well then after the fish came et cetera et cetera et cetera When S had finished R would begin That just reminds me of an hotel I was at in France et cetera and so each one told his experiences to the infinite delectation of his neighbours and having locust like devoured everything we came across we used to get up hungry and haggard and run on deck to smoke away the tail end of our appetite In those days our grace before and after meat was rather a peculiar one The president said the first it was Curse the cat Then just before we rose from table mister Vice will you kindly return thanks Confound the cat THE LAST OF THE SKIPPER S IMP No one ever saw the last of him however although a seaman called Davis swore point black that he had seen the cat fly overboard in a sheet of blue flame but then Davis was the biggest lubber and the greatest liar in the ship The only thing known for certain is this we were about three days sail from Symon s Town Cape of Good Hope The night was dark and the weather squally and poor Tom was last seen sitting very quiet and pensive like on the hammock nettings aft He was seen there I say in the middle watch and he was never seen again alive or dead The men swore roundly that he was a devil nothing more nor less and that being a devil he couldn t stomach my lord bishop on board and consequently took French leave and went home The truth I suppose is that the ship gave a nasty lee lurch and Tom half asleep missed his footing and tumbled overboard I know the skipper was sorry We kept a good look out for the Flying Dutchman after Tom s demise but very much to my disappointment we did not fall in with that ghostly ship If I were merely writing a sailor s yarn I should certainly say we had seen her and give a most photographic like description of her but such stories I leave landsmen to tell for I think if a man has been for ten or a dozen years at sea and kept his weather eye lifting all the time it will take him the remainder of his life to tell the whole truth alone When we came down to the Cape which we managed to do without any further adventures there lay the new admiral s ship all spick and span from England s shores so all our fellows were turned over to and went home in the old Admiral s ship all except our engineer and my unhappy self We much to our disgust were reappointed to the saucy Tickler which was to remain out for another commission as tender to the new flagship Now however we had a new captain the jolliest little man alive new officers and a new crew and we were all as jolly as sandboys The new officers thought themselves tremendously clever chaps and every night they used all to pull off their slippers and go pell mell at the unfortunate cockroaches but the engineer and I sat like stoics and let them crawl over us in scores and if too many at one time came on the book we might be reading we gently removed them But before a month was over our messmates found out the futility of trying to diminish the number of cockroaches and these interesting creatures had carte blanche all over the ship Illustration TORTOISESHELL First Prize Owned by mister L SMITH Illustration SILVER or BLUE TABBY First Prize Owned by mister REYNOLDS We sailed for Bombay But though black Tom was no more ill luck seemed still to hover in the wake of that little vessel I would willingly narrate our further adventures in detail but somehow I have no heart now that the cat has left the story But how we were caught in a gale off the Cape and the ship taken aback that reader is much more dreadful than it appears on paper how we sprang a leak a week after glass falling and weather stormy on a rock bound coast and just as the ship was beginning to stagger like a drunk man and the boats were got ready for lowering the engineer brave little man dived below water in the engine room and found it was no leak at all but the great sea cock left open by a drunken stoker how we ran on shore on that wild reef outside Johanna and lay there for a whole week with our keel floating in splinters around us how finally we got off and steamed to Bombay almost a wreck the pumps going continually and barely keeping her afloat how we arrived safely through it all how a liberal government paid rather more for repairing her than would have bought a new one and how she was sold three years after for an old song is it not all written in the log of Her Majesty s saucy gunboat Tickler Illustration Zula the property of missus Captain Barrett Lennard This cat was brought from Abyssinia at the conclusion of the war fed on the way home on raw beef and was long very wild She is now very fond of her mistress but has a great many eccentricities which other cats have not and is altogether a wonderful specimen of cat kind ADDENDA I deem it fair both to myself and to the reader to supplement my own evidence on the Curiosities of Cat Life by giving the names and addresses of my authorities for those of my anecdotes which may seem to run contrary to the generally received opinions concerning cats at the same time thanking those ladies and gentlemen who have taken so much interest in the progress of this work and expressed themselves willing to vouch for the truth of the incidents herein related by me I have tried to make the anecdotes as readable as possible and as humorous as I know many people think cats a dry subject but in no single instance have the interests of truth been disregarded My anecdotes are what might be called sample anecdotes as I have many hundreds more of the same sort my object being to describe pussy as she really is and thus to gain favour for an animal hitherto understood only by the few and abused by the many And nothing would give me greater pain than the reader to have an idea that my cats are exceptional cats for I distinctly aver that no cat mentioned in this book has either done or suffered anything which any other cat in the kingdom cannot do or suffer INDEX OF NAMES AND ADDRESSES Anderson Alex mister New Fowlis Crieff N B Anderson Jane Miss Old Meldrum
