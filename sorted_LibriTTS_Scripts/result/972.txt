the reprehensible habit of devouring the dead The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of comforting beliefs than to

an uncommon allowance of limbs and he saw it in more than one place at a time The good man was coming away from dinner at the time and explains that if he had not been heavy with eating he would have seized the demon at all hazards Atholston relates that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury and ducked in a horsepond He appears to think that so distinguished a

fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place Twenty armed men with a priest at their head bearing a crucifix entered and captured the ghoul which thinking to escape by the stratagem had transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen but was nevertheless hanged drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous

the wound This however is inaccurate to impale is properly to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the body the victim being left in a sitting position This was a common mode of punishment among many of the nations of antiquity and is still in high favor in China and other parts of Asia Down to the beginning of the fifteenth century it was widely employed in churching heretics and schismatics Wolecraft calls it the stoole of repentynge and among the common people it was jocularly known as riding the one legged horse Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in Thibet impalement is considered the most appropriate punishment for crimes against religion and although in China it is sometimes awarded for secular offences it is most frequently adjudged in cases of sacrilege To the person in actual experience of impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts but doubtless

testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with and which judges therefore rule out even of proceedings before themselves alone Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination yet most momentous actions military political commercial and of every other kind are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence There is no religion in the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence Revelation is hearsay evidence that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known to have been sworn in any sense Under the rules of evidence as they now exist in this country no single assertion in the Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law It cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought that there was such as person as Julius Caesar such an empire as Assyria But as records of courts of justice are admissible it can easily be proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to mankind The evidence including confession upon which certain women were convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw it is still unimpeachable The judges decisions based on it were sound in logic and in law Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death If there were no witches human testimony and human reason are alike destitute of value INAUSPICIOUSLY adv In an unpromising manner the auspices being unfavorable Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs or state prophets some hint of its probable outcome and one of their favorite and most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of birds the omens thence derived being called auspices Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that the word always in the plural shall mean patronage or management as The festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Body Snatchers or The hilarities were auspicated by the Knights of Hunger A Roman slave appeared one day Before the Augur Tell me pray If here the Augur smiling made A checking gesture and displayed His open palm which plainly itched For visibly its surface twitched A denarius the Latin nickel Successfully allayed the tickle And then the slave proceeded Please Inform me whether Fate decrees Success or failure in what I To night if it be dark shall try Its nature Never mind I think Tis writ on this and with a wink Which darkened half the earth he drew Another denarius to view Its shining face attentive scanned Then slipped it into the good man s hand Who with great gravity said Wait While I retire to question Fate That holy person then withdrew His scared clay and passing through The temple s rearward gate cried Shoo Waving his robe of office Straight Each sacred peacock and its mate Maintained for Juno s favor fled With clamor from the trees o erhead Where they were perching for the night The temple s roof received their flight For thither they would always go When danger threatened them below Back to the slave the Augur went My son forecasting the event By flight of birds I must confess The auspices deny success That slave retired a sadder man Abandoning his secret plan Which was as well the craft seer Had from the first divined to clear The wall and fraudulently seize On Juno s poultry in the trees G J INCOME n The natural and rational gauge and measure of respectability the commonly accepted standards being artificial arbitrary and fallacious for as Sir Sycophas Chrysolater in the play has justly remarked the true use and function of property in whatsoever it consisteth coins or land or houses or merchant stuff or anything which may be named as holden of right to one s own subservience as also of honors titles preferments and place and all favor and acquaintance of persons of quality or ableness are but to get money Hence it followeth that all things are truly to be rated as of worth in measure of their serviceableness to that end and their possessors should take rank in agreement thereto neither the lord of an unproducing manor howsoever broad and ancient nor he who bears an unremunerate dignity nor yet the pauper favorite of a king being esteemed of level excellency with him whose riches are of daily accretion and hardly should they whose wealth is barren claim and rightly take more honor than the poor and unworthy INCOMPATIBILITY n In matrimony a similarity of tastes particularly the taste for domination Incompatibility may however consist of a meek eyed matron living just around the corner It has even been known to wear a moustache INCOMPOSSIBLE adj Unable to exist if something else exists Two things are incompossible when the world of being has scope enough for one of them but not enough for both as Walt Whitman s poetry and God s mercy to man Incompossibility it will be seen is only incompatibility let loose Instead of such low language as Go heel yourself I mean to kill you on sight the words Sir we are incompossible would convey and equally significant intimation and in stately courtesy are altogether superior INCUBUS n One of a race of highly improper demons who though probably not wholly extinct may be said to have seen their best nights For a complete account of incubi and succubi including incubae and succubae see the Liber Demonorum of Protassus Paris thirteen twenty eight which contains much curious information that would be out of place in a dictionary intended as a text book for the public schools Victor Hugo relates that in the Channel Islands Satan himself tempted more than elsewhere by the beauty of the women doubtless sometimes plays at incubus greatly to the inconvenience and alarm of the good dames who wish to be loyal to their marriage vows generally speaking A certain lady applied to the parish priest to learn how they might in the dark distinguish the hardy intruder from their husbands The holy man said they must feel his brown for horns but Hugo is ungallant enough to hint a doubt of the efficacy of the test INCUMBENT n A person of the liveliest interest to the outcumbents INDECISION n The chief element of success for whereas saith Sir Thomas Brewbold there is but one way to do nothing and divers way to do something whereof to a surety only one is the right way it followeth that he who from indecision standeth still hath not so many chances of going astray as he who pusheth forwards a most clear and satisfactory exposition on the matter Your prompt decision to attack said Genera Grant on a certain occasion to General Gordon Granger was admirable you had but five minutes to make up your mind in Yes sir answered the victorious subordinate it is a

bellyache heap God INDISCRETION n The guilt of woman INEXPEDIENT adj Not calculated to advance one s interests INFANCY n The period of our lives when according to Wordsworth Heaven lies about us The world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward INFERIAE n Latin Among the Greeks and Romans sacrifices for propitiation of the Dii Manes or souls of the dead heroes for the pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual needs and had to have a number of makeshift deities or as a sailor might say jury gods which they made out of the most unpromising materials It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon that Laiaides a priest of Aulis was favored with an audience of that illustrious warrior s shade who prophetically recounted to him the birth of Christ and the triumph of Christianity giving him also a rapid but tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis The narrative ended abruptly at the point owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to Hades There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story and as it has not been traced back further than Pere Brateille a pious but obscure writer at the court of Saint Louis we shall probably not err on the side of presumption in considering it apocryphal though Monsignor Capel s judgment of the matter might be different and

person s fall was decreed from the beginning Infralapsarians are sometimes called Sublapsarians without material effect upon the importance and lucidity of their views about Adam Two theologues once as they wended their way To chapel engaged in colloquial fray An earnest logomachy bitter as gall Concerning poor Adam and what made him fall Twas Predestination cried one for the Lord Decreed he

reputations and unmake them to blacken them and to make them white but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an edifice of fame and as a whitewash to

occurs that a person who has paid to get in pays twice as much to get out INNATE adj Natural inherent as innate ideas that is to say ideas that we are born with having had them previously imparted to us The doctrine of innate ideas is one of the most admirable faiths of philosophy being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible to disproof though Locke foolishly supposed himself to have

of one s personal affairs and in the interesting nature of one s diseases IN ARDS n The stomach heart soul and other bowels Many eminent investigators do not class the soul as an in ard but that acute

malevolent development in this century being indeed closely related to our political system Every American being the equal of every other American it follows that everybody has the right to know everybody else which implies the right to introduce without request or permission The Declaration of Independence should have read thus We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life and the right to make that of another miserable by thrusting upon him an incalculable quantity of

modified was that of the tail of a subdued dog and it was not a letter but a character standing for a Latin verb jacere to throw because when a stone is thrown at a dog the dog s tail assumes that shape This is the origin of the letter as expounded by the renowned doctor Jocolpus Bumer of the University of Belgrade who established his conclusions on the subject in a work of three quarto volumes and committed suicide on being reminded that the j in the Roman alphabet had originally no curl JEALOUS adj Unduly concerned about the preservation of that which can be lost only if not worth keeping JESTER n An officer formerly attached to a king s household whose business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances the absurdity being attested by his motley costume The king himself being attired with dignity it took the world some centuries to discover that his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement not only of his court but of all mankind The jester was commonly called a fool but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as a singularly wise and witty person In the circus of to day the melancholy ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall panged the patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears The widow queen of Portugal Had an audacious jester Who entered the confessional Disguised and there confessed her Father she said thine ear bend down My sins are more than scarlet I love my fool blaspheming clown

Smero In their tongue it was called Klatch which means destroyed The form of the letter was originally precisely that of our H but the erudite doctor Snedeker explains that it was altered to its present shape to commemorate the destruction of the great temple of Jarute by an earthquake circa seven hundred thirty B C This building was famous for the two lofty columns of its portico one of which was broken in half by the catastrophe the other remaining intact As the earlier form of the letter is supposed to have been suggested by these pillars so it is thought by the great antiquary its later was adopted as a simple and natural not to say touching means of keeping the calamity ever in the national memory It is not known if the name of the letter was altered as an additional mnemonic or if the name was always Klatch and the destruction one of nature s puns As each theory seems probable enough I see no objection to believing both and doctor Snedeker arrayed himself on that side of

along with other crown properties for according to Malcolm tis spoken To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction But the gift somewhere dropped out of the line of succession the later sovereigns of England have not been tactual healers and the disease once honored with the name king s evil now bears the humbler one of scrofula from scrofa a sow The date and author of the following

royal taction is dead but like many a departed conviction it has left a monument of custom to keep its memory green The practice of forming a line and shaking the President s hand had no other origin and when that great dignitary bestows his healing salutation on strangely visited people All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye The mere despair of surgery he and his patients are handing along an

surface considered as property The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society and is eminently worthy of the superstructure Carried to its logical conclusion it means that some have the right to prevent others from living for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A B and C there will be no place for D E F and G to be born or born as trespassers to exist A life on the

arrest its growth stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods For your lexicographer having written his dictionary comes to be considered as one having authority whereas his function is only to make a record not to give a law The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statue Let the dictionary for example mark a good word as obsolete or obsolescent and few men thereafter venture to use it whatever their need of it and however desirable its restoration to favor whereby the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays On the contrary recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow at all makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense has no following and is tartly reminded that it isn t in the dictionary although down to the time of the first lexicographer Heaven forgive him no author ever had used a word that was in the dictionary In the golden prime and high noon of English speech when from the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were possible and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservation sweeter than honey and stronger than a lion the lexicographer was a person unknown the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him to create God said Let Spirit perish into Form And lexicographers arose a swarm

infrequently found editing a newspaper In his character of editor he is closely allied to the blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity for in truth the lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect although the latter is frequently found as an independent species Lickspittling is more detestable than blackmailing precisely as the business of a confidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber and the parallel maintains itself throughout for whereas few robbers will cheat every sneak will plunder if he dare LIFE n A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay We live in daily apprehension of its loss yet when lost it is not missed The question Is life worth living has been much discussed particularly by those who think it is not many of whom have

unfair to pitch in Discharging the first censorious stone Besides the truth compels me to say The boots in question were made that way As he drew the lace she made a grimace And blushingly said to him This boot I m sure is too high to endure It hurts my hurts my limb The salesman smiled in a manner mild Like an artless undesigning child Then checking himself to his face he gave A look as sorrowful

LOOKING GLASS n A vitreous plane upon which to display a fleeting show for man s disillusion given The King of Manchuria had a magic looking glass whereon whoso looked saw not his own image but only that of the king A certain courtier who had long enjoyed the king s favor and was thereby enriched beyond any other subject of the realm said to the king Give me I pray thy wonderful mirror so that when absent out of thine august presence I may yet do homage before thy visible shadow prostrating myself night and morning in the glory of thy benign countenance as which nothing has so divine splendor O Noonday Sun of the Universe Please with the speech the king commanded that the mirror be conveyed to the courtier s palace but after having gone thither without apprisal he found it in an apartment where was naught but idle lumber And the mirror was dimmed with dust and overlaced with cobwebs This so angered him that he fisted it hard shattering the glass and was sorely hurt Enraged all the more by this mischance he commanded that the ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison and that the glass be repaired and taken back to his own palace and this was done But when the king looked again on the mirror he saw not his image as before but only the figure of a crowned ass having a bloody bandage on one of its hinder hooves as the artificers and all who had looked upon it had before discerned but feared to report Taught wisdom and charity the king restored his courtier to liberty had the mirror set into the back of the throne and reigned many years with justice and humility and one day when he fell asleep in death while on the throne the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure of an angel which remains to this day LOQUACITY n A disorder which renders

six days and was arrested on the seventh Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to and down into the sea it is reverently recognized as is manifest in the following deep water version of the Fourth

with other crude penances has now been superseded by benefaction The founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is conferred by the knife or iron and is therefore a surer means of grace There are however two grave objections to it as a penitential method the good that it does and the taint of justice SCEPTER n A

translated from the Japanese by Shusi Itama a famous writer of the thirteenth century When the great Gichi Kuktai was Mikado he condemned to decapitation Jijiji Ri a high officer of the Court Soon after the hour appointed for performance of the rite what was his Majesty s surprise to see calmly approaching the throne the man who should have been at that time ten minutes dead Seventeen hundred impossible dragons shouted the enraged monarch Did I not sentence you to stand in the market place and have your head struck off by the public executioner at three o clock And is it not now three ten Son of a thousand illustrious deities answered the condemned minister all that you say is so true that the truth is a lie in comparison But your heavenly Majesty s sunny and vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded With joy I ran and placed my unworthy body in the market place The executioner appeared with his bare scimetar ostentatiously whirled it in air and then tapping me lightly upon the neck strode away pelted by the populace with whom I was ever a favorite I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable and treasonous head To what regiment of executioners does the black boweled caitiff belong asked the Mikado To the gallant Ninety eight Hundred and Thirty seventh I know the man His name is Sakko Samshi Let him be brought before me said the Mikado to an attendant and a half hour later the culprit stood in the Presence Thou bastard son of a three legged hunchback without thumbs roared the sovereign why didst thou but lightly tap the neck that it should have been thy pleasure to sever Lord of Cranes of Cherry Blooms replied the executioner unmoved command him to blow his nose with his fingers Being commanded Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted like an elephant all expecting to see the severed head flung violently from him Nothing occurred the performance prospered peacefully to the close without incident All eyes were now turned on the executioner who had grown as white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama His legs trembled and his breath came in gasps of terror Several kinds of spike tailed brass lions he cried I am a ruined and disgraced swordsman I struck the villain feebly because in flourishing the scimetar I had accidentally passed it through my own neck Father of the Moon I resign my office So saying he gasped his top knot lifted off his head and advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado s feet SCRAP BOOK n A book that is commonly edited by a fool Many persons of some small distinction compile scrap books containing whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to collect One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following by Agamemnon Melancthon Peters Dear

false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based SEAL n A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority Sometimes it is stamped upon wax and attached to the paper sometimes into the paper itself Sealing in this sense is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers mostly of a sacerdotal character validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices frequently initial letters of words to conjure with and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful Our word sincere is derived from sine cero without wax but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis The initials L S commonly appended to signatures of legal documents mean locum sigillis the place of the seal although the seal is no longer used an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish The words locum sigillis are humbly suggested as a suitable

influence It was however deemed less respectable and sometimes was punished by torture and death Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession After enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his guilt but naively asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing it SOUL n A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave disputation Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence antedating Athens had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers Plato himself was a philosopher The souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots Dionysius I who had threatened to decapitate the broad browed philosopher was a usurper and a despot Plato doubtless was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies certainly he was not the last Concerning the nature of the soul saith the renowned author of Diversiones Sanctorum there hath been hardly more argument than that of its place in the body Mine own belief is that the soul hath her seat in the abdomen in which faith we may discern and interpret a truth hitherto unintelligible namely that the glutton is of all men most devout He is said in the Scripture to make a god of his belly why then should he not be pious having ever his Deity with him to freshen his faith Who so well as he can know the might and majesty that he shrines Truly and soberly the soul and the stomach are one Divine Entity and such was the belief of Promasius who nevertheless erred in denying it immortality He had observed that its visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of the body after death but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing This is what we call the Appetite and it survives the wreck and reek of mortality to be rewarded or punished in another world according to what it hath demanded in the flesh The Appetite whose coarse clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine whilst that which firmly through civilly insisted on ortolans caviare terrapin anchovies pates de foie gras and all such Christian comestibles shall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever and wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and richest wines ever quaffed here below Such is my religious faith though I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury whom I equally and profoundly revere will assent to its dissemination SPOOKER n A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural phenomena especially in the doings of spooks One of the most illustrious spookers of our time is mister William D Howells who introduces a well credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet To the terror that invests the chairman of a district school board the Howells ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another township STORY n A narrative commonly untrue The truth of the stories here following has however not been successfully impeached One evening mister Rudolph Block of New York found himself seated at dinner alongside mister Percival Pollard the distinguished critic mister Pollard said he my book The Biography of a Dead Cow is published anonymously but you can hardly be ignorant of its authorship Yet in reviewing it you speak of it as the work of the Idiot of the Century Do you think that fair criticism I am very sorry sir replied the critic amiably but it did not occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who wrote it mister W C Morrow who used to live in San Jose California was addicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a stream of lizards fresh from the ice were streaking it up his back and hiding in his hair San Jose was at that time believed to be haunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez who had been hanged there The town was not very well lighted and it is putting it mildly to say that San Jose was reluctant to be out o nights One particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the loneliest spot within the city limits talking loudly to keep up their courage when they came upon mister J J Owen a well known journalist Why Owen said one what brings you here on such a night as this You told me that this is one of Vasquez favorite haunts And you are a believer Aren t you afraid to be out My dear fellow the journalist replied with a drear autumnal cadence in his speech like the moan of a leaf laden wind I am afraid to be in I have one of Will Morrow s stories in my pocket and I don t dare to go where there is light enough to read it Rear Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F Joy were standing near the Peace Monument in Washington discussing the question Is success a failure mister Joy suddenly broke off in the middle of an eloquent sentence exclaiming Hello I ve heard that band before Santlemann s I think I don t hear any band said Schley Come to think I don t either said Joy but I see General Miles coming down the avenue and that pageant always affects me in the same way as a brass band One has to scrutinize one s impressions pretty closely or one will mistake their origin While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy General Miles passed in review a spectacle of impressive dignity When the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two observers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its effulgence He seems to be enjoying himself said the Admiral There is nothing assented Joy thoughtfully that he enjoys one half so well The illustrious statesman Champ Clark once lived about a mile from the village of Jebigue in Missouri One day he rode into town on a favorite mule and hitching the beast on the sunny side of a street in front of a saloon he went inside in his character of teetotaler to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker It was a dreadfully hot day Pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing Clark said Champ it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun He ll roast sure he was smoking as I passed him O he s all right said Clark lightly he s an inveterate smoker The neighbor took a lemonade but shook his head and repeated that it was not right He was a conspirator There had been a fire the night before a stable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had put on their immortality among them a young colt which was roasted to a rich nut brown Some of the boys had turned mister Clark s mule loose and substituted the mortal part of the colt Presently another man entered the saloon For mercy s sake he said taking it with sugar do remove that mule barkeeper it smells Yes interposed Clark that animal has the best nose in Missouri But if he doesn t mind you shouldn t In the course of human events mister Clark went out and there apparently lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger The boys did not have any fun out of mister Clarke who looked at the body and with the non committal expression to which he owes so much of his political preferment went away But walking home late that night he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the misty moonlight Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon emphasis mister Clark took the back track as hard as ever he could hook it and passed the night in town General H H Wotherspoon president of the Army War College has a pet rib nosed baboon an animal of uncommon intelligence but imperfectly beautiful Returning to his apartment one evening the General was surprised and pained to find Adam for so the creature is named the general being a Darwinian sitting up for him and wearing his master s best uniform coat epaulettes and all You confounded remote ancestor thundered the great strategist what do you mean by being out of bed after naps and with my coat on Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the manner of his kind and scuffling across the room to a table returned with a visiting card General Barry had called and judging by an empty champagne bottle and several cigar stumps had been hospitably entertained while waiting The general apologized to his faithful progenitor and retired The next day he met General Barry who said Spoon old man when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you about those excellent cigars Where did you get them General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply but walked away Pardon me please said Barry moving after him I was joking of course Why I knew it was not you before I had been in the room fifteen minutes SUCCESS n The one unpardonable sin against one s fellows In literature and particularly in

your hair long you needn t your hat SUFFRAGE n Expression of opinion by means of a ballot The right of suffrage which is held to be both a privilege and a duty means as commonly interpreted the right to vote for the man of another man s choice and is highly prized Refusal to do so has the bad name of incivism The incivilian however cannot be properly arraigned for his crime for there is no legitimate accuser If the accuser is himself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion if not he profits by the crime for A s abstention from voting gives greater weight to the vote of B By female suffrage is meant the right of a woman to vote as some man tells her to It is based on female responsibility which is somewhat limited The woman most eager to jump out of her petticoat to assert her rights is first to jump back into it when threatened with a switching for misusing them SYCOPHANT n One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked He is sometimes an editor As the lean leech its victim found is pleased To fix itself upon a part diseased Till its black hide distended with bad blood It drops to die of surfeit in the mud So

tendency to make them as funereal urns carved on memorial monuments They were once real urns holding the ashes of the dead We cannot stop making them but we can give them a name that conceals our

an animal s spine that has transcended its natural limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of its own Excepting in its foetal state Man is without a tail a privation of which he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness by the coat skirt of the male and the train of the female and by a marked tendency to ornament that part of his attire where the tail should be and indubitably once was This tendency is most observable in the female of the species in whom the ancestral sense is strong and persistent The tailed men described by Lord Monboddo are now generally

condition of one that is bored Many fanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed but so high an authority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious source the first words of the

the mystery of science The modern Theosophist holds with the Buddhists that we live an incalculable number of times on this earth in as many several bodies because one life is not long enough for our complete spiritual development that is a single lifetime does not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to wish to become To be absolutely wise and good that is perfection and the Theosophist is so keen sighted as to have observed that everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection Less competent observers are disposed to except cats which seem neither wiser nor better than they were last year The greatest and fattest of recent Theosophists was the late Madame Blavatsky who had no cat TIGHTS n An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the general acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity Public attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss Lillian Russell s refusal to wear it and many were the conjectures as to her motive the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of ingenuity and sustained reflection It was Miss Hall s belief that nature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs This theory was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding but the conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation It is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell s aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as modesty The nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood and possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us The study of lost arts has however been recently revived and some of the arts themselves recovered This is an epoch of renaissances and there is ground for hope that the primitive blush may be dragged from its hiding place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the stage TOMB n The House of Indifference Tombs are now by common consent invested with a certain sanctity but when they have been long tenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle

by nature to serve as a penal apparatus though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a negligible fruit or none at all When naturally fruited the tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public morals In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit white and black respectively though not eaten is agreeable to the public taste and though not exported profitable to the general welfare That the legitimate relation of the tree to justice was no discovery of Judge Lynch who indeed conceded it no primacy over the lamp post and the bridge

put upon record the blameless characters of judges advocates and jurors In order to effect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person of one who is called the defendant the prisoner or the accused If the contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo such an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable sense of their immunity added to that of their worth In our day the accused is usually a human being or a socialist but in mediaeval times animals fishes reptiles and insects were brought to trial A beast that had taken human life or practiced sorcery was duly arrested tried and if condemned put to death by the public executioner Insects ravaging grain fields orchards or vineyards were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal and after testimony argument and condemnation if they continued in contumaciam the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court where they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized In a street of Toledo some pigs that had wickedly run between the viceroy s legs upsetting him were arrested on a warrant tried and punished In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake but

conduct and morals In fourteen fifty one a suit was brought against the leeches infesting some ponds about Berne and the Bishop of Lausanne instructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University directed that some of the aquatic worms be brought before the local magistracy This was done and the leeches both present and absent were ordered to leave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of incurring the malediction of God In the voluminous records of this cause celebre nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved the punishment or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable jurisdiction TRICHINOSIS n The pig s reply to proponents of porcophagy Moses Mendlessohn having fallen ill sent for a Christian physician who at once diagnosed the philosopher s disorder

consistent with only one Subordinate deities of the polytheistic faith such as devils and angels are not dowered with the power of combination and must urge individually their claims to adoration and propitiation The Trinity is one of the most sublime mysteries of our holy religion In rejecting it because it is incomprehensible Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of theological fundamentals

the American novelist Mendax interminabilis U UBIQUITY n The gift or power of being in all places at one time but not in all places at all times which is omnipresence an attribute of God and the luminiferous ether only This important distinction between ubiquity and omnipresence was not clear to the mediaeval Church and there was much bloodshed about it Certain Lutherans who affirmed the presence everywhere of Christ s body were known as Ubiquitarians For this error they were doubtless damned for Christ s body is present only in the eucharist though that sacrament may be performed in more than one place simultaneously In recent times ubiquity has not always been understood not even by Sir Boyle Roche for example who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a

of peace The most menacing political condition is a period of international amity The student of history who has not been taught to expect the unexpected may justly boast himself inaccessible to the light In time of peace prepare for war has a deeper meaning than is commonly discerned it means not merely that all things earthly have an end that change is the one immutable and eternal law but that the soil of peace is thickly sown with the seeds of war and singularly suited to their germination and growth It was when Kubla Khan had decreed his stately pleasure dome when that is to say there were peace and fat feasting in Xanadu that he heard from afar Ancestral voices prophesying war One of the greatest of poets Coleridge was one of the wisest of men and it was not for nothing that he

difficulty be made and which is used also for bread The French are said to eat more bread per capita of population than any other people which is natural for only they know how to make the stuff palatable WHITE adj and n Black WIDOW n A pathetic figure that the Christian world has agreed to take humorously although Christ s tenderness towards widows was one of the most marked features of his character WINE n Fermented grape juice known to the Women s Christian Union as liquor sometimes as rum Wine madam is God s next best gift to man WIT n The salt with which the American humorist spoils his intellectual cookery by leaving it out WITCH n one Any ugly and repulsive old woman in a wicked league with the devil two A beautiful and attractive young woman in wickedness a league beyond the devil WITTICISM n A sharp and clever remark usually quoted and seldom noted what the Philistine is pleased to call a joke WOMAN n An animal usually living in the vicinity of Man and having a rudimentary susceptibility to domestication It is credited by many of the elder zoologists with a certain vestigial docility acquired in a former state of seclusion but naturalists of the postsusananthony period having no knowledge of the seclusion deny the virtue and declare that such as creation s dawn beheld it roareth now The species is the most widely distributed of all beasts of prey infesting all habitable parts of the globe from Greeland s spicy mountains to India s moral strand The popular name wolfman is incorrect for the creature is of the cat kind The woman is lithe and graceful in its movement especially the American variety felis pugnans is omnivorous and can be taught not to talk Balthasar Pober WORMS MEAT n The finished product of which we are the raw material The contents of the Taj Mahal the Tombeau Napoleon and the Granitarium Worms meat is usually outlasted by the structure that houses it but this too must pass away Probably the silliest work in which a human being can engage is construction of a tomb for himself The solemn purpose cannot dignify but only accentuates by contrast the foreknown futility Ambitious fool so mad to be a show How profitless the labor you bestow Upon a dwelling whose magnificence The tenant neither can admire nor know Build deep build high build massive as you can The wanton grass roots will defeat the plan By shouldering asunder all the stones In what to you would be a moment s span Time to the dead so all unreckoned flies That when your marble is all dust arise If wakened stretch your limbs and yawn You ll think you scarcely can have closed your eyes What though of all man s works your tomb alone Should stand till Time himself be overthrown Would it advantage you to dwell therein Forever as a stain upon a stone Joel Huck WORSHIP n Homo Creator s testimony to the sound construction and fine finish of Deus Creatus A popular form of abjection having an element of pride WRATH n Anger of a superior quality and degree appropriate to exalted characters and momentous occasions as the wrath of God the day of wrath et cetera Amongst the ancients the wrath of kings was deemed sacred for it could usually command the agency of some god for its fit manifestation as could also that of a priest The Greeks before Troy were so harried by Apollo that they jumped out of the frying pan of the wrath of Cryses into the fire of the wrath of Achilles though Agamemnon the sole offender was neither fried nor roasted A similar noted immunity was that of David when he incurred the wrath of Yahveh by numbering his people seventy thousand of whom paid the penalty with their lives God is now Love and a director of the census performs his work without apprehension of disaster X X in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to the attacks of the spelling reformers and like them will doubtless last as long as the language X is the sacred symbol of ten dollars and in such words as Xmas Xn et cetera stands for Christ not as is popular supposed because it represents a cross but because the corresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name Xristos If it represented a cross it would stand for saint Andrew who testified upon one of that shape In the algebra of psychology x stands for Woman s mind Words beginning with X are Grecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary Y YANKEE n In Europe an American In the Northern States of our Union a New Englander In the Southern States the word is unknown See DAMNYANK YEAR n A period of three hundred and sixty five disappointments YESTERDAY n The infancy of youth the youth of manhood the entire past of age But yesterday I should have thought me blest To stand high pinnacled upon the peak Of middle life and look adown the bleak And unfamiliar foreslope to the West Where solemn shadows all the land invest And stilly voices half remembered speak Unfinished prophecy and witch fires freak The haunted twilight of the Dark of Rest Yea yesterday my soul was all aflame To stay the shadow on the dial s face At manhood s noonmark Now in God His name I chide aloud the little interspace Disparting me from Certitude and fain Would know the dream and vision ne er again Baruch Arnegriff It is said that in his last illness the poet Arnegriff was attended at different times by seven doctors YOKE n An implement madam to whose Latin name jugum we owe one of the most illuminating words in our language a word that defines the matrimonial situation with precision point and poignancy A thousand apologies for withholding it YOUTH n The Period of Possibility when Archimedes finds a fulcrum Cassandra has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of endowing a living Homer Youth is the true Saturnian Reign the Golden Age on earth again when figs are grown on thistles and pigs betailed with whistles and wearing silken bristles live ever in clover and cows fly over delivering milk at every door and Justice never is heard to snore and every assassin is made a ghost and howling is cast into Baltimost Polydore Smith Z ZANY n A popular character in old Italian plays who imitated with ludicrous incompetence the buffone or clown and was therefore the ape of an ape for the clown himself imitated the serious characters of the play The zany was progenitor to the

n The point in the heavens directly overhead to a man standing or a growing cabbage A man in bed or a cabbage in the pot is not considered as having a zenith though from this view of the matter there was once a considerably dissent among the learned some holding that the posture of the body was immaterial These were called Horizontalists their opponents Verticalists The Horizontalist heresy was finally extinguished by Xanobus the philosopher king of Abara a zealous Verticalist Entering an assembly of philosophers who were debating the matter he cast a severed human head at the feet of his opponents and asked them to determine its zenith explaining that its body was hanging by the heels outside Observing that it was the head of their leader the Horizontalists hastened to profess themselves converted to whatever opinion the Crown might be pleased to hold and Horizontalism took its place among fides defuncti ZEUS n The chief of Grecian gods adored by the Romans as Jupiter and by the modern Americans as God Gold Mob and Dog Some explorers who have touched upon the shores of America and one who professes to have penetrated a considerable distance to the interior have thought
