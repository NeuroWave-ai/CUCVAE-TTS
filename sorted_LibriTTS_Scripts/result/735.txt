2272_150674_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But I have reviewed with diligence and pleasure the objects of ecclesiastical history by which the decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected the propagation of Christianity the constitution of the Catholic church the ruin of Paganism and the sects that arose from the mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation 
none	none	At the head of this class we may justly rank the worship of images so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of Italy the temporal power of the popes and the restoration of the Roman empire in the West Footnote one The learned Selden has given the history of transubstantiation in a comprehensive and pithy sentence This opinion is only rhetoric turned into logic his Works vol iii p twenty thirty seven in his Table Talk The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews and their enmity to the Greeks The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the foolish idolaters who bowed before the workmanship of their own hands the images of brass and marble which had they been endowed with sense and motion should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist two Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and saint Paul with the profane honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras three but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and spiritual and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the censure of the council of Illiberis three hundred years after the Christian aera Under the successors of Constantine in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition for the benefit of the multitude and after the ruin of Paganism they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel 
2272_150674_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the veneration of the cross and of relics 
none	none	The saints and martyrs whose intercession was implored were seated on the right hand if God but the gracious and often supernatural favors which in the popular belief were showered round their tomb conveyed an unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims who visited and touched and kissed these lifeless remains the memorials of their merits and sufferings four But a memorial more interesting than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy is the faithful copy of his person and features delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture In every age such copies so congenial to human feelings have been cherished by the zeal of private friendship or public esteem the images of the Roman emperors were adored with civil and almost religious honors a reverence less ostentatious but more sincere was applied to the statues of sages and patriots and these profane virtues these splendid sins disappeared in the presence of the holy men who had died for their celestial and everlasting country 
2272_150674_000011_000008	train-clean-360	At first the experiment was made with caution and scruple and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant to awaken the cold and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes 
none	none	By a slow though inevitable progression the honors of the original were transferred to the copy the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint and the Pagan rites of genuflection luminaries and incense again stole into the Catholic church The scruples of reason or piety were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles and the pictures which speak and move and bleed must be endowed with a divine energy and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adoration 
2272_150674_000011_000011	train-clean-360	The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt of defining by forms and colors the infinite Spirit the eternal Father who pervades and sustains the universe 
none	none	five But the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels and above all the Son of God under the human shape which on earth they have condescended to assume The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and mortal body but that body had ascended into heaven and had not some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples the spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the saints A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary the place of her burial was unknown and the assumption of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and Latins The use and even the worship of images was firmly established before the end of the sixth century they were fondly cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics the Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the West The bolder forms of sculpture in brass or marble which peopled the temples of antiquity were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the Christian Greeks and a smooth surface of colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation six Footnote two Nec intelligunt homines

Eglises Reformees of Basnage tom ii p thirteen ten thirteen thirty seven He was a Protestant but of a manly spirit and on this head the Protestants are so notoriously in the right that they can venture to be impartial See the perplexity of poor Friar Pagi Critica tom i p forty two The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the original but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God his mother and his apostles the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine seven was more probably that of some temporal savior the Gnostics and their profane monuments were reprobated and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model In this distress a bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the worship A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular basis of a Syrian legend on the correspondence of Christ and Abgarus so famous in the days of Eusebius so reluctantly deserted by our modern advocates The bishop of Caesarea eight records the epistle nine but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ ten the perfect impression of his face on a linen with which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing power and offered the strong city of Edessa to protect him against the malice of the Jews The ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall from whence after an oblivion of five hundred years it was released by some prudent bishop and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times Its first and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan and it was soon revered as a pledge of the divine promise that Edessa should never be taken by a foreign enemy It is true indeed that the text of Procopius ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valor of her citizens who purchased the absence and repelled the assaults of the Persian monarch He was ignorant the profane historian of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius that the Palladium was exposed on the rampart and that the water which had been sprinkled on the holy face instead of quenching added new fuel to the flames of the besieged After this important service the image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude and if the Armenians rejected the legend the more credulous Greeks adored the similitude which was not the work of any mortal pencil but the immediate creation of the divine original The style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold He who dwells in heaven condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image He who is seated on the cherubim visits us this day by a picture which the Father has delineated with his immaculate hand which he has formed in an ineffable manner and which we sanctify by adoring it with fear and love Before the end of the sixth century these images made without hands in Greek it is a single word eleven were propagated in the camps and cities of the Eastern empire twelve they were the objects of worship and the instruments of miracles and in the hour of danger or tumult their venerable presence could revive the hope rekindle the courage or repress the fury of the Roman legions Of these pictures the far greater part the transcripts of a human pencil could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper title but there were some of higher descent who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with the original endowed for that purpose with a miraculous and prolific virtue The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the image of Edessa and such is the veronica of Rome or Spain or Jerusalem which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to his face and delivered to a holy matron The fruitful precedent was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs In the church of Diospolis in Palestine the features of the Mother of God thirteen were deeply inscribed in a marble column the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of saint Luke and the Evangelist who was perhaps a physician has been forced to exercise the occupation of a painter so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians The Olympian Jove created by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion but these Catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius fourteen Footnote seven After removing some rubbish of miracle and inconsistency it may be allowed that as late as the year three hundred Paneas in Palestine was decorated with a bronze statue representing a grave personage wrapped in a cloak with a grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him and that an inscription was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal By the Christians this group was foolishly explained of their founder and the poor woman whom he had cured of the bloody flux Euseb vii eighteen Philostorg vii three c M de Beausobre more reasonably conjectures the philosopher Apollonius or the emperor Vespasian in the latter supposition the female is a city a province or perhaps the queen Berenice Bibliotheque Germanique tom xiii p

which have not been noticed by Gretser nor consequently by Beausobre Opera Joh Damascen tom i p six hundred eighteen six hundred thirty one Footnote fourteen Your scandalous figures stand quite out from the canvass they are as bad as a group of statues It was thus that the ignorance and bigotry of a Greek priest applauded the pictures of Titian which he had ordered and refused to accept The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible degrees and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind as productive of comfort and innocent of sin But in the beginning of the eighth century in the full magnitude of the abuse the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension that under the mask of Christianity they had restored the religion of their fathers they heard with grief and impatience the name of idolaters the incessant charge of the Jews and Mahometans fifteen who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative worship The servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal and depreciate their authority but the triumphant Mussulmans who reigned at Damascus and threatened Constantinople cast into the scale of reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory The cities of Syria Palestine and Egypt had been fortified with the images of Christ his mother and his saints and each city presumed on the hope or promise of miraculous defence In a rapid conquest of ten years the Arabs subdued those cities and these images and in their opinion the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and inanimate idols fifteen eleven For a while Edessa had braved the Persian assaults but the chosen city the spouse of Christ was involved in the common ruin and his divine resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels After a servitude of three hundred years the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans and a perpetual truce for the territory of Edessa sixteen In this season of distress and dismay the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of images and they attempted to prove that the sin and schism of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor and annihilated the virtue of these precious symbols But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational Christians who appealed to the evidence of texts of facts and of the primitive times and secretly desired the reformation of the church As the worship of images had never been established by any general or positive law its progress in the Eastern empire had been retarded or accelerated by the differences of men and manners the local degrees of refinement and the personal characters of the bishops The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by the levity of the capital and the inventive genius of the Byzantine clergy while the rude and remote districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred luxury Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians maintained after their conversion the simple worship which had preceded their separation and the Armenians the most warlike subjects of Rome were not reconciled in the twelfth century to the sight of images seventeen These various denominations of men afforded a fund of prejudice and aversion of small account in the villages of Anatolia or Thrace but which in the fortune of a soldier a prelate or a eunuch might be often connected with the powers of the church and state Footnote fifteen By Cedrenus Zonaras Glycas and Manasses the origin of the Aconoclcasts is imprinted to the caliph Yezid and two Jews who promised the empire to Leo and the reproaches of these hostile sectaries are turned into an absurd conspiracy for restoring the purity of the Christian worship see Spanheim Hist Imag c two Footnote fifteen eleven Yezid ninth caliph of the race of the Ommiadae caused all the images in Syria to be destroyed about the year seven hundred nineteen hence the orthodox reproaches the sectaries with following the example of the Saracens and the Jews Fragm

seven Abulpharagius Dynast p two hundred one and Abulfeda Annal Moslem p two hundred sixty four and the criticisms of Pagi tom iii A D nine hundred forty four The prudent Franciscan refuses to determine whether the image of Edessa now reposes at Rome or Genoa but its repose is inglorious and this ancient object of worship is no longer famous or fashionable Footnote seventeen Nicetas l ii p two hundred fifty eight The Armenian churches are still content with the Cross Missions du Levant tom iii p one hundred forty eight but surely the superstitious Greek is unjust to the superstition of the Germans of the xiith century Of such adventurers the most fortunate was the emperor Leo the Third eighteen who from the mountains of Isauria ascended the throne of the East He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters but his education his reason perhaps his intercourse with the Jews and Arabs had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images and it was held to be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates of his own conscience But in the outset of an unsettled reign during ten years of toil and danger Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy bowed before the idols which he despised and satisfied the Roman pontiff with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal In the reformation of religion his first steps were moderate and cautious he assembled a great council of senators and bishops and enacted with their consent that all the images should be removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible to the eyes and inaccessible to the superstition of the people But it was impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse impulse of veneration and abhorrence in their lofty position the sacred images still edified their votaries and reproached the tyrant He was himself provoked by resistance and invective and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple By a second edict he proscribed the existence as well as the use of religious pictures the churches of Constantinople and the provinces were cleansed from idolatry the images of Christ the Virgin and the saints were demolished or a smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice The sect of the Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despotism of six emperors and the East and West were involved in a noisy conflict of one hundred and twenty years It was the design of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of faith and by the authority of a general council but the convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son Constantine nineteen and though it is stigmatized by triumphant bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists their own partial and mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety The debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of Constantinople and was composed of the respectable number of three hundred and thirty eight bishops of Europe and Anatolia for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of the caliph and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks This Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh general council yet even this title was a recognition of the six preceding assemblies which had laboriously built the structure of the Catholic faith After a serious deliberation of six months the three hundred and thirty eight bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree that all visible symbols of Christ except in the Eucharist were either blasphemous or heretical that image worship was a corruption of Christianity and a renewal of Paganism that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased and that those who should refuse to deliver the objects of their private superstition were guilty of disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor In their loud and loyal acclamations they celebrated the merits of their temporal redeemer and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures At Constantinople as in the former councils the will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith but on this occasion I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear In the long night of superstition the Christians had wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel nor was it easy for them to discern the clew and tread back the mazes of the labyrinth The worship of images was inseparably blended at least to a pious fancy with the Cross the Virgin the Saints and their relics the holy ground was involved in a cloud of miracles and visions and the nerves of the mind curiosity and scepticism were benumbed by the habits of obedience and belief Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal license to doubt or deny or deride the mysteries of the Catholics twenty but they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his bishops and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret horror the monuments of popular devotion which were consecrated to the honor of his celestial patrons In the reformation of the sixteenth century freedom and knowledge had expanded all the faculties of man the thirst of innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity and the vigor of Europe could disdain those phantoms which terrified the sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks Footnote eighteen Our original but not impartial monuments of the Iconoclasts must be drawn from the Acts of the Councils tom viii and ix Collect Labbe edit Venet and the historical writings of Theophanes Nicephorus Manasses Cedrenus Zonoras c Of the modern Catholics Baronius Pagi Natalis Alexander Hist Eccles Seculum viii and ix and Maimbourg Hist des Iconoclasts have treated the subject with learning passion and credulity The Protestant labors of Frederick Spanheim Historia Imaginum restituta and James Basnage Hist des Eglises Reformees tom ii l xxiiii p thirteen thirty nine thirteen eighty five are cast into the Iconoclast scale With this mutual aid and opposite tendency it is easy for us to poise the balance with philosophic indifference Note Compare Schlosser Geschichte der Bilder sturmender Kaiser Frankfurt am Main eighteen twelve a

c Opera tom i p eight hundred six Footnote twenty He is accused of proscribing the title of saint styling the Virgin Mother of Christ comparing her after her delivery to an empty purse of Arianism Nestorianism c In his defence Spanheim c iv p two hundred seven is somewhat embarrassed between the interest of a Protestant and the duty of an orthodox divine The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to the people by the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet but the most ignorant can perceive the most torpid must feel the profanation and downfall of their visible deities The first hostilities of Leo were directed against a lofty Christ on the vestibule and above the gate of the palace A ladder had been planted for the assault but it was furiously shaken by a crowd of zealots and women they beheld with pious transport the ministers of sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed against the pavement and the honors of the ancient martyrs were prostituted to these criminals who justly suffered for murder and rebellion twenty one The execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by frequent tumults in Constantinople and the provinces the person of Leo was endangered his officers were massacred and the popular enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and military power Of the Archipelago or Holy Sea the numerous islands were filled with images and monks their votaries abjured without scruple the enemy of Christ his mother and the saints they armed a fleet of boats and galleys displayed their consecrated banners and boldly steered for the harbor of Constantinople to place on the throne a new favorite of God and the people They depended on the succor of a miracle but their miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire and after the defeat and conflagration of the fleet the naked islands were abandoned to the clemency or justice of the conqueror The son of Leo in the first year of his reign had undertaken an expedition against the Saracens during his absence the capital the palace and the purple were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith The worship of images was triumphantly restored the patriarch renounced his dissimulation or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous claims of the usurper was acknowledged both in the new and in ancient Rome Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal mountains but he descended at the head of the bold and affectionate Isaurians and his final victory confounded the arms and predictions of the fanatics His long reign was distracted with clamor sedition conspiracy and mutual hatred and sanguinary revenge the persecution of images was the motive or pretence of his adversaries and if they missed a temporal diadem they were rewarded by the Greeks with the crown of martyrdom In every act of open and clandestine treason the emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the monks the faithful slaves of the superstition to which they owed their riches and influence They prayed they preached they absolved they inflamed they conspired the solitude of Palestine poured forth a torrent of invective and the pen of saint John Damascenus twenty two the last of the Greek fathers devoted the tyrant s head both in this world and the next twenty three twenty three eleven I am not at leisure to examine how far the monks provoked nor how much they have exaggerated their real and pretended sufferings nor how many lost their lives or limbs their eyes or their beards by the cruelty of the emperor twenty three twelve From the chastisement of individuals he proceeded to the abolition of the order and as it was wealthy and useless his resentment might be stimulated by avarice and justified by patriotism The formidable name and mission of the Dragon twenty four his visitor general excited the terror and abhorrence of the black nation the religious communities were dissolved the buildings were converted into magazines or bar racks the lands movables and cattle were confiscated and our modern precedents will support the charge that much wanton or malicious havoc was exercised against the relics and even the books of the monasteries With the habit and profession of monks the public and private worship of images was rigorously proscribed and it should seem that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted from the subjects or at least from the clergy of the Eastern empire twenty five Footnote twenty one The holy confessor Theophanes approves the principle of their rebellion p three hundred thirty nine Gregory II in Epist i ad Imp Leon Concil tom viii p six hundred sixty one six hundred sixty four applauds the zeal of the Byzantine women who killed the Imperial officers Footnote twenty two John or Mansur was a noble Christian of Damascus who held a considerable office in the service of the caliph His zeal in the cause of images exposed him to the resentment and treachery of the Greek emperor and on the suspicion of a treasonable correspondence he was deprived of his right hand which was miraculously restored by the Virgin After this deliverance he resigned his office distributed his wealth and buried himself in the monastery of saint Sabas between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea The legend is famous but his learned editor Father Lequien has a unluckily proved that saint John Damascenus was already a monk

subscription I do not remember to have seen in any modern compilation The patient East abjured with reluctance her sacred images they were fondly cherished and vigorously defended by the independent zeal of the Italians In ecclesiastical rank and jurisdiction the patriarch of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal But the Greek prelate was a domestic slave under the eye of his master at whose nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne and from the throne to the convent A distant and dangerous station amidst the Barbarians of the West excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin bishops Their popular election endeared them to the Romans the public and private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue and the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to consult both in peace and war the temporal safety of the city In the school of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the virtues and the ambition of a prince the same character was assumed the same policy was adopted by the Italian the Greek or the Syrian who ascended the chair of saint Peter and after the loss of her legions and provinces the genius and fortune of the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome It is agreed that in the eighth century their dominion was founded on rebellion and that the rebellion was produced and justified by the heresy of the Iconoclasts but the conduct of the second and third Gregory in this memorable contest is variously interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies The Byzantine writers unanimously declare that after a fruitless admonition they pronounced the separation of the East and West and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue and sovereignty of Italy Their excommunication is still more clearly expressed by the Greeks who beheld the accomplishment of the papal triumphs and as they are more strongly attached to their religion than to their country they praise instead of blaming the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men twenty six The modern champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the precedent this great and glorious example of the deposition of royal heretics is celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine twenty seven and if they are asked why the same thunders were not hurled against the Neros and Julians of antiquity they reply that the weakness of the primitive church was the sole cause of her patient loyalty twenty eight On this occasion the effects of love and hatred are the same and the zealous Protestants who seek to kindle the indignation and to alarm the fears of princes and magistrates expatiate on the insolence and treason of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign twenty nine They are defended only by the moderate Catholics for the most part of the Gallican church thirty who respect the saint without approving the sin These common advocates of the crown and the mitre circumscribe the truth of facts by the rule

style is barbarous the narrative partial the details are trifling yet it must be read as a curious and authentic record of the times The epistles of the popes are dispersed in the volumes of Councils Chapter XLIX Conquest Of Italy By The Franks Part II Two original epistles from Gregory the Second to the emperor Leo are still extant thirty three and if they cannot be praised as the most perfect models of eloquence and logic they exhibit the portrait or at least the mask of the founder of the papal monarchy During ten pure and fortunate years says Gregory to the emperor we have tasted the annual comfort of your royal letters subscribed in purple ink with your own hand the sacred pledges of your attachment to the orthodox creed of our fathers How deplorable is the change how tremendous the scandal You now accuse the Catholics of idolatry and by the accusation you betray your own impiety and ignorance To this ignorance we are compelled to adapt the grossness of our style and arguments the first elements of holy letters are sufficient for your confusion and were you to enter a grammar school and avow yourself the enemy of our worship the simple and pious children would be provoked to cast their horn books at your head After this decent salutation the pope attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any visible likeness The latter are the genuine forms of Christ his mother and his saints who had approved by a crowd of miracles the innocence and merit of this relative worship He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo since he could assert the perpetual use of images from the apostolic age and their venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church A more specious argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general council and Gregory frankly confesses than such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox prince To the impudent and inhuman Leo more guilty than a heretic he recommends peace silence and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff To the former he appropriates the body to the latter the soul the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate the more formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not spare his offending father the successor of saint Peter may lawfully chastise the kings of the earth You assault us O tyrant with a carnal and military hand unarmed and naked we can only implore the Christ the prince of the heavenly host that he will send unto you a devil for the destruction of your body and the salvation of your soul You declare with foolish arrogance I will despatch my orders to Rome I will break in pieces the image of saint Peter and Gregory like his predecessor Martin shall be transported in chains and in exile to the foot of the Imperial throne Would to God that I might be permitted to tread in the footsteps of the holy Martin but may the fate of Constans serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church After his just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily the tyrant was cut off in the fullness of his sins by a domestic servant the saint is still adored by the nations of Scythia among whom he ended his banishment and his life But it is our duty to live for the edification and support of the faithful people nor are we reduced to risk our safety on the event of a combat Incapable as you are of defending your Roman subjects the maritime situation of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to the distance of four and twenty stadia to the first fortress of the Lombards and then you may pursue the winds Are you ignorant that the popes are the bond of union the mediators of peace between the East and West The eyes of the nations are fixed on our humility and they revere as a God upon earth the apostle saint Peter whose image you threaten to destroy thirty five The remote and interior kingdoms of the West present their homage to Christ and his vicegerent and we now prepare to visit one of their most powerful monarchs who desires to receive from our hands the sacrament of baptism thirty six The Barbarians have submitted to the yoke of the gospel while you alone are deaf to the voice of the shepherd These pious Barbarians are kindled into rage they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East Abandon your rash and fatal enterprise reflect tremble and repent If you persist we are innocent of the blood that will be spilt in the contest may it fall on your own head Footnote thirty three The two epistles of Gregory II have been preserved in the Acta of the Nicene Council tom viii p six hundred fifty one six hundred seventy four They are without a date which is variously fixed by Baronius in the year seven hundred twenty six by Muratori Annali d Italia tom vi p one hundred twenty in seven hundred twenty nine and by Pagi in seven hundred thirty Such is the force of prejudice that some papists have praised the good sense and moderation of these letters Footnote thirty four Epist i p six hundred sixty four This proximity of the Lombards is hard of digestion Camillo Pellegrini Dissert iv de Ducatu Beneventi in the Script Ital tom v p

believe that Gregory with the pedantry of the age employs stadia for miles without much inquiry into the genuine measure Footnote thirty five Footnote thirty six p six hundred sixty five The pope appears to have imposed on the ignorance of the Greeks he lived and died in the Lateran and in his time all the kingdoms of the West had embraced Christianity May not this unknown Septetus have some reference to the chief of the Saxon Heptarchy to Ina king of Wessex who in the pontificate of Gregory the Second visited Rome for the purpose not of baptism but of pilgrimage Pagi A eighty nine No two A D seven hundred twenty six No fifteen The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the West who related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the emperor But on the reception of his proscriptive edict they trembled for their domestic deities the images of Christ and the Virgin of the angels martyrs and saints were abolished in all the churches of Italy and a strong alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff the royal favor as the price of his compliance degradation and exile as the penalty of his disobedience Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance Without depending on prayers or miracles he boldly armed against the public enemy and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of their danger and their duty thirty seven At this signal Ravenna Venice and the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis adhered to the cause of religion their military force by sea and land consisted for the most part of the natives and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into the mercenary strangers The Italians swore to live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images the Roman people was devoted to their father and even the Lombards were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war The most treasonable act but the most obvious revenge was the destruction of the statues of Leo himself the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion was the withholding the tribute of Italy and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation thirty eight A form of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and governors and so high was the public indignation that the Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor and to conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople In that palace the Roman bishops the second and third Gregory were condemned as the authors of the revolt and every attempt was made either by fraud or force to seize their persons and to strike at their lives The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust they landed with foreign troops they obtained some domestic aid and the superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans the Greeks were overthrown and massacred their leaders suffered an ignominious death and the popes however inclined to mercy refused to intercede for these guilty victims At Ravenna thirty nine the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud in religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit and the exarch who attempted to stem the torrent lost his life in a popular sedition To punish this flagitious deed and restore his dominion in Italy the emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic Gulf After suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay the Greeks made their descent in the neighborhood of Ravenna they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital and to imitate perhaps to surpass the example of Justinian the Second who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants The women and clergy in sackcloth and ashes lay prostrate in prayer the men were in arms for the defence of their country the common danger had united the factions and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege In a hard fought day as the two armies alternately yielded and advanced a phantom was seen a voice was heard and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory The strangers retreated to their ships but the populous sea coast poured forth a multitude of boats the waters of the Po were so deeply infected with blood that during six years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the river and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated the worship of images and the abhorrence of the Greek tyrant Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms the Roman pontiff convened a synod of ninety three bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts With their consent he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved forty but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head No sooner had they confirmed their own safety the worship of images and the freedom of Rome and Italy than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity and to have spared the relics of the Byzantine dominion Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor and they exhorted the Italians not to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna a captive rather than a master and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine forty one Footnote thirty seven I shall transcribe the important and decisive passage of the Liber Pontificalis Respiciens ergo pius vir profanam principis

and fall of the empire the god Terminus the sacred boundary had insensibly receded from the ocean the Rhine the Danube and the Euphrates and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo to Terracina and from Narni to the mouth of the Tyber forty two When the kings were banished the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and virtue Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two annual magistrates the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people by a well proportioned scale of property and service Ignorant of the arts of luxury the primitive Romans had improved the science of government and war the will of the community was absolute the rights of individuals were sacred one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory forty three When the sovereignty of the Greek emperors was extinguished the ruins of Rome presented the sad image of depopulation and decay her slavery was a habit her liberty an accident the effect of superstition and the object of her own amazement and terror The last vestige of the substance or even the forms of the constitution was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans and they were devoid of knowledge or virtue again to build the fabric of a commonwealth Their scanty remnant the offspring of slaves and strangers was despicable in the eyes of the victorious Barbarians As often as the Franks or Lombards expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe they called him a Roman and in this name says the bishop Liutprand we include whatever is base whatever is cowardly whatever is perfidious the extremes of avarice and luxury and every vice that can prostitute the dignity of human nature forty four four hundred forty one By the necessity of their situation the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model of a republican government they were compelled to elect some judges in peace and some leaders in war the nobles assembled to deliberate and their resolves could not be executed without the union and consent of the multitude The style of the Roman senate and people was revived forty five but the spirit was fled and their new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of vicentiousness and oppression The want of laws could only be supplied by the influence of religion and their foreign and domestic counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop His alms his sermons his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the West his recent services their gratitude and oath accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first magistrate or prince of the city The Christian humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus or Lord and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient coins forty six Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years and their noblest title is the free choice of a people whom they had redeemed from slavery

In the quarrels of ancient Greece the holy people of Elis enjoyed a perpetual peace under the protection of Jupiter and in the exercise of the Olympic games forty seven Happy would it have been for the Romans if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of saint Peter from the calamities of war if the Christians who visited the holy threshold would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his successor But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator and a sage this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the popes the Romans were not addicted like the inhabitants of Elis to the innocent and placid labors of agriculture and the Barbarians of Italy though softened by the climate were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of public and private life A memorable example of repentance and piety was exhibited by Liutprand king of the Lombards In arms at the gate of the Vatican the conqueror listened to the voice of Gregory the Second forty eight withdrew his troops resigned his conquests respectfully visited the church of saint Peter and after performing his devotions offered his sword and dagger his cuirass and mantle his silver cross and his crown of gold on the tomb of the apostle But this religious fervor was the illusion perhaps the artifice of the moment the sense of interest is strong and lasting the love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards and both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy the nakedness of Rome and the unwarlike profession of her new chief On the first edicts of the emperor they declared themselves the champions of the holy images Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna which had already assumed that distinctive appellation the Catholics of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance to his civil and military power and a foreign enemy was introduced for the first time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna That city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians and those faithful subjects obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself in separating the personal guilt of Leo from the general cause of the Roman empire forty nine The Greeks were less mindful of the service than the Lombards of the injury the two nations hostile in their faith were reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance the king and the exarch marched to the conquest of Spoleto and Rome the storm evaporated without effect but the policy of Liutprand alarmed Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce His successor Astolphus declared himself the equal enemy of the emperor and the pope Ravenna was subdued by force or treachery fifty and this final conquest extinguished the series of the exarchs who had reigned with a subordinate power since the time of Justinian and the ruin of the Gothic kingdom Rome was summoned to acknowledge the victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each citizen and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience The Romans hesitated they entreated they complained and the threatening Barbarians were checked by arms and negotiations till the popes had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the Alps

Subregulus Pepin and Charlemagne as far as the year seven hundred ninety one when it was formed by the last of these princes His original and authentic Ms Bibliothecae Cubicularis is now in the Imperial library of Vienna and has been published by Lambecius and Muratori Script Rerum Ital tom iii pars ii p seventy five c In his distress the first five hundred eleven Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of the age of Charles Martel who governed the French monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke and who by his signal victory over the Saracens had saved his country and perhaps Europe from the Mahometan yoke The ambassadors of the pope were received by Charles with decent reverence but the greatness of his occupations and the shortness of his life prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy except by a friendly and ineffectual mediation His son Pepin the heir of his power and virtues assumed the office of champion of the Roman church and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been prompted by the love of glory and religion But the danger was on the banks of the Tyber the succor on those of the Seine and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery Amidst the tears of the city Stephen the Third embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of Lombardy and France to deprecate the injustice of his enemy or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend After soothing the public despair by litanies and orations he undertook this laborious journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek emperor The king of the Lombards was inexorable but his threats could not silence the complaints nor retard the speed of the Roman pontiff who traversed the Pennine Alps reposed in the abbey of saint Maurice and hastened to grasp the right hand of his protector a hand which was never lifted in vain either in war or friendship Stephen was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle at the next assembly the field of March or of May his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation and he repassed the Alps not as a suppliant but as a conqueror at the head of a French army which was led by the king in person The Lombards after a weak resistance obtained an ignominious peace and swore to restore the possessions and to respect the sanctity of the Roman church But no sooner was Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace Rome was again encompassed by his arms and Stephen apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of saint Peter himself fifty two The apostle assures his adopted sons the king the clergy and the nobles of France that dead in the flesh he is still alive in the spirit that they now hear and must obey the voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman church that the Virgin the angels the saints and the martyrs and all the host of heaven unanimously urge the request and will confess the obligation that riches victory and paradise will crown their pious enterprise and that eternal damnation will be the penalty of their neglect if they suffer his tomb his temple and his people to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards The second expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and fortunate than the first saint Peter was satisfied Rome was again saved and Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a foreign master After this double chastisement the Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor and decay But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble they peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims evasions and inroads which they undertook without reflection and terminated without glory On either side their expiring monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the First the genius the fortune and greatness of Charlemagne the son of Pepin these heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic friendship and while they trampled on the prostrate they varnished their proceedings with the fairest colors of equity and moderation fifty three The passes of the Alps and the walls of Pavia were the only defence of the Lombards the former were surprised the latter were invested by the son of Pepin and after a blockade of two years five hundred thirty one Desiderius the last of their native princes surrendered his sceptre and his capital Under the dominion of a foreign king but in the possession of their national laws the Lombards became the brethren rather than the subjects of the Franks who derived their

important link of ancient and modern of civil and ecclesiastical history In the conquest of Italy the champions of the Roman church obtained a favorable occasion a specious title the wishes of the people the prayers and intrigues of the clergy But the most essential gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France fifty five and of patrician of Rome I Under the sacerdotal monarchy of saint Peter the nations began to resume the practice of seeking on the banks of the Tyber their kings their laws and the oracles of their fate The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of their government All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin mayor of the palace and nothing except the regal title was wanting to his ambition His enemies were crushed by his valor his friends were multiplied by his liberality his father had been the savior of Christendom and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four generations The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis the feeble Childeric but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution and Pepin a subject and a prince was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family The mayor and the nobles were bound by an oath of fidelity to the royal phantom the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff to dispel their scruples or to absolve their promise The interest of Pope Zachary the successor of the two Gregories prompted him to decide and to decide in their favor he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king and that the unfortunate Childeric a victim of the public safety should be degraded shaved and confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days An answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a casuist the sentence of a judge or the oracle of a prophet the Merovingian race disappeared from the earth and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people accustomed to obey his laws and to march under his standard His coronation was twice performed with the sanction of the popes by their most faithful servant saint Boniface the apostle of Germany and by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third who in the monastery of saint Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor The royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously applied fifty six the successor of saint Peter assumed the character of a divine ambassador a German chieftain was transformed into the Lord s anointed and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe The Franks were absolved from their ancient oath but a dire anathema was thundered against them and their posterity if they should dare to renew the same freedom of choice or to elect a king except in the holy and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes Without apprehending the future danger these princes gloried in their present security the secretary of Charlemagne affirms that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of the popes fifty seven and in their boldest enterprises they insist with

eight were far removed from the senate of Romulus on the palace of Constantine from the free nobles of the republic or the fictitious parents of the emperor After the recovery of Italy and Africa by the arms of Justinian the importance and danger of those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme magistrate he was indifferently styled the exarch or the patrician and these governors of Ravenna who fill their place in the chronology of princes extended their jurisdiction over the Roman city Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of the Exarchate the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice of their independence Yet even in this act they exercised the right of disposing of themselves and the decrees of the senate and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity with the honors of patrician of Rome The leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate office but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended and in the vacancy of the empire they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic The Roman ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of saint Peter as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty with a holy banner which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the church and city fifty nine In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the freedom while it threatened the safety of Rome and the patriciate represented only the title the service the alliance of these distant protectors The power and policy of Charlemagne annihilated an enemy and imposed a master In his first visit to the capital he was received with all the honors which had formerly been paid to the exarch the representative of the emperor and these honors obtained some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian the First sixty No sooner was he informed of the sudden approach of the monarch than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him with the banner about thirty miles from the city At the distance of one mile the Flaminian way was lined with the schools or national communities of Greeks Lombards Saxons c the Roman youth were under arms and the children of a more tender age with palms and olive branches in their hands chanted the praises of their great deliverer At the aspect of the holy crosses and ensigns of the saints he dismounted from his horse led the procession of his nobles to the Vatican and as he ascended the stairs devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles In the portico Adrian expected him at the head of his clergy they embraced as friends and equals but in their march to the altar the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the pope Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty demonstrations of respect In the twenty six years that elapsed between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coronation Rome which had been delivered by the sword was subject as his own to the sceptre of Charlemagne The people swore allegiance to his person and family in his name money was coined and justice was administered and the election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his authority Except an original and self inherent claim of sovereignty there was not any prerogative remaining which the title of emperor could add

of Charlemagne describes Rome as his subject city vestrae civitates ad Pompeium Festum suis addidit sceptris de Metensis Ecclesiae Episcopis Some Carlovingian medals struck at Rome have engaged Le Blanc to write an elaborate though partial dissertation on their authority at Rome both as patricians and emperors Amsterdam sixteen ninety two in fourto The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these obligations and their names are consecrated as the saviors and benefactors of the Roman church Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and provinces and the donation of the Exarchate was the first fruits of the conquests of Pepin sixty two Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey the keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the French ambassador and in his master s name he presented them before the tomb of saint Peter The ample measure of the Exarchate sixty three might comprise all the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the emperor and his vicegerent but its strict and proper limits were included in the territories of Ravenna Bologna and Ferrara its inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis which stretched along the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona and advanced into the midland country as far as the ridges of the Apennine In this transaction the ambition and avarice of the popes have been severely condemned Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profession Perhaps a faithful subject or even a generous enemy would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the Barbarian and if the emperor had intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the restitution of the Exarchate I will not absolve the pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood But in the rigid interpretation of the laws every one may accept without injury whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice The Greek emperor had abdicated or forfeited his right to the Exarchate and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the stronger sword of the Carlovingian It was not in the cause of the Iconoclast that Pepin has exposed his person and army in a double expedition beyond the Alps he possessed and might lawfully alienate his conquests and to the importunities of the Greeks he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he had conferred on the Roman Pontiff for the remission of his sins and the salvation of his soul The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bishop invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince the choice of magistrates the exercise of justice the imposition of taxes and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna In the dissolution of the Lombard kingdom the inhabitants of the duchy of Spoleto sixty four sought a refuge from the storm shaved their heads after the Roman fashion declared themselves the servants and subjects of saint Peter and completed by this voluntary surrender the present circle of the ecclesiastical state That mysterious circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent by the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne sixty five who in the first transports of his victory despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the Exarchate But in the cooler moments of absence and reflection he viewed with an eye of jealousy and envy the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally The execution of his own and his father s promises was respectfully eluded the king of the Franks and Lombards asserted the inalienable rights of the empire and in his life and death Ravenna sixty six as well as Rome was numbered in the list of his metropolitan cities The sovereignty of the Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes they found in the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival sixty seven the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest and in the disorders of the times they could only retain the memory of an ancient claim which in a more prosperous age they have revived and realized Footnote sixty two Mosheim Institution Hist Eccles p two hundred sixty three weighs this donation with fair and

were an arsenal and manufacture which according to the occasion have produced or concealed a various collection of false or genuine of corrupt or suspicious acts as they tended to promote the interest of the Roman church Before the end of the eighth century some apostolic scribe perhaps the notorious Isidore composed the decretals and the donation of Constantine the two magic pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes This memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of Adrian the First who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the liberality and revive the name of the great Constantine sixty eight According to the legend the first of the Christian emperors was healed of the leprosy and purified in the waters of baptism by saint Silvester the Roman bishop and never was physician more gloriously recompensed His royal proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of saint Peter declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the East and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome Italy and the provinces of the West sixty nine This fiction was productive of the most beneficial effects The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt of usurpation and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his lawful inheritance The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state The sovereignty of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people and the successors of saint Peter and Constantine were invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times that the most absurd of fables was received with equal reverence in Greece and in France and is still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law seventy The emperors and the Romans were incapable of discerning a forgery that subverted their rights and freedom and the only opposition proceeded from a Sabine monastery which in the beginning of the twelfth century disputed the truth and validity of the donation of Constantine seventy one In the revival of letters and liberty this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot seventy two His contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his sacrilegious boldness yet such is the silent and irresistible progress of reason that before the end of the next age the fable was rejected by the contempt of historians seventy three and poets seventy four and the tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the Roman church seventy five The popes themselves have indulged a smile at the credulity of the vulgar seventy six but a false and obsolete title still sanctifies their reign and by the same fortune which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been undermined

in the Eastern empire seventy seven Under the reign of Constantine the Fifth the union of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree without extirpating the root of superstition The idols for such they were now held were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone to devotion and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of man Leo the Fourth maintained with less rigor the religion of his father and grandfather but his wife the fair and ambitious Irene had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians the heirs of the Idolatry rather than the philosophy of their ancestors During the life of her husband these sentiments were inflamed by danger and dissimulation and she could only labor to protect and promote some favorite monks whom she drew from their caverns and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East But as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son Irene more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts and the first step of her future persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience In the restoration of the monks a thousand images were exposed to the public veneration a thousand legends were inverted of their sufferings and miracles By the opportunities of death or removal the episcopal seats were judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or celestial favor anticipated and flattered the judgment of their sovereign and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the patriarch of Constantinople and the command of the Oriental church But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar assembly seventy eight the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in possession and averse to debate and the feeble voice of the bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamor of the soldiers and people of Constantinople The delay and intrigues of a year the separation of the disaffected troops and the choice of Nice for a second orthodox synod removed these obstacles and the episcopal conscience was again after the Greek fashion in the hands of the prince No more than eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this important work the Iconoclasts appeared not as judges but as criminals or penitents the scene was decorated by the legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern patriarchs seventy nine the decrees were framed by the president Taracius and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three hundred and fifty bishops They unanimously pronounced that the worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason to the fathers and councils of the church but they hesitate whether that worship be relative or direct whether the Godhead and the figure of Christ be entitled to the same mode of adoration Of this second Nicene council the acts are still extant a curious monument of superstition and ignorance of falsehood and folly I shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of image worship and morality A monk had concluded a truce with the daemon of fornication on condition of interrupting his daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell His scruples prompted him to consult the abbot Rather than abstain from adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy images it would be better for you replied the casuist to enter every brothel and visit every prostitute in the city eighty For the honor of orthodoxy at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church it is somewhat unfortunate that the two princes who convened the two councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her friends During the five succeeding reigns a period of thirty eight years the contest was maintained with unabated rage and various success between the worshippers and the breakers of the images but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events Nicephorus allowed a general liberty of speech and practice and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition Superstition and weakness formed the character of Michael the First but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne In the purple Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an Armenian and the idols with their seditious adherents were condemned to a second exile Their applause would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant but his assassin and successor the second Michael was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian heresies he attempted to mediate between the contending parties and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him into the opposite scale His moderation was guarded by timidity but his son Theophilus alike ignorant of fear and pity was the last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly against them and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred After the death of Theophilus the final victory of the images was achieved by a second female his widow Theodora whom he left the guardian of the empire Her measures were bold and decisive The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of her deceased husband the sentence of the Iconoclast patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of two hundred lashes the bishops trembled the monks shouted and the festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images A single question yet remained whether they are endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity it was agitated by the Greeks of the eleventh century eighty one and as this opinion has the strongest recommendation of absurdity I am surprised that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative In the West Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced the decrees of the Nicene assembly which is now revered by the Catholics as the seventh in rank of the general councils Rome and Italy were docile to the voice of their father but the greatest part of the Latin Christians were far behind in the race of superstition The churches of France Germany England and Spain steered a middle course between the adoration and the destruction of images which they admitted into their temples not as objects of worship but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history An angry book of controversy was composed and published in the name of Charlemagne eighty two under his authority a synod of three hundred bishops was assembled at Frankfort eighty three they blamed the fury of the Iconoclasts but they pronounced a more severe censure against the superstition of the Greeks and the decrees of their pretended council which was long despised by the Barbarians of the West eighty four Among them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible progress but a large atonement is made for their hesitation and delay by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede the reformation and of the countries both in Europe and America which are still immersed in the gloom of superstition Footnote seventy seven The remaining history of images from Irene to Theodora is

popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne They were compelled to choose between the rival nations religion was not the sole motive of their choice and while they dissembled the failings of their friends they beheld with reluctance and suspicion the Catholic virtues of their foes The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years In that schism the Romans had tasted of freedom and the popes of sovereignty their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence as well as the tyranny of the Byzantine court The Greek emperors had restored the images but they had not restored the Calabrian estates eighty five and the Illyrian diocese eighty six which the Iconociasts had torn away from the successors of saint Peter and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy eighty seven The Greeks were now orthodox but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch the Franks were now contumacious but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion from the use to the adoration of images The name of Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes but the conqueror himself conformed with the temper of a statesman to the various practice of France and Italy In his four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety knelt before the tomb and consequently before the image of the apostle and joined without scruple in all the prayers and processions of the Roman liturgy Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate Had they power to abolish his government of Rome The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne and it was only by reviving the Western empire that they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks from the debasement of a provincial town the majesty of Rome would be restored the Latin Christians would be united under a supreme head in their ancient metropolis and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown from the successors of saint Peter The Roman church would acquire a zealous and respectable advocate and under the shadow of the Carlovingian power the bishop might exercise with honor and safety the government of the city eighty eight Footnote eighty five Theophanes p three

the ruin of Paganism in Rome the competition for a wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed The people was less numerous but the times were more savage the prize more important and the chair of saint Peter was fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign The reign of Adrian the First eighty nine surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages ninety the walls of Rome the sacred patrimony the ruin of the Lombards and the friendship of Charlemagne were the trophies of his fame he secretly edified the throne of his successors and displayed in a narrow space the virtues of a great prince His memory was revered but in the next election a priest of the Lateran Leo the Third was preferred to the nephew and the favorite of Adrian whom he had promoted to the first dignities of the church Their acquiescence or repentance disguised above four years the blackest intention of revenge till the day of a procession when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed multitude and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred person of the pope But their enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed perhaps by their own confusion and remorse Leo was left for dead on the ground on his revival from the swoon the effect of his loss of blood he recovered his speech and sight and this natural event was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue of which he had been deprived twice deprived by the knife of the assassins ninety one From his prison he escaped to the Vatican the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue Charlemagne sympathized in his injury and in his camp of Paderborn in Westphalia accepted or solicited a visit from the Roman pontiff Leo repassed the Alps with a commission of counts and bishops the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence and it was not without reluctance that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office In his fourth and last pilgrimage he was received at Rome with the due honors of king and patrician Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge his enemies were silenced and the sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty of exile On the festival of Christmas the last year of the eighth century Charlemagne appeared in the church of saint Peter and to gratify the vanity of Rome he had exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a patrician ninety two After the celebration of the holy mysteries Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head ninety three and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people Long life and victory to Charles the most pious Augustus crowned by God the great and pacific emperor of the Romans The head and body of Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction after the example of the Caesars he was saluted or adored by the pontiff his coronation oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of the church and the first fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle In his familiar conversation the emperor protested the ignorance of the intentions of Leo which he would have disappointed by his absence on that memorable day But the preparations of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret and the journey of Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation he had acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his ambition and a Roman synod had pronounced that it was the only adequate reward of his merit and services ninety four Footnote eighty nine His merits and hopes are summed up in an epitaph of thirty eight verses of which Charlemagne declares himself the author Concil tom viii p five hundred twenty Post patrem lacrymans Carolus haec carmina scripsi Tu mihi dulcis amor te modo plango pater Nomina jungo simul titulis clarissime

Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favor the title has been indissolubly blended with the name That name with the addition of saint is inserted in the Roman calendar and the saint by a rare felicity is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age ninety five His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendor from the nakedness of the surrounding desert Without injustice to his fame I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the Western empire Of his moral virtues chastity is not the most conspicuous ninety six but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines the various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters ninety seven whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion nine hundred seventy one I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror but in a day of equal retribution the sons of his brother Carloman the Merovingian princes of Aquitain and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne His treatment of the vanquished Saxons ninety eight was an abuse of the right of conquest his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms and in the discussion of his motives whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire neither peace nor war nor summer nor winter were a season of repose and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions nine hundred eighty one But this activity was a national rather than a personal virtue the vagrant life of a Frank was spent in the chase in pilgrimage in military adventures and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose His military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops his enemies and his actions Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name their examples and the companions of their victories At the head of his veteran and superior armies he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations who were incapable of confederating for their common safety nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers in discipline or in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success and he might behold with envy the Saracen trophies of his grandfather After the Spanish expedition his rear guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains and the soldiers whose situation was irretrievable and whose valor was useless might accuse with their last breath the want of skill or caution of their general ninety nine I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne so highly applauded by a respectable judge They compose not a system but a series of occasional and minute edicts for the correction of abuses the reformation of manners the economy of his farms the care of his poultry and even the sale of his eggs He wished to improve the laws and the character of the Franks and his attempts however feeble and imperfect are deserving of praise the inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government one hundred but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator who survives himself for the benefit of posterity The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of a single man he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons and after his numerous diets the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction and his son Lewis when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops might accuse in some measure the imprudence of his father His laws enforced the imposition of tithes because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity one hundred one The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of schools the introduction of arts the works which were published in his name and his familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both the prince and people His own studies were tardy laborious and imperfect if he spoke Latin and understood Greek he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation rather than from books and in his mature age the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing which every peasant now learns in his infancy one hundred two The grammar and logic the music and astronomy of the times were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its improvement and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne one hundred three The dignity of his person one hundred four the length of his reign the prosperity of his arms the vigor of his government and the reverence of distant nations distinguish him from the royal crowd and Europe dates a new aera from his restoration of the Western empire

That empire was not unworthy of its title one hundred five and some of the fairest kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a prince who reigned at the same time in France Spain Italy Germany and Hungary one hundred six I The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into the name and monarchy of France but in the decay of the Merovingian line its limits were contracted by the independence of the Britons and the revolt of Aquitain Charlemagne pursued and confined the Britons on the shores of the ocean and that ferocious tribe whose origin and language are so different from the French was chastised by the imposition of tribute hostages and peace After a long and evasive contest the rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the forfeiture of their province their liberty and their lives Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious governors who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace But a recent discovery one hundred seven has proved that these unhappy princes were the last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis and younger branch from the brother of Dagobert of the Merovingian house Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne to the counties of Fesenzac and Armagnac at the foot of the Pyrenees their race was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century and after surviving their Carlovingian tyrants they were reserved to feel the injustice or the favors of a third dynasty By the reunion of Aquitain France was enlarged to its present boundaries with the additions of the Netherlands and Spain as far as the Rhine II The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father of Charlemagne but they still possessed the greatest part of Spain from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees Amidst their civil divisions an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his protection in the diet of Paderborn Charlemagne undertook the expedition restored the emir and without distinction of faith impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians and rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans In his absence he instituted the Spanish march one hundred eight which extended from the Pyrenees to the River Ebro Barcelona was the residence of the French governor he possessed the counties of Rousillon and Catalonia and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were subject to his jurisdiction III As king of the Lombards and patrician of Rome he reigned over the greatest part of Italy one hundred nine a tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of Calabria The duchy of Beneventum a Lombard fief had spread at the expense of the Greeks over the modern kingdom of Naples But Arrechis the reigning duke refused to be included in the slavery of his country assumed the independent title of prince and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian monarchy His defence was firm his submission was not inglorious and the emperor was content with an easy tribute the demolition of his fortresses and the acknowledgement on his coins of a supreme lord The artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of father but he asserted his dignity with prudence and Benventum insensibly escaped from the French yoke one hundred ten IV Charlemagne was the first who united Germany under the same sceptre The name of Oriental France is preserved in the circle of Franconia and the people of Hesse and Thuringia were recently incorporated with the victors by the conformity of religion and government The Alemanni so formidable to the Romans were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks and their country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace Swabia and Switzerland The Bavarians with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners were less patient of a master the repeated treasons of Tasillo justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes and their power was shared among the counts who judged and guarded that important frontier But the north of Germany from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe was still hostile and Pagan nor was it till after a war of thirty three years that the Saxons bowed under the yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne The idols and their votaries were extirpated the foundation of eight bishoprics of Munster Osnaburgh Paderborn and Minden of Bremen Verden Hildesheim and Halberstadt define on either side of the Weser the bounds of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first schools and cities of that savage land and the religion and humanity of the children atoned in some degree for the massacre of the parents Beyond the Elbe the Slavi or Sclavonians of similar manners and various denominations overspread the modern dominions of Prussia Poland and Bohemia and some transient marks of obedience have tempted the French historian to extend the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula The conquest or conversion of those countries is of a more recent age but the first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne V He retaliated on the Avars or Huns of Pannonia the same calamities which they had inflicted on the nations Their rings the wooden fortifications which encircled their districts and villages were broken down by the triple effort of a French army that was poured into their country by land and water through the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube After a bloody conflict of eight years the loss of some French generals was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns the relics of the nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and unknown and the treasures the rapine of two hundred and fifty years enriched the victorious troops or decorated the churches of Italy and Gaul one hundred eleven After the reduction of Pannonia the empire of Charlemagne was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the Save the provinces of Istria Liburnia and Dalmatia were an easy though unprofitable accession and it was an effect of his moderation that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks But these distant possessions added more to the reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor nor did he risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship Some canals of communication between the rivers the Saone and the Meuse the Rhine and the Danube were faintly attempted one hundred twelve Their execution would have vivified the empire and more cost and labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral eleven twenty one Footnote one hundred five See the concise but correct and original work of D Anville Etats Formes en

time of Charlemagne even if the term expended were substituted for wasted M Chapter XLIX Conquest Of Italy By The Franks Part V If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture it will be seen that the empire of the Franks extended between east and west from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula between the north and south from the duchy of Beneventum to the River Eyder the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin and after the loss of Spain the Christian and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch implored the honor and support of his alliance and styled him their common parent the sole and supreme emperor of the West one hundred thirteen He maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid one hundred fourteen whose dominion stretched from Africa to India and accepted from his ambassadors a tent a water clock an elephant and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab who were strangers to each other s person and language and religion but their public correspondence was founded on vanity and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest Two thirds of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany But in the choice of his enemies eleven forty one we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the south The three and thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy and the Saracens from Spain The weakness of the Greeks would have insured an easy victory and the holy crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge and loudly justified by religion and policy Perhaps in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire to disarm the enemies of civilized society and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations But it has been wisely observed that in a light of precaution all conquest must be ineffectual unless it could be universal since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility one hundred fifteen The subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives The fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their brethren of the North the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans who in less than seventy years precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy Footnote one hundred thirteen See Eginhard c sixteen and Gaillard tom ii p three hundred sixty one three hundred eighty five who mentions with a loose reference the

borrowed his judicious remarks on Charlemagne s plan of conquest and the judicious distinction of his enemies of the first and the second enceinte tom ii p one hundred eighty four five hundred nine c Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution the titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne for the term of his life and his successors on each vacancy must have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election But the association of his son Lewis the Pious asserts the independent right of monarchy and conquest and the emperor seems on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of the clergy The royal youth was commanded to take the crown from the altar and with his own hands to place it on his head as a gift which he held from God his father and the nation one hundred sixteen The same ceremony was repeated though with less energy in the subsequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second the Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honor of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes who were already invested with their power and dominions The pious Lewis survived his brothers and embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne but the nations and the nobles his bishops and his children quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul and the foundations were undermined to the centre while the external surface was yet fair and entire After a war or battle which consumed one hundred thousand Franks the empire was divided by treaty between his three sons who had violated every filial and fraternal duty The kingdoms of Germany and France were forever separated the provinces of Gaul between the Rhone and the Alps the Meuse and the Rhine were assigned with Italy to the Imperial dignity of Lothaire In the partition of his share Lorraine and Arles two recent and transitory kingdoms were bestowed on the younger children and Lewis the Second his eldest son was content with the realm of Italy the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor On his death without any male issue the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and cousins and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates and of bestowing on the most obsequious or most liberal the Imperial office of advocate of the Roman church The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power and the ridiculous epithets of the bard the stammerer the fat and the simple distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion By the failure of the collateral branches the whole inheritance devolved to Charles the Fat the last emperor of his family his insanity authorized the desertion of Germany Italy and France he was deposed in a diet and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty had been spared According to the measure of their force the governors the bishops and the lords usurped the fragments of the falling empire and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of Charlemagne Of the greater part the title and possession were alike doubtful and the merit was adequate to the contracted scale of their dominions Those who could appear with an army at the gates of Rome were crowned emperors in the Vatican but their modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy and

were enlarged on every side by his son the first and greatest of the Othos A portion of Gaul to the west of the Rhine along the banks of the Meuse and the Moselle was assigned to the Germans by whose blood and language it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and Tacitus Between the Rhine the Rhone and the Alps the successors of Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of Burgundy and Arles In the North Christianity was propagated by the sword of Otho the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and Oder the marches of Brandenburgh and Sleswick were fortified with German colonies and the king of Denmark the dukes of Poland and Bohemia confessed themselves his tributary vassals At the head of a victorious army he passed the Alps subdued the kingdom of Italy delivered the pope and forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation of Germany From that memorable aera two maxims of public jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time I That the prince who was elected in the German diet acquired from that instant the subject kingdoms of Italy and Rome II But that he might not legally assume the titles of emperor

custom forces me to number Conrad I and Henry I the Fowler in the list of emperors a title which was never assumed by those kings of Germany The Italians Muratori for instance are more scrupulous and correct and only reckon the princes who have been crowned at Rome The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East by the alteration of his style and instead of saluting his fathers the Greek emperors he presumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation of brother one hundred twenty Perhaps in his connection with Irene he aspired to the name of husband his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language of peace and friendship and might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess who had renounced the most sacred duties of a mother The nature the duration the probable consequences of such a union between two distant and dissonant empires it is impossible to conjecture but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to suspect that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene to charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to the strangers of the West one hundred twenty one The French ambassadors were the spectators and had nearly been the victims of the conspiracy of Nicephorus and the national hatred Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome a proverb That the Franks were good friends and bad neighbors was in every one s mouth but it was dangerous to provoke a neighbor who might be tempted to reiterate in the church of saint Sophia the ceremony of his Imperial coronation After a tedious journey of circuit and delay the ambassadors of Nicephorus found him in his camp on the banks of the River Sala and Charlemagne affected to confound their vanity by displaying in a Franconian village the pomp or at least the pride of the Byzantine palace one hundred twenty two The Greeks were successively led through four halls of audience in the first they were ready to fall prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state till he informed them that he was only a servant the constable or master of the horse of the emperor The same mistake and the same answer were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine the steward and the chamberlain and their impatience was gradually heightened till the doors of the presence chamber were thrown open and they beheld the genuine monarch on his throne enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised and encircled with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs A treaty of peace and alliance was concluded between the two empires and the limits of the East and West were defined by the right of present possession But the Greeks one hundred twenty three soon forgot this humiliating equality or remembered it only to hate the Barbarians by whom it was extorted During the short union of virtue and power they respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne with the acclamations of basileus and emperor of the Romans As soon as these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son the Byzantine letters were inscribed To the king or as he styles himself the emperor of the Franks and Lombards When both power and virtue were extinct they despoiled Lewis the Second of his hereditary title and with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega degraded him among the crowd of Latin princes His reply one hundred twenty four is expressive of his weakness he proves with some learning that both in sacred and profane history the name of king is synonymous with the Greek word basileus if at Constantinople it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial sense he claims from his ancestors and from the popes a just participation of the honors of the Roman purple The same controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos and their ambassador describes in lively colors the insolence of the Byzantine court one hundred twenty five The Greeks affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons and in their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman emperors Footnote one hundred twenty Invidiam tamen suscepti nominis C P

assumed by the Gothic and Grecian princes and the importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate and spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman church In the Christian aristocracy the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration and to supply the vacancy of the bishop Rome was divided into twenty eight parishes and each parish was governed by a cardinal priest or presbyter a title which however common or modest in its origin has aspired to emulate the purple of kings Their number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons of the most considerable hospitals the seven palatine judges of the Lateran and some dignitaries of the church This ecclesiastical senate was directed by the seven cardinal bishops of the Roman province who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia Porto Velitrae Tusculum Praeneste Tibur and the Sabines than by their weekly service in the Lateran and their superior share in the honors and authority of the apostolic see On the death of the pope these bishops recommended a successor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals one hundred twenty six and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamor of the Roman people But the election was imperfect nor could the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor the advocate of the church had graciously signified his approbation and consent The royal commissioner examined on the spot the form and freedom of the proceedings nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the qualifications of the candidates that he accepted an oath of fidelity and confirmed the donations which had successively enriched the patrimony of saint Peter In the frequent schisms the rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor and in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge to condemn and to punish the crimes of a guilty pontiff Otho the First imposed a treaty on the senate and people who engaged to prefer the candidate most acceptable to his majesty one hundred twenty seven his successors anticipated or prevented their choice they bestowed the Roman benefice like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg on their chancellors or preceptors and whatever might be the merit of a Frank or Saxon his name sufficiently attests the interposition of foreign power These acts of prerogative were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular election The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or avarice of the multitude the Vatican and the Lateran were stained with blood and the most powerful senators the marquises of Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum held the apostolic see in a long and disgraceful servitude The Roman pontiffs of the ninth and tenth centuries were insulted imprisoned and murdered by their tyrants and such was their indigence after the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies that they could neither support the state of a prince nor exercise the charity of a priest one hundred twenty eight The influence of two sister prostitutes Marozia and Theodora was founded on their wealth and beauty their political and amorous intrigues the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre and their reign one hundred twenty nine may have suggested to the darker ages one hundred thirty the fable one hundred thirty one of a female pope one hundred thirty two The bastard son the grandson and the great grandson of Marozia a rare genealogy were seated in the chair of saint Peter and it was at the age of nineteen years that the second of these became the head of the Latin church thirteen twenty one His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a Roman synod and in the presence of Otho the Great As John XII had renounced the dress and decencies of his profession the soldier may not perhaps be dishonored by the wine which he drank the blood that he spilt the flames that he kindled or the licentious pursuits of gaming and hunting His open simony might be the consequence of distress and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus if it be true could not possibly be serious But we read with some surprise that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for prostitution and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of saint Peter lest in the devout act they should be violated by his successor one hundred thirty three The Protestants have dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist but to a philosophic eye the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their virtues After a long series of scandal the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory VII That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two projects I To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of election and forever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors and the Roman people II To bestow and resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice one hundred thirty four of the church and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and kingdoms of the earth After a contest of fifty years the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the ecclesiastical order whose liberty was connected with that of their chief But the second attempt though it was

century was derived from Caesar to the praefect of the city one hundred thirty six Between the arts of the popes and the violence of the people this supremacy was crushed and annihilated Content with the titles of emperor and Augustus the successors of Charlemagne neglected to assert this local jurisdiction In the hour of prosperity their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects and in the decay and division of the empire they were oppressed by the defence of their hereditary provinces Amidst the ruins of Italy the famous Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of her third husband and Hugh king of Burgundy was introduced by her faction into the mole of Hadrian or Castle of saint Angelo which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome Her son by the first marriage Alberic was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet but his reluctant and ungraceful service was chastised with a blow by his new father The blow was productive of a revolution Romans exclaimed the youth once you were the masters of the world and these Burgundians the most abject of your slaves They now reign these voracious and brutal savages and my injury is the commencement of your servitude one hundred thirty seven The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame Marozia was imprisoned by her victorious son and his brother Pope John XI was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions With the title of prince Alberic possessed above twenty years the government of Rome and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice by restoring the office or at least the title of consuls and tribunes His son and heir Octavian assumed with the pontificate the name of John XII like his predecessor he was provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic and the services of Otho were rewarded with the Imperial dignity But the Saxon was imperious the Romans were impatient the festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom and Otho commanded his sword bearer not to stir from his person lest he should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar one hundred thirty eight Before he repassed the Alps the emperor chastised the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John XII The pope was degraded in a synod the praefect was mounted on an ass whipped through the city and cast into a dungeon thirteen of the most guilty were hanged others were mutilated or banished and this severe process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and Justinian The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a perfidious and bloody act the massacre of the senators whom he had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality and friendship one hundred thirty nine In the minority of his son Otho the Third Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon yoke and the consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic From the condition of a subject and an exile he twice rose to the command of the city oppressed expelled and created the popes and formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the Greek emperors thirteen ninety one In the fortress of saint Angelo he maintained an obstinate siege till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety his body was suspended on a gibbet and his head was exposed on the battlements of the castle By a reverse of fortune Otho after separating his troops was besieged three days without food in his palace and a disgraceful escape saved him from the justice or fury of the Romans The senator Ptolemy was the leader of the people and the widow of Crescentius enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband by a poison which she administered to her Imperial lover It was the design of Otho the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the North to erect his throne in Italy and to revive the institutions of the Roman monarchy But his successors only once in their lives appeared on the banks of the Tyber to receive their crown in the Vatican one hundred forty Their absence was contemptible their presence odious and formidable They descended from the Alps at the head of their barbarians who were strangers and enemies to the country and their transient visit was a scene of tumult and

Submission Of The Arabs His Death And Successors The Claims And Fortunes Of Ali And His Descendants After pursuing above six hundred years the fleeting Caesars of Constantinople and Germany I now descend in the reign of Heraclius on the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy While the state was exhausted by the Persian war and the church was distracted by the Nestorian and Monophysite sects Mahomet with the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other erected his throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome The genius of the Arabian prophet the manners of his nation and the spirit of his religion involve the causes of the decline and fall of the Eastern empire and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the most memorable revolutions which have impressed a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe one Footnote one As in this and the following chapter I shall display much Arabic learning I must profess my total ignorance of the Oriental tongues and my gratitude to the learned interpreters who have transfused their science into the Latin French and English languages Their collections versions and histories I shall occasionally notice In the vacant space between Persia Syria Egypt and Aethiopia the Arabian peninsula two may be conceived as a triangle of spacious but irregular dimensions From the northern point of Beles three on the Euphrates a line of fifteen hundred miles is terminated by the Straits of Bebelmandel and the land of frankincense About half this length may be allowed for the middle breadth from east to west from Bassora to Suez from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea four The sides of the triangle are gradually enlarged and the southern basis presents a front of a thousand miles to the Indian Ocean The entire surface of the peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or France but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with the epithets of the stony and the sandy Even the wilds of Tartary are decked by the hand of nature with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life But in the dreary waste of Arabia a boundless level of sand is intersected by sharp and naked mountains and the face of the desert without shade or shelter is scorched by the direct and intense rays of a tropical sun Instead of refreshing breezes the winds particularly from the south west diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapor the hillocks of sand which they alternately raise and scatter are compared to the billows of the ocean and whole caravans whole armies have been lost and buried in the whirlwind The common benefits of water are an object of desire and contest and such is the scarcity of wood that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element of fire Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers which fertilize the soil and convey its produce to the adjacent regions the torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty earth the rare and hardy plants the tamarind or the acacia that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks are nourished by the dews of the night a scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueducts the wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert and the pilgrim of Mecca five after many a dry and sultry march is disgusted by the taste of the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt Such is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia The experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial enjoyments A shady grove a green pasture a stream of fresh water are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to themselves and their cattle and which encourage their industry in the cultivation of the palmtree and the vine The high lands that border on the Indian Ocean are distinguished by their superior plenty of wood and water the air is more temperate the fruits are more delicious the animals and the human race more numerous the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the toil of the husbandman and the peculiar gifts of frankincense six and coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the world If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula this sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the happy and the splendid coloring of fancy and fiction has been suggested by contrast and countenanced by distance It was for this earthly paradise that Nature had reserved her choicest favors and her most curious workmanship the incompatible blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives the soil was impregnated with gold seven and gems and both the land and sea were taught to exhale the odors of aromatic sweets This division of the sandy the stony and the happy so familiar to the Greeks and Latins is unknown to the Arabians themselves and it is singular enough that a country whose language and inhabitants have ever been the same should scarcely retain a vestige of its ancient geography The maritime districts of Bahrein and Oman are opposite to the realm of Persia The kingdom of Yemen displays the limits or at least the situation of Arabia Felix the name of Neged is extended over the inland space and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province of Hejaz

Lieut Wellsted M Footnote eight Consult peruse and study the Specimen Hostoriae Arabum of Pocock Oxon sixteen fifty in fourto The thirty pages of text and version are extracted from the Dynasties of Gregory Abulpharagius which Pocock afterwards translated Oxon sixteen sixty three in fourto the three hundred and fifty eight notes form a classic and original work on the Arabian antiquities The measure of population is regulated by the means of subsistence and the inhabitants of this vast peninsula might be outnumbered by the subjects of a fertile and industrious province Along the shores of the Persian Gulf of the ocean and even of the Red Sea the Icthyophagi nine or fish eaters continued to wander in quest of their precarious food In this primitive and abject state which ill deserves the name of society the human brute without arts or laws almost without sense or language is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal creation Generations and ages might roll away in silent oblivion and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence to the narrow margin of the seacoast But in an early period of antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene of misery and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a people of hunters they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful condition of the pastoral life The same life is uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert and in the portrait of the modern Bedoweens we may trace the features of their ancestors ten who in the age of Moses or Mahomet dwelt under similar tents and conducted their horses and camels and sheep to the same springs and the same pastures Our toil is lessened and our wealth is increased by our dominion over the useful animals and the Arabian shepherd had acquired the absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave eleven Arabia in the opinion of the naturalist is the genuine and original country of the horse the climate most propitious not indeed to the size but to the spirit and swiftness of that generous animal The merit of the Barb the Spanish and the English breed is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood twelve the Bedoweens preserve with superstitious care the honors and the memory of the purest race the males are sold at a high price but the females are seldom alienated and the birth of a noble foal was esteemed among the tribes as a subject of joy and mutual congratulation These horses are educated in the tents among the children of the Arabs with a tender familiarity which trains them in the habits of gentleness and attachment They are accustomed only to walk and to gallop their sensations are not blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip their powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit but no sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup than they dart away with the swiftness of the wind and if their friend be dismounted in the rapid career they instantly stop till he has recovered his seat In the sands of Africa and Arabia the camel is a sacred and precious gift That strong and patient beast of burden can perform without eating or drinking a journey of several days and a reservoir of fresh water is preserved in a large bag a fifth stomach of the animal whose body is imprinted with the marks of servitude the larger breed is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds and the dromedary of a lighter and more active frame outstrips the fleetest courser in the race Alive or dead almost every part of the camel is serviceable to man her milk is plentiful and nutritious the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal thirteen a valuable salt is extracted from the urine the dung supplies the deficiency of fuel and the long hair which falls each year and is renewed is coarsely manufactured into the garments the furniture and the tents of the Bedoweens In the rainy seasons they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter they remove their encampments to the sea coast the hills of Yemen or the neighborhood of the Euphrates and have often extorted the dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile and the villages of Syria and Palestine The life of a wandering Arab is a life of danger and distress and though sometimes by rapine or exchange he may appropriate the fruits of industry a private citizen in Europe is in the possession of more solid and pleasing luxury than the proudest emir who marches in the field at the head of ten thousand horse Footnote nine Arrian remarks the Icthyophagi of the coast of Hejez Periplus Maris Erythraei p twelve and beyond Aden p fifteen It seems probable that the

hundred four Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of Scythia and the Arabian tribes since many of the latter were collected into towns and employed in the labors of trade and agriculture A part of their time and industry was still devoted to the management of their cattle they mingled in peace and war with their brethren of the desert and the Bedoweens derived from their useful intercourse some supply of their wants and some rudiments of art and knowledge Among the forty two cities of Arabia fourteen enumerated by Abulfeda the most ancient and populous were situate in the happy Yemen the towers of Saana fifteen and the marvellous reservoir of Merab sixteen were constructed by the kings of the Homerites but their profane lustre was eclipsed by the prophetic glories of Medina seventeen and Mecca eighteen near the Red Sea and at the distance from each other of two hundred and seventy miles The last of these holy places was known to the Greeks under the name of Macoraba and the termination of the word is expressive of its greatness which has not indeed in the most flourishing period exceeded the size and populousness of Marseilles Some latent motive perhaps of superstition must have impelled the founders in the choice of a most unpromising situation They erected their habitations of mud or stone in a plain about two miles long and one mile broad at the foot of three barren mountains the soil is a rock the water even of the holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish the pastures are remote from the city and grapes are transported above seventy miles from the gardens of Tayef The fame and spirit of the Koreishites who reigned in Mecca were conspicuous among the Arabian tribes but their ungrateful soil refused the labors of agriculture and their position was favorable to the enterprises of trade By the seaport of Gedda at the distance only of forty miles they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia and that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the disciples of Mahomet The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the Peninsula to Gerrha or Katif in the province of Bahrein a city built as it is said of rock salt by the Chaldaean exiles nineteen and from thence with the native pearls of the Persian Gulf they were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates Mecca is placed almost at an equal distance a month s journey between Yemen on the right and Syria on the left hand The former was the winter the latter the summer station of her caravans and their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of India from the tedious and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea In the markets of Saana and Merab in the harbors of Oman and Aden the camels of the Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics a supply of corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of Bostra and Damascus the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and riches in the streets of Mecca and the noblest of her sons united the love of arms

subdued by the Abyssinians the Persians the sultans of Egypt twenty two and the Turks twenty three the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have repeatedly bowed under a Scythian tyrant and the Roman province of Arabia twenty four embraced the peculiar wilderness in which Ismael and his sons must have pitched their tents in the face of their brethren Yet these exceptions are temporary or local the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most powerful monarchies the arms of Sesostris and Cyrus of Pompey and Trajan could never achieve the conquest of Arabia the present sovereign of the Turks twenty five may exercise a shadow of jurisdiction but his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship of a people whom it is dangerous to provoke and fruitless to attack The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed on the character and country of the Arabs Many ages before Mahomet twenty six their intrepid valor had been severely felt by their neighbors in offensive and defensive war The patient and active virtues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline of a pastoral life The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to the women of the tribe but the martial youth under the banner of the emir is ever on horseback and in the field to practise the exercise of the bow the javelin and the cimeter The long memory of their independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their descent and to maintain their inheritance Their domestic feuds are suspended on the approach of a common enemy and in their last hostilities against the Turks the caravan of Mecca was attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of the confederates When they advance to battle the hope of victory is in the front in the rear the assurance of a retreat Their horses and camels who in eight or ten days can perform a march of four or five hundred miles disappear before the conqueror the secret waters of the desert elude his search and his victorious troops are consumed with thirst hunger and fatigue in the pursuit of an invisible foe who scorns his efforts and safely reposes in the heart of the burning solitude The arms and deserts of the Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their own freedom but the barriers also of the happy Arabia whose inhabitants remote from war are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate The legions of Augustus melted away in disease and lassitude twenty seven and it is only by a naval power that the reduction of Yemen has been successfully attempted When Mahomet erected his holy standard twenty eight that kingdom was a province of the Persian empire yet seven princes of the Homerites still reigned in the mountains and the vicegerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget his distant country and his unfortunate master The historians of the age of Justinian represent the state of the independent Arabs who were divided by interest or affection in the long quarrel of the East the tribe of Gassan was allowed to encamp on the Syrian territory the princes of Hira were permitted to form a city about forty miles to the southward of the ruins of Babylon Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous but their friendship was venal their faith inconstant their enmity capricious it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these roving barbarians and in the familiar intercourse of war they learned to see and to despise the splendid weakness both of Rome and of Persia From Mecca to the Euphrates the Arabian tribes twenty nine were confounded by the Greeks and

society without forfeiting the prerogatives of nature In every tribe superstition or gratitude or fortune has exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals The dignities of sheick and emir invariably descend in this chosen race but the order of succession is loose and precarious and the most worthy or aged of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple though important office of composing disputes by their advice and guiding valor by their example Even a female of sense and spirit has been permitted to command the countrymen of Zenobia thirty one The momentary junction of several tribes produces an army their more lasting union constitutes a nation and the supreme chief the emir of emirs whose banner is displayed at their head may deserve in the eyes of strangers the honors of the kingly name If the Arabian princes abuse their power they are quickly punished by the desertion of their subjects who had been accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction Their spirit is free their steps are unconfined the desert is open and the tribes and families are held together by a mutual and voluntary compact The softer natives of Yemen supported the pomp and majesty of a monarch but if he could not leave his palace without endangering his life thirty two the active powers of government must have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates The cities of Mecca and Medina present in the heart of Asia the form or rather the substance of a commonwealth The grandfather of Mahomet and his lineal ancestors appear in foreign and domestic transactions as the princes of their country but they reigned like Pericles at Athens or the Medici at Florence by the opinion of their wisdom and integrity their influence was divided with their patrimony and the sceptre was transferred from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the tribe of Koreish On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of the people and since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded to obey the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient Arabs is the clearest evidence of public freedom thirty three But their simple freedom was of a very different cast from the nice and artificial machinery of the Greek and Roman republics in which each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and political rights of the community In the more simple state of the Arabs the nation is free because each of her sons disdains a base submission to the will of a master His breast is fortified by the austere virtues of courage patience and sobriety the love of independence prompts him to exercise the habits of self command and the fear of dishonor guards him from the meaner apprehension of pain of danger and of death The gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his outward demeanor his speech is low weighty and concise he is seldom provoked to laughter his only gesture is that of stroking his beard the venerable symbol of manhood and the sense of his own importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity and his superiors without awe thirty four The liberty of the Saracens survived their conquests the first caliphs indulged the bold and familiar language of their subjects they ascended the pulpit to persuade and edify the congregation nor was it before the seat of empire was removed to the Tigris that the Abbasides adopted the proud

sixty two This gift of speech they shared only with the Persians and the sententious Arabs would probably have disdained the simple and sublime logic of Demosthenes Footnote thirty four I must remind the reader that D Arvieux D Herbelot and Niebuhr represent in the most lively colors the manners and government of the Arabs which are illustrated by many incidental passages in the Life of Mahomet Note See likewise the curious romance of Antar the most vivid and authentic picture of Arabian manners M In the study of nations and men we may observe the causes that render them hostile or friendly to each other that tend to narrow or enlarge to mollify or exasperate the social character The separation of the Arabs from the rest of mankind has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of jurisprudence which they believe and practise to the present hour They pretend that in the division of the earth the rich and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the human family and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might recover by fraud or force the portion of inheritance of which he had been unjustly deprived According to the remark of Pliny the Arabian tribes are equally addicted to theft and merchandise the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged and their neighbors since the remote times of Job and Sesostris thirty five have been the victims of their rapacious spirit If a Bedoween discovers from afar a solitary traveller he rides furiously against him crying with a loud voice Undress thyself thy aunt my wife is without a garment A ready submission entitles him to mercy resistance will provoke the aggressor and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in legitimate defence A single robber or a few associates are branded with their genuine name but the exploits of a numerous band assume the character of lawful and honorable war The temper of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine murder and revenge In the constitution of Europe the right of peace and war is now confined to a small and the actual exercise to a much smaller list of respectable potentates but each Arab with impunity and renown might point his javelin against the life of his countrymen The union of the nation consisted only in a vague resemblance of language and manners and in each community the jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent Of the time of ignorance which preceded Mahomet seventeen hundred battles thirty six are recorded by tradition hostility was imbittered with the rancor of civil faction and the recital in prose or verse of an obsolete feud was sufficient to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the hostile tribes In private life every man at least every family was the judge and avenger of his own cause The nice sensibility of honor which weighs the insult rather than the injury sheds its deadly venom on the quarrels of the Arabs the honor of their women and of their beards is most easily wounded an indecent action a contemptuous word can be expiated only by the blood of the offender and such is their patient inveteracy that they expect whole months and years the opportunity of revenge A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians of every age but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to accept the atonement or to exercise with their own hands the law of retaliation The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the head of the murderer substitutes an innocent for the guilty person and transfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of the race by whom they have been injured If he falls by their hands they are exposed in their turn to the danger of reprisals the interest and principal of the bloody debt are accumulated the individuals of either family lead a life of malice and suspicion and fifty years may sometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled thirty seven This sanguinary spirit ignorant of pity or forgiveness has been moderated however by the maxims of honor which require in every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength of numbers and weapons An annual festival of two perhaps of four months was observed by the Arabs before the time of Mahomet during which their swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic hostility and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare

the merchant is the friend of mankind and the annual caravans imported the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the cities and even the camps of the desert Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs their language is derived from the same original stock with the Hebrew the Syriac and the Chaldaean tongues the independence of the tribes was marked by their peculiar dialects thirty nine but each after their own allowed a just preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca In Arabia as well as in Greece the perfection of language outstripped the refinement of manners and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey the two hundred of a serpent the five hundred of a lion the thousand of a sword at a time when this copious dictionary was intrusted to the memory of an illiterate people The monuments of the Homerites were inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character but the Cufic letters the groundwork of the present alphabet were invented on the banks of the Euphrates and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet The arts of grammar of metre and of rhetoric were unknown to the freeborn eloquence of the Arabians but their penetration was sharp their fancy luxuriant their wit strong and sententious forty and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to the minds of their hearers The genius and merit of a rising poet was celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes A solemn banquet was prepared and a chorus of women striking their tymbals and displaying the pomp of their nuptials sung in the presence of their sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe that a champion had now appeared to vindicate their rights that a herald had raised his voice to immortalize their renown The distant or hostile tribes resorted to an annual fair which was abolished by the fanaticism of the first Moslems a national assembly that must have contributed to refine and harmonize the Barbarians Thirty days were employed in the exchange not only of corn and wine but of eloquence and poetry The prize was disputed by the generous emulation of the bards the victorious performance was deposited in the archives of princes and emirs and we may read in our own language the seven original poems which were inscribed in letters of gold and suspended in the temple of Mecca forty one The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of the age and if they sympathized with the prejudices they inspired and crowned the virtues of their countrymen The indissoluble union of generosity and valor was the darling theme of their song and when they pointed their keenest satire against a despicable race they affirmed in the bitterness of reproach that the men knew not how to give nor the women to deny forty two The same hospitality which was practised by Abraham and celebrated by Homer is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs The ferocious Bedoweens the terror of the desert embrace without inquiry or hesitation the stranger who dares to confide in their honor and to enter their tent His treatment is kind and respectful he shares the wealth or the poverty of his host and after a needful repose he is dismissed on his way with thanks with blessings and perhaps with gifts The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a friend but the heroic acts that could deserve the public applause must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion and experience A dispute had arisen who among the citizens of Mecca was entitled to the prize of generosity and a successive application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of the trial Abdallah the son of Abbas had undertaken a distant journey and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice of a suppliant O son of the uncle of the apostle of God I am a traveller and in distress He instantly dismounted to present the pilgrim with his camel her rich caparison and a purse of four thousand pieces of gold excepting only the sword either for its intrinsic value or as the gift of an honored kinsman The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master was asleep but he immediately added Here is a purse of seven thousand pieces of gold it is all we have in the house and here is an order that will entitle you to a camel and a slave the master as soon as he awoke praised and enfranchised his faithful steward with a gentle reproof that by respecting his slumbers he had stinted his bounty The third of these heroes the blind Arabah at the hour of prayer was supporting his steps on the shoulders of two slaves Alas he replied my coffers are empty but these you may sell if you refuse I renounce them At these words pushing away the youths he groped along the wall with his staff The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue forty three he was brave and liberal an eloquent poet and a successful robber forty camels were roasted at his hospitable feast and at the prayer of a suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil The freedom of his countrymen disdained the laws of justice

Translation Fund M The religion of the Arabs forty four as well as of the Indians consisted in the worship of the sun the moon and the fixed stars a primitive and specious mode of superstition The bright luminaries of the sky display the visible image of a Deity their number and distance convey to a philosophic or even a vulgar eye the idea of boundless space the character of eternity is marked on these solid globes that seem incapable of corruption or decay the regularity of their motions may be ascribed to a principle of reason or instinct and their real or imaginary influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care The science of astronomy was cultivated at Babylon but the school of the Arabs was a clear firmament and a naked plain In their nocturnal marches they steered by the guidance of the stars their names and order and daily station were familiar to the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween and he was taught by experience to divide in twenty eight parts the zodiac of the moon and to bless the constellations who refreshed with salutary rains the thirst of the desert The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the visible sphere and some metaphysical powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of bodies a camel was left to perish on the grave that he might serve his master in another life and the invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still endowed with consciousness and power I am ignorant and I am careless of the blind mythology of the Barbarians of the local deities of the stars the air and the earth of their sex or titles their attributes or subordination Each tribe each family each independent warrior created and changed the rites and the object of his fantastic worship but the nation in every age has bowed to the religion as well as to the language of Mecca The genuine antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the Christian aera in describing the coast of the Red Sea the Greek historian Diodorus forty five has remarked between the Thamudites and the Sabaeans a famous temple whose superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians the linen or silken veil which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor was first offered by a pious king of the Homerites who reigned seven hundred years before the time of Mahomet forty six A tent or a cavern might suffice for the worship of the savages but an edifice of stone and clay has been erected in its place and the art and power of the monarchs of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the original model forty seven A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba a square chapel twenty four cubits long twenty three broad and twenty seven high a door and a window admit the light the double roof is supported by three pillars of wood a spout now of gold discharges the rain water and the well Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental pollution The tribe of Koreish by fraud and force had acquired the custody of the Caaba the sacerdotal office devolved through four lineal descents to the grandfather of Mahomet and the family of the Hashemites from whence he sprung was the most respectable and sacred in the eyes of their country forty eight The precincts of Mecca enjoyed the rights of sanctuary and in the last month of each year the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of pilgrims who presented their vows and offerings in the house of God The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful Mussulman were invented and practised by the superstition of the idolaters At an awful distance they cast away their garments seven times with hasty steps they encircled the Caaba and kissed the black stone seven times they visited and adored the adjacent mountains seven times they threw stones into the valley of Mina and the pilgrimage was achieved as at the present hour by a sacrifice of sheep and camels and the burial of their hair and nails in the consecrated ground Each tribe either found or introduced in the Caaba their domestic worship the temple was adorned or defiled with three hundred and sixty idols of men eagles lions and antelopes and most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal of red agate holding in his hand seven arrows without heads or feathers the instruments and symbols of profane divination But this statue was a monument of Syrian arts the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars in imitation of the black stone forty nine of Mecca which is deeply tainted with the reproach of an idolatrous origin From Japan to Peru the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed and the votary has expressed his gratitude or fear by destroying or consuming in honor of the gods the dearest and most precious of their gifts The life of a man fifty is the most precious oblation to deprecate a public calamity the altars of Phoenicia and Egypt of Rome and Carthage have been polluted with human gore the cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs in the third century a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the Dumatians fifty one and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the prince of the Saracens the ally and soldier of the emperor Justinian fifty two A parent who drags his son to the altar exhibits the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism the deed or the intention was sanctified by the example of saints and heroes and the father of Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash vow and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a hundred camels In the time of ignorance the Arabs like the Jews and Egyptians abstained from the taste of swine s flesh fifty three they circumcised fifty four their children at the age of puberty the same customs without the censure or the precept of the Koran have been silently transmitted to their posterity and proselytes It has been

to the happy land where they might profess what they thought and practise what they professed The religions of the Sabians and Magians of the Jews and Christians were disseminated from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea In a remote period of antiquity Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans fifty five and the arms of the Assyrians From the observations of two thousand years the priests and astronomers of Babylon fifty six deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence They adored the seven gods or angels who directed the course of the seven planets and shed their irresistible influence on the earth The attributes of the seven planets with the twelve signs of the zodiac and the twenty four constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere were represented by images and talismans the seven days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities the Sabians prayed thrice each day and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of their pilgrimage fifty seven But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to learn in the tradition of the creation the deluge and the patriarchs they held a singular agreement with their Jewish captives they appealed to the secret books of Adam Seth and Enoch and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of saint John in the territory of Bassora fifty eight The altars of Babylon were overturned by the Magians but the injuries of the Sabians were revenged by the sword of Alexander Persia groaned above five hundred years under a foreign yoke and the purest disciples of Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry and breathed with their adversaries the freedom of the desert fifty nine Seven hundred years before the death of Mahomet the Jews were settled in Arabia and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian The industrious exiles aspired to liberty and power they erected synagogues in the cities and castles in the wilderness and their Gentile converts were confounded with the children of Israel whom they resembled in the outward mark of circumcision The Christian missionaries were still more active and successful the Catholics asserted their universal reign the sects whom they oppressed successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire the Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions and apocryphal gospels the churches of Yemen and the princes of Hira and Gassan were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite and Nestorian bishops sixty The liberty of choice was presented to the tribes each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private religion and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the sublime theology of saints and philosophers A fundamental article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above the powers of heaven and earth but who has often revealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets and whose grace or justice has interrupted by seasonable miracles the order of nature The most rational of the Arabs acknowledged his power though they neglected his worship sixty one and it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to the relics of idolatry The Jews and Christians were the people of the Book the Bible was already translated into the Arabic language sixty two and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by the concord of these implacable enemies In the story of the Hebrew patriarchs the Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael revered the faith and virtue of Abraham

and genuine nobility he sprung from the tribe of Koreish and the family of Hashem the most illustrious of the Arabs the princes of Mecca and the hereditary guardians of the Caaba The grandfather of Mahomet was Abdol Motalleb the son of Hashem a wealthy and generous citizen who relieved the distress of famine with the supplies of commerce Mecca which had been fed by the liberality of the father was saved by the courage of the son The kingdom of Yemen was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia their vassal Abrahah was provoked by an insult to avenge the honor of the cross and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants and an army of Africans A treaty was proposed and in the first audience the grandfather of Mahomet demanded the restitution of his cattle And why said Abrahah do you not rather implore my clemency in favor of your temple which I have threatened to destroy Because replied the intrepid chief the cattle is my own the Caaba belongs to the gods and they will defend their house from injury and sacrilege The want of provisions or the valor of the Koreish compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful retreat their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous flight of birds who showered down stones on the heads of the infidels and the deliverance was long commemorated by the aera of the elephant sixty five The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with domestic happiness his life was prolonged to the age of one hundred and ten years and he became the father of six daughters and thirteen sons His best beloved Abdallah was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth and in the first night when he consummated his marriage with Amina six hundred fifty one of the noble race of the Zahrites two hundred virgins are said to have expired of

numerous and in the division of the inheritance the orphan s share was reduced to five camels and an Aethiopian maid servant At home and abroad in peace and war Abu Taleb the most respectable of his uncles was the guide and guardian of his youth in his twenty fifth year he entered into the service of Cadijah a rich and noble widow of Mecca who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune The marriage contract in the simple style of antiquity recites the mutual love of Mahomet and Cadijah describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty camels which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle sixty seven By this alliance the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of his ancestors and the

hundred thirty four According to the tradition of his companions Mahomet sixty nine was distinguished by the beauty of his person an outward gift which is seldom despised except by those to whom it has been refused Before he spoke the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or private audience They applauded his commanding presence his majestic aspect his piercing eye his gracious smile his flowing beard his countenance that painted every sensation of the soul and his gestures that enforced each expression of the tongue In the familiar offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of his country his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of Mecca the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of his views and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship or universal benevolence His memory was capacious and retentive his wit easy and social his imagination sublime his judgment clear rapid and decisive He possessed the courage both of thought and action and although his designs might gradually expand with his success the first idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original and superior genius The son of Abdallah was educated in the bosom of the noblest race in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence With these powers of eloquence Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian his youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and writing seventy the common ignorance exempted him from shame or reproach but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence and deprived of those faithful mirrors which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes Yet the book of nature and of man was open to his view and some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to the Arabian traveller seventy one He compares the nations and the regions of the earth discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman monarchies beholds with pity and indignation the degeneracy of the times and resolves to unite under one God and one king the invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs Our more accurate inquiry will suggest that instead of visiting the courts the camps the temples of the East the two journeys of Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and Damascus that he was only thirteen years of age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle and that his duty compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of Cadijah In these hasty and superficial excursions the eye of genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked his curiosity and I cannot perceive in the life or writings of Mahomet that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of the Arabian world From every region of that solitary world the pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled by the calls of devotion and commerce in the free concourse of multitudes a simple citizen in his native tongue might study the political state and character of the tribes the theory and practice of the Jews and Christians Some useful strangers might be tempted or forced to implore the rights of hospitality and the enemies of Mahomet have named the Jew the Persian and the Syrian monk whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition of the Koran seventy two Conversation enriches the understanding but solitude is the school of genius and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist From his earliest youth Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation each year during the month of Ramadan he withdrew from the world and from the arms of Cadijah in the cave of Hera three miles from Mecca seventy three he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm whose abode is not in the heavens but in the mind of the prophet The faith which under the name of Islam he preached to his family and nation is compounded of an eternal truth and a necessary fiction That there is only one God and that Mahomet is the apostle of God Footnote sixty nine Abulfeda in Vit c lxv lxvi

of polytheism their simple ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and worship of the true God The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue his metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power the unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the invisible essence After the ruin of the temple the faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified fixed and enlightened by the spiritual devotion of the synagogue and the authority of Mahomet will not justify his perpetual reproach that the Jews of Mecca or Medina adored Ezra as the son of God seventy four But the children of Israel had ceased to be a people and the religions of the world were guilty at least in the eyes of the prophet of giving sons or daughters or companions to the supreme God In the rude idolatry of the Arabs the crime is manifest and audacious the Sabians are poorly excused by the preeminence of the first planet or intelligence in their celestial hierarchy and in the Magian system the conflict of the two principles betrays the imperfection of the conqueror The Christians of the seventh century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and images that disgraced the temples of the East the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs and saints and angels the objects of popular veneration and the Collyridian heretics who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia invested the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a goddess seventy five The mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the principle of the divine unity In their obvious sense they introduce three equal deities and transform the man Jesus into the substance of the Son of God seventy six an orthodox commentary will satisfy only a believing mind intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn the veil of the sanctuary and each of the Oriental sects was eager to confess that all except themselves deserved the reproach of idolatry and polytheism The creed of Mahomet is free from suspicion or ambiguity and the Koran is a glorious testimony to the unity of God The prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men of stars and planets on the rational principle that whatever rises must set that whatever is born must die that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish seventy seven In the Author of the universe his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an infinite and eternal being without form or place without issue or similitude present to our most secret thoughts existing by the necessity of his own nature and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual perfection These sublime truths thus announced in the language of the prophet seventy eight are firmly held by his disciples and defined with metaphysical precision by the interpreters of the Koran A philosophic theist might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans seventy nine a creed too sublime perhaps for our present faculties What object remains for the fancy or even the understanding when we have abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and space of motion and matter of sensation and reflection The first principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the voice of Mahomet his proselytes from India to Morocco are distinguished by the name of Unitarians and the danger of idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images The doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mahometans and they struggle with the common difficulties how to reconcile the prescience of God with the freedom and responsibility of man how to explain the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite goodness Footnote seventy four Koran c nine p one

on the ear of a peasant yet how minute is the distance of their understandings if it be compared with the contact of an infinite and a finite mind with the word of God expressed by the tongue or the pen of a mortal The inspiration of the Hebrew prophets of the apostles and evangelists of Christ might not be incompatible with the exercise of their reason and memory and the diversity of their genius is strongly marked in the style and composition of the books of the Old and New Testament But Mahomet was content with a character more humble yet more sublime of a simple editor the substance of the Koran ninety one according to himself or his disciples is uncreated and eternal subsisting in the essence of the Deity and inscribed with a pen of light on the table of his everlasting decrees A paper copy in a volume of silk and gems was brought down to the lowest heaven by the angel Gabriel who under the Jewish economy had indeed been despatched on the most important errands and this trusty messenger successively revealed the chapters and verses to the Arabian prophet Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure of the divine will the fragments of the Koran were produced at the discretion of Mahomet each revelation is suited to the emergencies of his policy or passion and all contradiction is removed by the saving maxim that any text of Scripture is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage The word of God and of the apostle was diligently recorded by his disciples on palm leaves and the shoulder bones of mutton and the pages without order or connection were cast into a domestic chest in the custody of one of his wives Two years after the death of Mahomet the sacred volume was collected and published by his friend and successor Abubeker the work was revised by the caliph Othman in the thirtieth year of the Hegira and the various editions of the Koran assert the same miraculous privilege of a uniform and incorruptible text In the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit of his book audaciously challenges both men and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page and presumes to assert that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance ninety two This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture whose ear is delighted by the music of sounds and whose ignorance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius ninety three The harmony and copiousness of style will not reach in a version the European infidel he will peruse with impatience the endless incoherent rhapsody of fable and precept and declamation which seldom excites a sentiment or an idea which sometimes crawls in the dust and is sometimes lost in the clouds The divine attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary but his loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book of Job composed in a remote age in the same country and in the same language ninety four If the composition of the Koran exceed the faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should we ascribe the Iliad of Homer or the Philippics of Demosthenes In all religions the life of the founder supplies the silence of his written revelation the sayings of Mahomet were so many lessons of truth his actions so many examples of virtue and the public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and companions At the end of two hundred years the Sonna or oral law was fixed and consecrated by the labors of Al Bochari who discriminated seven thousand two hundred and seventy five genuine traditions from a mass of three hundred thousand reports of a more doubtful or spurious character Each day the pious author prayed in the temple of Mecca and performed

revelation to create a garden in the desert or to kindle a conflagration in the unbelieving city As often as he is pressed by the demands of the Koreish he involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and prophecy appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine and shields himself behind the providence of God who refuses those signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith and aggravate the guilt of infidelity But the modest or angry tone of his apologies betrays his weakness and vexation and these passages of scandal established beyond suspicion the integrity of the Koran ninety six The votaries of Mahomet are more assured than himself of his miraculous gifts and their confidence and credulity increase as they are farther removed from the time and place of his spiritual exploits They believe or affirm that trees went forth to meet him that he was saluted by stones that water gushed from his fingers that he fed the hungry cured the sick and raised the dead that a beam groaned to him that a camel complained to him that a shoulder of mutton informed him of its being poisoned and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally subject to the apostle of

with his companion Gabriel he successively ascended the seven heavens and received and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs the prophets and the angels in their respective mansions Beyond the seventh heaven Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed he passed the veil of unity approached within two bow shots of the throne and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart when his shoulder was touched by the hand of God After this familiar though important conversation he again descended to Jerusalem remounted the Borak returned to Mecca and performed in the tenth part of a night the

himself inculcates a more simple and rational piety prayer fasting and alms are the religious duties of a Mussulman and he is encouraged to hope that prayer will carry him half way to God fasting will bring him to the door of his palace and alms will gain him admittance one hundred one I According to the tradition of the nocturnal journey the apostle in his personal conference with the Deity was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of fifty prayers By the advice of Moses he applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burden the number was gradually reduced to five without any dispensation of business or pleasure or time or place the devotion of the faithful is repeated at daybreak at noon in the afternoon in the evening and at the first watch of the night and

hands the face and the body which was practised of old by the Arabs is solemnly enjoined by the Koran and a permission is formally granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water The words and attitudes of supplication as it is performed either sitting or standing or prostrate on the ground are prescribed by custom or authority but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy and each Mussulman for his own person is invested with the character of a priest Among the theists who reject the use of images it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings of the fancy by directing the eye and the thought towards a kebla or visible point of the horizon The prophet was at first inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem but he soon returned to a more natural partiality and five times every day the eyes of the nations at Astracan at Fez at Delhi are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street As a distinction from the Jews and Christians the Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public worship the people is assembled in the mosch and the imam some respectable elder ascends the pulpit to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon But the Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition ten eleven II The voluntary one hundred two penance of the ascetics the torment and glory of their lives was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh and women and sleep and firmly declared that he would suffer no monks in his religion one hundred three Yet he instituted in each year a fast of thirty days and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline which purifies the soul and subdues the body as a salutary exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle During the month of Ramadan from the rising to the setting of the sun the Mussulman abstains from eating and drinking and women and baths and perfumes from all nourishment that can restore his strength from all pleasure that can gratify his senses In the revolution of the lunar year the Ramadan coincides by turns with the winter cold and the summer heat and the patient martyr without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water must expect the close of a tedious and sultry day The interdiction of wine peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits is converted by Mahomet alone into a positive and general law one hundred four and a considerable portion of the globe has abjured at his command the use of that salutary though dangerous liquor These painful restraints are doubtless infringed by the libertine and eluded by the hypocrite but the legislator by whom they are enacted cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the indulgence of their sensual appetites III The charity of the Mahometans descends to the animal creation and the Koran repeatedly inculcates not as a merit but as a strict and indispensable duty the relief of the indigent and unfortunate Mahomet perhaps is the only lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity the standard may vary with the degree and nature of property as it consists either in money in corn or cattle in fruits or merchandise but the Mussulman does not accomplish the law unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion the tenth under the idea of restitution is enlarged to a fifth one hundred five Benevolence is the foundation of justice since we are forbid to injure those whom we are bound to assist A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and of futurity but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts Footnote one hundred one The most authentic account of these precepts pilgrimage prayer fasting alms and ablutions is extracted from the Persian and Arabian theologians by Maracci Prodrom part

portioned fifty six charity schools are founded for both sexes one hundred and twenty confraternities relieve the wants of their brethren c The benevolence of London is still more extensive but I am afraid that much more is to be ascribed to the humanity than to the religion of the people The two articles of belief and the four practical duties of Islam are guarded by rewards and punishments and the faith of the Mussulman is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful catastrophe though he darkly announces the signs both in heaven and earth which will precede the universal dissolution when life shall be destroyed and the order of creation shall be confounded in the primitive chaos At the blast of the trumpet new worlds will start into being angels genii and men will arise from the dead and the human soul will again be united to the body The doctrine of the resurrection was first entertained by the Egyptians one hundred six and their mummies were embalmed their pyramids were constructed to preserve the ancient mansion of the soul during a period of three thousand years But the attempt is partial and unavailing and it is with a more philosophic spirit that Mahomet relies on the omnipotence of the Creator whose word can reanimate the breathless clay and collect the innumerable atoms that no longer retain their form or substance one hundred seven The intermediate state of the soul it is hard to decide and those who most firmly believe her immaterial nature are at a loss to understand how

curiosity and confirmed the faith of Abraham The reunion of the soul and body will be followed by the final judgment of mankind and in his copy of the Magian picture the prophet has too faithfully represented the forms of proceeding and even the slow and successive operations of an earthly tribunal By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for extending even to themselves the hope of salvation for asserting the blackest heresy that every man who believes in God and accomplishes good works may expect in the last day a favorable sentence Such rational indifference is ill adapted to the character of a fanatic nor is it probable that a messenger from heaven should depreciate the value and necessity of his own revelation In the idiom of the Koran one hundred eight the belief of God is inseparable from that of Mahomet the good works are those which he has enjoined and the two qualifications imply the profession of Islam to which all nations and all sects are equally invited Their spiritual blindness though excused by ignorance and crowned with virtue will be scourged with everlasting torments and the tears which Mahomet shed over the tomb of his mother for whom he was forbidden to pray display a striking contrast of humanity and enthusiasm one hundred nine The doom of the infidels is common the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the degree of evidence which they have rejected by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained the eternal mansions of the Christians the Jews the Sabians the Magians and idolaters are sunk below each other in the abyss and the lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed the mask of religion After the greater part of mankind has been condemned for their opinions the true believers only will be judged by their actions The good and evil of each Mussulman will be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance and a singular mode of compensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged and if he should be destitute of any moral property the weight of his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the demerits of the sufferer According as the shares of guilt or virtue shall preponderate the sentence will be pronounced and all without distinction will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the abyss but the innocent treading in the footsteps of Mahomet will gloriously enter the gates of paradise while the guilty will fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells The term of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years but the prophet has judiciously promised that all his disciples whatever may be their sins shall be saved by their own faith and his intercession from eternal damnation It is not surprising that superstition should act most powerfully on the fears of her votaries since the human fancy can paint with more energy the misery than the bliss of a future life With the two simple elements of darkness and fire we create a sensation of pain which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of endless duration But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the continuity of pleasure and too much of our present enjoyments is obtained from the relief or the comparison of evil It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves the fountains and the rivers of paradise but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony and science conversation and friendship he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds the robes of silk palaces of marble dishes of gold rich wines artificial dainties numerous attendants and the whole train of sensual and costly luxury which becomes insipid to the owner even in the short period of this mortal life Seventy two Houris or black eyed girls of resplendent beauty blooming youth virgin purity and exquisite sensibility will be created for the use of the meanest believer a moment of pleasure will be prolonged to a thousand years and his faculties will be increased a hundred fold to render him worthy of his felicity Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice the gates of heaven will be open to both sexes but Mahomet has not specified the male companions of the female elect lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former husbands or disturb their felicity by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage This image of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation perhaps the envy of the monks they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures and allegories But the sounder and more consistent party adhere without shame to the literal interpretation of the Koran useless would be the resurrection of the body unless it were restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest faculties and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to complete the happiness of the double animal the perfect man Yet the joys of the Mahometan paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury and appetite and the prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happiness will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs who shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision one hundred ten Footnote one hundred eight The candid Reland has demonstrated that Mahomet damns all unbelievers de Religion Moham p one hundred twenty eight one hundred forty two that devils

information The first and most arduous conquests of Mahomet one hundred eleven were those of his wife his servant his pupil and his friend one hundred twelve since he presented himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant with his infirmities as a man Yet Cadijah believed the words and cherished the glory of her husband the obsequious and affectionate Zeid was tempted by the prospect of freedom the illustrious Ali the son of Abu Taleb embraced the sentiments of his cousin with the spirit of a youthful hero and the wealth the moderation the veracity of Abubeker confirmed the religion of the prophet whom he was destined to succeed By his persuasion ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca were introduced to the private lessons of Islam they yielded to the voice of reason and enthusiasm they repeated the fundamental creed There is but one God and Mahomet is the apostle of God and their faith even in this life was rewarded with riches and honors with the command of armies and the government of kingdoms Three years were silently employed in the conversion of fourteen proselytes the first fruits of his mission but in the fourth year he assumed the prophetic office and resolving to impart to his family the light of divine truth he prepared a banquet a lamb as it is said and a bowl of milk for the entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem Friends and kinsmen said Mahomet to the assembly I offer you and I alone can offer the most precious of gifts the treasures of this world and of the world to come God has commanded me to call you to his service Who among you will support my burden Who among you will be my companion and my vizier one hundred thirteen No answer was returned till the silence of astonishment and doubt and contempt was at length broken by the impatient courage of Ali a youth in the fourteenth year of his age O prophet I am the man whosoever rises against thee I will dash out his teeth tear out his eyes break his legs rip up his belly O prophet I will be thy vizier over them Mahomet accepted his offer with transport and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the superior dignity of his son In a more serious tone the father of Ali advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design Spare your remonstrances replied the intrepid fanatic to his uncle and benefactor if they should place the sun on my right hand and the moon on my left they should not divert me from my course He persevered ten years in the exercise of his mission and the religion which has overspread the East and the West advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of Mecca Yet Mahomet enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding the increase of his infant congregation of Unitarians who revered him as a prophet and to whom he seasonably dispensed the spiritual nourishment of the Koran The number of proselytes may be esteemed by the absence of eighty three men and eighteen women who retired to Aethiopia in the seventh year of his mission and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of his uncle Hamza and of the fierce and inflexible Omar who signalized in the cause of Islam the same zeal which he had exerted for its destruction Nor was the charity of Mahomet confined to the tribe of Koreish or the precincts of Mecca on solemn festivals in the days of pilgrimage he frequented the Caaba accosted the strangers of every tribe and urged both in private converse and public discourse the belief and worship of a sole Deity Conscious of his reason and of his weakness he asserted the liberty of conscience and disclaimed the use of religious violence one hundred fourteen but he called the Arabs to repentance and conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of Ad and Thamud whom the divine justice had swept away from the face of the earth one hundred fifteen Footnote one hundred eleven Before I enter on the history of the prophet it is incumbent on me to produce my evidence The Latin French and

unbelief by superstition and envy The elders of the city the uncles of the prophet affected to despise the presumption of an orphan the reformer of his country the pious orations of Mahomet in the Caaba were answered by the clamors of Abu Taleb Citizens and pilgrims listen not to the tempter hearken not to his impious novelties Stand fast in the worship of Al Lata and Al Uzzah Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the aged chief and he protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults of the Koreishites who had long been jealous of the preeminence of the family of Hashem Their malice was colored with the pretence of religion in the age of Job the crime of impiety was punished by the Arabian magistrate one hundred sixteen and Mahomet was guilty of deserting and denying the national deities But so loose was the policy of Mecca that the leaders of the Koreish instead of accusing a criminal were compelled to employ the measures of persuasion or violence They repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in the style of reproach and menace Thy nephew reviles our religion he accuses our wise forefathers of ignorance and folly silence him quickly lest he kindle tumult and discord in the city If he persevere we shall draw our swords against him and his adherents and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of thy fellow citizens The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded the violence of religious faction the most helpless or timid of the disciples retired to Aethiopia and the prophet withdrew himself to various places of strength in the town and country As he was still supported by his family the rest of the tribe of Koreish engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the children of Hashem neither to buy nor sell neither to marry not to give in marriage but to pursue them with implacable enmity till they should deliver the person of Mahomet to the justice of the gods The decree was suspended in the Caaba before the eyes of the nation the messengers of the Koreish pursued the Mussulman exiles in the heart of Africa they besieged the prophet and his most faithful followers intercepted their water and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of injuries and insults A doubtful truce restored the appearances of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the power of his enemies at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah Abu Sophian the chief of the branch of Ommiyah succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca A zealous votary of the idols a mortal foe of the line of Hashem he convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies to decide the fate of the apostle His imprisonment might provoke the despair of his enthusiasm and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces of Arabia His death was resolved and they agreed that a sword from each tribe should be buried in his heart to divide the guilt of his blood and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy and flight was the only resource of Mahomet one hundred seventeen At the dead of night accompanied by his friend Abubeker he silently escaped from his house the assassins watched at the door but they were deceived by the figure of Ali who reposed on the bed and was covered with the green vestment of the apostle The Koreish respected the piety of the heroic youth but some verses of Ali which are still extant exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety his tenderness and his religious confidence Three days Mahomet and his companion were concealed in the cave of Thor at the distance of a league from Mecca and in the close of each evening they received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of intelligence and food The diligence of the Koreish explored every haunt in the neighborhood of the city they arrived at the entrance of the cavern but the providential deceit of a spider s web and a pigeon s nest is supposed to convince them that the place was solitary and inviolate We are only two said the trembling Abubeker There is a third replied the prophet it is God himself No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two fugitives issued from the rock and mounted their camels on the road to Medina they were overtaken by the emissaries of the Koreish they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from their hands In this eventful moment the lance of an Arab might have changed the history of the world The flight of the prophet from Mecca to Medina has fixed the memorable aera of the Hegira one hundred eighteen which at the end of twelve centuries still discriminates the lunar years of the Mahometan nations one hundred nineteen

perished in its cradle had not Medina embraced with faith and reverence the holy outcasts of Mecca Medina or the city known under the name of Yathreb before it was sanctified by the throne of the prophet was divided between the tribes of the Charegites and the Awsites whose hereditary feud was rekindled by the slightest provocations two colonies of Jews who boasted a sacerdotal race were their humble allies and without converting the Arabs they introduced the taste of science and religion which distinguished Medina as the city of the Book Some of her noblest citizens in a pilgrimage to the Canaba were converted by the preaching of Mahomet on their return they diffused the belief of God and his prophet and the new alliance was ratified by their deputies in two secret and nocturnal interviews on a hill in the suburbs of Mecca In the first ten Charegites and two Awsites united in faith and love protested in the name of their wives their children and their absent brethren that they would forever profess the creed and observe the precepts of the Koran The second was a political association the first vital spark of the empire of the Saracens one hundred twenty Seventy three men and two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet his kinsman and his disciples and pledged themselves to each other by a mutual oath of fidelity They promised in the name of the city that if he should be banished they would receive him as a confederate obey him as a leader and defend him to the last extremity like their wives and children But if you are recalled by your country they asked with a flattering anxiety will you not abandon your new allies All things replied Mahomet with a smile are now common between us your blood is as my blood your ruin as my ruin We are bound to each other by the ties of honor and interest I am your friend and the enemy of your foes But if we are killed in your service what exclaimed the deputies of Medina will be our reward Paradise replied the prophet Stretch forth thy hand He stretched it forth and they reiterated the oath of allegiance and fidelity Their treaty was ratified by the people who unanimously embraced the profession of Islam they rejoiced in the exile of the apostle but they trembled for his safety and impatiently expected his arrival After a perilous and rapid journey along the sea coast he halted at Koba two miles from the city and made his public entry into Medina sixteen days after his flight from Mecca Five hundred of the citizens advanced to meet him he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty and devotion Mahomet was mounted on a she camel an umbrella shaded his head and a turban was unfurled before him to supply the deficiency of a standard His bravest disciples who had been scattered by the storm assembled round his person and the equal though various merit of the Moslems was distinguished by the names of Mohagerians and Ansars the fugitives of Mecca and the auxiliaries of Medina To eradicate the seeds of jealousy Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the rights and obligations of brethren and when Ali found himself without a peer the prophet tenderly declared that he would be the companion and brother of the noble youth The expedient was crowned with success the holy fraternity was respected in peace and war and the two parties vied with each other in a generous emulation of courage and fidelity Once only the concord was slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel a patriot of Medina arraigned the insolence of the strangers but the hint of their expulsion was heard with abhorrence and his own son most eagerly offered to lay at the apostle s feet the head of his father Footnote one hundred twenty The triple inauguration of Mahomet is described by Abulfeda p thirty thirty three forty eighty six and Gagnier tom i p three hundred forty two c three hundred forty nine c tom ii p two hundred twenty three c From his establishment at Medina Mahomet assumed the exercise of the regal and sacerdotal office and it was impious to appeal from a judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom A small portion of ground the patrimony of two orphans was acquired by gift or purchase one hundred twenty one on that chosen spot he built a house and a mosch more venerable in their rude simplicity than the palaces and temples of the Assyrian caliphs His seal of gold or silver was inscribed with the apostolic title when he prayed and preached in the weekly assembly he leaned against the trunk of a palm tree and it was long before he indulged himself in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber one hundred twenty two After a reign of six years fifteen hundred Moslems in arms and in the field renewed their oath of allegiance and their chief repeated the assurance of protection till the death of the last member or the final dissolution of the party It was in the same camp that the deputy of Mecca was astonished by the attention of the faithful to the words and looks of the prophet by the eagerness with which they collected his spittle a hair that dropped on the ground the refuse water of his lustrations as if they participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue I have seen said he the Chosroes of Persia and the Caesar of Rome but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mahomet among his companions The devout fervor of enthusiasm acts with more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of courts Footnote one hundred twenty one Prideaux Life of Mahomet p forty four reviles the

honest Gagnier ad Abulfed p fifty three has shown that they were deceived by the word Al Nagjar which signifies in this place not an obscure trade but a noble tribe of Arabs The desolate state of the ground is described by Abulfeda and his worthy interpreter has proved from Al Bochari the offer of a price from Al Jannabi the fair purchase and from Ahmeq Ben Joseph the payment of the money by the generous Abubeker On these grounds the prophet must be honorably acquitted Footnote one hundred twenty two Al Jannabi apud Gagnier tom ii p two hundred forty six three hundred twenty four describes the seal and pulpit as two venerable relics of the apostle of God and the portrait of his court is taken from Abulfeda c forty four p eighty five In the state of nature every man has a right to defend by force of arms his person and his possessions to repel or even to prevent the violence of his enemies and to extend his hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and retaliation In the free society of the Arabs the duties of subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint and Mahomet in the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission had been despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen The choice of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca to the rank of a sovereign and he was invested with the just prerogative of forming alliances and of waging offensive or defensive war The imperfection of human rights was supplied and armed by the plenitude of divine power the prophet of Medina assumed in his new revelations a fiercer and more sanguinary tone which proves that his former moderation was the effect of weakness one hundred twenty three the means of persuasion had been tried the season of forbearance was elapsed and he was now commanded to propagate his religion by the sword to destroy the monuments of idolatry and without regarding the sanctity of days or months to pursue the unbelieving nations of the earth The same bloody precepts so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran are ascribed by the author to the Pentateuch and the Gospel But the mild tenor of the evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text that Jesus did not bring peace on the earth but a sword his patient and humble virtues should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of princes and bishops who have disgraced the name of his disciples In the prosecution of religious war Mahomet might appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses of the Judges and the kings of Israel The military laws of the Hebrews are still more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator one hundred twenty four The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews if a city resisted their summons the males without distinction were put to the sword the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to destruction and neither repentance nor conversion could shield them from the inevitable doom that no creature within their precincts should be left alive twelve forty one The fair option of friendship or submission or battle was proposed to the enemies of Mahomet If they professed the creed of Islam they were admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his primitive disciples and marched under the same banner to extend the religion which they had embraced The clemency of the prophet was decided by his interest yet he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy and he seems to promise that on the payment of a tribute the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be indulged in their worship or at least in their imperfect faith In the first months of his reign he practised the lessons of holy warfare and displayed his white banner before the gates of Medina the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or sieges one hundred twenty five and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten years by himself or his lieutenants The Arab continued to unite the professions of a merchant and a robber and his petty excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly prepared his troops for the conquest of Arabia The distribution of the spoil was regulated by a divine law one hundred twenty six the whole was faithfully collected in one common mass a fifth of the gold and silver the prisoners and cattle the movables and immovables was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had obtained the victory or guarded the camp the rewards of the slain devolved to their widows and orphans and the increase of cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse and to the man From all sides the roving Arabs were allured to the standard of religion and plunder the apostle sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their wives or concubines and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant martyrs of the faith The sword says Mahomet is the key of heaven and of hell a drop of blood shed in the cause of God a night spent in arms is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer whosoever falls in battle his sins are forgiven at the day of judgment his

Prelim Discourse p one hundred three represent the opinions of the doctors and our modern travellers the confidence the fading confidence of the Turks Perhaps the Koreish would have been content with the dight of Mahomet had they not been provoked and alarmed by the vengeance of an enemy who could intercept their Syrian trade as it passed and repassed through the territory of Medina Abu Sophian himself with only thirty or forty followers conducted a wealthy caravan of a thousand camels the fortune or dexterity of his march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet but the chief of the Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush to await his return He despatched a messenger to his brethren of Mecca and they were roused by the fear of losing their merchandise and their provisions unless they hastened to his relief with the military force of the city The sacred band of Mahomet was formed of three hundred and thirteen Moslems of whom seventy seven were fugitives and the rest auxiliaries they mounted by turns a train of seventy camels the camels of Yathreb were formidable in war but such was the poverty of his first disciples that only two could appear on horseback in the field one hundred twenty eight In the fertile and famous vale of Beder one hundred twenty nine three stations from Medina he was informed by his scouts of the caravan that approached on one side of the Koreish one hundred horse eight hundred and fifty foot who advanced on the other After a short debate he sacrificed the prospect of wealth to the pursuit of glory and revenge and a slight intrenchment was formed to cover his troops and a stream of fresh water that glided through the valley O God he exclaimed as the numbers of the Koreish descended from the hills O God if these are destroyed by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth Courage my children close your ranks discharge your arrows and the day is your own At these words he placed himself with Abubeker on a throne or pulpit one hundred thirty and instantly demanded the succor of Gabriel and three thousand angels His eye was fixed on the field of battle the Mussulmans fainted and were pressed in that decisive moment the prophet started from his throne mounted his horse and cast a handful of sand into the air Let their faces be covered with confusion Both armies heard the thunder of his voice their fancy beheld the angelic warriors one hundred thirty one the Koreish trembled and fled seventy of the bravest were slain and seventy captives adorned the first victory of the faithful The dead bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted two of the most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death and the ransom of the others four thousand drams of silver compensated in some degree the escape of the caravan But it was in vain that the camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and along the Euphrates they were overtaken by the diligence of the Mussulmans and wealthy must have been the prize if twenty thousand drams could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle The resentment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men seven hundred of whom were armed with cuirasses and two hundred were mounted on horseback three thousand camels attended his march and his wife Henda with fifteen matrons of Mecca incessantly sounded their timbrels to animate the troops and to magnify the greatness of Hobal the most popular deity of the Caaba The standard of God and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers the disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field of Beder and their presumption of victory prevailed against the divine and human sense of the apostle The second battle was fought on Mount Ohud six miles to the north of Medina one hundred thirty two the Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent and the right wing of cavalry was led by Caled the fiercest and most successful of the Arabian warriors The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on the declivity of the hill and their rear was guarded by a detachment of fifty archers The weight of their charge impelled and broke the centre of the idolaters but in the pursuit they lost the advantage of their ground the archers deserted their station the Mussulmans were tempted by the spoil disobeyed their general and disordered their ranks The intrepid Caled wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear exclaimed with a loud voice that Mahomet was slain He was indeed wounded in the face with a javelin two of his teeth were shattered with a stone yet in the midst of tumult and dismay he reproached the infidels with the murder of a prophet and blessed the friendly hand that stanched his blood and conveyed him to a place of safety Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people they fell said the apostle in pairs each brother embracing his lifeless companion one hundred thirty three their bodies were mangled by the inhuman females of Mecca and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails of Hamza the uncle of Mahomet They might applaud their superstition and satiate their fury but the Mussulmans soon rallied in the field and the Koreish wanted strength or courage to undertake the siege of Medina It was attacked the ensuing year by an army of ten thousand enemies and this third expedition is variously named from the nations which marched under the banner of Abu Sophian from the ditch which was drawn before the city and a camp of three thousand Mussulmans The prudence of Mahomet declined a general engagement the valor of Ali was signalized in single combat and the war was protracted twenty days till the final separation of the confederates A tempest of wind rain and hail overturned their tents their private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary and the Koreish deserted by their allies no longer hoped to subvert the throne or to check the conquests of their invincible exile one

discovers the early propensity of Mahomet in favor of the Jews and happy would it have been for their temporal interest had they recognized in the Arabian prophet the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah Their obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable hatred with which he pursued that unfortunate people to the last moment of his life and in the double character of an apostle and a conqueror his persecution was extended to both worlds one hundred thirty five The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the protection of the city he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult and summoned them to embrace his religion or contend with him in battle Alas replied the trembling Jews we are ignorant of the use of arms but we persevere in the faith and worship of our fathers why wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just defence The unequal conflict was terminated in fifteen days and it was with extreme reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the importunity of his allies and consented to spare the lives of the captives But their riches were confiscated their arms became more effectual in the hands of the Mussulmans and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven with their wives and children to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria The Nadhirites were more guilty since they conspired in a friendly interview to assassinate the prophet He besieged their castle three miles from Medina but their resolute defence obtained an honorable capitulation and the garrison sounding their trumpets and beating their drums was permitted to depart with the honors of war The Jews had excited and joined the war of the Koreish no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch than Mahomet without laying aside his armor marched on the same day to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Koraidha After a resistance of twenty five days they surrendered at discretion They trusted to the intercession of their old allies of Medina they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity A venerable elder to whose judgment they appealed pronounced the sentence of their death seven hundred Jews were dragged in chains to the market place of the city they descended alive into the grave prepared for their execution and burial and the apostle beheld with an inflexible eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies Their sheep and camels were inherited by the Mussulmans three hundred cuirasses five hundred piles a thousand lances composed the most useful portion of the spoil Six days journey to the north east of Medina the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of the Jewish power in Arabia the territory a fertile spot in the desert was covered with plantations and cattle and protected by eight castles some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength The forces of Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse and fourteen hundred foot in the succession of eight regular and painful sieges they were exposed to danger and fatigue and hunger and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God perhaps we may believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to the chest by his irresistible cimeter but we cannot praise the modesty of romance which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand one hundred thirty six After the reduction of the castles the town of Chaibar submitted to the yoke The chief of the tribe was tortured in the presence of Mahomet to force a confession of his hidden treasure the industry of the shepherds and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration they were permitted so long as it should please the conqueror to improve their patrimony in equal shares for his emolument and their own Under the reign of Omar the Jews of Chaibar were transported to Syria and the caliph alleged the

three hundred twenty four believes that the Jewish religion and Karaite sect are still professed by the tribe of Chaibar and that in the plunder of the caravans the disciples of Moses are the confederates of those of Mahomet Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards Mecca one hundred thirty eight and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives to revisit as a conqueror the city and the temple from whence he had been driven as an exile The Caaba was present to his waking and sleeping fancy an idle dream was translated into vision and prophecy he unfurled the holy banner and a rash promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips of the apostle His march from Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage seventy camels chosen and bedecked for sacrifice preceded the van the sacred territory was respected and the captives were dismissed without ransom to proclaim his clemency and devotion But no sooner did Mahomet descend into the plain within a day s journey of the city than he exclaimed They have clothed themselves with the skins of tigers the numbers and resolution of the Koreish opposed his progress and the roving Arabs of the desert might desert or betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician he waived in the treaty his title of apostle of God concluded with the Koreish and their allies a truce of ten years engaged to restore the fugitives of Mecca who should embrace his religion and stipulated only for the ensuing year the humble privilege of entering the city as a friend and of remaining three days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage A cloud of shame and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans and their disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who had so often appealed to the evidence of success The faith and hope of the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca their swords were sheathed thirteen eighty one seven times in the footsteps of the apostle they encompassed the Caaba the Koreish had retired to the hills and Mahomet after the customary sacrifice evacuated the city on the fourth day The people was edified by his devotion the hostile chiefs were awed or divided or seduced and both Kaled and Amrou the future conquerors of Syria and Egypt most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of idolatry The power of Mahomet was increased by the submission of the Arabian tribes ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the conquest of Mecca and the idolaters the weaker party were easily convicted of violating the truce Enthusiasm and discipline impelled the march and preserved the secret till the blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished Koreish the design the approach and the irresistible force of the enemy The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in review observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty kingdom and confessed under the cimeter of Omar that he was the apostle of the true God The return of Marius and Scylla was stained with the blood of the Romans the revenge of Mahomet was stimulated by religious zeal and his injured followers were eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre Instead of indulging their passions and his own one hundred thirty nine the victorious exile forgave the guilt and united the factions of Mecca His troops in three divisions marched into the city eight and twenty of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled eleven men and six women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet but he blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant and several of the most obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency or contempt The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his feet What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged We confide in the generosity of our kinsman And you shall not confide in vain begone you are safe you are free The people of Mecca deserved their pardon by the profession of Islam and after an exile of seven years the fugitive missionary was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his native country one hundred forty But the three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba were ignominiously broken the house of God was purified and adorned as an example to future times the apostle again fulfilled the duties of a pilgrim and a perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever should dare to set his foot on the territory of the holy city one hundred

the eloquence or the arms of the prophet Indifference for rites and opinions still marks the character of the Bedoweens and they might accept as loosely as they hold the doctrine of the Koran Yet an obstinate remnant still adhered to the religion and liberty of their ancestors and the war of Honain derived a proper appellation from the idols whom Mahomet had vowed to destroy and whom the confederates of Tayef had sworn to defend one hundred forty three Four thousand Pagans advanced with secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror they pitied and despised the supine negligence of the Koreish but they depended on the wishes and perhaps the aid of a people who had so lately renounced their gods and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy The banners of Medina and Mecca were displayed by the prophet a crowd of Bedoweens increased the strength or numbers of the army and twelve thousand Mussulmans entertained a rash and sinful presumption of their invincible strength They descended without precaution into the valley of Honain the heights had been occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates their numbers were oppressed their discipline was confounded their courage was appalled and the Koreish smiled at their impending destruction The prophet on his white mule was encompassed by the enemies he attempted to rush against their spears in search of a glorious death ten of his faithful companions interposed their weapons and their breasts three of these fell dead at his feet O my brethren he repeatedly cried with sorrow and indignation I am the son of Abdallah I am the apostle of truth O man stand fast in the faith O God send down thy succor His uncle Abbas who like the heroes of Homer excelled in the loudness of his voice made the valley resound with the recital of the gifts and promises of God the flying Moslems returned from all sides to the holy standard and Mahomet observed with pleasure that the furnace was again rekindled his conduct and example restored the battle and he animated his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors of their shame From the field of Honain he marched without delay to the siege of Tayef sixty miles to the south east of Mecca a fortress of strength whose fertile lands produce the fruits of Syria in the midst of the Arabian desert A friendly tribe instructed I know not how in the art of sieges supplied him with a train of battering rams and military engines with a body of five hundred artificers But it was in vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef that he violated his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit trees that the ground was opened by the miners that the breach was assaulted by the troops After a siege of twenty days the prophet sounded a retreat but he retreated with a song of devout triumph and affected to pray for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving city The spoils of this fortunate expedition amounted to six thousand captives twenty four thousand camels forty thousand sheep and four thousand ounces of silver a tribe who had fought at Hoinan redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice of their idols but Mahomet compensated the loss by resigning to the soldiers his fifth of the plunder and wished for their sake that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in the province of Tehama Instead of chastising the disaffection of the Koreish he endeavored to cut out their tongues his own expression and to secure their attachment by a superior measure of liberality Abu Sophian alone was presented with three

the land of Syria detached and dropped in the general deluge The fugitives and auxiliaries complained that they who had borne the burden were neglected in the season of victory Alas replied their artful leader suffer me to conciliate these recent enemies these doubtful proselytes by the gift of some perishable goods To your guard I intrust my life and fortunes You are the companions of my exile of my kingdom of my paradise He was followed by the deputies of Tayef who dreaded the repetition of a siege Grant us O apostle of God a truce of three years with the toleration of our ancient worship Not a month not an hour Excuse us at least from the obligation of prayer Without prayer religion is of no avail They submitted in silence their temples were demolished and the same sentence of destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia His lieutenants on the shores of the Red Sea the Ocean and the Gulf of Persia were saluted by the acclamations of a faithful people and the ambassadors who knelt before the throne of Medina were as numerous says the Arabian proverb as the dates that fall from the maturity of a palm tree The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished the spontaneous or reluctant oblations of arms and tithes were applied to the service of religion and one hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems

the prince of Medina who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain and a secure retreat in the province of Syria one hundred forty five But the friendship of Heraclius and Mahomet was of short continuance the new religion had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Saracens and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence for invading with three thousand soldiers the territory of Palestine that extends to the eastward of the Jordan The holy banner was intrusted to Zeid and such was the discipline or enthusiasm of the rising sect that the noblest chiefs served without reluctance under the slave of the prophet On the event of his decease Jaafar and Abdallah were successively substituted to the command and if the three should perish in the war the troops were authorized to elect their general The three leaders were slain in the battle of Muta one hundred forty six the first military action which tried the valor of the Moslems against a foreign enemy Zeid fell like a soldier in the foremost ranks the death of Jaafar was heroic and memorable he lost his right hand he shifted the standard to his left the left was severed from his body he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps till he was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable wounds fourteen sixty one Advance cried Abdallah who stepped into the vacant place advance with confidence either victory or paradise is our own The lance of a Roman decided the alternative but the falling standard was rescued by Caled the proselyte of Mecca nine swords were broken in his hand and his valor withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians In the nocturnal council of the camp he was chosen to command his skilful evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the victory or the retreat of the Saracens and Caled is renowned among his brethren and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of God In the pulpit Mahomet described with prophetic rapture the crowns of the blessed martyrs but in private he betrayed the feelings of human nature he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid What do I see said the astonished votary You see replied the apostle a friend who is deploring the loss of his most faithful friend After the conquest of Mecca the sovereign of Arabia affected to prevent the hostile preparations of Heraclius and solemnly proclaimed war against the Romans without attempting to disguise the hardships and dangers of the enterprise one hundred forty seven The Moslems were discouraged they alleged the want of money or horses or provisions the season of harvest and the intolerable heat of the summer Hell is much hotter said the indignant prophet He disdained to compel their service but on his return he admonished the most guilty by an excommunication of fifty days Their desertion enhanced the merit of Abubeker Othman and the faithful companions who devoted their lives and fortunes and Mahomet displayed his banner at the head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot Painful indeed was the distress of the march lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and pestilential winds of the desert ten men rode by turns on one camel and they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water from the belly of that useful animal In the mid way ten days journey from Medina and Damascus they reposed near the grove and fountain of Tabuc Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war he declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions he was more probably daunted by the martial array of the emperor of the East But the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror of his name and the prophet received the submission of the tribes and cities from the Euphrates to Ailah at the head of the Red Sea To his Christian subjects Mahomet readily granted the security of their persons the freedom of their trade the property of their goods and the toleration of their worship one hundred forty eight The weakness of their Arabian brethren had restrained them from opposing his ambition the disciples of Jesus were endeared to the enemy of the Jews and it was

the health of the prophet declined his infirmities increased but his mortal disease was a fever of fourteen days which deprived him by intervals of the use of reason As soon as he was conscious of his danger he edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or penitence If there be any man said the apostle from the pulpit whom I have unjustly scourged I submit my own back to the lash of retaliation Have I aspersed the reputation of a Mussulman let him proclaim my thoughts in the face of the congregation Has any one been despoiled of his goods the little that I possess shall compensate the principal and the interest of the debt Yes replied a voice from the crowd I am entitled to three drams of silver Mahomet heard the complaint satisfied the demand and thanked his creditor for accusing him in this world rather than at the day of judgment He beheld with temperate firmness the approach of death enfranchised his slaves seventeen men as they are named and eleven women minutely directed the order of his funeral and moderated the lamentations of his weeping friends on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace Till the third day before his death he regularly performed the function of public prayer the choice of Abubeker to supply his place appeared to mark that ancient and faithful friend as his successor in the sacerdotal and regal office but he prudently declined the risk and envy of a more explicit nomination At a moment when his faculties were visibly impaired he called for pen and ink to write or more properly to dictate a divine book the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations a dispute arose in the chamber whether he should be allowed to supersede the authority of the Koran and the prophet was forced to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples If the slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives and companions he maintained in the bosom of his family and to the last moments of his life the dignity fifteen oh one of an apostle and the faith of an enthusiast described the visits of Gabriel who bade an everlasting farewell to the earth and expressed his lively confidence not only of the mercy but of the favor of the Supreme Being In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his special prerogative that the angel of death was not allowed to take his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of the prophet The request was granted and Mahomet immediately fell into the agony of his dissolution his head was reclined on the lap of Ayesha the best beloved of all his wives he fainted with the violence of pain recovering his spirits he raised his eyes towards the roof of the house and with a steady look though a faltering voice uttered the last broken though articulate words O God pardon my sins Yes I come among my fellow citizens on high and thus peaceably expired on a carpet spread upon the floor An expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by this mournful event the army halted at the gates of Medina the chiefs were assembled round their dying master The city more especially the house of the prophet was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent despair fanaticism

want of fortitude such marks of childish impatience as are in general to be found in men only of the most ordinary stamp and such as extorted from his wife Ayesha in particular the sarcastic remark

they dwelt at Medina and survived the prophet many years they might repeat the pious tale to a second or third generation of pilgrims At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet it may perhaps be expected that I should balance his faults and virtues that I should decide whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to that extraordinary man Had I been intimately conversant with the son of Abdallah the task would still be difficult and the success uncertain at the distance of twelve centuries I darkly contemplate his shade through a cloud of religious incense and could I truly delineate the portrait of an hour the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply to the solitary of Mount Hera to the preacher of Mecca and to the conqueror of Arabia The author of a mighty revolution appears to have been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition so soon as marriage had raised him above the pressure of want he avoided the paths of ambition and avarice and till the age of forty he lived with innocence and would have died without a name The unity of God is an idea most congenial to nature and reason and a slight conversation with the Jews and Christians would teach him to despise and detest the idolatry of Mecca It was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the doctrine of salvation to rescue his country from the dominion of sin and error The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object would convert a general obligation into a particular call the warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as the inspirations of Heaven the labor of thought would expire in rapture and vision and the inward sensation the invisible monitor would be described with the form and attributes of an angel of God one hundred fifty four From enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery the daemon of Socrates one hundred fifty five affords a memorable instance how a wise man may deceive himself how a good man may deceive others how the conscience may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self illusion and voluntary fraud Charity may believe that the original motives of Mahomet were those of pure and genuine benevolence but a human missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his claims despise his arguments and persecute his life he might forgive his personal adversaries he may lawfully hate the enemies of God the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the bosom of Mahomet and he sighed like the prophet of Nineveh for the destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina transformed the citizen into a prince the humble preacher into the leader of armies but his sword was consecrated by the example of the saints and the same God who afflicts a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes might inspire for their conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants In the exercise of political government he was compelled to abate of the stern rigor of fanaticism to comply in some measure with the prejudices and passions of his followers and to employ even the vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation The use of fraud and perfidy of cruelty and injustice were often subservient to the propagation of the faith and Mahomet commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle By the repetition of such acts the character of Mahomet must have been gradually stained and the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries and friends Of his last years ambition was the ruling passion and a politician will suspect that he secretly smiled the victorious impostor at the enthusiasm of his youth and the credulity of his proselytes one hundred fifty six A philosopher will observe that their credulity and his success would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission that his interest and religion were inseparably connected and that his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral laws If he retained any vestige of his native innocence the sins of Mahomet may be allowed as an evidence of his sincerity In the support of truth the arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal and he would have started at the foulness of the means had he not been satisfied of the importance and justice of the end Even in a conqueror or a priest I can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity and the decree of Mahomet that in the sale of captives the mothers should never be separated from their children may suspend or moderate the censure of the historian one hundred fifty seven Footnote one hundred fifty four The Christians rashly enough have assigned to Mahomet a tame pigeon that seemed to descend from heaven and whisper in his ear As this pretended miracle is urged by Grotius de Veritate Religionis Christianae his Arabic translator the learned Pocock inquired of him the names of his authors and Grotius confessed that it is unknown to the Mahometans themselves Lest it should provoke their indignation and laughter the pious lie is

impartial pen this humane law of the prophet and the murders of Caab and Sophian which he prompted and approved Vie de Mahomet tom ii p sixty nine ninety seven two hundred eight Chapter L Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants Part VII The good sense of Mahomet one hundred fifty eight despised the pomp of royalty the apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family he kindled the fire swept the floor milked the ewes and mended with his own hands his shoes and his woollen garment Disdaining the penance and merit of a hermit he observed without effort or vanity the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier On solemn occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable plenty but in his domestic life many weeks would elapse without a tire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley bread he delighted in the taste of milk and honey but his ordinary food consisted of dates and water Perfumes and women were the two sensual enjoyments which his nature required and his religion did not forbid and Mahomet affirmed that the fervor of his devotion was increased by these innocent pleasures The heat of the climate inflames the blood of the Arabs and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the writers of antiquity one hundred fifty nine Their incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the Koran their incestuous alliances were blamed the boundless license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or concubines their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably determined the freedom of divorce was discouraged adultery was condemned as a capital offence and fornication in either sex was punished with a hundred stripes one hundred sixty Such were the calm and rational precepts of the legislator but in his private conduct Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man and abused the claims of a prophet A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation the female sex without reserve was abandoned to his desires and this singular prerogative excited the envy rather than the scandal the veneration rather than the envy of the devout Mussulmans If we remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the wise Solomon we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian who espoused no more than seventeen or fifteen wives eleven are enumerated who occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of the apostle and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal society What is singular enough they were all widows excepting only Ayesha the daughter of Abubeker She was doubtless a virgin since Mahomet consummated his nuptials such is the premature ripeness of the climate when she was only nine years of age The youth the beauty the spirit of Ayesha gave her a superior ascendant she was beloved and trusted by the prophet and after his death the daughter of Abubeker was long revered as the mother of the faithful Her behavior had been ambiguous and indiscreet in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a man The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence he chastised her accusers and published a law of domestic peace that no woman should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery one hundred sixty one In his adventures with Zeineb the wife of Zeid and with Mary an Egyptian captive the amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation At the house of Zeid his freedman and adopted son he beheld in a loose undress the beauty of Zeineb and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire The servile or grateful freedman understood the hint and yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and scandal the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the deed to annul the adoption and gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his God One of his wives Hafna the daughter of Omar surprised him on her own bed in the embraces of his Egyptian captive she promised secrecy and forgiveness he swore that he would renounce the possession of Mary Both parties forgot their engagements and Gabriel again descended with a chapter of the Koran to absolve him from his oath and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and concubines without listening to the clamors of his wives In a solitary retreat of thirty days he labored alone with Mary to fulfil the commands of the angel When his love and revenge were satiated he summoned to his presence his eleven wives reproached their disobedience and indiscretion and threatened them with a sentence of divorce both in this world and in the next a dreadful sentence since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a second marriage Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preternatural gifts one hundred sixty two he united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of Adam and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labor one hundred sixty three of the Grecian Hercules one hundred sixty four A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah During the twenty four years of their marriage her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted by the society of a rival After her death he placed her in the rank of the four perfect women with the sister of Moses the mother of Jesus and Fatima the best beloved of his daughters Was she not old said Ayesha with the insolence of a blooming beauty has not God given you a better in her place No by God said Mahomet with an effusion of honest gratitude there never can be a better She believed in me when men despised me she relieved my wants when I was poor and persecuted by the world one hundred sixty five Footnote one hundred fifty eight For the domestic life of

died in their infancy Mary his Egyptian concubine was endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim At the end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his grave but he sustained with firmness the raillery of his enemies and checked the adulation or credulity of the Moslems by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by the death of the infant Cadijah had likewise given him four daughters who were married to the most faithful of his disciples the three eldest died before their father but Fatima who possessed his confidence and love became the wife of her cousin Ali and the

source Sir John Chardin has too faithfully copied the fables and errors of the modern Persians Voyages tom ii p two hundred thirty five two hundred fifty c The birth the alliance the character of Ali which exalted him above the rest of his countrymen might justify his claim to the vacant throne of Arabia The son of Abu Taleb was in his own right the chief of the family of Hashem and the hereditary prince or guardian of the city and temple of Mecca The light of prophecy was extinct but the husband of Fatima might expect the inheritance and blessing of her father the Arabs had sometimes been patient of a female reign and the two grandsons of the prophet had often been fondled in his lap and shown in his pulpit as the hope of his age and the chief of the youth of paradise The first of the true believers might aspire to march before them in this world and in the next and if some were of a graver and more rigid cast the zeal and virtue of Ali were never outstripped by any recent proselyte He united the qualifications of a poet a soldier and a saint his wisdom still breathes in a collection of moral and religious sayings one hundred sixty seven and every antagonist in the combats of the tongue or of the sword was subdued by his eloquence and valor From the first hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral the apostle was never forsaken by a generous friend whom he delighted to name his brother his vicegerent and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses The son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for neglecting to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his right which would have silenced all competition and sealed his succession by the decrees of Heaven But the unsuspecting hero confided in himself the jealousy of empire and perhaps the fear of opposition might suspend the resolutions of Mahomet and the bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha the daughter of Abubeker and the enemy of Ali sixteen seventy one Footnote one hundred sixty seven Ockley at the end of his second volume has given an English version of one hundred sixty nine sentences which he ascribes with some hesitation to Ali the son of Abu Taleb His preface is colored by the enthusiasm of a translator yet these sentences delineate a characteristic though dark picture of human life Footnote sixteen seventy one Gibbon wrote chiefly from the Arabic or Sunnite account of these transactions the only sources accessible at the time when he composed his History Major Price writing from Persian authorities affords us the advantage of comparing throughout what may be fairly considered the Shiite Version The glory of Ali is the constant burden of their strain He was destined and according to some accounts designated for the caliphate by the prophet but while the others were fiercely pushing their own interests Ali was watching the remains of Mahomet with pious fidelity His disinterested magnanimity on each separate occasion declined the sceptre and gave the noble example of obedience to the appointed caliph He is described in retirement on the throne and in the field of battle as transcendently pious magnanimous valiant and humane He lost his empire through his excess of virtue and love for the faithful his life through his confidence in God and submission to the decrees of fate Compare the curious account of this apathy in Price chapter ii It is to be regretted I must add that Major Price has contented himself with quoting the names of the Persian works which he follows without any account of their character age and authority M The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the people and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the choice of his successor The hereditary claim and lofty spirit of Ali were offensive to an aristocracy of elders desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election the Koreish could never be reconciled to the proud preeminence of the line of Hashem the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled the fugitives of Mecca and the auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits and the rash proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have crushed in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens The tumult was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar who suddenly renouncing his own pretensions stretched forth his hand and declared himself the first subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker sixteen seventy two The urgency of the moment and the acquiescence of the people might excuse this illegal and precipitate measure but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit that if any Mulsulman should hereafter presume to anticipate the suffrage of his brethren both the elector and the elected would be worthy of death one hundred sixty eight After the simple inauguration of Abubeker he was obeyed in Medina Mecca and the provinces of Arabia the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity and their chief in his own house maintained above six months a sullen and independent reserve without listening to the threats of Omar who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle The death of Fatima and the decline of his party subdued the indignant spirit of Ali he condescended to salute the commander of the faithful accepted his excuse of the necessity of preventing their common enemies and wisely rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the Arabians After a reign of two years the aged caliph was summoned by the angel of death In his testament with the tacit approbation of his companions he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid virtue of Omar I have no occasion said the modest candidate for the place But the place has occasion for you replied Abubeker who expired with a fervent prayer that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice and direct the Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience The prayer was not ineffectual since Ali himself in a life of privacy and prayer professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his rival who comforted him for the loss of empire by the most flattering marks of confidence and esteem In the twelfth year of his reign Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his son and of Ali refused to load his conscience with the sins of his successor and devolved on six of the most respectable companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the faithful On this occasion Ali was again blamed by his friends one hundred sixty nine for submitting his right to the judgment of men for recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six electors He might have obtained their suffrage had he deigned to promise a strict and servile conformity not only to the Koran and tradition but likewise to the determinations of two seniors one hundred seventy With these limitations Othman the secretary of Mahomet accepted the government nor was it till after the third caliph twenty four years after the death of the prophet that Ali was invested by the popular choice with the regal and sacerdotal office The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive simplicity and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity of this world At the hour of prayer he repaired to the mosch of Medina clothed in a thin cotton gown a coarse turban on his head his slippers in one hand and his bow in the other instead of a walking staff The companions of the prophet and the chiefs of the tribes

hundred seventy one may signify not two actual counsellors but his two predecessors Abubeker and Omar The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually confined to the times and countries in which they have been agitated But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of Ali has been renewed in every age of the Hegira and is still maintained in the immortal hatred of the Persians and Turks one hundred seventy one The former who are branded with the appellation of Shiites or sectaries have enriched the Mahometan creed with a new article of faith and if Mahomet be the apostle his companion Ali is the vicar of God In their private converse in their public worship they bitterly execrate the three usurpers who intercepted his indefeasible right to the dignity of Imam and Caliph and the name of Omar expresses in their tongue the perfect accomplishment of wickedness and impiety one hundred seventy two The Sonnites who are supported by the general consent and orthodox tradition of the Mussulmans entertain a more impartial or at least a more decent opinion They respect the memory of Abubeker Omar Othman and Ali the holy and legitimate successors of the prophet But they assign the last and most humble place to the husband of Fatima in the persuasion that the order of succession was determined by the decrees of sanctity one hundred seventy three An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand unshaken by superstition will calmly pronounce that their manners were alike pure and exemplary that their zeal was fervent and probably sincere and that in the midst of riches and power their lives were devoted to the practice of moral and religious duties But the public virtues of Abubeker and Omar the prudence of the first the severity of the second maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns The feeble temper and declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining the weight of conquest and empire He chose and he was deceived he trusted and he was betrayed the most deserving of the faithful became useless or hostile to his government and his lavish bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent The spirit of discord went forth in the provinces their deputies assembled at Medina and the Charegites the desperate fanatics who disclaimed the yoke of subordination and reason were confounded among the free born Arabs who demanded the redress of their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors From Cufa from Bassora from Egypt from the tribes of the desert they rose in arms encamped about a league from Medina and despatched a haughty mandate to their sovereign requiring him to execute justice or to descend from the throne His repentance began to disarm and disperse the insurgents but their fury was rekindled by the arts of his enemies and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate his fall The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors the esteem and confidence of the Moslems during a siege of six weeks his water and provisions were intercepted and the feeble gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the more timorous rebels Forsaken by those who had abused his simplicity the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the approach of death the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of the assassins and Othman with the Koran in his lap was pierced with a multitude of wounds seventeen thirty one A tumultuous anarchy of five days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali his refusal would have provoked a general massacre In this painful situation he supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites declared that he had rather serve than reign rebuked the presumption of the strangers and required the formal if not the voluntary assent of the chiefs of the nation He has never been accused of prompting the assassin of Omar though Persia indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr The quarrel between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of Ali and Hassan the eldest of his sons was insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph Yet it is doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere in his opposition to the rebels and it is certain that he enjoyed the benefit of their crime The temptation was indeed of such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate virtue The ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren sceptre of Arabia the Saracens had been victorious in the East and West and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia Syria and Egypt were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful Footnote one hundred seventy one The schism of the Persians is explained by all our travellers of the last century especially in the

days of his reign he neglected to secure either by gifts or fetters the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobeir two of the most powerful of the Arabian chiefs They escaped from Medina to Mecca and from thence to Bassora erected the standard of revolt and usurped the government of Irak or Assyria which they had vainly solicited as the reward of their services The mask of patriotism is allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies and the enemies perhaps the assassins of Othman now demanded vengeance for his blood They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha the widow of the prophet who cherished to the last hour of her life an implacable hatred against the husband and the posterity of Fatima The most reasonable Moslems were scandalized that the mother of the faithful should expose in a camp her person and character seventeen thirty three but the superstitious crowd was confident that her presence would sanctify the justice and assure the success of their cause At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal Arabs and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa the caliph encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under the walls of Bassora seventeen thirty four Their leaders Telha and Zobeir seventeen thirty five were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the arms of the Moslems seventeen thirty six After passing through the ranks to animate the troops Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers of the field In the heat of the action seventy men who held the bridle of her camel were successively killed or wounded and the cage or litter in which she sat was stuck with javelins and darts like the quills of a porcupine The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches of the conqueror and was speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow of the apostle seventeen thirty seven After this victory which was styled the Day of the Camel Ali marched against a more formidable adversary against Moawiyah the son of Abu Sophian who had assumed the title of caliph and whose claim was supported by the forces of Syria and the interest of the house of Ommiyah From the passage of Thapsacus the plain of Siffin one hundred seventy four extends along the western bank of the Euphrates On this spacious and level theatre the two competitors waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten days In the course of ninety actions or skirmishes the loss of Ali was estimated at twenty five that of Moawiyah at forty five thousand soldiers and the list of the slain was dignified with the names of five and twenty veterans who had fought at Beder under the standard of Mahomet In this sanguinary contest the lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valor and humanity seventeen forty one His troops were strictly enjoined to await the first onset of the enemy to spare their flying brethren and to respect the bodies of the dead and the chastity of the female captives He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems by a single combat but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of inevitable death The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous and two edged sword As often as he smote a rebel he shouted the Allah Acbar God is victorious and in the tumult of a nocturnal battle he was heard to repeat four hundred times that tremendous exclamation The prince of Damascus already meditated his flight but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops Their conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost lances and Ali was compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious compromise He retreated with sorrow and indignation to Cufa his party was discouraged the distant provinces of Persia of Yemen and of Egypt were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival and the stroke of fanaticism which was aimed against the three chiefs of the nation was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet In the temple of Mecca three Charegites or enthusiasts discoursed of the disorders of the church and state they soon agreed that the deaths of Ali of Moawiyah and of his friend Amrou the viceroy of Egypt would restore the peace and unity of religion Each of the assassins chose his victim poisoned his dagger devoted his life and secretly repaired to the scene of action Their resolution was equally desperate but the first mistook the person of Amrou and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second the lawful caliph in the mosch of Cufa received a mortal wound from the hand of the third He expired in the sixty third year of his age and mercifully recommended to his children that they would despatch the murderer by a single stroke seventeen

request free access to the river declaring that under the same circumstances he would not allow any of the faithful though his adversaries to perish from thirst After some debate Moawiyah determined to avail himself of the advantage of his situation and to reject the demand of Ali The soldiers of Ali became desperate forced their way through that part of the hostile army which commanded the river and in their turn entirely cut off the troops of Moawiyah from the water Moawiyah was reduced to make the same supplication to Ali The generous caliph instantly complied and both armies with their

fierce and obstinate his conversion was tardy and reluctant his new faith was fortified by necessity and interest he served he fought perhaps he believed and the sins of the time of ignorance were expiated by the recent merits of the family of Ommiyah Moawiyah the son of Abu Sophian and of the cruel Henda was dignified in his early youth with the office or title of secretary of the prophet the judgment of Omar intrusted him with the government of Syria and he administered that important province above forty years either in a subordinate or supreme rank Without renouncing the fame of valor and liberality he affected the reputation of humanity and moderation a grateful people was attached to their benefactor and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of Cyprus and Rhodes The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition The bloody shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus the emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman and sixty thousand Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and revenge Amrou the conqueror of Egypt himself an army was the first who saluted the new monarch and divulged the dangerous secret that the Arabian caliphs might be created elsewhere than in the city of the prophet one hundred seventy eight The policy of Moawiyah eluded the valor of his rival and after the death of Ali he negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan whose mind was either above or below the government of the world and who retired without a sigh from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his grandfather The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary kingdom Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the reluctance of the Arabs and four citizens of Medina refused the oath of fidelity but the designs of Moawiyah were conducted with vigor and address and his son Yezid a feeble and dissolute youth was proclaimed as the commander of the faithful and the successor on the apostle of God Footnote one hundred seventy eight I borrow on this occasion the strong sense and expression of Tacitus Hist i four Evulgato imperii arcano posse imperatorem alni quam Romae fieri A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons of Ali In serving at table a slave had inadvertently dropped a dish of scalding broth on his master the heedless wretch fell prostrate to deprecate his punishment and repeated a verse of the Koran Paradise is for those who command their anger I am not angry and for those who pardon offences I pardon your offence and for those who return good for evil I give you your liberty and four hundred pieces of silver With an equal measure of piety Hosein the younger brother of Hassan inherited a remnant of his father s spirit and served with honor against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople The primogeniture of the line of Hashem and the holy character of grandson of the apostle had centred in his person and he was at liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid the tyrant of Damascus whose vices he despised and whose title he had never deigned to acknowledge A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa to Medina of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems who professed their attachment to his cause and who were eager to draw their swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the Euphrates Against the advice of his wisest friends he resolved to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious people He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue of women and children but as he approached the confines of Irak he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party His fears were just Obeidollah the governor of Cufa had extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection and Hosein in the plain of Kerbela was encompassed by a body of five thousand horse who intercepted his communication with the city and the river He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert that had defied the power of Caesar and Chosroes and confided in the fidelity of the tribe of Tai which would have armed ten thousand warriors in his defence In a conference with the chief of the enemy he proposed the option of three honorable conditions that he should be allowed to return to Medina or be stationed in a frontier garrison against the Turks or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid But the commands of the caliph or his lieutenant were stern and absolute and Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful or expect the consequences of his rebellion Do you think replied he to terrify me with death And during the short respite of a night seventeen eighty one he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to encounter his fate He checked the lamentations of his sister Fatima who deplored the impending ruin of his house Our trust said Hosein is in God alone All things both in heaven and earth must perish and return to their Creator My brother my father my mother were better than me and every Mussulman has an example in the prophet He pressed his friends to consult their safety by a timely flight they unanimously refused to desert or survive their beloved master and their courage was fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise On the morning of the fatal day he mounted on horseback with his sword in one hand and the Koran in the other his generous band of martyrs consisted only of thirty two horse and forty foot but their flanks and rear were secured by the tent ropes and by a deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots according to the practice of the Arabs The enemy advanced with reluctance and one of their chiefs deserted with thirty followers to claim the partnership of inevitable death In every close onset or single combat the despair of the Fatimites was invincible but the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a cloud of arrows and the horses and men were successively slain a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer and the battle at length expired by the death of the last companions of Hosein Alone weary and wounded he seated himself at the door of his tent As he tasted a drop of water he was pierced in the mouth with a dart and his son and nephew two beautiful youths were killed in his arms He lifted his hands to heaven they were full of blood and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and the dead In a transport of despair his sister issued from the tent and adjured the general of the Cufians that he would not suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes a tear trickled down his venerable beard and the boldest of his soldiers fell back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them The remorseless Shamer a name detested by the faithful reproached their cowardice and the grandson of Mahomet was slain with three and thirty strokes of lances and swords After they had trampled on his body they carried his head to the castle of Cufa and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a cane Alas exclaimed an aged Mussulman on these lips have I seen the lips of the apostle of God In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader one hundred seventy nine seventeen ninety one On the annual festival of his martyrdom in the devout pilgrimage to his

circumstances more pathetic than that of Ockley followed by Gibbon His family after his defenders were all slain perished in succession before his eyes They had been cut off from the water and suffered all the agonies of thirst His eldest son Ally Akbar after ten different assaults on the enemy in each of which he slew two or three complained bitterly of his sufferings from heat and thirst His father arose and introducing his own tongue within the parched lips of his favorite child thus endeavored to alleviate his sufferings by the only means of which his enemies had not yet been able to deprive him Ally was slain and cut to pieces in his sight this wrung from him his first and only cry then it was that his sister Zeyneb rushed from the tent The rest including his nephew fell in succession Hosein s horse was wounded he fell to the ground The hour of prayer between noon and sunset had arrived the Imaun began the religious duties as Hosein prayed he heard the cries of his infant child Abdallah only twelve months old The child was at his desire placed on his bosom as he wept over it it was transfixed by an arrow Hosein dragged himself to the Euphrates as he slaked his

dared to visit Meshed Ali and Meshed Hosein The two sepulchres are in the hands of the Turks who tolerate and tax the devotion of the Persian heretics The festival of the death of Hosein is amply described by Sir John Chardin a traveller whom I have often praised When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to the throne of Damascus the caliph was advised to extirpate the enmity of a popular and hostile race whom he had injured beyond the hope of reconciliation But Yezid preferred the councils of mercy and the mourning family was honorably dismissed to mingle their tears with their kindred at Medina The glory of martyrdom superseded the right of primogeniture and the twelve imams one hundred eighty one or pontiffs of the Persian creed are Ali Hassan Hosein and the lineal descendants of Hosein to the ninth generation Without arms or treasures or subjects they successively enjoyed the veneration of the people and provoked the jealousy of the reigning caliphs their tombs at Mecca or Medina on the banks of the Euphrates or in the province of Chorasan are still visited by the devotion of their sect Their names were often the pretence of sedition and civil war but these royal saints despised the pomp of the world submitted to the will of God and the injustice of man and devoted their innocent lives to the study and practice of religion The twelfth and last of the Imams conspicuous by the title of Mahadi or the Guide surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his predecessors He concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad the time and place of his death are unknown and his votaries pretend that he still lives and will appear before the day of judgment to overthrow the tyranny of Dejal or the Antichrist one hundred eighty two In the lapse of two or three centuries the posterity of Abbas the uncle of Mahomet had multiplied to the number of thirty three thousand one hundred eighty three the race of Ali might be equally prolific the meanest individual was above the first and greatest of princes and the most eminent were supposed to excel the perfection of angels But their adverse fortune and the wide extent of the Mussulman empire allowed an ample scope for every bold and artful imposture who claimed affinity with the holy seed the sceptre of the Almohades in Spain and Africa of the Fatimites in Egypt and Syria one hundred eighty four of the Sultans of Yemen and of the Sophis of Persia one hundred eighty five has been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title Under their reigns it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of their birth and one of the Fatimite caliphs silenced an indiscreet question by drawing his cimeter This said Moez is my pedigree and these casting a handful of gold to his soldiers and these are my kindred and my children In the various conditions of princes or doctors or nobles or merchants or beggars a swarm of the genuine or fictitious descendants of Mahomet and Ali is honored with the appellation of

still assert the proud preeminence of their birth A family of three hundred persons the pure and orthodox branch of the caliph Hassan is preserved without taint or suspicion in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and still retains after the revolutions of twelve centuries the custody of the temple and the sovereignty of their native land The fame and merit of Mahomet would ennoble a plebeian

of Mahomet and Ali is most accurately described by Demetrius Cantemir Hist of the Othmae Empire p ninety four and Niebuhr Description de l Arabie p nine sixteen three hundred seventeen c It is much to be lamented that the Danish traveller was unable to purchase the chronicles of Arabia The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause but his success has perhaps too strongly attracted our admiration Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic In the heresies of the church the same seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers Does it seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword and the sceptre subdue his native country and erect a monarchy by his victorious arms In the moving picture of the dynasties of the East a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser origin surmounted more formidable obstacles and filled a larger scope of empire and conquest Mahomet was alike instructed to preach and to fight and the union of these opposite qualities while it enhanced his merit contributed to his success the operation of force and persuasion of enthusiasm and fear continually acted on each other till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power His voice invited the Arabs to freedom and victory to arms and rapine to the indulgence of their darling passions in this world and the other the restraints which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the prophet and to exercise the obedience of the people and the only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and perfections of God It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religion that deserves our wonder the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and Medina is preserved after the revolutions of twelve centuries by the Indian the African and the Turkish proselytes of the Koran If the Christian apostles saint Peter or saint Paul could return to the Vatican they might possibly inquire the name of the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that magnificent temple at Oxford or Geneva they would experience less surprise but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse the catechism of the church and to study the orthodox commentators on their own writings and the words of their Master But the Turkish dome of saint Sophia with an increase of splendor and size represents the humble tabernacle erected at Medina by the hands of Mahomet The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man I believe in one God and Mahomet the apostle of God is the simple and invariable profession of Islam The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the honors of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion The votaries of Ali have indeed consecrated the memory of their hero his wife and his children and some of the Persian doctors pretend that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams but their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the worship of saints and martyrs The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God and the liberty of man have been agitated in the schools of the Mahometans as well as in those of the Christians but among the former they have never engaged the passions of the people or disturbed the tranquillity of the state The cause of this important difference may be found in the separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters It was the interest of the caliphs the successors of the prophet and commanders of the faithful to repress and discourage all religious innovations the order the discipline the temporal and spiritual ambition of the clergy are unknown to the Moslems and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their faith From the Atlantic to the Ganges the Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code not only of theology but of civil and criminal jurisprudence and the laws which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of God This religious servitude is attended with some practical disadvantage the illiterate legislator had been often misled by his own prejudices and those of his country and the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople On these occasions the Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume and substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the principles of equity and the manners and policy of the times His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the last consideration in the character of Mahomet The most bitter or most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will surely allow that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine less perfect only than their own He piously supposed as the basis of his religion the truth and sanctity of their prior revolutions the virtues and miracles of their founders The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne of God the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer and fasting and alms the laudable or innocent arts of devotion and his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation Mahomet was perhaps incapable of dictating a moral and political system for the use of his countrymen but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship recommended the practice of the social virtues and checked by his laws and precepts the thirst of revenge and the oppression of widows and orphans The hostile tribes were united in faith and obedience and the valor which had been idly spent in domestic quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign enemy Had the impulse been less powerful Arabia free at home and formidable abroad might have flourished under a succession of her native monarchs Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of conquest The colonies of the nation were scattered over the East and West and their blood was mingled with the blood of their converts and captives After the reign of three caliphs the throne was transported from Medina to the valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris the holy cities were violated by impious war Arabia was ruled by the rod of a subject perhaps of a stranger and the Bedoweens of the desert awakening from their dream of dominion resumed their old and solitary independence one hundred eighty seven Footnote one hundred eighty seven The writers of the Modern Universal History vols i and ii have compiled in eight hundred fifty folio pages the life of Mahomet and the annals of the caliphs They enjoyed the advantage of reading and sometimes correcting the Arabic text yet notwithstanding their high sounding boasts I cannot find after the conclusion of my work that they have afforded me much if any additional information The dull mass is not quickened by a spark of philosophy or taste and the compilers indulge the criticism of acrimonious bigotry against Boulainvilliers Sale Gagnier and all who have treated Mahomet with favor or even justice Chapter LI Conquests By The Arabs Part I The Conquest Of Persia Syria Egypt Africa And Spain By The Arabs Or Saracens Empire Of The Caliphs Or Successors Of Mahomet State Of The Christians c Under Their Government The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the Arabs the death of Mahomet was the signal of independence and the hasty structure of his power and religion tottered to its foundations A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence and shared his distress had fled with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina The increasing myriads who acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet had been compelled by his arms or allured by his prosperity The polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and invisible God the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator The habits of faith and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed and many of the new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses or the rites and mysteries of the Catholic church or the idols the sacrifices the joyous festivals of their Pagan ancestors The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and subordination and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions or violated their customs They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts of the Koran the abstinence from wine the fast of the Ramadan and the daily repetition of five prayers and the alms and tithes which were collected for the treasury of Medina could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute The example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct and defy the authority of the living prophet At the head of the fugitives and auxiliaries the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca Medina and Tayef and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the idols of the Caaba if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable reproof Ye men of Mecca will ye be the last to embrace and the first to abandon the religion of Islam After exhorting the Moslems to confide in the aid of God and his apostle Abubeker resolved by a vigorous attack to prevent the junction of the rebels The women and children were safely lodged in the cavities of the mountains the warriors marching under eleven banners diffused the terror of their arms and the appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty of the faithful The inconstant tribes accepted with humble repentance the duties of prayer and fasting and alms and after some examples of success and severity the most daring apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of Caled In the fertile province of Yemanah one between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Persia in a city not inferior to Medina itself a powerful chief his name was Moseilama had assumed the character of a prophet and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his voice A female prophetess eleven eleven was attracted by his reputation the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these favorites of Heaven two and they employed several days in mystic and amorous converse An obscure sentence of his Koran or book is yet extant three and in the pride of his mission Moseilama condescended to offer a partition of the earth The proposal was answered by Mahomet with contempt but the rapid progress of the impostor awakened the fears of his successor forty thousand Moslems were assembled under the standard of Caled and the existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive battle three thousand one hundred eleven In the first action they were repulsed by the loss of twelve hundred men but the skill and perseverance of their general prevailed their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of ten thousand infidels and Moseilama himself was pierced by an Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded the uncle of Mahomet The various rebels of Arabia without a chief or a cause were speedily suppressed by the power and discipline of the rising monarchy and the whole nation again professed and more steadfastly held the religion of the Koran The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise for the restless spirit of the Saracens their valor was united in the prosecution of a holy war and their enthusiasm was equally confirmed by opposition and victory Footnote one See the description of the city and country of Al Yamanah in Abulfeda Descript Arabiae p sixty sixty one In the xiiith century there were some ruins and a few palms but in the present century the same ground is occupied by the visions and arms of a modern prophet whose tenets are imperfectly known Niebuhr Description de l Arabie p two hundred ninety six three hundred two Footnote eleven eleven This extraordinary woman was a Christian she was at the head of a numerous and flourishing sect Moseilama professed to recognize her inspiration In a personal interview he proposed their marriage and the union of their sects The handsome person the impassioned eloquence and the arts of Moseilama triumphed over the virtue of the prophetesa who was rejected with scorn by her lover and by her notorious unchastity ost her influence with her own followers Gibbon with that propensity too common especially in his later volumes has selected only the grosser part of this singular adventure M Footnote two The first salutation may be transcribed but cannot be translated It was thus that Moseilama said or sung Surge tandem itaque strenue permolenda

account of this battle in Price p forty two M From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will naturally arise that the caliphs three hundred eleven commanded in person the armies of the faithful and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of the battle The courage of Abubeker four Omar five and Othman six had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet and the personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present world But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem their longest expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca and they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before the sepulchre of the prophet The austere and frugal measure of their lives was the effect of virtue or habit and the pride of their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph he enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his private patrimony that it might be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of the state He thought himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave but on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own and the public money first to the most worthy and then to the most indigent of the Moslems The remains of his wealth a coarse garment and five pieces of gold were delivered to his successor who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model Yet the abstinence and humility of Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker his food consisted of barley bread or dates his drink was water he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places and the Persian satrap who paid his homage to the conqueror found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina Oeeconomy is the source of liberality and the increase of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services of the faithful Careless of his own emolument he assigned to Abbas the uncle of the prophet the first and most ample allowance of twenty five thousand drachms or pieces of silver Five thousand were allotted to each of the aged warriors the relics of the field of Beder and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces One thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles against the Greeks and Persians and the decreasing pay as low as fifty pieces of silver was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar Under his reign and that of his predecessor the conquerors of the East were the trusty servants of God and the people the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline of the Saracens and they united by a rare felicity the despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of a republican government The heroic courage of Ali seven the consummate prudence of Moawiyah eight excited the emulation of their subjects and the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of the prophet In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus the succeeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen and of saints nine Yet the spoils of unknown nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne and the uniform ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs A large deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies The birth of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly period of the Persians the Romans and the Barbarians of Europe the empires of Trajan or even of Constantine or Charlemagne would have repelled the assault of the naked Saracens and the torrent of fanaticism might have been obscurely lost in

Roman republic it had been the aim of the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single war and completely to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the hostilities of a second These timid maxims of policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs With the same vigor and success they invaded the successors of Augustus and those of Artaxerxes and the rival monarchies at the same instant became the prey of an enemy whom they had been so long accustomed to despise In the ten years of the administration of Omar the Saracens reduced to his obedience thirty six thousand cities or castles destroyed four thousand churches or temples of the unbelievers and edified fourteen hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet One hundred years after his flight from Mecca the arms and the reign of his successors extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean over the various and distant provinces which may be comprised under the names of I Persia II Syria III Egypt IV Africa and V Spain Under this general division I shall proceed to unfold these memorable transactions despatching with brevity the remote and less interesting conquests of the East and reserving a fuller narrative for those domestic countries which had been included within the pale of the Roman empire Yet I must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and insufficiency of my guides The Greeks so loquacious in controversy have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of their enemies ten After a century of ignorance the first annals of the Mussulmans were collected in a great measure from the voice of tradition eleven Among the numerous productions of Arabic and Persian literature twelve our interpreters have selected the imperfect sketches of a more recent age thirteen The art and genius of history have ever been unknown to the Asiatics fourteen they are ignorant of the laws of criticism and our monkish chronicle of the same period may be compared to their most popular works which are never vivified by the spirit of philosophy and freedom The Oriental library of a Frenchman fifteen would instruct the most learned mufti of the East and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single historian so clear and comprehensive a narrative of their own exploits as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets Footnote ten For the viith and

Bibliotheque Orientale par M D Herbelot in folio Paris sixteen ninety seven For the character of the respectable author consult his friend Thevenot Voyages du Levant part i chap one His work is an agreeable miscellany which must gratify every taste but I never can digest the alphabetical order and I find him more satisfactory in the Persian than the Arabic history The recent supplement from the papers of Mm Visdelou and Galland in folio La Haye seventeen seventy nine is of a different cast a medley of tales proverbs and Chinese antiquities I In the first year of the first caliph his lieutenant Caled the Sword of God and the scourge of the infidels advanced to the banks of the Euphrates and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira Westward of the ruins of Babylon a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed themselves on the verge of the desert and Hira was the seat of a race of kings who had embraced the Christian religion and reigned above six hundred years under the shadow of the throne of Persia sixteen The last of the Mondars sixteen eleven was defeated and slain by Caled his son was sent a captive to Medina his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet the people was tempted by the example and success of their countrymen and the caliph accepted as the first fruits of foreign conquest an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold The conquerors and even their historians were astonished by the dawn of their future greatness In the same year says Elmacin Caled fought many signal battles an immense multitude of the infidels was slaughtered and spoils infinite and innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems seventeen But the invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war the invasion of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or less prudent commanders the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the passage of the Euphrates and though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the Magians their remaining forces still hovered in the desert of Babylon seventeen eleven Footnote sixteen Pocock will explain the chronology Specimen Hist Arabum p sixty six seventy four and D Anville the geography l Euphrate et le Tigre p

indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment their intestine divisions By the unanimous sentence of the priests and nobles their queen Arzema was deposed the sixth of the transient usurpers who had arisen and vanished in three or four years since the death of Chosroes and the retreat of Heraclius Her tiara was placed on the head of Yezdegerd the grandson of Chosroes and the same aera which coincides with an astronomical period eighteen has recorded the fall of the Sassanian dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster nineteen The youth and inexperience of the prince he was only fifteen years of age declined a perilous encounter the royal standard was delivered into the hands of his general Rustam and a remnant of thirty thousand regular troops was swelled in truth or in opinion to one hundred and twenty thousand subjects or allies of the great king The Moslems whose numbers were reenforced from twelve to thirty thousand had pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia twenty and their line though it consisted of fewer men could produce more soldiers than the unwieldy host of the infidels I shall here observe what I must often repeat that the charge of the Arabs was not like that of the Greeks and Romans the effort of a firm and compact infantry their military force was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers and the engagement which was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying skirmishes might be protracted without any decisive event to the continuance of several days The periods of the battle of Cadesia were distinguished by their peculiar appellations The first from the well timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian brethren was denominated the day of succor The day of concussion might express the disorder of one or perhaps of both of the contending armies The third a nocturnal tumult received the whimsical name of the night of barking from the discordant clamors which were compared to the inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals The morning of the succeeding day twenty eleven determined the fate of Persia and a seasonable whirlwind drove a cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers The clangor of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam who far unlike the ancient hero of his name was gently reclining in a cool and tranquil shade amidst the baggage of his camp and the train of mules that were laden with gold and silver On the sound of danger he started from his couch but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab who caught him by the foot struck off his head hoisted it on a lance and instantly returning to the field of battle carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest ranks of the Persians The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand five hundred men twenty twelve and the battle of Cadesia is justly described by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious twenty one The standard of the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field a leathern apron of a blacksmith who in ancient times had arisen the deliverer of Persia but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised and almost concealed by a profusion of precious gems twenty two After this victory the wealthy province of Irak or Assyria submitted to the caliph and his conquests were firmly established by the speedy foundation of Bassora twenty three a place which ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians As the distance of fourscore miles from the Gulf the Euphrates and Tigris unite in a broad and direct current which is aptly styled the river of the Arabs In the midway between the junction and the mouth of these famous streams the new settlement was planted on the western bank the first colony was composed of eight hundred Moslems but the influence of the situation soon reared a flourishing and populous capital The air though excessively hot is pure and healthy the meadows are filled with palm trees and cattle and one of the adjacent valleys has been celebrated among the four paradises or gardens of Asia Under the first caliphs the jurisdiction of this Arabian colony extended over the southern provinces of Persia the city has been sanctified by the tombs of the companions and martyrs and the vessels of Europe still frequent the port of Bassora as a convenient station and passage of the Indian trade Footnote eighteen A cycle of one hundred twenty years the end of which an intercalary month of thirty days supplied the use of our Bissextile and restored the integrity of the solar year In a great revolution of fourteen forty years this intercalation was successively removed from the first to the twelfth month but Hyde and Freret are involved in a profound controversy whether the twelve or only eight of these changes were accomplished before the aera

expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally display their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the present world They were informed that the produce and manufactures of the country were annually collected in the fair of Abyla sixty four about thirty miles from the city that the cell of a devout hermit was visited at the same time by a multitude of pilgrims and that the festival of trade and superstition would be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the governor of Tripoli Abdallah the son of Jaafar a glorious and holy martyr undertook with a banner of five hundred horse the pious and profitable commission of despoiling the infidels As he approached the fair of Abyla he was astonished by the report of this mighty concourse of Jews and Christians Greeks and Armenians of natives of Syria and of strangers of Egypt to the number of ten thousand besides a guard of five thousand horse that attended the person of the bride The Saracens paused For my own part said Abdallah I dare not go back our foes are many our danger is great but our reward is splendid and secure either in this life or in the life to come Let every man according to his inclination advance or retire Not a Mussulman deserted his standard Lead the way said Abdallah to his Christian guide and you shall see what the companions of the prophet can perform They charged in five squadrons but after the first advantage of the surprise they were encompassed and almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their enemies and their valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot in the skin of a black camel sixty five About the hour of sunset when their weapons dropped from their hands when they panted on the verge of eternity they discovered an approaching cloud of dust they heard the welcome sound of the tecbir sixty six and they soon perceived the standard of Caled who flew to their relief with the utmost speed of his cavalry The Christians were broken by his attack and slaughtered in their flight as far as the river of Tripoli They left behind them the various riches of the fair the merchandises that were exposed for sale the money that was brought for purchase the gay decorations of the nuptials and the governor s daughter with forty of her female attendants The fruits provisions and furniture the money plate and jewels were diligently laden on the backs of

preference sixty eight The heat of the climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and mountains by the plenty of wood and water and the produce of a fertile soil affords the subsistence and encourages the propagation of men and animals From the age of David to that of Heraclius the country was overspread with ancient and flourishing cities the inhabitants were numerous and wealthy and after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition after the recent calamities of the Persian war Syria could still attract and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert A plain of ten days journey from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch is watered on the western side by the winding course of the Orontes The hills of Libanus and Anti Libanus are planted from north to south between the Orontes and the Mediterranean and the epithet of hollow Coelesyria was applied to a long and fruitful valley which is confined in the same direction by the two ridges of snowy mountains sixty nine Among the cities which are enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and conquest of Syria we may distinguish Emesa or Hems Heliopolis or Baalbec the former as the metropolis of the plain the latter as the capital of the valley Under the last of the Caesars they were strong and populous the turrets glittered from afar an ample space was covered with public and private buildings and the citizens were illustrious by their spirit or at least by their pride by their riches or at least by their luxury In the days of Paganism both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted to the worship of Baal or the sun but the decline of their superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety of fortune Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa which was equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus seventy while the ruins of Baalbec invisible to the writers of antiquity excite the curiosity and wonder of the European traveller seventy one The measure of the temple is two hundred feet in length and one hundred in breadth the front is adorned with a double portico of eight columns fourteen may be counted on either side and each column forty five feet in height is composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble The proportions and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the architecture of the Greeks but as Baalbec has never been the seat of a monarch we are at a loss to conceive how the expense of these magnificent structures could be supplied by private or municipal liberality seventy two From the conquest of Damascus the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa but I shall decline the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already shown on a larger scale In the prosecution of the war their policy was not less effectual than their sword By short and separate truces they dissolved the union of the enemy accustomed the Syrians to compare their friendship with their enmity familiarized the idea of their language religion and manners and exhausted by clandestine purchase the magazines and arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege They aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy or the more obstinate and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold five thousand ounces of silver two thousand robes of silk and as many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses But the terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed and the lieutenant of the caliph who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive Baalbec remained tranquil and immovable in his tent till the jarring factions solicited the interposition of a foreign master The conquest of the plain and valley of Syria was achieved in less than two years Yet the commander of the faithful reproved the slowness of their progress and the Saracens bewailing their fault with tears of rage and repentance called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to fight the battles of the Lord In a recent action under the walls of Emesa an Arabian youth the cousin of Caled was heard aloud to exclaim Methinks I see the black eyed girls looking upon me one of whom should she appear in this world all mankind would die for love of her And I see in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green silk and a cap of precious stones and she beckons me and calls out Come hither quickly for I love thee With these words charging the Christians he made havoc wherever he went till observed at length by the governor of Hems he was struck through with a javelin Footnote sixty seven In the Geography of Abulfeda the

Saracens to exert the full powers of their valor and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor who was taught by repeated losses that the rovers of the desert had undertaken and would speedily achieve a regular and permanent conquest From the provinces of Europe and Asia fourscore thousand soldiers were transported by sea and land to Antioch and Caesarea the light troops of the army consisted of sixty thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan Under the banner of Jabalah the last of their princes they marched in the van and it was a maxim of the Greeks that for the purpose of cutting diamond a diamond was the most effectual Heraclius withheld his person from the dangers of the field but his presumption or perhaps his despondency suggested a peremptory order that the fate of the province and the war should be decided by a single battle The Syrians were attached to the standard of Rome and of the cross but the noble the citizen the peasant were exasperated by the injustice and cruelty of a licentious host who oppressed them as subjects and despised them as strangers and aliens seventy three A report of these mighty preparations was conveyed to the Saracens in their camp of Emesa and the chiefs though resolved to fight assembled a council the faith of Abu Obeidah would have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom the wisdom of Caled advised an honorable retreat to the skirts of Palestine and Arabia where they might await the succors of their friends and the attack of the unbelievers A speedy messenger soon returned from the throne of Medina with the blessings of Omar and Ali the prayers of the widows of the prophet and a reenforcement of eight thousand Moslems In their way they overturned a detachment of Greeks and when they joined at Yermuk the camp of their brethren they found the pleasing intelligence that Caled had already defeated and scattered the Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan In the neighborhood of Bosra the springs of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of Decapolis or ten cities and the Hieromax a name which has been corrupted to Yermuk is lost after a short course in the Lake of Tiberias seventy four The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by a long and bloody encounter seven thousand four hundred eleven On this momentous occasion the public voice and the modesty of Abu Obeidah restored the command to the most deserving of the Moslems Caled assumed his station in the front his colleague was posted in the rear that the disorder of the fugitive might be checked by his venerable aspect and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had displayed before the walls of Chaibar The last line was occupied by the sister of Derar with the Arabian women who had enlisted in this holy war who were accustomed to wield the bow and the lance and who in a moment of captivity had defended against the uncircumcised ravishers their chastity and religion seventy five The exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible Paradise is before you the devil and hell fire in your rear Yet such was the weight of the Roman cavalry that the right wing of the Arabs was broken and separated from the main body Thrice did they retreat in disorder and thrice were they driven back to the charge by the reproaches and blows of the women In the intervals of action Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers of two different hours bound up their wounds with his own hands and administered the comfortable reflection that the infidels partook of their sufferings without partaking of their reward Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field of battle and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious service The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they had seen But it was likewise the most decisive many thousands of the Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs many were slaughtered after the defeat in the woods and mountains many by mistaking the ford were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk and however the loss may be magnified seventy six the Christian writers confess and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins seventy seven Manuel the Roman general was either killed at Damascus or took refuge in the monastery of Mount Sinai An exile in the Byzantine court Jabalah lamented the manners of Arabia and his unlucky preference of the Christian cause seventy eight He had once inclined to the profession of Islam but in the pilgrimage of Mecca Jabalah was provoked to strike one of his brethren and fled with amazement from the stern and equal justice of the caliph These victorious Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and repose the spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah an equal share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse and a double portion was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed Footnote seventy three I have read somewhere in Tacitus or Grotius Subjectos habent tanquam suos viles

securely choose among the fortified towns of Syria the first object of their attack They consulted the caliph whether they should march to Caesarea or Jerusalem and the advice of Ali determined the immediate siege of the latter To a profane eye Jerusalem was the first or second capital of Palestine but after Mecca and Medina it was revered and visited by the devout Moslems as the temple of the Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revelation of Moses of Jesus and of Mahomet himself The son of Abu Sophian was sent with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise or treaty but on the eleventh day the town was invested by the whole force of Abu Obeidah He addressed the customary summons to the chief commanders and people of Aelia seventy nine Footnote seventy nine

side by deep valleys and steep ascents since the invasion of Syria the walls and towers had been anxiously restored the bravest of the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest place of refuge and in the defence of the sepulchre of Christ the natives and strangers might feel some sparks of the enthusiasm which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms of the Saracens The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months not a day was lost without some action of sally or assault the military engines incessantly played from the ramparts and the inclemency of the winter was still more painful and destructive to the Arabs The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of the besiegers The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls and by the voice of an interpreter demanded a conference seven thousand nine hundred eleven After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph from his impious enterprise he proposed in the name of the people a fair capitulation with this extraordinary clause that the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and presence of Omar himself The question was debated in the council of Medina the sanctity of the place and the advice of Ali persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and enemies and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression The conqueror of Persia

invited to partake of his homely fare and the repast was consecrated by the prayer and exhortation of the commander of the faithful eighty But in this expedition or pilgrimage his power was exercised in the administration of justice he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty and chastised the luxury of the Saracens by despoiling them of their rich silks and dragging them on their faces in the dirt When he came within sight of Jerusalem the caliph cried with a loud voice God is victorious O Lord give us an easy conquest and pitching his tent of coarse hair calmly seated himself on the ground After signing the capitulation he entered the city without fear or precaution and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities eighty one Sophronius bowed before his new master and secretly muttered in the words of Daniel The abomination of desolation is in the holy place eighty two At the hour of prayer they stood together in the church of the resurrection but the caliph refused to perform his devotions and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church of Constantine To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and honorable motive Had I yielded said Omar to your request the Moslems of a future age would have infringed the treaty under color of imitating my example By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon was prepared for the foundation of a mosch eighty three and during a residence of ten days he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian conquests Medina

he has used to supply the defective narrative of Al Wakidi To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war the caliph had formed two separate armies a chosen detachment under Amrou and Yezid was left in the camp of Palestine while the larger division under the standard of Abu Obeidah and Caled marched away to the north against Antioch and Aleppo The latter of these the Beraea of the Greeks was not yet illustrious as the capital of a province or a kingdom and the inhabitants by anticipating their submission and pleading their poverty obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion But the castle of Aleppo eighty five distinct from the city stood erect on a lofty artificial mound the sides were sharpened to a precipice and faced with free stone and the breadth of the ditch might be filled with water from the neighboring springs After the loss of three thousand men the garrison was still equal to the defence and Youkinna their valiant and hereditary chief had murdered his brother a holy monk for daring to pronounce the name of peace In a siege of four or five months the hardest of the Syrian war great numbers of the Saracens were killed and wounded their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce the vigilance of Youkinna nor could the Christians be terrified by the execution of three hundred captives whom they beheaded before the castle wall The silence and at length the complaints of Abu Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope and patience were consumed at the foot of this impregnable fortress I am variously affected replied Omar by the difference of your success but I charge you by no means to raise the siege of the castle Your retreat would diminish the reputation of our arms and encourage the infidels to fall upon you on all sides Remain before Aleppo till God shall determine the event and forage with your horse round the adjacent country The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was fortified by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of Arabia who arrived in the camp on horses or camels Among these was Dames of a servile birth but of gigantic size and intrepid resolution The forty seventh day of his service he proposed with only thirty men to make an attempt on the castle The experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer and Abu Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin of Dames since he himself could he relinquish the public care would cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave His design was covered by the appearance of a retreat and the camp of the Saracens was pitched about a league from Aleppo The thirty adventurers lay in ambush at the foot of the hill and Dames at length succeeded in his inquiries though he was provoked by the ignorance of his Greek captives God curse these dogs said the illiterate Arab what a strange barbarous language they speak At the darkest hour of the night he scaled the most accessible height which he had diligently surveyed a place where the stones were less entire or the slope less perpendicular or the guard less vigilant Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on each other s shoulders and the weight of the column was sustained on the broad and sinewy back of the gigantic slave The foremost in this painful ascent could grasp and climb the lowest part of the battlements they silently stabbed and cast down the sentinels and the thirty brethren repeating a pious ejaculation O apostle of God help and deliver us were successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans With bold and cautious footsteps Dames explored the palace of the governor who celebrated in riotous merriment the festival of his deliverance From thence returning to his companions he assaulted on the inside the entrance of the castle They overpowered the guard unbolted the gate let down the drawbridge and defended the narrow pass till the arrival of Caled with the dawn of day relieved their danger and assured their conquest Youkinna a formidable foe became an active and useful proselyte and the general of the Saracens expressed his regard for the most humble merit by detaining the army at Aleppo till Dames was cured of his honorable wounds The capital of Syria was still covered by the castle of Aazaz and the iron bridge of the Orontes After the loss of those important posts and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies the luxury of Antioch eighty six trembled and obeyed Her safety was ransomed with three hundred thousand pieces of gold but the throne of the successors of Alexander the seat of the Roman government of the East which had been decorated by Caesar with the titles of free and holy and inviolate was degraded under the yoke of the caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town eighty seven

glories of the Persian war are clouded on either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more early and his later days When the successors of Mahomet unsheathed the sword of war and religion he was astonished at the boundless prospect of toil and danger his nature was indolent nor could the infirm and frigid age of the emperor be kindled to a second effort The sense of shame and the importunities of the Syrians prevented the hasty departure from the scene of action but the hero was no more and the loss of Damascus and Jerusalem the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk may be imputed in some degree to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ he involved the church and state in a metaphysical controversy for the unity of his will and while Heraclius crowned the offspring of his second nuptials he was tamely stripped of the most valuable part of their inheritance In the cathedral of Antioch in the presence of the bishops at the foot of the crucifix he bewailed the sins of the prince and people but his confession instructed the world that it was vain and perhaps impious to resist the judgment of God The Saracens were invincible in fact since they were invincible in opinion and the desertion of Youkinna his false repentance and repeated perfidy might justify the suspicion of the emperor that he was encompassed by traitors and apostates who conspired to betray his person and their country to the enemies of Christ In the hour of adversity his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of a falling crown and after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria he secretly embarked with a few attendants and absolved the faith of his subjects eighty eight Constantine his eldest son had been stationed with forty thousand men at Caesarea the civil metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine But his private interest recalled him to the Byzantine court and after the flight of his father he felt himself an unequal champion to the united force of the caliph His vanguard was boldly attacked by three hundred Arabs and a thousand black slaves who in the depth of winter had climbed the snowy mountains of Libanus and who were speedily followed by the victorious squadrons of Caled himself From the north and south the troops of Antioch and Jerusalem advanced along the sea shore till their banners were joined under the walls of the Phoenician cities Tripoli and Tyre were betrayed and a fleet of fifty transports which entered without distrust the captive harbors brought a seasonable supply of arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens Their labors were terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea the Roman prince had embarked in the night eighty nine and the defenceless citizens

embraced for the last time his sister and mother It is not said he the delicacies of Syria or the fading delights of this world that have prompted me to devote my life in the cause of religion But I seek the favor of God and his apostle and I have heard from one of the companions of the prophet that the spirits of the martyrs will be lodged in the crops of green birds who shall taste the fruits and drink of the rivers of paradise Farewell we shall meet again among the groves and fountains which God has provided for his elect The faithful captives might exercise a passive and more arduous resolution and a cousin of Mahomet is celebrated for refusing after an abstinence of three days the wine and pork the only nourishment that was allowed by the malice of the infidels The frailty of some weaker brethren exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism and the father of Amer deplored in pathetic strains the apostasy and damnation of a son who had renounced the promises of God and the intercession of the prophet to occupy with the priests and deacons the lowest mansions of hell The more fortunate Arabs who survived the war and persevered in the faith were restrained by their abstemious leader from the abuse of prosperity After a refreshment of three days Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from the pernicious contagion of the luxury of Antioch and assured the caliph that their religion and virtue could only be preserved by the hard discipline of poverty and labor But the virtue of Omar however rigorous to himself was kind and liberal to his brethren After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving he dropped a tear of compassion and sitting down on the ground wrote an answer in which he mildly censured the severity of his lieutenant God said the successor of the prophet has not forbidden the use of the good things of this worl to faithful men and such as have performed good works Therefore you ought to have given them leave to rest themselves and partake freely of those good things which the country affordeth If any of the Saracens have no family in Arabia they may marry in Syria and whosoever of them wants any female slaves he may purchase as many as he hath occasion for The conquerors prepared to use or to abuse this gracious permission but the year of their triumph was marked by a mortality of men and cattle and twenty five thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of Syria The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the Christians but his brethren recollected that he was one of the ten elect whom the prophet had named as the heirs of paradise ninety one Caled survived his brethren about three years and the tomb of the Sword of God is shown in the neighborhood of Emesa His valor which founded in Arabia and Syria the empire of the caliphs was fortified by the opinion of a special providence and as long as he wore a cap which had been blessed by Mahomet he deemed himself invulnerable amidst the darts of the infidels nine thousand one hundred eleven Footnote ninety one Abulfeda Annal Moslem p seventy three Mahomet could artfully vary the praises of his disciples Of Omar he was accustomed to say that if a

their children and countrymen Syria became the seat and support of the house of Ommiyah and the revenue the soldiers the ships of that powerful kingdom were consecrated to enlarge on every side the empire of the caliphs But the Saracens despise a superfluity of fame and their historians scarcely condescend to mention the subordinate conquests which are lost in the splendor and rapidity of their victorious career To the north of Syria they passed Mount Taurus and reduced to their obedience the province of Cilicia with its capital Tarsus the ancient monument of the Assyrian kings Beyond a second ridge of the same mountains they spread the flame of war rather than the light of religion as far as the shores of the Euxine and the neighborhood of Constantinople To the east they advanced to the banks and sources of the Euphrates and Tigris ninety two the long disputed barrier of Rome and Persia was forever confounded the walls of Edessa and Amida of Dara and Nisibis which had resisted the arms and engines of Sapor or Nushirvan were levelled in the dust and the holy city of Abgarus might vainly produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbelieving conqueror To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea and the ruin of Aradus a small island or peninsula on the coast was postponed during ten years But the hills of Libanus abounded in timber the trade of Phoenicia was populous in mariners and a fleet of seventeen hundred barks was equipped and manned by the natives of the desert The Imperial navy of the Romans fled before them from the Pamphylian rocks to the Hellespont but the spirit of the emperor a grandson of Heraclius had been subdued before the combat by a dream and a pun ninety three The Saracens rode masters of the sea and the islands of Cyprus Rhodes and the Cyclades were successively exposed to their rapacious visits Three hundred years before the Christian aera the memorable though fruitless siege of Rhodes ninety four by Demetrius had furnished that maritime republic with the materials and the subject of a trophy A gigantic statue of Apollo or the sun seventy cubits in height was erected at the entrance of the harbor a monument of the freedom and the arts of Greece After standing fifty six years the colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake but the massy trunk and huge fragments lay scattered eight centuries on the ground and are often described as one of the wonders of the ancient world They were collected by the diligence of the Saracens and sold to a Jewish merchant of Edessa who is said to have laden nine

the victorious Saracen one of the first of his nation in an age when the meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by the spirit of enthusiasm The birth of Amrou was at once base and illustrious his mother a notorious prostitute was unable to decide among five of the Koreish but the proof of resemblance adjudged the child to Aasi the oldest of her lovers ninety six The youth of Amrou was impelled by the passions and prejudices of his kindred his poetic genius was exercised in satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet his dexterity was employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious exiles who had taken refuge in the court of the Aethiopian king ninety seven Yet he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte his reason or his interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols he escaped from Mecca with his friend Caled and the prophet of Medina enjoyed at the same moment the satisfaction of embracing the two firmest champions of his cause The impatience of Amrou to lead the armies of the faithful was checked by the reproof of Omar who advised him not to seek power and dominion since he who is a subject to day may be a prince to morrow Yet his merit was not overlooked by the two first successors of Mahomet they were indebted to his arms for the conquest of Palestine and in all the battles and sieges of Syria he united with the temper of a chief the valor of an adventurous soldier In a visit to Medina the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which had cut down so many Christian warriors the son of Aasi unsheathed a short and ordinary cimeter and as he perceived the surprise of Omar Alas said the modest Saracen the sword itself without the arm of its master is neither sharper nor more weighty than the sword of Pharezdak the poet ninety eight After the conquest of Egypt he was recalled by the jealousy of the caliph Othman but in the subsequent troubles the ambition of a soldier a statesman and an orator emerged from a private station His powerful support both in council and in the field established the throne of the Ommiades the administration and revenue of Egypt were restored by the gratitude of Moawiyah to a faithful friend who had raised himself above the rank of a subject and Amrou ended his days in the palace and city which he had founded on the banks of the Nile His dying speech to his children is celebrated by the Arabians as a model of eloquence and wisdom he deplored the errors of his youth but if the penitent was still infected by the vanity of a poet he might

Vespasian and Mucianus with Moawiyah and Amrou Yet the resemblance is still more in the situation than in the characters of the men From his camp in Palestine Amrou had surprised or anticipated the caliph s leave for the invasion of Egypt one hundred The magnanimous Omar trusted in his God and his sword which had shaken the thrones of Chosroes and Caesar but when he compared the slender force of the Moslems with the greatness of the enterprise he condemned his own rashness and listened to his timid companions The pride and the greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the readers of the Koran and a tenfold repetition of prodigies had been scarcely sufficient to effect not the victory but the flight of six hundred thousand of the children of Israel the cities of Egypt were many and populous their architecture was strong and solid the Nile with its numerous branches was alone an insuperable barrier and the granary of the Imperial city would be obstinately defended by the Roman powers In this perplexity the commander of the faithful resigned himself to the decision of chance or in his opinion of Providence At the head of only four thousand Arabs the intrepid Amrou had marched away from his station of Gaza when he was overtaken by the messenger of Omar If you are still in Syria said the ambiguous mandate retreat without delay but if at the receipt of this epistle you have already reached the frontiers of Egypt advance with confidence and depend on the succor of God and of your brethren The experience perhaps the secret intelligence of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts and he continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched on Egyptian ground He there assembled his officers broke the seal perused the epistle gravely inquired the name and situation of the place and declared his ready obedience to the commands of the caliph After a siege of thirty days he took possession of Farmah or Pelusium and that key of Egypt as it has been justly named unlocked the entrance of the country as far as the ruins of Heliopolis and the neighborhood of the modern Cairo Footnote one hundred Al Wakidi had likewise composed a separate

protected the passage of the river and the second capital of Egypt This important fortress which might fairly be described as a part of Memphis or Misrah was invested by the arms of the lieutenant of Omar a reenforcement of four thousand Saracens soon arrived in his camp and the military engines which battered the walls may be imputed to the art and labor of his Syrian allies Yet the siege was protracted to seven months and the rash invaders were encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile one hundred three Their last assault was bold and successful they passed the ditch which had been fortified with iron spikes applied their scaling ladders entered the fortress with the shout of God is victorious and drove the remnant of the Greeks to their boats and the Isle of Rouda The spot was afterwards recommended to the conqueror by the easy communication with the gulf and the peninsula of Arabia the remains of Memphis were deserted the tents of the Arabs were converted into permanent habitations and the first mosch was blessed by the presence of fourscore companions of Mahomet one hundred four A new city arose in their camp on the eastward bank of the Nile and the contiguous quarters of Babylon and Fostat are confounded in their present decay by the appellation of old Misrah or Cairo of which they form an extensive suburb But the name of Cairo the town of

Mahomet ranked him among princes but he declined with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments the proposal of a new religion one hundred eight The abuse of his trust exposed him to the resentment of Heraclius his submission was delayed by arrogance and fear and his conscience was prompted by interest to throw himself on the favor of the nation and the support of the Saracens In his first conference with Amrou he heard without indignation the usual option of the Koran the tribute or the sword The Greeks replied Mokawkas are determined to abide the determination of the sword but with the Greeks I desire no communion either in this world or in the next and I abjure forever the Byzantine tyrant his synod of Chalcedon and his Melchite slaves For myself and my brethren we are resolved to live and die in the profession of the gospel and unity of Christ It is impossible for us to embrace the revelations of your prophet but we are desirous of peace and cheerfully submit to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors The tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of every Christian but old men monks women and children of both sexes under sixteen years of age were exempted from this personal assessment the Copts above and below Memphis swore allegiance to the caliph and promised a hospitable entertainment of three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their country By this charter of security the ecclesiastical and civil tyranny of the Melchites was destroyed one hundred nine the anathemas of saint Cyril were thundered from every pulpit and the sacred edifices with the patrimony of the church were restored to the national communion of the Jacobites who enjoyed without moderation the moment of triumph and revenge At the pressing summons of Amrou their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his desert and after the first interview the courteous Arab affected to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian priest of more innocent manners and a more venerable aspect one hundred ten In the march from Memphis to Alexandria the lieutenant of Omar intrusted his safety to the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians the roads and bridges were diligently repaired and in every step of his progress he could depend on a constant supply of provisions and intelligence The Greeks of Egypt whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives were overwhelmed by the universal defection they had ever been hated they were no longer feared the magistrate fled from his tribunal the bishop from his altar and the distant garrisons were

been awake to the public distress fresh armies of Romans and Barbarians might have been poured into the harbor to save the second capital of the empire A circumference of ten miles would have scattered the forces of the Greeks and favored the stratagems of an active enemy but the two sides of an oblong square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis and each of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of the attempt and the value of the prize From the throne of Medina the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city his voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of Syria and the merit of a holy war was recommended by the peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt Anxious for the ruin or expulsion of their tyrants the faithful natives devoted their labors to the service of Amrou some sparks of martial spirit were perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies and the sanguine hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church of saint John of Alexandria Eutychius the patriarch observes that the Saracens fought with the courage of lions they repulsed the frequent and almost daily sallies of the besieged and soon assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city In every attack the sword the banner of Amrou glittered in the van of the Moslems On a memorable day he was betrayed by his imprudent valor his followers who had entered the citadel were driven back and the general with a friend and slave remained a prisoner in the hands of the Christians When Amrou was conducted before the praefect he remembered his dignity and forgot his situation a lofty demeanor and resolute language revealed the lieutenant of the caliph and the battle axe of a soldier was already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive His life was saved by the readiness of his slave who instantly gave his master a blow on the face and commanded him with an angry tone to be silent in the presence of his superiors The credulous Greek was deceived he listened to the offer of a treaty and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more respectable embassy till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced the return of their general and insulted the folly of the infidels At length after a siege of fourteen months one hundred twelve and the loss of three and twenty thousand men the Saracens prevailed the Greeks embarked their dispirited and diminished numbers and the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of the capital of Egypt I have taken said Amrou to the caliph the great city of the West It is impossible for me to enumerate the variety of its riches and beauty and I shall content myself with observing that it contains four thousand palaces four thousand baths four hundred theatres or places of amusement twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food and forty thousand tributary Jews The town has been subdued by force of arms without treaty or capitulation and the Moslems are impatient to seize the fruits of their victory one hundred thirteen The commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of pillage and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation of the faith the inhabitants were numbered a tribute was imposed the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were curbed and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship The intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted the declining health of the emperor and Heraclius died of a dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria one hundred fourteen Under the minority of his grandson the clamors of a people deprived of their daily sustenance compelled the Byzantine court to undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt In the space of four years the harbor and fortifications of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet and army of Romans They were twice expelled by the valor of Amrou who was recalled by the domestic peril from the distant wars of Tripoli and Nubia But the facility of the attempt the repetition of the insult and the obstinacy of the resistance provoked him to swear that if a third time he drove the infidels into the sea he would render Alexandria as accessible on all sides as the house of a prostitute Faithful to his promise he dismantled several parts of the walls and towers but the people was spared in the chastisement of the city and the mosch of Mercy was erected on the spot where the victorious general had stopped the fury of his troops Footnote one hundred eleven The local description of Alexandria is perfectly ascertained

I passed in silence the fate of the Alexandrian library as it is described by the learned Abulpharagius The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than that of his brethren and in his leisure hours the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of John the last disciple of Ammonius and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and philosophy one hundred fifteen Emboldened by this familiar intercourse Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift inestimable in his opinion contemptible in that of the Barbarians the royal library which alone among the spoils of Alexandria had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph and the well known answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God they are useless and need not be preserved if they disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed The sentence was executed with blind obedience the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city and such was their incredible multitude that six months were barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel Since the Dynasties of Abulpharagius one hundred sixteen have been given to the world in a Latin version the tale has been repeatedly transcribed and every scholar with pious indignation has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning the arts and the genius of antiquity For my own part I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences eleven sixty one The fact is indeed marvellous Read and wonder says the historian himself and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media is overbalanced by the silence of two annalist of a more early date both Christians both natives of Egypt and the most ancient of whom the patriarch Eutychius has amply described the conquest of Alexandria one hundred seventeen The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare that the religious books of the Jews and Christians which are acquired by the right of war should never be committed to the flames and that the works of profane science historians or poets physicians or philosophers may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful one hundred eighteen A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet yet in this instance the conflagration would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials I should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own defence one hundred nineteen or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry one hundred twenty But if we gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius we shall learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four or the seven hundred thousand volumes which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies one hundred twenty one Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books but if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in the public baths one hundred twenty two a philosopher may allow with a smile that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind I sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the Roman empire but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages the waste of ignorance and the calamities of war our treasures rather than our losses are the objects of my surprise Many curious and interesting facts are buried in oblivion the three great historians of Rome have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state and we are deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric iambic and dramatic poetry of the Greeks Yet we should gratefully remember that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of antiquity one hundred twenty three had adjudged the first place of genius and glory the teachers of ancient knowledge who are still extant had perused and compared the writings of their predecessors one hundred twenty four nor can it fairly be presumed

exotic fancies of Sir William Temple The contempt of the Greeks for Barbaric science would scarcely admit the Indian or Aethiopic books into the library of Alexandria nor is it proved that philosophy has sustained any real loss from their exclusion In the administration of Egypt one hundred twenty five Amrou balanced the demands of justice and policy the interest of the people of the law who were defended by God and of the people of the alliance who were protected by man In the recent tumult of conquest and deliverance the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were most adverse to the tranquillity of the province To the former Amrou declared that faction and falsehood would be doubly chastised by the punishment of the accusers whom he should detest as his personal enemies and by the promotion of their innocent brethren whom their envy had labored to injure and supplant He excited the latter by the motives of religion and honor to sustain the dignity of their character to endear themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the caliph to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their faith and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of their victory In the management of the revenue he disapproved the simple but oppressive mode of a capitation and preferred with reason a proportion of taxes deducted on every branch from the clear profits of agriculture and commerce A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs of the dikes and canals so essential to the public welfare Under his administration the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of Arabia and a string of camels laden with corn and provisions covered almost without an interval the long road from Memphis to Medina one hundred twenty six But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the maritime communication which had been attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs the Ptolemies or the Caesars and a canal at least eighty miles in length was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea twelve sixty one This inland navigation which would have joined the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean was soon discontinued as useless and dangerous the throne was

du Baron de Tott tom iv Of his new conquest the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran He requested that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and the Amalekites and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not unfaithful picture of that singular country one hundred twenty eight O commander of the faithful Egypt is a compound of black earth and green plants between a pulverized mountain and a red sand The distance from Syene to the sea is a month s journey for a horseman Along the valley descends a river on which the blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and morning and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the sun and moon When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks the springs and fountains that nourish the earth the Nile rolls his swelling and sounding waters through the realm of Egypt the fields are overspread by the salutary flood and the villages communicate with each other in their painted barks The retreat of the inundation deposits a fertilizing mud for the reception of the various seeds the crowds of husbandmen who blacken the land may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants and their native indolence is quickened by the lash of the task master and the promise of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase Their hope is seldom deceived but the riches which they extract from the wheat the barley and the rice the legumes the fruit trees and the cattle are unequally shared between those who labor and those who possess According to the vicissitudes of the seasons the face of the country is adorned with a silver wave a verdant emerald and the deep yellow of a golden harvest one hundred twenty nine Yet this beneficial order is sometimes interrupted and the long delay and sudden swell of the river in the first year of the conquest might afford some color to an edifying fable It is said that the annual sacrifice of a virgin one hundred thirty had been interdicted by the piety of Omar and that the Nile lay sullen and inactive in his shallow bed till the mandate of the caliph was cast into the obedient stream which rose in a single night to the height of sixteen cubits The admiration of the Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the license of their romantic spirit We may read in the gravest authors that Egypt was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages one hundred thirty one that exclusive of the Greeks and Arabs the Copts alone were found on the assessment six millions of tributary subjects one hundred thirty two or twenty millions of either sex and of every age that three hundred millions of gold or silver were annually paid to the treasury of the caliphs one hundred thirty three Our reason must be startled by these extravagant assertions and they will become more palpable if we assume the compass and measure the extent of habitable ground a valley from the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles and the triangle of the Delta a flat surface of two thousand one hundred square leagues compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of France one hundred thirty four A more accurate research will justify a more reasonable estimate The three hundred millions created by the error of a scribe are reduced to the decent revenue of four millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold of which nine hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the soldiers one hundred thirty five Two authentic lists of the present and of the twelfth century are circumscribed within the respectable number of two thousand

blessing of the commander of the faithful They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their countrymen and the conduct of the war was intrusted to Abdallah one hundred thirty nine the son of Said and the foster brother of the caliph who had lately supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt Yet the favor of the prince and the merit of his favorite could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy The early conversion of Abdallah and his skilful pen had recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of the Koran he betrayed his trust corrupted the text derided the errors which he had made and fled to Mecca to escape the justice and expose the ignorance of the apostle After the conquest of Mecca he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet his tears and the entreaties of Othman extorted a reluctant pardon out the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood of the apostate With apparent fidelity and effective merit he served the religion which it was no longer his interest to desert his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank among the Koreish and in a nation of cavalry Abdallah was renowned as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia At the head of forty thousand Moslems he advanced from Egypt into the unknown countries of the West The sands of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their faithful camels and the natives of the desert beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate After a painful march they pitched their tents before the walls of Tripoli one hundred forty a maritime city in which the name the wealth and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred and which now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary A reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the sea shore but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first assaults and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the praefect Gregory one hundred forty one to relinquish the labors of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action If his standard was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men the regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors who formed the strength or rather the numbers of his host He rejected with indignation the option of the Koran or the tribute and during several days the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon when their fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and refreshment in their respective camps The daughter of Gregory a maid of incomparable beauty and spirit is said to have fought by his side from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback to draw the bow and to wield the cimeter and the richness of her arms and apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle Her hand with a hundred thousand pieces of gold was offered for the head of the Arabian general and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect of the glorious prize At the pressing solicitation of his brethren Abdallah withdrew his person from the field but the Saracens were discouraged by the retreat of their leader and the repetition of these equal or unsuccessful conflicts

eyes round the field Where said he is our general In his tent Is the tent a station for the general of the Moslems Abdallah represented with a blush the importance of his own life and the temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect Retort said Zobeir on the infidels their ungenerous attempt Proclaim through the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with his captive daughter and the equal sum of one hundred thousand pieces of gold To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the lieutenant of the caliph intrusted the execution of his own stratagem which inclined the long disputed balance in favor of the Saracens Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency of numbers a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in the heavens On both sides they retired with fainting steps their horses were unbridled their armor was laid aside and the hostile nations prepared or seemed to prepare for the refreshment of the evening and the encounter of the ensuing day On a sudden the charge was sounded the Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised assaulted overturned by new squadrons of the faithful who to the eye of fanaticism might appear as a band of angels descending from the sky The praefect himself was slain by the hand of Zobeir his daughter who sought revenge and death was surrounded and made prisoner and the fugitives involved in their disaster the town of Sufetula to which they escaped from the sabres and lances of the Arabs Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty miles to the south of Carthage a gentle declivity is watered by a running stream and shaded by a grove of juniper trees and in the ruins of a triumpha arch a portico and three temples of the Corinthian order curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the Romans one hundred forty three After the fall of this opulent city the provincials and Barbarians implored on all sides the mercy of the conqueror His vanity or his zeal might be flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith but his losses his fatigues and the progress of an epidemical disease prevented a solid establishment and the Saracens after a campaign of fifteen months retreated to the confines of Egypt with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition The caliph s fifth was granted to a favorite on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold one hundred forty four but the state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction if each foot soldier had shared one thousand and each horseman three thousand pieces in the real division of the plunder The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most precious reward of the victory from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in the battle till the tears and exclamations of the praefect s daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valor and modesty of that gallant soldier The unfortunate virgin was offered and almost rejected as a slave by her father s murderer who coolly declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion and that he labored for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty or the riches of this transitory life A reward congenial to his temper was the honorable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the success of his arms The companions the chiefs and the people were assembled in the mosch of Medina to hear the interesting narrative of

Heraclius had been informed of the tribute which they had been compelled to stipulate with the Arabs but instead of being moved to pity and relieve their distress they imposed as an equivalent or a fine a second tribute of a similar amount The ears of the zantine ministers were shut against the complaints of their poverty and ruin their despair was reduced to prefer the dominion of a single master and the extortions of the patriarch of Carthage who was invested with civil and military power provoked the sectaries and even the Catholics of the Roman province to abjure the religion as well as the authority of their tyrants The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just renown subdued an important city defeated an army of thirty thousand Greeks swept away fourscore thousand captives

to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah The interior regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious armies and imaginary citadels In the warlike province of Zab or Numidia

irresistible terrors of the Oriental arms and as they possessed neither gold nor silver the richest spoil was the beauty of the female captives some of whom were afterward sold for a thousand pieces of gold The career though not the zeal of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean He spurred his horse into the waves and raising his eyes to heaven exclaimed with the tone of a fanatic Great God if my course were not stopped by this sea I would still go on to the unknown kingdoms of the West preaching the unity of thy holy name and putting to the sword the rebellious nations who

An ambitious chief who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general The insurgents had trusted to his discontent and revenge he disdained their offers and revealed their designs In the hour of danger the grateful Akbah unlocked his fetters and advised him to retire he chose to die under the banner of his rival Embracing as

savage state of independence and idolatry on the first retreat or misfortune of the Moslems The prudence of Akbah had proposed to found an Arabian colony in the heart of Africa a citadel that might curb the levity of the Barbarians a place of refuge to secure against the accidents of war the wealth and the families of the Saracens With this view and under the modest title of the station of a caravan he planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira In its present decay Cairoan one hundred fifty four still holds the second rank in the kingdom of Tunis from which it is distant about fifty miles to the south one hundred fifty five its inland situation twelve miles westward of the sea has protected the city from the Greek and Sicilian fleets When the wild beasts and serpents were extirpated when the forest or rather wilderness was cleared the vestiges of a Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain the vegetable food of Cairoan is brought from afar and the scarcity of springs constrains the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs a precarious supply of rain water These obstacles were subdued by the industry of Akbah he traced a circumference of three thousand and six hundred paces which he encompassed with a brick wall in the space of five years the governor s palace was surrounded with a sufficient number of private habitations a spacious mosque was supported by five hundred columns of granite porphyry and Numidian marble and Cairoan became the seat of learning as well as of empire But these were the glories of a later age the new colony was shaken by the successive defeats of Akbah and Zuheir and the western expeditions were again interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy The son of the valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years a

been alternately won and lost by the Saracens But the seacoast still remained in the hands of the Greeks the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications of Carthage and the number of its defenders was recruited by the fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli The arms of Hassan were bolder and more fortunate he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa and the mention of scaling ladders may justify the suspicion that he anticipated by a sudden assault the more tedious operations of a regular siege But the joy of the conquerors was soon disturbed by the appearance of the

In the interior provinces the Moors or Berbers one hundred sixty two so feeble under the first Cesars so formidable to the Byzantine princes maintained a disorderly resistance to the religion and power of the successors of Mahomet Under the standard of their queen Cahina the independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a prophetess they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to their own The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence of Africa the conquests of an age were lost in a single day and the Arabian chief overwhelmed by the torrent retired to the confines of Egypt and expected five years the promised succours of the caliph After the retreat of the Saracens the victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs and recommended a measure of strange and savage policy Our cities said she and the gold and silver which they contain perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs These vile metals are not the objects of OUR ambition we content ourselves with the simple productions of the earth Let us destroy these cities let us bury in their ruins those pernicious treasures and when the avarice of our foes shall be destitute of temptation perhaps they will cease to disturb the tranquillity of a warlike people The proposal was accepted with unanimous applause

and Asiatics might probably use a common idiom the imitative sound of Barbar was applied to the ruder tribes whose pronunciation was most harsh whose grammar was most defective two From the time at least of Herodotus it was extended to all the nations who were strangers to the language and manners of the Greeks three In the age of Plautus the Romans submitted to the insult Pompeius Festus l ii p forty eight edit Dacier and freely gave themselves the name of Barbarians They insensibly claimed an exemption for Italy and her subject provinces and at length removed the disgraceful appellation to the savage or hostile nations beyond the pale of the empire four In every sense it was due to the Moors the familiar word was borrowed from the Latin Provincials by the Arabian conquerors and has justly settled as a local denomination Barbary along the northern coast of Africa Such is the tale of the modern Arabians Yet I strongly suspect that their ignorance of antiquity the love of the marvellous and the fashion of extolling the philosophy of Barbarians has induced them to describe as one voluntary act the calamities of three hundred years since the first fury of the Donatists and Vandals In the progress of the revolt Cahina had most probably contributed her share of destruction and the alarm of universal ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly yielded to her unworthy yoke They no longer hoped perhaps they no longer wished the return of their Byzantine sovereigns their present servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and justice and the most zealous Catholic must prefer the imperfect truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of the province the friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle which overturned the baseless fabric of her superstition and empire The same spirit revived under the successor of Hassan it was finally quelled by the activity of Musa and his two sons but the number of the rebels may be presumed from that of three hundred thousand captives sixty thousand of whom the caliph s fifth were sold for the profit of thee public treasury Thirty thousand of the Barbarian youth were enlisted in the troops and the pious labours of Musa to inculcate the knowledge and practice of the Koran accustomed the Africans to obey the apostle of God and the commander of the faithful In their climate and government their diet and habitation the wandering Moors resembled the Bedoweens of the desert With the religion they were proud to adopt the language name and origin of Arabs the blood of the strangers and natives was insensibly mingled and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic the same nation might seem to be diffused over the sandy plains of Asia and Africa Yet I will not deny that fifty thousand tents of pure Arabians might be transported over the Nile and scattered through the Lybian desert and I am not ignorant that five of the Moorish tribes still retain their barbarous idiom with the appellation and character of white Africans one

the coast of Andalusia one hundred sixty six nor had they forgotten the relief of Carthage by the Gothic succours In that age as well as in the present the kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta one of the columns of Hercules which is divided by a narrow strait from the opposite pillar or point of Europe A small portion of Mauritania was still wanting to the African conquest but Musa in the pride of victory was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta by the vigilance and courage of count Julian the general of the Goths From his disappointment and perplexity Musa was relieved by

history lived five hundred years after the conquest of the Arabs and the more early accounts are comprised in some meagre lines of the blind chronicles of Isidore of Badajoz Pacensis and of Alphonso III king of Leon which I have seen only in the Annals of Pagi If we inquire into the cause of this treachery the Spaniards will repeat the popular story of his daughter Cava one hundred sixty eight of a virgin who was seduced or ravished by her sovereign of a father who sacrificed his religion and country to the thirst of revenge The passions of princes have often been licentious and destructive but this well known tale romantic in itself is indifferently supported by external evidence and the history of Spain will suggest some motives of interest and policy more congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman one hundred sixty nine After the decease or deposition of Witiza his two sons were supplanted by the ambition of Roderic a noble Goth whose father the duke or governor of a province had fallen a victim to the preceding tyranny The monarchy was still elective but the sons of Witiza educated on the steps of the throne were impatient of a private station Their resentment was the more dangerous as it was varnished with the dissimulation of courts their followers were excited by the remembrance of favours and the promise of a revolution and their uncle Oppas archbishop of Toledo and Seville was the first person in the church and the second in the state It is probable that Julian was involved in the disgrace of the unsuccessful faction that he had little to hope and much to fear from the new reign and that the imprudent king could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his family had sustained The merit and influence of the count rendered him a useful or formidable subject his estates were ample his followers bold and numerous and it was too fatally shown that by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands he held in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy Too feeble however to meet his sovereign in arms he sought the aid of a foreign power and his rash invitation of the Moors and Arabs produced the calamities of eight hundred years In his epistles or in a personal interview he revealed the wealth and nakedness of his country the weakness of an unpopular prince the degeneracy of an effeminate people The Goths were no longer the

commander of the faithful and his messenger returned with the permission of Walid to annex the unknown kingdoms of the West to the religion and throne of the caliphs In his residence of Tangier Musa

the rock of Gibraltar to the bay of Biscay The failure of land compelled him to retreat and he was recalled to Toledo to excuse his presumption of subduing a kingdom in the absence of his general Spain which in a more savage and disorderly state had resisted two hundred years the arms of the Romans was overrun in a few months by those of the Saracens and such was the eagerness of submission and treaty that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the only chief who fell without conditions a prisoner into their hands The cause of the Goths had been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres and in the national dismay each part of the monarchy declined a contest with the antagonist who had vanquished the united strength of the whole one hundred eighty one That strength had been wasted by two successive seasons of famine and pestilence and the governors who were impatient to surrender might exaggerate the difficulty of collecting the provisions of a siege To disarm the Christians superstition likewise contributed her terrors and the subtle Arab encouraged the report of dreams omens and prophecies and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of Spain that were discovered on

Etats de l Europe p one hundred fifty nine Chapter LI Conquests By The Arabs Part VII On the intelligence of this rapid success the applause of Musa degenerated into envy and he began not to complain but to fear that Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue At the head of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africans he passed over in person from Mauritania to Spain the first of his companions were the noblest of the Koreish his eldest son was left in the command of Africa the three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to second the boldest enterprises of their father At his landing in Algezire he was respectfully entertained by Count Julian who stifled his inward remorse and testified both in words and actions that the victory of the Arabs had not impaired his attachment to their cause Some enemies yet remained for the sword of Musa The tardy repentance of the Goths had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders the cities from which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as impregnable and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of Seville and Merida They were successively besieged and reduced by the labor of Musa who transported his camp from the Boetis to the Anas from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana When he beheld the works of Roman magnificence the bridge the aqueducts the triumphal arches and the theatre of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania I should imagine said he to his four companions that the human race must have united their art and power in the foundation of this city happy is the man who shall become its master He aspired to that happiness but the Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent from the veteran legionaries of Augustus one hundred eighty three Disdaining the confinement of their walls they gave battle to the Arabs on the plain but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry or a ruin chastised their indiscretion and intercepted their return The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long and the castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the losses of the Moslems The constancy of the besieged was at length subdued by famine and despair and the prudent victor disguised his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed the churches were divided between the two religions and the wealth of those who had fallen in the siege or retired to Gallicia was confiscated as the reward of the faithful In the midway between Merida and Toledo the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the caliph and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic kings Their first interview was cold and formal a rigid account was exacted of the treasures of Spain the character of Tarik was exposed to suspicion and obloquy and the hero was imprisoned reviled and ignominiously scourged by the hand or the command of Musa Yet so strict was the discipline so pure the zeal or so tame the spirit of the primitive Moslems that after this public indignity Tarik could serve and be trusted in the reduction of the Tarragonest province A mosch was erected at Saragossa by the liberality of the Koreish the port of Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria and the Goths were pursued beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania or Languedoc one hundred eighty four In the church of saint Mary at Carcassone Musa found but it is improbable that he left seven equestrian statues of massy silver and from his term or column of Narbonne he returned on his footsteps to the Gallician and Lusitanian shores of the ocean During the absence of the father his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents of Seville and reduced from Malaga to Valentia the sea coast of the Mediterranean his original treaty with the discreet and valiant Theodemir one hundred eighty five will represent the manners and policy of the times The conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz the son of Musa the son of Nassir and Theodemir prince of the Goths In the name of the most merciful God Abdelaziz makes peace on these conditions that Theodemir shall not be disturbed in his principality nor any injury be offered to the life or property the wives and children the religion and temples of the Christians that Theodemir shall freely deliver his seven eighteen fifty one cities Orihuela Valentola Alicanti Mola Vacasora Bigerra now Bejar Ora or Opta and Lorca that he shall not assist or

the year of the Hegira ninety four and subscribed with the names of four Mussulman witnesses one hundred eighty six Theodemir and his subjects were treated with uncommon lenity but the rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth according to the submission or obstinacy of the Christians one hundred eighty seven In this revolution many partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or religious passions of the enthusiasts some churches were profaned by the new worship some relics or images were confounded with idols the rebels were put to the sword and one town an obscure place between Cordova and Seville was razed to its foundations Yet if we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths or its recovery by the kings of Castile and Arragon we must applaud the moderation

have not the original before me it would confirm or destroy a dark suspicion that the piece has been forged to introduce the immunity of a neighboring convent The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life though he affected to disguise his age by coloring with a red powder the whiteness of his beard But in the love of action and glory his breast was still fired with the ardor of youth and the possession of Spain was considered only as the first step to the monarchy of Europe With a powerful armament by sea and land he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees to extinguish in Gaul and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards and to preach the unity of God on the altar of the Vatican From thence subduing the Barbarians of Germany he proposed to follow the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea to overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople and returning from Europe to Asia to unite his new acquisitions with Antioch and the provinces of Syria one hundred eighty eight But his vast enterprise perhaps of easy execution must have seemed extravagant to vulgar minds and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence and servitude The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services and wrongs at the court of Damascus the proceedings of Musa were blamed his intentions were suspected and his delay in complying with the first invitation was chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons An intrepid messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia and in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle of his horse His own loyalty or that of his troops inculcated the duty of obedience and his disgrace was alleviated by the recall of his rival and the permission of investing with his two governments his two sons Abdallah and Abdelaziz His long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus displayed the spoils of Africa and the treasures of Spain four hundred Gothic nobles with gold coronets and girdles were distinguished in his train and the number of male and female captives selected for their birth or beauty was computed at eighteen or even at thirty thousand persons As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine he was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph by a private message from Soliman his brother and presumptive heir who wished to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory Had Walid recovered the delay of Musa would have been criminal he pursued his march and found an enemy on the throne In his trial before a partial judge against a popular antagonist he was convicted of vanity and falsehood and a fine of two hundred thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved his rapaciousness The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indignity and the veteran commander after a public whipping stood a whole day in the sun before the palace gate till he obtained a decent exile under the pious name of a pilgrimage to Mecca The resentment of the caliph might have been satiated with the ruin of Musa but his fears demanded the extirpation of a potent and injured family A sentence of death was intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne both in Africa and Spain and the forms if not the substance of justice were superseded in this bloody execution In the mosch or palace of Cordova Abdelaziz was slain by the swords of the conspirators they accused their governor of claiming the honors of royalty and his scandalous marriage with Egilona the widow of Roderic offended the prejudices both of the Christians and Moslems By a refinement of cruelty the head of the son was presented to the father with an insulting question whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel I know his features he exclaimed with indignation I assert his innocence and I imprecate the same a juster fate against the authors of his death The age and despair of Musa raised him above the power of kings and he expired at Mecca of the anguish of a broken heart His rival was more favorably treated his services were forgiven and Tarik was permitted to mingle with the crowd of slaves one hundred eighty nine I am ignorant whether Count Julian was rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed though not from the hands of the Saracens but the tale of their ingratitude to the sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable evidence The two royal youths were reinstated in the private patrimony of their father but on the decease of Eba the elder his daughter was unjustly despoiled of her portion by the violence of her uncle Sigebut The Gothic maid pleaded her cause before the caliph Hashem and obtained the restitution of her inheritance but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian and their two sons Isaac and Ibrahim were received in Spain with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches Footnote one hundred eighty eight This design which is attested by several Arabian historians Cardonne tom i p ninety five ninety six may be compared with that of Mithridates to march from the Crimaea to Rome or with that of Caesar to conquer the East and return home by the North and all three are perhaps surpassed by the real and successful enterprise of Hannibal Footnote one hundred eighty nine I much regret our loss or my ignorance of two Arabic works of the viiith century a Life of Musa and a poem on the exploits of Tarik Of these authentic pieces the former was composed by a grandson of Musa who had escaped from the massacre of his kindred the latter by the vizier of the first Abdalrahman caliph of Spain who might have conversed with some of the veterans of the conqueror Bibliot Arabico Hispana tom ii p thirty six one hundred thirty nine A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the introduction of strangers and the imitative spirit of the natives and Spain which had been successively tinctured with Punic and Roman and Gothic blood imbibed in a few generations the name and manners of the Arabs The first conquerors and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs were attended by a numerous train of civil and military followers who preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home the private and public interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful colonies and the cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe or country of their Eastern progenitors The victorious though motley bands of Tarik and Musa asserted by the name of Spaniards their original claim of conquest yet they allowed their brethren of Egypt to share their establishments of Murcia and Lisbon The royal legion of Damascus was planted at Cordova that of Emesa at Seville that of Kinnisrin or Chalcis at Jaen that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina Sidonia The natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo and the inland country and the fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on ten thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak the children of the purest and most noble of the Arabian tribes one hundred ninety A spirit of emulation sometimes beneficial more frequently dangerous was nourished by these hereditary factions Ten years after the conquest a map of the province was presented to the caliph the seas the rivers and the harbors the inhabitants and cities the climate the soil and the mineral productions of the earth one hundred ninety one In the space of two centuries the gifts of nature were improved by the agriculture one hundred ninety two the manufactures and the commerce of an industrious people and the effects of their diligence have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy The first of the Ommiades who reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians and in his edict of peace and protection he contents himself with a modest imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold ten thousand pounds of silver ten thousand horses as many mules one thousand cuirasses with an equal number of helmets and lances one hundred ninety three The most powerful of his successors derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve millions and forty five thousand dinars or pieces of gold about six millions of sterling money one hundred ninety four a sum which in the tenth century most probably surpassed the united revenues of the Christians monarchs His royal seat of Cordova contained six hundred moschs nine hundred baths and two hundred thousand houses he gave laws to eighty cities of the first to three hundred of the second and third order and the fertile banks of the Guadalquivir were adorned with twelve thousand villages and hamlets The Arabs might exaggerate the truth but they created and they describe the most prosperous aera of the riches the cultivation and the

in the spoils of Grenada and Morocco Note Compare the valuable work of Conde Historia de la Dominacion de las Arabes en Espana Madrid eighteen twenty M The wars of the Moslems were sanctified by the prophet but among the various precepts and examples of his life the caliphs selected the lessons of toleration that might tend to disarm the resistance of the unbelievers Arabia was the temple and patrimony of the God of Mahomet but he beheld with less jealousy and affection the nations of the earth The polytheists and idolaters who were ignorant of his name might be lawfully extirpated by his votaries one hundred ninety six but a wise policy supplied the obligation of justice and after some acts of intolerant zeal the Mahometan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the pagods of that devout and populous country The disciples of Abraham of Moses and of Jesus were solemnly invited to accept the more perfect revelation of Mahomet but if they preferred the payment of a moderate tribute they were entitled to the freedom of conscience and religious worship one hundred ninety seven In a field of battle the forfeit lives of the prisoners were redeemed by the profession of Islam the females were bound to embrace the religion of their masters and a race of sincere proselytes was gradually multiplied by the education of the infant captives But the millions of African and Asiatic converts who swelled the native band of the faithful Arabs must have been allured rather than constrained to declare their belief in one God and the apostle of God By the repetition of a sentence and the loss of a foreskin the subject or the slave the captive or the criminal arose in a moment the free and equal companion of the victorious Moslems Every sin was expiated every engagement was dissolved the vow of celibacy was superseded by the indulgence of nature the active spirits who slept in the cloister were awakened by the trumpet of the Saracens and in the convulsion of the world every member of a new society ascended to the natural level of his capacity and courage The minds of the multitude were tempted by the invisible as well as temporal blessings of the Arabian prophet and charity will hope that many of his proselytes entertained a serious conviction of the truth and sanctity of his revelation In the eyes of an inquisitive polytheist it must appear worthy of the human and the divine nature More pure than the system of Zoroaster more liberal than the law of Moses the religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason than the creed of mystery and superstition which in the seventh century disgraced the simplicity of the gospel Footnote one hundred ninety six The Harbii as they are styled qui tolerari nequeunt are one Those who besides God worship the sun moon or

Hottinger Hist Orient p one hundred seven one hundred eight In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa the national religion has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith The ambiguous theology of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the East but the profane writings of Zoroaster one hundred ninety eight might under the reverend name of Abraham be dexterously connected with the chain of divine revelation Their evil principle the daemon Ahriman might be represented as the rival or as the creature of the God of light The temples of Persia were devoid of images but the worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a gross and criminal idolatry one hundred ninety nine The milder sentiment was consecrated by the practice of Mahomet two hundred and the prudence of the caliphs the Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians among the people of the written law two hundred one and as late as the third century of the Hegira the city of Herat will afford a lively contrast of private zeal and public toleration two hundred two Under the payment of an annual tribute the Mahometan law secured to the Ghebers of Herat their civil and religious liberties but the recent and humble mosch was overshadowed by the antique splendor of the adjoining temple of fire A fanatic Iman deplored in his sermons the scandalous neighborhood and accused the weakness or indifference of the faithful Excited by his voice the people assembled in tumult the two houses of prayer were consumed by the flames but the vacant ground was immediately occupied by the foundations of a new mosch The injured Magi appealed to the sovereign of Chorasan he promised justice and relief when behold four thousand citizens of Herat of a grave character and mature age unanimously swore that the idolatrous fane had never existed the inquisition was silenced and their conscience was satisfied says the historian Mirchond two hundred three with this holy and meritorious perjury two hundred four But the greatest part of the temples of Persia were ruined by the insensible and general desertion of their votaries It was insensible since it is not accompanied with any memorial of time or place of persecution or resistance It was general since the whole realm from Shiraz to Samarcand imbibed the faith of the Koran and the preservation of the native tongue reveals the descent of the Mahometans of Persia two hundred five In the mountains and deserts an obstinate race of unbelievers adhered to the superstition of their fathers and a faint tradition of the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of Kirman along the banks of the Indus among the exiles of Surat and in the colony which in the last century was planted by Shaw Abbas at the gates of Ispahan The chief pontiff has retired to Mount Elbourz eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd the perpetual fire if it continues to burn is inaccessible to the profane but his residence is the school the oracle and the pilgrimage of the Ghebers whose hard and uniform features attest the unmingled purity of their blood Under the jurisdiction of their elders eighty thousand families maintain an innocent and industrious life their subsistence is derived from some curious manufactures and mechanic trades and they cultivate the earth with the fervor of a religious duty Their ignorance withstood the despotism of Shaw Abbas who demanded with threats and tortures the prophetic books of Zoroaster and this obscure remnant of the Magians is spared by the moderation or contempt of their present sovereigns two hundred six Footnote one hundred ninety eight The Zend or Pazend the bible of the Ghebers is reckoned by themselves or at least by the Mahometans among the ten books which Abraham

had been taught by Carthage and Rome were involved in a cloud of ignorance the doctrine of Cyprian and Augustin was no longer studied Five hundred episcopal churches were overturned by the hostile fury of the Donatists the Vandals and the Moors The zeal and numbers of the clergy declined and the people without discipline or knowledge or hope submissively sunk under the yoke of the Arabian prophet Within fifty years after the expulsion of the Greeks a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the tribute of the infidels was abolished by their conversion two hundred seven and though he sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion his specious pretence was drawn from the rapid and extensive progress of the Mahometan faith In the next age an extraordinary mission of five bishops was detached from Alexandria to Cairoan They were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch to cherish and revive the dying embers of Christianity two hundred eight but the interposition of a foreign prelate a stranger to the Latins an enemy to the Catholics supposes the decay and dissolution of the African hierarchy It was no longer the time when the successor of saint Cyprian at the head of a numerous synod could maintain an equal contest with the ambition of the Roman pontiff In the eleventh century the unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of Carthage implored the arms and the protection of the Vatican and he bitterly complains that his naked body had been scourged by the Saracens and that his authority was disputed by the four suffragans the tottering pillars of his throne Two epistles of Gregory the Seventh two hundred nine are destined to soothe the distress of the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish prince The pope assures the sultan that they both worship the same God and may hope to meet in the bosom of Abraham but the complaint that three bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a brother announces the speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order The Christians of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to the practice of circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine and pork and the name of Mozarabes two hundred ten adoptive Arabs was applied to their civil or religious conformity two hundred eleven About the middle of the twelfth century the worship of Christ and the succession of pastors were abolished along the coast of Barbary and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville of Valencia and Grenada two hundred twelve The throne of the Almohades or Unitarians was founded on the blindest fanaticism and their extraordinary rigor might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and intolerant zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille of Arragon and Portugal The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived by the papal

After the revolution of eleven centuries the Jews and Christians of the Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was granted by the Arabian caliphs During the first age of the conquest they suspected the loyalty of the Catholics whose name of Melchites betrayed their secret attachment to the Greek emperor while the Nestorians and Jacobites his inveterate enemies approved themselves

bells or of psalmody is interdicted in their worship a decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their sermons and conversations and the sacrilegious attempt to enter a mosch or to seduce a Mussulman will not be suffered to escape with impunity In a time however of tranquillity and justice the Christians have never been compelled to renounce the Gospel or to embrace the Koran but the

church the votes of a senate or the memory of a free constitution The authority of the companions of Mahomet expired with their lives and the chiefs or emirs of the Arabian tribes left behind in the desert the spirit of equality and independence The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in the successors of Mahomet and if the Koran was the rule of their actions they were the supreme judges and interpreters of that divine book They reigned by the right of conquest over the nations of the East to whom the name of liberty was unknown and who were accustomed to applaud in their tyrants the acts of violence and severity that were exercised at their own expense Under the last of the Ommiades the Arabian empire extended two hundred days journey from east to west from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean And if we retrench the sleeve of the robe as it is styled by their writers the long and narrow province of Africa the solid and compact dominion

Of The Caliphs Defeats And Victories Of The Greek Emperors When the Arabs first issued from the desert they must have been surprised at the ease and rapidity of their own success But when they advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the Indus and the summit of the Pyrenees when they had repeatedly tried the edge of their cimeters and the energy of their faith they might be equally astonished that any nation could resist their invincible arms that any boundary should confine the dominion of the successor of the prophet The confidence of soldiers and fanatics may indeed be excused since the calm historian of the present hour who strives to follow the rapid course of the Saracens must study to explain by what means the church and state were saved from this impending and as it should seem from this inevitable danger The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia might be guarded by their extent their climate their poverty and the courage of the northern shepherds China was remote and inaccessible but the greatest part of the temperate zone was subject to the Mahometan conquerors the Greeks were exhausted by the calamities of war and the loss of their fairest provinces and the Barbarians of Europe might justly tremble at the precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy In this inquiry I shall unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain and our neighbors of Gaul from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran that protected the majesty of Rome and delayed the servitude of Constantinople that invigorated the defence of the Christians and scattered among their enemies the seeds of division and decay Forty six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca his disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople one They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the prophet that to the first army which besieged the city of the Caesars their sins were forgiven the long series of Roman triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of New Rome and the wealth of nations was deposited in this well chosen seat of royalty and commerce No sooner had the caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his throne than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood by the success and glory of this holy expedition two his preparations by sea and land were adequate to the importance of the object his standard was intrusted to Sophian a veteran warrior but the troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid the son and presumptive heir of the commander of the faithful The Greeks had little to hope nor had their enemies any reason of fear from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor who disgraced the name of Constantine and imitated only the inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius Without delay or opposition the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the unguarded channel of the Hellespont which even now under the feeble and disorderly government of the Turks is maintained as the natural bulwark of the capital three The Arabian fleet cast anchor and the troops were disembarked near the palace of Hebdomon seven miles from the city During many days from the dawn of light to the evening the line of assault was extended from the golden gate to the eastern promontory and the foremost warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeeding columns But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of the strength and resources of Constantinople The solid and lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline the spirit of the Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and empire the fugitives from the conquered provinces more successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria and the Saracens were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire This firm and effectual resistance diverted their arms to the more easy attempt of plundering the European and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis and after keeping the sea from the month of April to that of September on the approach of winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital to the Isle of Cyzicus in which they had established their magazine of spoil and provisions So patient was their perseverance or so languid were their operations that they repeated in the six following summers the same attack and retreat with a gradual abatement of hope and vigor till the mischances of shipwreck and disease of the sword and of fire compelled them to relinquish the fruitless enterprise They might bewail the loss or commemorate the martyrdom of thirty thousand Moslems who fell in the siege of Constantinople and the solemn funeral of Abu Ayub or Job excited the curiosity of the Christians themselves That venerable Arab one of the last of the companions of Mahomet was numbered among the ansars or auxiliaries of Medina who sheltered the head of the flying prophet In his youth he fought at Beder and Ohud under the holy standard in his mature age he was the friend and follower of Ali and the last remnant of his strength and life was consumed in a distant and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran His memory was revered but the place of his burial was neglected and unknown during a period of seven hundred and eighty years till the conquest of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second A seasonable vision for such are the manufacture of every religion revealed the holy spot at the foot of the walls and the bottom of the harbor and the mosch of Ayub has been deservedly chosen for the simple and martial

Damascus a general council of the emirs or Koreish a peace or truce of thirty years was ratified between the two empires and the stipulation of an annual tribute fifty horses of a noble breed fifty slaves and three thousand pieces of gold degraded the majesty of the commander of the faithful five The aged caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions and ending his days in tranquillity and repose while the Moors and Indians trembled at his name his palace and city of Damascus was insulted by the Mardaites or Maronites of Mount Libanus the firmest barrier of the empire till they were disarmed and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks six After the revolt of Arabia and Persia the house of Ommiyah was reduced to the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt their distress and fear enforced their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians and the tribute was increased to a slave a horse and a thousand pieces of gold for each of the three hundred and sixty five days of the solar year But as soon as the empire was again united by the arms and policy of Abdalmalek he disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride he discontinued the payment of the tribute and the resentment of the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the second Justinian the just rebellion of his subjects and the frequent change of his antagonists and successors Till the reign of Abdalmalek the Saracens had been content with the free possession of the Persian and Roman treasures in the coins of Chosroes and Caesar By the command of that caliph a national mint was established both for silver and gold and the inscription of the Dinar though it might be censured by some timorous casuists proclaimed the unity of the God of Mahomet eight Under the reign of the caliph Walid the Greek language and characters were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue nine If this change was productive of the invention or

inscriptions Some of these exist in different collections We learn from Makrizi an Arabian author of great learning and judgment that in the year eighteen of the Hegira under the caliphate of Omar the Arabs had coined money of this description The same author informs us that the caliph Abdalmalek caused coins to be struck representing himself with a sword by his side These types so contrary to the notions of the Arabs were disapproved by the most influential persons of the time and the caliph substituted for them after the year seventy six of the Hegira the Mahometan coins with which we are

idle on the throne of Damascus whilst his lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and Spain a third army of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia Minor and approached the borders of the Byzantine capital But the attempt and disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his brother Soliman whose ambition appears to have been quickened by a more active and martial spirit In the revolutions of the Greek empire after the tyrant Justinian had been punished and avenged an humble secretary Anastasius or Artemius was promoted by chance or merit to the vacant purple He was alarmed by the sound of war and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the tremendous news that the Saracens were preparing an armament by sea and land such as would transcend the experience of the past or the belief of the present age The precautions of Anastasius were not unworthy of his station or of the impending danger He issued a peremptory mandate that all persons who were not provided with the means of subsistence for a three years siege should evacuate the city the public granaries and arsenals were abundantly replenished the walls were restored and strengthened and the engines for casting stones or darts or fire were stationed along the ramparts or in the brigantines of war of which an additional number was hastily constructed To prevent is safer as well as more honorable than to repel an attack and a design was meditated above the usual spirit of the Greeks of burning the naval stores of the enemy the cypress timber that had been hewn in Mount Libanus and was piled along the sea shore of Phoenicia for the service of the Egyptian fleet This generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of the troops who in the new language of the empire were styled of the Obsequian Theme eleven They murdered their chief deserted their standard in the Isle of Rhodes dispersed themselves over the adjacent continent and deserved pardon or reward by investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue The name of Theodosius might recommend him to the senate and people but after some months he sunk into a cloister and resigned to the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian the urgent defence of the capital and empire The most formidable of the Saracens Moslemah the brother of the caliph was advancing at the head of one hundred and twenty thousand Arabs and Persians the greater part mounted on horses or camels and the successful sieges of Tyana Amorium and Pergamus were of sufficient duration to exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes At the well known passage of Abydus on the Hellespont the Mahometan arms were transported for the first time eleven eleven from Asia to Europe From thence wheeling round the Thracian cities of the Propontis Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart prepared and planted his engines of assault and declared by words and actions a patient resolution of expecting the return of seed time and harvest should the obstinacy of the besieged prove equal to his own eleven twelve The Greeks would gladly have ransomed their religion and empire by a fine or assessment of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city but the liberal offer was rejected with disdain and the presumption of Moslemah was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the natives of Egypt and Syria They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred ships the number betrays their inconsiderable size and of the twenty stout and capacious vessels whose magnitude impeded their progress each was manned with no more than one hundred heavy armed soldiers This huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea and with a gentle gale towards the mouth of the Bosphorus the surface of the strait was overshadowed in the language of the Greeks with a moving forest and the same fatal night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault by sea and land To allure the confidence of the enemy the emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbor but while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity or apprehend the snare the ministers of destruction were at hand The fire ships of the Greeks were launched against them the Arabs their arms and vessels were involved in the same flames the disorderly fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet that had threatened to extirpate the Roman name A still more fatal and irreparable loss was that of the caliph Soliman who died of an indigestion twelve in his camp near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria as he was preparing to lead against Constantinople the remaining forces of the East The brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy and the throne of an active and able prince was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot twelve eleven While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind conscience the siege was continued through the winter by the neglect rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar thirteen The winter proved uncommonly rigorous above a hundred days the ground was covered with deep snow and the natives of the sultry climes of Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp They revived on the return of spring a second effort had been made in their favor and their distress was relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets laden with corn and arms and soldiers the first from Alexandria of four hundred transports and galleys the second of three hundred and sixty vessels from the ports of Africa But the Greek fires were again kindled and if the destruction was less complete it was owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at a safe distance or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners who deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians The trade and navigation of the capital were restored and the produce of the fisheries supplied the wants and even the luxury of the inhabitants But the calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah and as the former was miserably assuaged so the latter was dreadfully propagated by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from the most unclean or unnatural food The spirit of conquest and even of enthusiasm was extinct the Saracens could no longer struggle beyond their lines either single or in small parties without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the Thracian peasants An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts and promises of Leo and these savage auxiliaries made some atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire by the defeat and slaughter of twenty two thousand Asiatics A report was dexterously scattered that the Franks the unknown nations of the Latin world were arming by sea and land in the defence of the Christian cause and their formidable aid was expected with far different sensations in the camp and city At length after a siege of thirteen months fourteen the hopeless Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of retreat fourteen eleven The march of the Arabian cavalry over the Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia was executed without delay or molestation but an army of their brethren had been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia and the remains of the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tempest and fire that only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate the tale of their various and almost incredible disasters fifteen Footnote eleven In the division of the Themes or provinces described by Constantine Porphyrogenitus de

The important secret of compounding and directing this artificial flame was imparted by Callinicus a native of Heliopolis in Syria who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the emperor seventeen The skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succor of fleets and armies and this discovery or improvement of the military art was fortunately reserved for the distressful period when the degenerate Romans of the East were incapable of contending with the warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigor of the Saracens The historian who presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides so prone to the marvellous so careless and in this instance so jealous of the truth From their obscure and perhaps fallacious hints it should seem that the principal ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha eighteen or liquid bitumen a light tenacious and inflammable oil nineteen which springs from the earth and catches fire as soon as it comes in contact with the air The naphtha was mingled I know not by what methods or in what proportions with sulphur and with the pitch that is extracted from evergreen firs twenty From this mixture which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame which not only rose in perpendicular ascent but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or lateral progress instead of being extinguished it was nourished and quickened by the element of water and sand urine or vinegar were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this powerful agent which was justly denominated by the Greeks the liquid or the maritime fire For the annoyance of the enemy it was employed with equal effect by sea and land in battles or in sieges It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers or launched in red hot balls of stone and iron or darted in arrows and javelins twisted round with flax and tow which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil sometimes it was deposited in fire ships the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which were planted on the prow of a galley and fancifully shaped into the mouths of savage monsters that seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming fire This important art was preserved at Constantinople as the palladium of the state the galleys and artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome but the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most jealous scruple and the terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged by their ignorance and surprise In the treaties of the administration of the empire the royal author twenty one suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians They should be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines with a sacred injunction that this gift of Heaven this peculiar blessing of the Romans should never be communicated to any foreign nation that the prince and the subject were alike bound to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties of treason and sacrilege and that the impious attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the Christians By these precautions the secret was confined above four hundred years to the Romans of the East and at the end of the eleventh century the Pisans to whom every sea and every art were familiar suffered the effects without understanding the composition of the Greek fire It was at length either discovered or stolen by the Mahometans and in the holy wars of Syria and Egypt they retorted an invention contrived against themselves on the heads of the Christians A knight who despised the swords and lances of the Saracens relates with heartfelt sincerity his own fears and those of his companions at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged a torrent of the Greek fire the feu Gregeois as it is styled by the more early of the French writers It came flying through the air says Joinville twenty two like a winged long tailed dragon about the thickness of a hogshead with the report of thunder and the velocity of lightning and the darkness of the night was dispelled by this deadly illumination The use of the Greek or as it might now be called of the Saracen fire was continued to the middle of the fourteenth century twenty three when the scientific or casual compound of nitre sulphur and charcoal effected a new revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind twenty four Footnote sixteen Our sure and indefatigable guide in the middle ages and Byzantine history Charles du Fresne

these insatiate fanatics The descendants of Clovis had lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious spirit and their misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet of lazy to the last kings of the Merovingian race twenty six They ascended the throne without power and sunk into the grave without a name A country palace in the neighborhood of Compiegne twenty seven was allotted for their residence or prison but each year in the month of March or May they were conducted in a wagon drawn by oxen to the assembly of the Franks to give audience to foreign ambassadors and to ratify the acts of the mayor of the palace That domestic officer was become the minister of the nation and the master of the prince A public employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family the elder Pepin left a king of mature years under the guardianship of his own widow and her child and these feeble regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his bastards A government half savage and half corrupt was almost dissolved and the tributary dukes and provincial counts and the territorial lords were tempted to despise the weakness of the monarch and to imitate the ambition of the mayor Among these independent chiefs one of the boldest and most successful was Eudes duke of Aquitain who in the southern provinces of Gaul usurped the authority and even the title of king The Goths the Gascons and the Franks assembled under the standard of this Christian hero he repelled the first invasion of the Saracens and Zama lieutenant of the caliph lost his army and his life under the walls of Thoulouse The ambition of his successors was stimulated by revenge they repassed the Pyrenees with the means and the resolution of conquest The advantageous situation which had recommended Narbonne twenty eight as the first Roman colony was again chosen by the Moslems they claimed the province of Septimania or Languedoc as a just dependence of the Spanish monarchy the vineyards of

places of the known world D Anville Notice de l Ancienne Gaule p four hundred seventy three But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalraman or Abderame who had been restored by the caliph Hashem to the wishes of the soldiers and people of Spain That veteran and daring commander adjudged to the obedience of the prophet whatever yet remained of France or of Europe and prepared to execute the sentence at the head of a formidable host in the full confidence of surmounting all opposition either of nature or of man His first care was to suppress a domestic rebel who commanded the most important passes of the Pyrenees Manuza a Moorish chief had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain and Eudes from a motive of private or public interest devoted his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African misbeliever But the strongest fortresses of Cerdagne were invested by a superior force the rebel was overtaken and slain in the mountains and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus to gratify the desires or more probably the vanity of the commander of the faithful From the Pyrenees Abderame proceeded without delay to the passage of the Rhone and the siege of Arles An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century and many thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean Sea The arms of Abderame were not less successful on the side of the ocean He passed without opposition the Garonne and Dordogne which unite their waters in the Gulf of Bourdeaux but he found beyond those rivers the camp of the intrepid Eudes who had formed a second army and sustained a second defeat so fatal to the Christians that according to their sad confession God alone could reckon the number of the slain The victorious Saracen overran the provinces of Aquitain whose Gallic names are disguised rather than lost in the modern appellations of Perigord Saintonge and Poitou his standards were planted on the walls or at least before the gates of Tours and of Sens and his detachments overspread the kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well known cities of Lyons and Besancon The memory of these devastations for Abderame did not spare the country or the people was long preserved by tradition and the invasion of France by the Moors or Mahometans affords the groundwork of those fables which have been so wildly disfigured in the romances of chivalry and so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse In the decline of society and art the deserted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames and the tutelar saints both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres twenty nine A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet thirty Footnote twenty nine With regard to the sanctuary of saint Martin of Tours Roderic Ximenes accuses the Saracens of the deed Turonis civitatem ecclesiam et palatia vastatione et incendio simili diruit et consumpsit The continuator of Fredegarius imputes to them no more than the intention Ad domum beatissimi Martini evertendam destinant At Carolus c The French annalist was more jealous of the honor of the saint Footnote thirty Yet I sincerely doubt whether the Oxford mosch would have produced a volume of controversy so elegant and ingenious as the sermons lately preached by mister White the Arabic professor at mister Bampton s lecture His observations on the character and religion of Mahomet are always adapted to his argument and generally founded in truth and reason He sustains the part of a lively and eloquent advocate and sometimes rises to the merit of an historian and philosopher From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and fortune of one man Charles the illegitimate son of the elder Pepin was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the Franks but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings In a laborious administration of twenty four years he restored and supported the dignity of the throne and the rebels of Germany and Gaul were successively crushed by the activity of a warrior who in the same campaign could display his banner on the Elbe the Rhone and the shores of the ocean In the public danger he was summoned by the voice of his country and his rival the duke of Aquitain was reduced to appear among the fugitives and suppliants Alas exclaimed the Franks what a misfortune what an indignity We have long heard of the name and conquests of the Arabs we were apprehensive of their attack from the East they have now conquered Spain and invade our country on the side of the West Yet their numbers and since they have no buckler their arms are inferior to our own If you follow my advice replied the prudent mayor of the palace you will not interrupt their march nor precipitate your attack They are like a torrent which it is dangerous to stem in its career The thirst of riches and the consciousness of success redouble their valor and valor is of more avail than arms or numbers Be patient till they have loaded themselves with the encumbrance of wealth The possession of wealth will divide their councils and assure your victory This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement of the Arabian writers and the situation of Charles will suggest a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination the secret desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the rebel duke of Aquitain It is yet more probable that the delays of Charles were inevitable and reluctant A standing army was unknown under the first and second race more than half the kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens according to their respective situation the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were to conscious or too careless of the impending danger and the voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a long interval from the standard of the Christian general No sooner had he collected his forces than he sought and found the enemy in the centre of France between Tours and Poitiers His well conducted march was covered with a range of hills and Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected presence The nations of Asia Africa and Europe advanced with equal ardor to an encounter which would change the history of the world In the six first days of desultory combat the horsemen and archers of the East maintained their advantage but in the closer onset of the seventh day the Orientals were oppressed by the strength and stature of the Germans who with stout hearts and iron hands thirty one asserted the civil and religious freedom of their posterity The epithet of Martel the Hammer which has been added to the name of Charles is expressive of his weighty and irresistible strokes the valor of Eudes was excited by resentment and emulation and their companions in the eye of history are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry After a bloody field in which Abderame was slain the Saracens in the close of the evening retired to their camp In the disorder and despair of the night the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus of Africa and Spain were provoked to turn their arms against each other the remains of their host were suddenly dissolved and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and separate retreat At the dawn of the day the stillness of a hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians on the report of their spies they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents but if we except some celebrated relics a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic world and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty or three hundred and seventy five thousand of the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles thirty two while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the field of Tours But this incredible tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French general who apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit and dismissed his German allies to their native forests The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and blood and the most cruel execution is inflicted not in the ranks of battle but on the backs of a flying enemy Yet the victory of the Franks was complete and final Aquitain was recovered by the arms of Eudes the Arabs never resumed the conquest of Gaul and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martel and his valiant race thirty three It might have been expected that the savior of Christendom would have been canonized or at least applauded by the gratitude of the clergy who are indebted to his sword for their present existence But in the public distress the mayor of the palace had been compelled to apply the riches or at least the revenues of the bishops and abbots to the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers His merits were forgotten his sacrilege alone was remembered and in an epistle to a Carlovingian prince a Gallic synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned that on the opening of his tomb the spectators were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon and that a saint of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the soul and body of Charles Martel burning to all eternity in the abyss of hell thirty four Footnote thirty one Gens Austriae membrorum pre eminentia

one Fleury Hist Eccles tom x p five hundred fourteen five hundred sixteen Yet Baronius himself and the French critics reject with contempt this episcopal fiction The loss of an army or a province in the Western world was less painful to the court of Damascus than the rise and progress of a domestic competitor Except among the Syrians the caliphs of the house of Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public favor The life of Mahomet recorded their perseverance in idolatry and rebellion their conversion had been reluctant their elevation irregular and factious and their throne was cemented with the most holy and noble blood of Arabia The best of their race the pious Omar was dissatisfied with his own title their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a departure from the order of succession and the eyes and wishes of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem and the kindred of the apostle of God Of these the Fatimites were either rash or pusillanimous but the descendants of Abbas cherished with courage and discretion the hopes of their rising fortunes From an obscure residence in Syria they secretly despatched their agents and missionaries who preached in the Eastern provinces their hereditary indefeasible right and Mohammed the son of Ali the son of Abdallah the son of Abbas the uncle of the prophet gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan and accepted their free gift of four hundred thousand pieces of gold After the death of Mohammed the oath of allegiance was administered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous band of votaries who expected only a signal and a leader and the governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus till he himself with all his adherents was driven from the city and palace of Meru by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem thirty five That maker of kings the author as he is named of the call of the Abbassides was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit with the usual gratitude of courts A mean perhaps a foreign extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem Jealous of his wives liberal of his wealth prodigal of his own blood and of that of others he could boast with pleasure and possibly with truth that he had destroyed six hundred thousand of his enemies and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and countenance that he was never seen to smile except on a day of battle In the visible separation of parties the green was consecrated to the Fatimites the Ommiades were distinguished by the white and the black as the most adverse was naturally adopted by the Abbassides Their turbans and garments were stained with that gloomy color two black standards on pike staves nine cubits long were borne aloft in the van of Abu Moslem and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual succession of the line of Hashem From the Indus to the Euphrates the East was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and the black factions the Abbassides were most frequently victorious but their public success was clouded by the personal misfortune of their chief The court of Damascus awakening from a long slumber resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splendid retinue to recommend himself at once to the favor of the prophet and of the people A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and arrested his person and the unhappy Ibrahim snatched away from the promise of untasted royalty expired in iron fetters in the dungeons of Haran His two younger brothers Saffah three thousand five hundred eleven and Almansor eluded the search of the tyrant and lay concealed at Cufa till the zeal of the people and the approach of his Eastern friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient public On Friday in the dress of a caliph in the colors of the sect Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the mosch ascending the pulpit he prayed and preached as the lawful successor of Mahomet and after his departure his kinsmen bound a willing people by an oath of fidelity But it was on the banks of the Zab and not in the mosch of Cufa that this important controversy was determined Every advantage appeared to be on the side of the white faction the authority of established government an army of a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers against a sixth part of that number and the presence and merit of the caliph Mervan the fourteenth and last of the house of Ommiyah Before his accession to the throne he had deserved by his Georgian warfare the honorable epithet of the ass of Mesopotamia thirty six and he might have been ranked amongst the greatest princes had not says Abulfeda the eternal order decreed that moment for the ruin of his family a decree against which all human fortitude and prudence must struggle in vain The orders of Mervan were mistaken or disobeyed the return of his horse from which he had dismounted on a necessary occasion impressed the belief of his death and the enthusiasm of the black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah the uncle of his competitor After an irretrievab defeat the caliph escaped to Mosul but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the rampart he suddenly repassed the Tigris cast a melancholy look on his palace of Haran crossed the Euphrates abandoned the fortifications of Damascus and without halting in Palestine pitched his last and fatal camp at Busir on the banks of the Nile thirty seven His speed was urged by the incessant diligence of Abdallah who in every step of the pursuit acquired strength and reputation the remains of the white faction were finally vanquished in Egypt and the lance which terminated the life and anxiety of Mervan was not less welcome perhaps to the unfortunate than to the victorious chief The merciless inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile race their bones were scattered their memory was accursed and the martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged on the posterity of his tyrants Fourscore of the Ommiades who had yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes were invited to a banquet at Damascus The laws of hospitality were violated by a promiscuous massacre the board was spread over their fallen bodies and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the music of their dying groans By the event of the civil war the dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established but the Christians only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss of the disciples of Mahomet thirty eight Footnote thirty five The steed and the saddle which had carried any of his wives were instantly killed or burnt lest they should

not tended to dissolve the power and unity of the empire of the Saracens In the proscription of the Ommiades a royal youth of the name of Abdalrahman alone escaped the rage of his enemies who hunted the wandering exile from the banks of the Euphrates to the valleys of Mount Atlas His presence in the neighborhood of Spain revived the zeal of the white faction The name and cause of the Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians the West had been pure from civil arms and the servants of the abdicated family still held by a precarious tenure the inheritance of their lands and the offices of government Strongly prompted by gratitude indignation and fear they invited the grandson of the caliph Hashem to ascend the throne of his ancestors and in his desperate condition the extremes of rashness and prudence were almost the same The acclamations of the people saluted his landing on the coast of Andalusia and after a successful struggle Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova and was the father of the Ommiades of Spain who reigned above two hundred and fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees thirty nine He slew in battle a lieutenant of the Abbassides who had invaded his dominions with a fleet and army the head of Ala in salt and camphire was suspended by a daring messenger before the palace of Mecca and the caliph Almansor rejoiced in his safety that he was removed by seas and lands from such a formidable adversary Their mutual designs or declarations of offensive war evaporated without effect but instead of opening a door to the conquest of Europe Spain was dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy engaged in perpetual hostility with the East and inclined to peace and friendship with the Christian sovereigns of Constantinople and France The example of the Ommiades was imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali the Edrissites of Mauritania and the more powerful fatimites of Africa and Egypt In the tenth century the chair of Mahomet was disputed by three caliphs or commanders of the faithful who reigned at Bagdad Cairoan and Cordova excommunicating each other and agreed only in a principle of discord that a sectary is

the Abbassides were never tempted to reside either in the birthplace or the city of the prophet Damascus was disgraced by the choice and polluted with the blood of the Ommiades and after some hesitation Almansor the brother and successor of Saffah laid the foundations of Bagdad forty one the Imperial seat of his posterity during a reign of five hundred years forty two The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of the Tigris about fifteen miles above the ruins of Modain the double wall was of a circular form and such was the rapid increase of a capital now dwindled to a provincial town that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by eight hundred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and the adjacent villages In this city of peace forty three amidst the riches of the East the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the first caliphs and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian kings After his wars and buildings Almansor left behind him in gold and silver about thirty millions sterling forty four and this treasure was exhausted in a few years by the vices or virtues of his children His son Mahadi in a single pilgrimage to Mecca expended six millions of dinars of gold A pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of cisterns and caravanseras which he distributed along a measured road of seven hundred miles but his train of camels laden with snow could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia and to refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet forty five The courtiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson Almamon who gave away four fifths of the income of a province a sum of two millions four hundred thousand gold dinars before he drew his foot from the stirrup At the nuptials of the same prince a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on the head of the bride forty six and a lottery of lands and houses displayed the capricious bounty of fortune The glories of the court were brightened rather than impaired in the decline of the empire and a Greek ambassador might admire or pity the magnificence of the feeble Moctader The caliph s whole army says the historian Abulfeda both horse and foot was under arms which together made a body of one hundred and sixty thousand men His state officers the favorite slaves stood near him in splendid apparel their belts glittering with gold and gems Near them were seven thousand eunuchs four thousand of them white the remainder black The porters or door keepers were in number seven hundred Barges and boats with the most superb decorations were seen swimming upon the Tigris Nor was the palace itself less splendid in which were hung up thirty eight thousand pieces of tapestry twelve thousand five hundred of which were of silk embroidered with gold The carpets on the floor were twenty two thousand A hundred lions were brought out with a keeper to each lion forty seven Among the other spectacles of rare and stupendous luxury was a tree of gold and silver spreading into eighteen large branches on which and on the lesser boughs sat a variety of birds made of the same precious metals as well as the leaves of the tree While the machinery affected spontaneous motions the several birds warbled their natural harmony Through this scene of magnificence the Greek ambassador was led by the vizier to the foot of the caliph s throne forty eight In the West the Ommiades of Spain supported with equal pomp the title of commander of the faithful Three miles from Cordova in honor of his favorite sultana the third and greatest of the Abdalrahmans constructed the city palace and gardens of Zehra Twenty five years and above three millions sterling were employed by the founder his liberal taste invited the artists of Constantinople the most skilful sculptors and architects of the age and the buildings were sustained or adorned by twelve hundred columns of Spanish and African of Greek and Italian marble The hall of audience was incrusted with gold and pearls and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds In a lofty pavilion of the

desires are perpetually repressed by poverty and subordination but the lives and labors of millions are devoted to the service of a despotic prince whose laws are blindly obeyed and whose wishes are instantly gratified Our imagination is dazzled by the splendid picture and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason there are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of royalty It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience of the same Abdalrahman whose magnificence has perhaps excited our admiration and envy and to transcribe an authentic memorial which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace beloved by my subjects dreaded by my enemies and respected by my allies Riches and honors power and pleasure have waited on my call nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity In this situation I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot they amount to Fourteen O man place not thy confidence in this present world fifty The luxury of the caliphs so useless to their private happiness relaxed the nerves and terminated the progress of the Arabian empire Temporal and spiritual conquest had been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life the whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work The Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants and their contempt of oeconomy Instead of pursuing the great object of ambition their leisure their affections the powers of their mind were diverted by pomp and pleasure the rewards of valor were embezzled by women and eunuchs and the royal camp was encumbered by the luxury of the palace A similar temper was diffused among the subjects of the caliph Their stern enthusiasm was softened by time and prosperity they sought riches in the occupations of industry fame in the pursuits of literature and happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life War was no longer the passion of the Saracens and the increase of pay the repetition of donatives were insufficient to allure the posterity of those voluntary champions who had crowded to the standard of Abubeker and Omar for the hopes of spoil and of paradise Footnote fifty Cardonne tom i p three

Rambler No two hundred four two hundred five will be triumphantly quoted by the detractors of human life Their expectations are commonly immoderate their estimates are seldom impartial If I may speak of myself the only person of whom I can speak with certainty my happy hours have far exceeded and far exceed the scanty numbers of the caliph of Spain and I shall not scruple to add that many of them are due to the pleasing labor of the present composition Under the reign of the Ommiades the studies of the Moslems were confined to the interpretation of the Koran and the eloquence and poetry of their native tongue A people continually exposed to the dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of medicine or rather of surgery but the starving physicians of Arabia murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived them of the greatest part of their practice fifty one After their civil and domestic wars the subjects of the Abbassides awakening from this mental lethargy found leisure and felt curiosity for the acquisition of profane science This spirit was first encouraged by the caliph Almansor who besides his knowledge of the Mahometan law had applied himself with success to the study of astronomy But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon the seventh of the Abbassides he completed the designs of his grandfather and invited the muses from their ancient seats His ambassadors at Constantinople his agents in Armenia Syria and Egypt collected the volumes of Grecian science at his command they were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the Arabic language his subjects were exhorted assiduously to peruse these instructive writings and the successor of Mahomet assisted with pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the learned He was not ignorant says Abulpharagius that they are the elect of God his best and most useful servants whose lives are devoted to the improvement of their rational faculties The mean ambition of the Chinese or the Turks may glory in the industry of their hands or the indulgence of their brutal appetites Yet these dexterous artists must view with hopeless emulation the hexagons and pyramids of the cells of a beehive fifty two these fortitudinous heroes are awed by the superior fierceness of the lions and tigers and in their amorous enjoyments they are much inferior to the vigor of the grossest and most sordid quadrupeds The teachers of wisdom are the true luminaries and legislators of a world which without their aid would again sink in ignorance and barbarism fifty three The zeal and curiosity of Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Abbas their rivals the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades of Spain were the patrons of the learned as well as the commanders of the faithful the same royal prerogative was claimed by their independent emirs of the provinces and their emulation diffused the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara to Fez and Cordova The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of two hundred thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a college at Bagdad which he endowed with an annual revenue of fifteen thousand dinars The fruits of instruction were communicated perhaps at different times to six thousand disciples of every degree from the son of the noble to that of the mechanic a sufficient allowance was provided for the indigent scholars and the merit or industry of the professors was repaid with adequate stipends In every city the productions of Arabic literature were copied and collected by the curiosity of the studious and the vanity of the rich A private doctor refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara because the carriage of his books would have required four hundred camels The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one hundred thousand manuscripts elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound which were lent without jealousy or avarice to the students of Cairo Yet this collection must appear moderate if we can believe that the Ommiades of Spain had formed a library of six hundred thousand volumes forty four of which were employed in the mere catalogue Their capital Cordova with the adjacent towns of Malaga Almeria and Murcia had given birth to more than three hundred writers and above seventy public libraries were opened in the cities of the Andalusian kingdom The age of Arabian learning continued about five hundred years till the great eruption of the Moguls and was coeval with the darkest and most slothful period of European annals but since the sun of science has arisen in the West it should seem that the Oriental studies have languished and declined fifty four Footnote fifty one The Guliston p twenty nine relates the conversation of Mahomet and a physician Epistol

besides the chronological remarks of Abulpharagius In the libraries of the Arabians as in those of Europe the far greater part of the innumerable volumes were possessed only of local value or imaginary merit fifty five The shelves were crowded with orators and poets whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen with general and partial histories which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of persons and events with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence which derived their authority from the law of the prophet with the interpreters of the Koran and orthodox tradition and with the whole theological tribe polemics mystics scholastics and moralists the first or the last of writers according to the different estimates of sceptics or believers The works of speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of philosophy mathematics astronomy and physic The sages of Greece were translated and illustrated in the Arabic language and some treatises now lost in the original have been recovered in the versions of the East fifty six which possessed and studied the writings of Aristotle and Plato of Euclid and Apollonius of Ptolemy Hippocrates and Galen fifty seven Among the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times the Arabians adopted the philosophy of the Stagirite alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every age Plato wrote for the Athenians and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the language and religion of Greece After the fall of that religion the Peripatetics emerging from their obscurity prevailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects and their founder was long afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain to the Latin schools fifty eight The physics both of the Academy and the Lycaeum as they are built not on observation but on argument have retarded the progress of real knowledge The metaphysics of infinite or finite spirit have too often been enlisted in the service of superstition But the human faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics the ten predicaments of Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas fifty nine and his syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute It was dexterously wielded in the schools of the Saracens but as it is more effectual for the detection of error than for the investigation of truth it is not surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same circle of logical argument The mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege that in the course of ages they may always advance and can never recede But the ancient geometry if I am not misinformed was resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth century and whatever may be the origin of the name the science of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest testimony of the Arabs themselves sixty They cultivated with more success the sublime science of astronomy which elevates the mind of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph Almamon and the land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same spacious level the same unclouded horizon In the plains of Sinaar and a second time in those of Cufa his mathematicians accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth and determined at twenty four thousand miles the entire circumference of our globe sixty one From the reign of the Abbassides to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane the stars without the aid of glasses were diligently observed and the astronomical tables of Bagdad Spain and Samarcand sixty two correct some minute errors without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar system In the Eastern courts the truths of science could be recommended only by ignorance and folly and the astronomer would have been disregarded had he not debased his wisdom or honesty by the vain predictions of astrology sixty three But in the science of medicine the Arabians have been deservedly applauded The names of Mesua and Geber of Razis and Avicenna are ranked with the Grecian masters in the city of Bagdad eight hundred and sixty physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession sixty four in Spain the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to the skill of the Saracens sixty five and the school of Salerno their legitimate offspring revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of the healing art sixty six The success of each professor must have been influenced by personal and accidental causes but we may form a less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy sixty seven botany sixty eight and chemistry sixty nine the threefold basis of their theory and practice A superstitious reverence for the dead confined both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection of apes and quadrupeds the more solid and visible parts were known in the time of Galen and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists Botany is an active science and the discoveries of the torrid zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand plants Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples and monasteries of Egypt much useful experience had been acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures but the science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the Saracens They first invented and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation analyzed the substances of the three kingdoms of nature tried the distinction and affinities of alcalis and acids and converted the poisonous minerals into soft and salutary medicines But the most eager search of Arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals and the elixir of immortal health the reason and the fortunes of thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy and the consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of mystery fable and superstition Footnote fifty five The Arabic catalogue of the Escurial will give a just idea of the proportion of the classes In the library of Cairo the Mss of astronomy and medicine amounted to six thousand five hundred with two fair globes the one of brass the other

tom i p three hundred seventy six four hundred twenty nine Note mister Whewell Hist of Inductive Sciences vol i p three hundred thirty six rejects the claim of the Arabians as inventors of the science of chemistry The formation and realization of the notions of analysis and affinity were important steps in chemical science which as I shall hereafter endeavor to show it remained for the chemists of Europe to make at a much later period M But the Moslems deprived themselves of the principal benefits of a familiar intercourse with Greece and Rome the knowledge of antiquity the purity of taste and the freedom of thought Confident in the riches of their native tongue the Arabians disdained the study of any foreign idiom The Greek interpreters were chosen among their Christian subjects they formed their translations sometimes on the original text more frequently perhaps on a Syriac version and in the crowd of astronomers and physicians there is no example of a poet an orator or even an historian being taught to speak the language of the Saracens seventy The mythology of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence of those stern fanatics they possessed in lazy ignorance the colonies of the Macedonians and the provinces of Carthage and Rome the heroes of Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion and the history of the world before Mahomet was reduced to a short legend of the patriarchs the prophets and the Persian kings Our education in the Greek and Latin schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste and I am not forward to condemn the literature and judgment of nations of whose language I am ignorant Yet I know that the classics have much to teach and I believe that the Orientals have much to learn the temperate dignity of style the graceful proportions of art the forms of visible and intellectual beauty the just delineation of character and passion the rhetoric of narrative and argument the regular fabric of epic and dramatic poetry seventy one The influence of truth and reason is of a less ambiguous complexion The philosophers of Athens and Rome enjoyed the blessings and asserted the rights of civil and religious freedom Their moral and political writings might have gradually unlocked the fetters of Eastern despotism diffused a liberal spirit of inquiry and toleration and encouraged the Arabian sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant and their prophet an impostor seventy two The instinct of superstition was alarmed by the introduction even of the abstract sciences and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon seventy three To the thirst of martyrdom the vision of paradise and the belief of predestination we must ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people And the sword of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was drawn away from the camp to the college when the armies of the faithful presumed to read and to reflect Yet the foolish vanity of the Greeks was jealous of their studies and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire to the Barbarians of the East seventy four Footnote seventy Abulpharagius Dynast p twenty six one hundred forty eight mentions a Syriac version of Homer s two poems by Theophilus a Christian Maronite of Mount Libanus who professed astronomy at Roha or Edessa towards the end of the viiith century His work would be a literary curiosity I have read somewhere but I do not believe that Plutarch s Lives were translated into Turkish for the use of Mahomet the Second Footnote seventy one I have perused with much pleasure Sir William Jones s Latin Commentary on Asiatic Poetry London seventeen seventy four in octavo which was composed in the youth of that wonderful linguist At present in the maturity of his taste and judgment he would perhaps abate of the fervent and even partial praise which he has bestowed on the Orientals Footnote seventy two Among the Arabian philosophers Averroes has been accused of despising the religions of the Jews the Christians and the Mahometans see his article in Bayle s Dictionary Each of these sects would agree that in two instances out of three his contempt was reasonable Footnote seventy three D Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p five hundred forty six Footnote seventy four Cedrenus p five hundred forty eight who relates how manfully the emperor refused a mathematician to the instances and offers of the caliph Almamon This absurd scruple is expressed almost in the same words by the continuator of Theophanes Scriptores post Theophanem p one hundred eighteen In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides the Greeks had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging their limits But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi the third caliph of the new dynasty who seized in his turn the favorable opportunity while a woman and a child Irene and Constantine were seated on the Byzantine throne An army of ninety five thousand Persians and Arabs was sent from the Tigris to the Thracian Bosphorus under the command of Harun seventy five or Aaron the second son of the commander of the faithful His encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis or Scutari informed Irene in her palace of Constantinople of the loss of her troops and provinces With the consent or connivance of their sovereign her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace and the exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of seventy thousand dinars of gold which was imposed on the Roman empire The Saracens had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land their retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful markets and not a Greek had courage to whisper that their weary forces might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a slippery mountain and the River Sangarius Five years after this expedition Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder brother the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race illustrious in the West as the ally of Charlemagne and familiar to the most childish readers as the perpetual hero of the Arabian tales His title to the name of Al Rashid the Just is sullied by the extirpation of the generous perhaps the innocent Barmecides yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops and who dared in a passage of the Koran to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of God and posterity His court was adorned with luxury and science but in a reign of three and twenty years Harun repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt nine times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca eight times he invaded the territories of the Romans and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of submission But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was deposed and banished her successor Nicephorus resolved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace The epistle of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the game of chess which had already spread from Persia to Greece The queen he spoke of Irene considered you as a rook and herself as a pawn That pusillanimous female submitted to pay a tribute the double of which she ought to have exacted from the Barbarians Restore therefore the fruits of your injustice or abide the determination of the sword At these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the throne The caliph smiled at the menace and drawing his cimeter samsamah a weapon of historic or fabulous renown he cut asunder the feeble arms of the Greeks without turning the edge or endangering the temper of his blade He then dictated an epistle of tremendous brevity In the name of the most merciful God Harun al Rashid commander of the faithful to Nicephorus the Roman dog I have read thy letter O thou son of an unbelieving mother Thou shalt not hear thou shalt behold my reply It was written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia and the warlike celerity of the Arabs could only be checked by the arts of deceit and the show of repentance The triumphant caliph retired after the fatigues of the campaign to his favorite palace of Racca on the Euphrates seventy six but the distance of five hundred miles and the inclemency of the season encouraged his adversary to violate the peace Nicephorus was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of the faithful who repassed in the depth of winter the snows of Mount Taurus his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds from a field of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission and the caliph was resolved on victory One hundred and thirty five thousand regular soldiers received pay and were inscribed in the military roll and above three hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black standard of the Abbassides They swept the surface of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra and invested the Pontic Heraclea seventy seven once a flourishing state now a paltry town at that time capable of sustaining in her antique walls a month s siege against the forces of the East The ruin was complete the spoil was ample but if Harun had been conversant with Grecian story he would have regretted the statue of Hercules whose attributes the club the bow the quiver and the lion s hide were sculptured in massy gold The progress of desolation by sea and land from the Euxine to the Isle of Cyprus compelled the emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty defiance In the new treaty the ruins of Heraclea were left forever as a lesson and a trophy and the coin of the tribute was marked with the image and superscription of Harun and his three sons seventy eight Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove the dishonor of the Roman name After the death of their father the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord and the conqueror the liberal Almamon was sufficiently engaged in the restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign science Footnote seventy five See the reign and character of Harun Al Rashid in the Bibliotheque Orientale p four hundred

Crete seventy nine and Sicily were subdued by the Arabs The former of these conquests is disdained by their own writers who were ignorant of the fame of Jupiter and Minos but it has not been overlooked by the Byzantine historians who now begin to cast a clearer light on the affairs of their own times eighty A band of Andalusian volunteers discontented with the climate or government of Spain explored the adventures of the sea but as they sailed in no more than ten or twenty galleys their warfare must be branded with the name of piracy As the subjects and sectaries of the white party they might lawfully invade the dominions of the black caliphs A rebellious faction introduced them into Alexandria eighty one they cut in pieces both friends and foes pillaged the churches and the moschs sold above six thousand Christian captives and maintained their station in the capital of Egypt till they were oppressed by the forces and the presence of Almamon himself From the mouth of the Nile to the Hellespont the islands and sea coasts both of the Greeks and Moslems were exposed to their depredations they saw they envied they tasted the fertility of Crete and soon returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack The Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested but when they descended with their plunder to the sea shore their vessels were in flames and their chief Abu Caab confessed himself the author of the mischief Their clamors accused his madness or treachery Of what do you complain replied the crafty emir I have brought you to a land flowing with milk and honey Here is your true country repose from your toils and forget the barren place of your nativity And our wives and children Your beauteous captives will supply the place of your wives and in their embraces you will soon become the fathers of a new progeny The first habitation was their camp with a ditch and rampart in the Bay of Suda but an apostate monk led them to a more desirable position in the eastern parts and the name of Candax their fortress and colony has been extended to the whole island under the corrupt and modern appellation of Candia The hundred cities of the age of Minos were diminished to thirty and of these only one most probably Cydonia had courage to retain the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity The Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss of their navy and the timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the main During a hostile period of one hundred and thirty eight years the princes of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with fruitless curses and ineffectual arms Footnote seventy nine The authors from whom I have learned the most of the ancient and modern state of Crete are Belon Observations c c three twenty Paris fifteen

occasioned by an act of superstitious rigor An amorous youth who had stolen a nun from her cloister was sentenced by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue Euphemius appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of Africa and soon returned with the Imperial purple a fleet of one hundred ships and an army of seven hundred horse and ten thousand foot They landed at Mazara near the ruins of the ancient Selinus but after some partial victories Syracuse eighty three was delivered by the Greeks the apostate was slain before her walls and his African friends were reduced to the necessity of feeding on the flesh of their own horses In their turn they were relieved by a powerful reenforcement of their brethren of Andalusia the largest and western part of the island was gradually reduced and the commodious harbor of Palermo was chosen for the seat of the naval and military power of the Saracens Syracuse preserved about fifty years the faith which she had sworn to Christ and to Caesar In the last and fatal siege her citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which had formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage They stood above twenty days against the battering rams and catapultoe the mines and tortoises of the besiegers and the place might have been relieved if the mariners of the Imperial fleet had not been detained at Constantinople in building a church to the Virgin Mary The deacon Theodosius with the bishop and clergy was dragged in chains from the altar to Palermo cast into a subterraneous dungeon and exposed to the hourly peril of death or apostasy His pathetic and not inelegant complaint may be read as the epitaph of his country eighty four From the Roman conquest to this final calamity Syracuse now dwindled to the primitive Isle of Ortygea had insensibly declined Yet the relics were still precious the plate of the cathedral weighed five thousand pounds of silver the entire spoil was computed at one million of pieces of gold about four hundred thousand pounds sterling and the captives must outnumber the seventeen thousand Christians who were transported from the sack of Tauromenium into African servitude In Sicily the religion and language of the Greeks were eradicated and such was the docility of the rising generation that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised and clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph The Arabian squadrons issued from the harbors of Palermo Biserta and Tunis a hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and Campania were attacked and pillaged nor could the suburbs of Rome be defended by the name of the Caesars and apostles Had the Mahometans been united Italy must have fallen an easy and glorious accession to the empire of the prophet But the caliphs of Bagdad had lost their authority in the West the Aglabites and Fatimites usurped the provinces of Africa their emirs of Sicily aspired to independence and the design of conquest and dominion was degraded to a repetition of

sixty four has added some important facts In the sufferings of prostrate Italy the name of Rome awakens a solemn and mournful recollection A fleet of Saracens from the African coast presumed to enter the mouth of the Tyber and to approach a city which even yet in her fallen state was revered as the metropolis of the Christian world The gates and ramparts were guarded by a trembling people but the tombs and temples of saint Peter and saint Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the Vatican and of the Ostian way Their invisible sanctity had protected them against the Goths the Vandals and the Lombards but the Arabs disdained both the gospel and the legend and their rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the precepts of the Koran The Christian idols were stripped of their costly offerings a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of saint Peter and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire their deliverance must be imputed to the haste rather than the scruples of the Saracens In their course along the Appian way they pillaged Fundi and besieged Gayeta but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome and by their divisions the Capitol was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca The same danger still impended on the heads of the Roman people and their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir They claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign but the Carlovingian standard was overthrown by a detachment of the Barbarians they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors but the attempt was treasonable and the succor remote and precarious eighty six Their distress appeared to receive some aggravation from the death of their spiritual and temporal chief but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of an election and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo the Fourth eighty seven was the safety of the church and city This pontiff was born a Roman the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in his breast and amidst the ruins of his country he stood erect like one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads above the fragments of the Roman forum The first days of his reign were consecrated to the purification and removal of relics to prayers and processions and to all the solemn offices of religion which served at least to heal the imagination and restore the hopes of the multitude The public defence had been long neglected not from the presumption of peace but from the distress and poverty of the times As far as the scantiness of his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow the ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo fifteen towers in the most accessible stations were built or renewed two of these commanded on either side of the Tyber and an iron chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of a hostile navy The Romans were assured of a short respite by the welcome news that the siege of Gayeta had been raised and that a part of the enemy with their sacrilegious plunder had perished in the waves Footnote eighty six One of the most eminent Romans Gratianus magister militum et Romani palatii superista was accused of declaring Quia Franci nihil nobis boni faciunt neque adjutorium praebent sed magis quae nostra sunt violenter tollunt Quare non advocamus Graecos et cum eis foedus pacis componentes Francorum regem et gentem de nostro regno et dominatione expellimus Anastasius in Leone IV p one hundred ninety nine Footnote eighty seven Voltaire Hist Generale tom ii c thirty eight p one hundred twenty four appears to be remarkably struck with the character of Pope Leo IV I have borrowed his general expression but the sight of the forum has furnished me with a more distinct and lively image But the storm which had been delayed soon burst upon them with redoubled violence The Aglabite eighty eight who reigned in Africa had inherited from his father a treasure and an army a fleet of Arabs and Moors after a short refreshment in the harbors of Sardinia cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber sixteen miles from the city and their discipline and numbers appeared to threaten not a transient inroad but a serious design of conquest and dominion But the vigilance of Leo had formed an alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire the free and maritime states of Gayeta Naples and Amalfi and in the hour of danger their galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the command of Caesarius the son of the Neapolitan duke a noble and valiant youth who had already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens With his principal companions Caesarius was invited to the Lateran palace and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire their errand and to accept with joy and surprise their providential succor The city bands in arms attended their father to Ostia where he reviewed and blessed his generous deliverers They kissed his feet received the communion with martial devotion and listened to the prayer of Leo that the same God who had supported saint Peter and saint Paul on the waves of the sea would strengthen the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his holy name After a similar prayer and with equal resolution the Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys which preserved their advantageous station along the coast The victory inclined to the side of the allies when it was less gloriously decided in their favor by a sudden tempest which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest mariners The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore Those who escaped from shipwreck and hunger neither found nor deserved mercy at the hands of their implacable pursuers The sword and the gibbet reduced the dangerous multitude of captives and the remainder was more usefully employed to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to subvert The pontiff at the head of the citizens and allies paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles and among the spoils of this naval victory thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee The reign of Leo the Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman state The churches were renewed and embellished near four thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of saint Peter and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of gold of the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds embossed with the portraits of the pope and emperor and encircled with a string of pearls Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria and transported the wandering inhabitants of Centumcellae to his new foundation of Leopolis twelve miles from the sea shore eighty nine By his liberality a colony of Corsicans with their wives and children was planted in the station of Porto at the mouth of the Tyber the falling city was restored for their use the fields and vineyards were divided among the new settlers their first efforts were assisted by a gift of horses and cattle and the hardy exiles who breathed revenge against the Saracens swore to live and die under the standard of saint Peter The nations of the West and North who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican and their various habitations were distinguished in the language of the times as the schools of the Greeks and Goths of the Lombards and Saxons But this venerable spot was still open to sacrilegious insult the design of enclosing it with walls and towers exhausted all that authority could command or charity would supply and the pious labor of four years was animated in every season and at every hour by the presence of the indefatigable pontiff The love of fame a generous but worldly passion may be detected in the name of the Leonine city which he bestowed on the Vatican yet the pride of the dedication was tempered with Christian penance and humility The boundary was trod by the bishop and his clergy barefoot in sackcloth and ashes the songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and litanies the walls were besprinkled with holy water and the ceremony was concluded with a prayer that under the guardian care of the apostles and the angelic host both the old and the new Rome might ever be preserved pure prosperous and impregnable ninety Footnote eighty eight De Guignes Hist

Life of Leo IV contains twenty four pages p one hundred seventy five one hundred ninety nine edit Paris and if a great part consist of superstitious trifles we must blame or command his hero who was much oftener in a church than in a camp The emperor Theophilus son of Michael the Stammerer was one of the most active and high spirited princes who reigned at Constantinople during the middle age In offensive or defensive war he marched in person five times against the Saracens formidable in his attack esteemed by the enemy in his losses and defeats In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into Syria and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra the casual birthplace of the caliph Motassem whose father Harun was attended in peace or war by the most favored of his wives and concubines The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen and he could only intercede in favor of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection These solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a part Sozopetra was levelled with the ground the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated with ignominious cruelty and a thousand female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory Among these a matron of the house of Abbas invoked in an agony of despair the name of Motassem and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honor of her kinsman to avenge his indignity and to answer her appeal Under the reign of the two elder brothers the inheritance of the youngest had been confined to Anatolia Armenia Georgia and Circassia this frontier station had exercised his military talents and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary ninety one the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or fought against the enemies of the Koran In this personal quarrel the troops of Irak Syria and Egypt were recruited from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish hordes his cavalry might be numerous though we should deduct some myriads from the hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables and the expense of the armament was computed at four millions sterling or one hundred thousand pounds of gold From Tarsus the place of assembly the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high road of Constantinople Motassem himself commanded the centre and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas who in the trial of the first adventures might succeed with the more glory or fail with the least reproach In the revenge of his injury the caliph prepared to retaliate a similar affront The father of Theophilus was a native of Amorium ninety two in Phrygia the original seat of the Imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monuments and whatever might be the indifference of the people Constantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of the sovereign and his court The name of Amorium was inscribed on the shields of the Saracens and their three armies were again united under the walls of the devoted city It had been proposed by the wisest counsellors to evacuate Amorium to remove the inhabitants and to abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment of the Barbarians The emperor embraced the more generous resolution of defending in a siege and battle the country of his ancestors When the armies drew near the front of the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted with spears and javelins but the event of the action was not glorious on either side to the national troops The Arabs were broken but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians who had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire The Greeks were repulsed and vanquished but it was by the arrows of the Turkish cavalry and had not their bowstrings been damped and relaxed by the evening rain very few of the Christians could have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle They breathed at Dorylaeum at the distance of three days and Theophilus reviewing his trembling squadrons forgave the common flight both of the prince and people After this discovery of his weakness he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium the inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and promises and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses of his great revenge They had nearly been the witnesses of his shame The vigorous assaults of fifty five days were encountered by a faithful governor a veteran garrison and a desperate people and the Saracens must have raised the siege if a domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a bull The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting rigor tired rather than satiated with destruction he returned to his new palace of Samara in the neighborhood of Bagdad while the unfortunate ninety three Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid of his Western rival the emperor of the Franks Yet in the siege of Amorium about seventy thousand Moslems had perished their loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty thousand Christians and the sufferings of an equal number of captives who were treated as the most atrocious criminals Mutual necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of prisoners ninety four but in the national and religious conflict of the two empires peace was without confidence and war without mercy Quarter was seldom given in the field those who escaped the edge of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude or exquisite torture and a Catholic emperor relates with visible satisfaction the execution of the Saracens of Crete who were flayed alive or plunged into caldrons of boiling oil ninety five To a point of honor Motassem had sacrificed a flourishing city two hundred thousand lives and the property of millions The same caliph descended from his horse and dirtied his robe to relieve the distress of a decrepit old man who with his laden ass had tumbled into a ditch On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure when he was summoned by the angel of death ninety six Footnote ninety one The same number was applied to the following circumstance in the life of Motassem he was the eight of the Abbassides he reigned eight years eight months and eight days left eight sons eight daughters eight thousand

six hundred forty With Motassem the eighth of the Abbassides the glory of his family and nation expired When the Arabian conquerors had spread themselves over the East and were mingled with the servile crowds of Persia Syria and Egypt they insensibly lost the freeborn and martial virtues of the desert The courage of the South is the artificial fruit of discipline and prejudice the active power of enthusiasm had decayed and the mercenary forces of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of the North of which valor is the hardy and spontaneous production Of the Turks ninety seven who dwelt beyond the Oxus and Jaxartes the robust youths either taken in war or purchased in trade were educated in the exercises of the field and the profession of the Mahometan faith The Turkish guards stood in arms round the throne of their benefactor and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace and the provinces Motassem the first author of this dangerous example introduced into the capital above fifty thousand Turks their licentious conduct provoked the public indignation and the quarrels of the soldiers and people induced the caliph to retire from Bagdad and establish his own residence and the camp of his Barbarian favorites at Samara on the Tigris about twelve leagues above the city of Peace ninety eight His son Motawakkel was a jealous and cruel tyrant odious to his subjects he cast himself on the fidelity of the strangers and these strangers ambitious and apprehensive were tempted by the rich promise of a revolution At the instigation or at least in the cause of his son they burst into his apartment at the hour of supper and the caliph was cut into seven pieces by the same swords which he had recently distributed among the guards of his life and throne To this throne yet streaming with a father s blood Montasser was triumphantly led but in a reign of six months he found only the pangs of a guilty conscience If he wept at the sight of an old tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the son of Chosroes if his days were abridged by grief and remorse we may allow some pity to a parricide who exclaimed in the bitterness of death that he had lost both this world and the world to come After this act of treason the ensigns of royalty the garment and walking staff of Mahomet were given and torn away by the foreign mercenaries who in four years created deposed and murdered three commanders of the faithful As often as the Turks were inflamed by fear or rage or avarice these caliphs were dragged by the feet exposed naked to the scorching sun beaten with iron clubs and compelled to purchase by the abdication of their dignity a short reprieve of inevitable fate ninety nine At length however the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted the Abbassides returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad the insolence of the Turks was curbed with a firmer and more skilful hand and their numbers were divided and destroyed in foreign warfare But the nations of the East had been taught to trample on the successors of the prophet and the blessings of domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and discipline So uniform are the mischiefs of military despotism that I seem to repeat the story of the praetorians of Rome one hundred Footnote ninety seven M de Guignes who sometimes leaps and sometimes stumbles in

While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business the pleasure and the knowledge of the age it burnt with concentrated heat in the breasts of the chosen few the congenial spirits who were ambitious of reigning either in this world or in the next How carefully soever the book of prophecy had been sealed by the apostle of Mecca the wishes and if we may profane the word even the reason of fanaticism might believe that after the successive missions of Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus and Mahomet the same God in the fulness of time would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law In the two hundred and seventy seventh year of the Hegira and in the neighborhood of Cufa an Arabian preacher of the name of Carmath assumed the lofty and incomprehensible style of the Guide the Director the Demonstration the Word the Holy Ghost the Camel the Herald of the Messiah who had conversed with him in a human shape and the representative of Mohammed the son of Ali of saint John the Baptist and of the angel Gabriel In his mystic volume the precepts of the Koran were refined to a more spiritual sense he relaxed the duties of ablution fasting and pilgrimage allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden food and nourished the fervor of his disciples by the daily repetition of fifty prayers The idleness and ferment of the rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa a timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect and the name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been withdrawn from the world His twelve apostles dispersed themselves among the Bedoweens a race of men says Abulfeda equally devoid of reason and of religion and the success of their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution The Carmathians were ripe for rebellion since they disclaimed the title of the house of Abbas and abhorred the worldly pomp of the caliphs of Bagdad They were susceptible of discipline since they vowed a blind and absolute submission to their Imam who was called to the prophetic office by the voice of God and the people Instead of the legal tithes he claimed the fifth of their substance and spoil the most flagitious sins were no more than the type of disobedience and the brethren were united and concealed by an oath of secrecy After a bloody conflict they prevailed in the province of Bahrein along the Persian Gulf far and wide the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher and these rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and seven thousand fanatics The mercenaries of the caliph were dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor accepted quarter and the difference between them in fortitude and patience is expressive of the change which three centuries of prosperity had effected in the character of the Arabians Such troops were discomfited in every action the cities of Racca and Baalbec of Cufa and Bassora were taken and pillaged Bagdad was filled with consternation and the caliph trembled behind the veils of his palace In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris Abu Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than five hundred horse By the special order of Moctader the bridges had been broken down and the person or head of the rebel was expected every hour by the commander of the faithful His lieutenant from a motive of fear or pity apprised Abu Taher of his danger and recommended a speedy escape Your master said the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger is at the head of thirty thousand soldiers three such men as these are wanting in his host at the same instant turning to three of his companions he commanded the first to plunge a dagger into his breast the second to leap into the Tigris and the third to cast himself headlong down a precipice They obeyed without a murmur Relate continued the imam what you have seen before the evening your general shall be chained among my dogs Before the evening the camp was surprised and the menace was executed The rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the worship of Mecca they robbed a caravan of pilgrims and twenty thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a death of hunger and thirst Another year they suffered the pilgrims to proceed without interruption but in the festival of devotion Abu Taher stormed the holy city and trampled on the most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith Thirty thousand citizens and strangers were put to the sword the sacred precincts were polluted by the burial of three thousand dead bodies the well of Zemzem overflowed with blood the golden spout was forced from its place the veil of the Caaba was divided among these impious sectaries and the black stone the first monument of the nation was borne away in triumph to their capital After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty they continued to infest the confines of Irak Syria and Egypt but the vital principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root Their scruples or their avarice again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca and restored the black stone of the Caaba and it is needless to inquire into what factions they were broken or by whose swords they were finally extirpated The sect of the Carmathians may be considered as the second visible cause of the decline and fall of the empire of the caliphs one hundred one Footnote one hundred one For the sect of the Carmathians consult Elmacin Hist Sara cen p two hundred nineteen two hundred twenty four two hundred twenty nine two

thirty five I find some inconsistencies of theology and chronology which it would not be easy nor of much importance to reconcile Note Compare Von Hammer Geschichte der Assassinen p forty four c M Chapter LII More Conquests By The Arabs Part V The third and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of the empire itself The caliph Almamon might proudly assert that it was easier for him to rule the East and the West than to manage a chess board of two feet square one hundred two yet I suspect that in both those games he was guilty of many fatal mistakes and I perceive that in the distant provinces the authority of the first and most powerful of the Abbassides was already impaired The analogy of despotism invests the representative with the full majesty of the prince the division and balance of powers might relax the habits of obedience might encourage the passive subject to inquire into the origin and administration of civil government He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to reign but the elevation of a private man of a peasant perhaps or a slave affords a strong presumption of his courage and capacity The viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the property and inheritance of his precarious trust the nations must rejoice in the presence of their sovereign and the command of armies and treasures are at once the object and the instrument of his ambition A change was scarcely visible as long as the lieutenants of the caliph were content with their vicarious title while they solicited for themselves or their sons a renewal of the Imperial grant and still maintained on the coin and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the commander of the faithful But in the long and hereditary exercise of power they assumed the pride and attributes of royalty the alternative of peace or war of reward or punishment depended solely on their will and the revenues of their government were reserved for local services or private magnificence Instead of a regular supply of men and money the successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious gift of an elephant or a cast of hawks a suit of silk hangings or some pounds of musk and amber one hundred three Footnote one hundred two Hyde Syntagma Dissertat tom ii p fifty seven in Hist Shahiludii Footnote one hundred three The dynasties of the Arabian empire may

temporal and spiritual supremacy of the Abbassides the first symptoms of disobedience broke forth in the province of Africa Ibrahim the son of Aglab the lieutenant of the vigilant and rigid Harun bequeathed to the dynasty of the Aglabites the inheritance of his name and power The indolence or policy of the caliphs dissembled the injury and loss and pursued only with poison the founder of the Edrisites one hundred four who erected the kingdom and city of Fez on the shores of the Western ocean one hundred five In the East the first dynasty was that of the Taherites one hundred six the posterity of the valiant Taher who in the civil wars of the sons of Harun had served with too much zeal and success the cause of Almamon the younger brother He was sent into honorable exile to command on the banks of the Oxus and the independence of his successors who reigned in Chorasan till the fourth generation was palliated by their modest and respectful demeanor the happiness of their subjects and the security of their frontier They were supplanted by one of those adventures so frequent in the annals of the East who left his trade of a brazier from whence the name of Soffarides for the profession of a robber In a nocturnal visit to the treasure of the prince of Sistan Jacob the son of Leith stumbled over a lump of salt which he unwarily tasted with his tongue Salt among the Orientals is the symbol of hospitality and the pious robber immediately retired without spoil or damage The discovery of this honorable behavior recommended Jacob to pardon and trust he led an army at first for his benefactor at last for himself subdued Persia and threatened the residence of the Abbassides On his march towards Bagdad the conqueror was arrested by a fever He gave audience in bed to the ambassador of the caliph and beside him on a table were exposed a naked cimeter a crust of brown bread and a bunch of onions If I die said he your master is delivered from his fears If I live this must determine between us If I am vanquished I can return without reluctance to the homely fare of my youth From the height where he stood the descent would not have been so soft or harmless a timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph who paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother Amrou to the palaces of Shiraz and Ispahan The Abbassides were too feeble to contend too proud to forgive they invited the powerful dynasty of the Samanides who passed the Oxus with ten thousand horse so poor that their stirrups were of wood so brave that they vanquished the Soffarian army eight times more numerous than their own The captive Amrou was sent in chains a grateful offering to the court of Bagdad and as the victor was content with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan the realms of Persia returned for a while to the allegiance of the caliphs The provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered by their Turkish slaves of the race of Toulon and Ilkshid one hundred seven These Barbarians in religion and manners the countrymen of Mahomet emerged from the bloody factions of the palace to a provincial command and an independent throne their names became famous and formidable in their time but the founders of these two potent dynasties confessed either in words or actions the vanity of ambition The first on his death bed implored the mercy of God to a sinner ignorant of the limits of his own power the second in the midst of four hundred thousand soldiers and eight thousand slaves concealed from every human eye the chamber where he attempted to sleep Their sons were educated in the vices of kings and both Egypt and Syria were recovered and possessed by the Abbassides during an interval of thirty years In the decline of their empire Mesopotamia with the important cities of Mosul and Aleppo was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of Hamadan The poets of their court could repeat without a blush that nature had formed their countenances for beauty their tongues for eloquence and their hands for liberality and valor but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery murder and parricide At the same fatal period the Persian kingdom was again usurped by the dynasty of the Bowides by the sword of three brothers who under various names were styled the support and columns of the state and who from the Caspian Sea to the ocean would suffer no tyrants but themselves Under their reign the language and genius of Persia revived and the Arabs three

Abulfeda who spoke to the people or conversed with the learned the last who in the expense of his household represented the wealth and magnificence of the ancient caliphs After him the lords of the Eastern world were reduced to the most abject misery and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile condition The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of Bagdad but that capital still contained an innumerable multitude vain of their past fortune discontented with their present state and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tribute of nations Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy Under the mask of piety the rigid followers of Hanbal one hundred nine invaded the pleasures of domestic life burst into the houses of plebeians and princes the wine broke the instruments beat the musicians and dishonored with infamous suspicions the associates of every handsome youth In each profession which allowed room for two persons the one was a votary the other an antagonist of Ali and the Abbassides were awakened by the clamorous grief of the sectaries who denied their title and cursed their progenitors A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military force but who could satisfy the avarice or assert the discipline of the mercenaries themselves The African and the Turkish guards drew their swords against each other and the chief commanders the emirs al Omra one hundred ten imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns and violated the sanctuary of the mosch and harem If the caliphs escaped to the camp or court of any neighboring prince their deliverance was a change of servitude till they were prompted by despair to invite the Bowides the sultans of Persia who silenced the factions of Bagdad by their irresistible arms The civil and military powers were assumed by Moezaldowlat the second of the three brothers and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the faithful But on the fortieth day at the audience of the ambassadors of Chorasan and in the presence of a trembling multitude the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon by the command of the stranger and the rude hands of his Dilamites His palace was pillaged his eyes were put out and the mean ambition of the Abbassides aspired to the vacant station of danger and disgrace In the school of adversity the luxurious caliphs resumed the grave and abstemious virtues of the primitive times Despoiled of their armor and silken robes they fasted they prayed they studied the Koran and the tradition of the Sonnites they performed with zeal and knowledge the functions of their ecclesiastical character The respect of nations still waited on the successors of the apostle the oracles of the law and conscience of the faithful and the weakness or division of their tyrants sometimes restored the Abbassides to the sovereignty of Bagdad But their misfortunes had been imbittered by the triumph of the Fatimites the real or spurious progeny of Ali Arising from the extremity of Africa these successful rivals extinguished in Egypt and Syria both the spiritual and temporal authority of the Abbassides and the monarch of the Nile insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the Tigris Footnote one hundred

elapsed after the war of Theophilus and Motassem the hostile transactions of the two nations were confined to some inroads by sea and land the fruits of their close vicinity and indelible hatred But when the Eastern world was convulsed and broken the Greeks were roused from their lethargy by the hopes of conquest and revenge The Byzantine empire since the accession of the Basilian race had reposed in peace and dignity and they might encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty emir whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national foes of the Mahometan faith The lofty titles of the morning star and the death of the Saracens one hundred eleven were applied in the public acclamations to Nicephorus Phocas a prince as renowned in the camp as he was unpopular in the city In the subordinate station of great domestic or general of the East he reduced the Island of Crete and extirpated the nest of pirates who had so long defied with impunity the majesty of the empire one hundred twelve His military genius was displayed in the conduct and success of the enterprise which had so often failed with loss and dishonor The Saracens were confounded by the landing of his troops on safe and level bridges which he cast from the vessels to the shore Seven months were consumed in the siege of Candia the despair of the native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their brethren of Africa and Spain and after the massy wall and double ditch had been stormed by the Greeks a hopeless conflict was still maintained in the streets and houses of the city eleven

Phocas and his assassin John Zimisces the two heroes of the age They reigned as the guardians and colleagues of her infant sons and the twelve years of their military command form the most splendid period of the Byzantine annals The subjects and confederates whom they led to war appeared at least in the eyes of an enemy two hundred thousand strong and of these about thirty thousand were armed with cuirasses one hundred fourteen a train of four thousand mules attended their march and their evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron spikes A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more than an anticipation of what would have been effected in a few years by the course of nature but I shall briefly prosecute the conquests of the two emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the desert of Bagdad The sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus in Cilicia first exercised the skill and perseverance of their troops on whom at this moment I shall not hesitate to bestow the name of Romans In the double city of Mopsuestia which is divided by the River Sarus two hundred thousand Moslems were predestined to death or slavery one hundred fifteen a surprising degree of population which must at least include the inhabitants of the dependent districts They were surrounded and taken by assault but Tarsus was reduced by the slow progress of famine and no sooner had the Saracens yielded on honorable terms than they were mortified by the distant and unprofitable view of the naval succors of Egypt They were dismissed with a safe conduct to the confines of Syria a part of the old Christians had quietly lived under their dominion and the vacant habitations were replenished by a new colony But the mosch was converted into a stable the pulpit was delivered to the flames many rich crosses of gold and gems the spoils of Asiatic churches were made a grateful offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor and he transported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus which were fixed in the walls of Constantinople an eternal monument of his victory After they had forced and secured the narrow passes of Mount Amanus the two Roman princes repeatedly carried their arms into the heart of Syria Yet instead of assaulting the walls of Antioch the humanity or superstition of Nicephorus appeared to respect the ancient metropolis of the East he contented himself with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation left a stationary army and instructed his lieutenant to expect without impatience the return of spring But in the depth of winter in a dark and rainy night an adventurous subaltern with three hundred soldiers approached the rampart applied his scaling ladders occupied two adjacent towers stood firm against the pressure of multitudes and bravely maintained his post till he was relieved by the tardy though effectual support of his reluctant chief The first tumult of slaughter and rapine subsided the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored and the efforts of a hundred thousand Saracens of the armies of Syria and the fleets of Africa were consumed without effect before the walls of Antioch The royal city of Aleppo was subject to Seifeddowlat of the dynasty of Hamadan who clouded his past glory by the precipitate retreat which abandoned his kingdom and capital to the Roman invaders In his stately palace that stood without the walls of Aleppo they joyfully seized a well furnished magazine of arms a stable of fourteen hundred mules and three hundred bags of silver and gold But the walls of the city withstood the strokes of their battering rams and the besiegers pitched their tents on the neighboring mountain of Jaushan Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen and mercenaries the guard of the gates and ramparts was deserted and while they furiously charged each other in the market place they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a common enemy The male sex was exterminated by the sword ten thousand youths were led into captivity the weight of the precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of burden the superfluous remainder was burnt and after a licentious possession of ten days the Romans marched away from the naked and bleeding city In their Syrian inroads they commanded the husbandmen to cultivate their lands that they themselves in the ensuing season might reap the benefit more than a hundred cities were reduced to obedience and eighteen pulpits of the principal moschs were committed to the flames to expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of Mahomet The classic names of Hierapolis Apamea and Emesa revive for a moment in the list of conquest the emperor Zimisces encamped in the paradise of Damascus and accepted the ransom of a submissive people and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable fortress of Tripoli on the sea coast of Phoenicia Since the days of Heraclius the Euphrates below the passage of Mount Taurus had been impervious and almost invisible to the Greeks The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces and the historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the once famous cities of Samosata Edessa Martyropolis Amida one hundred sixteen and Nisibis the ancient limit of the empire in the neighborhood of the Tigris His ardor was quickened by the desire of grasping the virgin treasures of Ecbatana one hundred seventeen a well known name under which the Byzantine writer has concealed the capital of the Abbassides The consternation of the fugitives had already diffused the terror of his name but the fancied riches of Bagdad had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of domestic tyrants The prayers of the people and the stern demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides required the caliph to provide for the defence of the city The helpless Mothi replied that his arms his revenues and his provinces had been torn from his hands and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to support The emir was inexorable the furniture of the palace was sold and the paltry price of forty thousand pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury But the apprehensions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the Greeks thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia and the emperor satiated with glory and laden with Oriental spoils returned to Constantinople and displayed in his triumph the silk the aromatics and three hundred myriads of gold and silver Yet the powers of the East had been bent not broken by this transient hurricane After the departure of the Greeks the fugitive princes returned to their capitals the subjects disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance the Moslems again purified their temples and overturned the idols of the saints and martyrs the Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a Saracen to an orthodox master and the numbers and spirit of the Melchites were inadequate to the support of the church and state Of these extensive conquests Antioch with the cities of Cilicia and the Isle of Cyprus was alone restored a permanent and useful accession to the Roman empire one hundred eighteen Footnote one

Of The Eastern Empire Part I Fate Of The Eastern Empire In The Tenth Century Extent And Division Wealth And Revenue Palace Of Constantinople Titles And Offices Pride And Power Of The Emperors Tactics Of The Greeks Arabs And Franks Loss Of The Latin Tongue Studies And Solitude Of The Greeks A ray of historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the tenth century We open with curiosity and respect the royal volumes of Constantine Porphyrogenitus one which he composed at a mature age for the instruction of his son and which promise to unfold the state of the eastern empire both in peace and war both at home and abroad In the first of these works he minutely describes the pompous ceremonies of the church and palace of Constantinople according to his own practice and that of his predecessors two In the second he attempts an accurate survey of the provinces the themes as they were then denominated both of Europe and Asia three The system of Roman tactics the discipline and order of the troops and the military operations by land and sea are explained in the third of these didactic collections which may be ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo four In the fourth of the administration of the empire he reveals the secrets of the Byzantine policy in friendly or hostile intercourse with the nations of the earth The literary labors of the age the practical systems of law agriculture and history might redound to the benefit of the subject and the honor of the Macedonian princes The sixty books of the Basilics five the code and pandects of civil jurisprudence were gradually framed in the three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty The art of agriculture had amused the leisure and exercised the pens of the best and wisest of the ancients and their chosen precepts are comprised in the twenty books of the Geoponics six of Constantine At his command the historical examples of vice and virtue were methodized in fifty three books seven and every citizen might apply to his contemporaries or himself the lesson or the warning of past times From the august character of a legislator the sovereign of the East descends to the more humble office of a teacher and a scribe and if his successors and subjects were regardless of his paternal cares we may inherit and enjoy the everlasting legacy Footnote one The epithet of Porphyrogenitus born in the purple is elegantly defined by Claudian Ardua privatos nescit fortuna Penates Et regnum cum luce dedit Cognata potestas Excepit Tyrio venerabile pignus in ostro And Ducange in his Greek and Latin Glossaries produces many passages expressive of the same idea Footnote two A splendid Ms of Constantine de Caeremoniis Aulae et Ecclesiae Byzantinae wandered from Constantinople to Buda Frankfort and Leipsic where it was published in a splendid edition by Leich and Reiske A D seventeen fifty one in folio with such lavish praise as editors never fail to bestow on the worthy or worthless object of their

Hoeschelius August Vindel sixteen oh three and de Virtutibus et Vitiis by Henry Valesius or de Valois Paris sixteen thirty four A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift and the gratitude of posterity in the possession of these Imperial treasures we may still deplore our poverty and ignorance and the fading glories of their authors will be obliterated by indifference or contempt The Basilics will sink to a broken copy a partial and mutilated version in the Greek language of the laws of Justinian but the sense of the old civilians is often superseded by the influence of bigotry and the absolute prohibition of divorce concubinage and interest for money enslaves the freedom of trade and the happiness of private life In the historical book a subject of Constantine might admire the inimitable virtues of Greece and Rome he might learn to what a pitch of energy and elevation the human character had formerly aspired But a contrary effect must have been produced by a new edition of the lives of the saints which the great logothete or chancellor of the empire was directed to prepare and the dark fund of superstition was enriched by the fabulous and florid legends of Simon the Metaphrast eight The merits and miracles of the whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a sage than the toil of a single husbandman who multiplies the gifts of the Creator and supplies the food of his brethren Yet the royal authors of the Geoponics were more seriously employed in expounding the precepts of the destroying art which had been taught since the days of Xenophon nine as the art of heroes and kings But the Tactics of Leo and Constantine are mingled with the baser alloy of the age in which they lived It was destitute of original genius they implicitly transcribe the rules and maxims which had been confirmed by victories It was unskilled in the propriety of style and method they blindly confound the most distant and discordant institutions the phalanx of Sparta and that of Macedon the legions of Cato and Trajan of Augustus and Theodosius Even the use or at least the importance of these military rudiments may be fairly questioned their general theory is dictated by reason but the merit as well as difficulty consists in the application The discipline of a soldier is formed by exercise rather than by study the talents of a commander are appropriated to those calm though rapid minds which nature produces to decide the fate of armies and nations the former is the habit of a life the latter the glance of a moment and the battles won by lessons of tactics may be numbered with the epic poems created from the rules of criticism The book of ceremonies is a recital tedious yet imperfect of the despicable pageantry which had infected the church and state since the gradual decay of the purity of the one and the power of the other A review of the themes or provinces might promise such authentic and useful information as the curiosity of government only can obtain instead of traditionary fables on the origin of the cities and malicious epigrams on the vices of their inhabitants ten Such information the historian would have been pleased to record nor should his silence be condemned if the most interesting objects the population of the capital and provinces the amount of the taxes and revenues the numbers of subjects and strangers who served under the Imperial standard have been unnoticed by Leo the philosopher and his son Constantine His treatise of the public administration is stained with the same blemishes yet it is discriminated by peculiar merit the antiquities of the nations may be doubtful or fabulous but the geography and manners of the Barbaric world are delineated with curious accuracy Of these nations the Franks alone were qualified to observe in their turn and to describe the metropolis of the East The ambassador of the great Otho a bishop of Cremona has painted the state of Constantinople about the middle of the tenth century his style is glowing his narrative lively his observation keen and even the prejudices and passions of Liutprand are stamped with an original character of freedom and genius eleven From this scanty fund of foreign and domestic materials I shall investigate the form and substance of the Byzantine empire the provinces and wealth the civil government and military force the character and literature of the Greeks in a period of six hundred years from the reign of Heraclius to his successful invasion of the Franks or Latins Footnote eight The life and writings of Simon Metaphrastes are described by Hankius de Scriptoribus Byzant p four hundred eighteen four hundred sixty This biographer of the saints indulged himself in a loose paraphrase of the sense or nonsense of more ancient acts His Greek rhetoric is again paraphrased in the Latin version of Surius and scarcely a thread can be now visible of the original texture Footnote nine According to the first book of the Cyropaedia professors of tactics a small part of the science of war were already instituted in Persia by which Greece must be understood A good edition of all the Scriptores Tactici would be a task not unworthy of a scholar His industry might discover some new Mss and his learning might illustrate the military history of the ancients But this scholar should be likewise a soldier

precisely the same with the French epigram against Freron Un serpent mordit Jean Freron Eh bien Le serpent en mourut But as the Paris wits are seldom read in the Anthology I should be curious to learn through what channel it was conveyed for their imitation Constantin Porphyrogen de Themat c ii Brunck Analect Graec tom ii p fifty six Brodaei Anthologia l ii p two hundred forty four Footnote eleven The Legatio Liutprandi Episcopi Cremonensis ad Nicephorum Phocam is inserted in Muratori Scriptores Rerum Italicarum tom ii pars i After the final division between the sons of Theodosius the swarms of Barbarians from Scythia and Germany over spread the provinces and extinguished the empire of ancient Rome The weakness of Constantinople was concealed by extent of dominion her limits were inviolate or at least entire and the kingdom of Justinian was enlarged by the splendid acquisition of Africa and Italy But the possession of these new conquests was transient and precarious and almost a moiety of the Eastern empire was torn away by the arms of the Saracens Syria and Egypt were oppressed by the Arabian caliphs and after the reduction of Africa their lieutenants invaded and subdued the Roman province which had been changed into the Gothic monarchy of Spain The islands of the Mediterranean were not inaccessible to their naval powers and it was from their extreme stations the harbors of Crete and the fortresses of Cilicia that the faithful or rebel emirs insulted the majesty of the throne and capital The remaining provinces under the obedience of the emperors were cast into a new mould and the jurisdiction of the presidents the consulars and the counts were superseded by the institution of the themes twelve or military governments which prevailed under the successors of Heraclius and are described by the pen of the royal author Of the twenty nine themes twelve in Europe and seventeen in Asia the origin is obscure the etymology doubtful or capricious the limits were arbitrary and fluctuating but some particular names that sound the most strangely to our ear were derived from the character and attributes of the troops that were maintained at the expense and for the guard of the respective divisions The vanity of the Greek princes most eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the memory of lost dominion A new Mesopotamia was created on the western side of the Euphrates the appellation and praetor of Sicily were transferred to a narrow slip of Calabria and a fragment of the duchy of Beneventum was promoted to the style and title of the theme of Lombardy In the decline of the Arabian empire the successors of Constantine might indulge their pride in more solid advantages The victories of Nicephorus John Zimisces and Basil the Second revived the fame and enlarged the boundaries of the Roman name the province of Cilicia the metropolis of Antioch the islands of Crete and Cyprus were restored to the allegiance of Christ and Caesar one third of Italy was annexed to the throne of Constantinople the kingdom of Bulgaria was destroyed and the last sovereigns of the Macedonian dynasty extended their sway from the sources of the Tigris to the neighborhood of Rome In the eleventh century the prospect was again clouded by new enemies and new misfortunes the relics of Italy were swept away by the Norman adventures and almost all the Asiatic branches were dissevered from the Roman trunk by the Turkish conquerors After these losses the emperors of the Comnenian family continued to reign from the Danube to Peloponnesus and from Belgrade to Nice Trebizond and the winding stream of the Meander The spacious provinces of Thrace Macedonia and Greece were obedient to their sceptre the possession of Cyprus Rhodes and Crete was accompanied by the fifty islands of the Aegean or Holy Sea thirteen and the remnant of their empire transcends the measure of the largest of the European kingdoms Footnote twelve See Constantine de Thematibus in

might assert with dignity and truth that of all the monarchs of Christendom they possessed the greatest city fourteen the most ample revenue the most flourishing and populous state With the decline and fall of the empire the cities of the West had decayed and fallen nor could the ruins of Rome or the mud walls wooden hovels and narrow precincts of Paris and London prepare the Latin stranger to contemplate the situation and extent of Constantinople her stately palaces and churches and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people Her treasures might attract but her virgin strength had repelled and still promised to repel the audacious invasion of the Persian and Bulgarian the Arab and the Russian The provinces were less fortunate and impregnable and few districts few cities could be discovered which had not been violated by some fierce Barbarian impatient to despoil because he was hopeless to possess From the age of Justinian the Eastern empire was sinking below its former level the powers of destruction were more active than those of improvement and the calamities of war were imbittered by the more permanent evils of civil and ecclesiastical tyranny The captive who had escaped from the Barbarians was often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his sovereign the Greek superstition relaxed the mind by prayer and emaciated the body by fasting and the multitude of convents and festivals diverted many hands and many days from the temporal service of mankind Yet the subjects of the Byzantine empire were still the most dexterous and diligent of nations their country was blessed by nature with every advantage of soil climate and situation and in the support and restoration of the arts their patient and peaceful temper was more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe The provinces that still adhered to the empire were repeopled and enriched by the misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost From the yoke of the caliphs the Catholics of Syria Egypt and Africa retired to the allegiance of their prince to the society of their brethren the movable wealth which eludes the search of oppression accompanied and alleviated their exile and Constantinople received into her bosom the fugitive trade of Alexandria and Tyre The chiefs of Armenia and Scythia who fled from hostile or religious persecution were hospitably entertained their followers were encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate waste lands and many spots both in Europe and Asia preserved the name the manners or at least the memory of these national colonies Even the tribes of Barbarians who had seated themselves in arms on the territory of the empire were gradually reclaimed to the laws of the church and state and as long as they were separated from the Greeks their posterity supplied a race of faithful and obedient soldiers Did we possess sufficient materials to survey the twenty nine themes of the Byzantine monarchy our curiosity might be satisfied with a chosen example it is fortunate enough that the clearest light should be thrown on the most interesting province and the name of Peloponnesus will awaken the attention of the classic reader Footnote fourteen According to the Jewish traveller who had visited Europe and Asia Constantinople was equalled only by Bagdad the great city of the Ismaelites Voyage de Benjamin de Tudele par Baratier tom l c v p forty six As early as the eighth century in the troubled reign of the Iconoclasts Greece and even Peloponnesus fifteen were overrun by some Sclavonian bands who outstripped the royal standard of Bulgaria The strangers of old Cadmus and Danaus and Pelops had planted in that fruitful soil the seeds of policy and learning but the savages of the north eradicated what yet remained of their sickly and withered roots In this irruption the country and the inhabitants were transformed the Grecian blood was contaminated and the proudest nobles of Peloponnesus were branded with the names of foreigners and slaves By the diligence of succeeding princes the land was in some measure purified from the Barbarians and the humble remnant was bound by an oath of obedience tribute and military service which they often renewed and often violated The siege of Patras was formed by a singular concurrence of the Sclavonians of Peloponnesus and the Saracens of Africa In their last distress a pious fiction of the approach of the praetor of Corinth revived the courage of the citizens Their sally was bold and successful the strangers embarked the rebels submitted and the glory of the day was ascribed to a phantom or a stranger who fought in the foremost ranks under the character of saint Andrew the Apostle The shrine which contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of victory and the captive race was forever devoted to the service and vassalage of the metropolitan church of Patras By the revolt of two Sclavonian tribes in the neighborhood of Helos and Lacedaemon the peace of the peninsula was often disturbed They sometimes insulted the weakness and sometimes resisted the oppression of the Byzantine government till at length the approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull to define the rites and obligations of the Ezzerites and Milengi whose annual tribute was defined at twelve hundred pieces of gold From these strangers the Imperial geographer has accurately distinguished a domestic and perhaps original race who in some degree might derive their blood from the much injured Helots The liberality of the Romans and especially of Augustus had enfranchised the maritime cities from the dominion of Sparta and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled them with the title of Eleuthero or Free Laconians sixteen In the time of Constantine Porphyrogenitus they had acquired the name of Mainotes under which they dishonor the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores Their territory barren of corn but fruitful of olives extended to the Cape of Malea they accepted a chief or prince from the Byzantine praetor and a light tribute of four hundred pieces of gold was the badge of their immunity rather than of their dependence The freemen of Laconia assumed the character of Romans and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks By the zeal of the emperor Basil they were baptized in the faith of Christ but the altars of Venus and Neptune had been crowned by these rustic votaries five hundred years after they were proscribed in the Roman world In the theme of Peloponnesus seventeen forty cities were still numbered and the declining state of Sparta Argos and Corinth may be suspended in the tenth century at an equal distance perhaps between their antique splendor and their present desolation The duty of military service either in person or by substitute was imposed on the lands or benefices of the province a sum of five pieces of gold was assessed on each of the substantial tenants and the same capitation was shared among several heads of inferior value On the proclamation of an Italian war the Peloponnesians excused themselves by a voluntary oblation of one hundred pounds of gold four thousand pounds sterling and a thousand horses with their arms and trappings The churches and monasteries furnished their contingent a sacrilegious profit was extorted from the sale of ecclesiastical honors and the indigent bishop of Leucadia eighteen was made responsible for a pension of one hundred pieces of gold nineteen Footnote

symptoms of liberal policy may be traced in a law which exempts from all personal taxes the mariners of Peloponnesus and the workmen in parchment and purple This denomination may be fairly applied or extended to the manufacturers of linen woollen and more especially of silk the two former of which had flourished in Greece since the days of Homer and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the reign of Justinian These arts which were exercised at Corinth Thebes and Argos afforded food and occupation to a numerous people the men women and children were distributed according to their age and strength and if many of these were domestic slaves their masters who directed the work and enjoyed the profit were of a free and honorable condition The gifts which a rich and generous matron of Peloponnesus presented to the emperor Basil her adopted son were doubtless fabricated in the Grecian looms Danielis bestowed a carpet of fine wool of a pattern which imitated the spots of a peacock s tail of a magnitude to overspread the floor of a new church erected in the triple name of Christ of Michael the archangel and of the prophet Elijah She gave six hundred pieces of silk and linen of various use and denomination the silk was painted with the Tyrian dye and adorned by the labors of the needle and the linen was so exquisitely fine that an entire piece might be rolled in the hollow of a cane twenty In his description of the Greek manufactures an historian of Sicily discriminates their price according to the weight and quality of the silk the closeness of the texture the beauty of the colors and the taste and materials of the embroidery A single or even a double or treble thread was thought sufficient for ordinary sale but the union of six threads composed a piece of stronger and more costly workmanship Among the colors he celebrates with affectation of eloquence the fiery blaze of the scarlet and the softer lustre of the green The embroidery was raised either in silk or gold the more simple ornament of stripes or circles was surpassed by the nicer imitation of flowers the vestments that were fabricated for the palace or the altar often glittered with precious stones and the figures were delineated in strings of Oriental pearls twenty one Till the twelfth century Greece alone of all the countries of Christendom was possessed of the insect who is taught by nature and of the workmen who are instructed by art to prepare this elegant luxury But the secret had been stolen by the dexterity and diligence of the Arabs the caliphs of the East and West scorned to borrow from the unbelievers their furniture and apparel and two cities of Spain Almeria and Lisbon were famous for the manufacture the use and perhaps the exportation of silk It was first introduced into Sicily by the Normans and this emigration of trade distinguishes the victory of Roger from the uniform and fruitless hostilities of every age After the sack of Corinth Athens and Thebes his lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers and artificers of both sexes a trophy glorious to their master and disgraceful to the Greek emperor twenty two The king of Sicily was not insensible of the value of the present and in the restitution of the prisoners he excepted only the male and female manufacturers of Thebes and Corinth who labor says the Byzantine historian under a barbarous lord like the old Eretrians in the service of Darius twenty three A stately edifice in the palace of Palermo was erected for the use of this industrious colony twenty four and the art was propagated by their children and disciples to satisfy the increasing demand of the western world The decay of the looms of Sicily may be ascribed to the troubles of the island and the competition of the Italian cities In the year thirteen hundred and fourteen Lucca alone among her sister republics enjoyed the lucrative monopoly twenty five A domestic revolution dispersed the manufacturers to Florence Bologna Venice Milan and even the countries beyond the Alps and thirteen years after this event the statutes of Modena enjoin the planting of mulberry trees and regulate the duties on raw silk twenty six The northern climates are less propitious to the education of the silkworm but the industry of France and England twenty seven is supplied and enriched by the productions of Italy and China Footnote twenty See Constantine in Vit Basil c seventy four seventy five seventy six p one hundred ninety five one hundred ninety seven in Script post Theophanem who allows himself to use many

p four but it is to the revocation of the edict of Nantes that we owe the Spitalfields colony Chapter LIII Fate Of The Eastern Empire Part II I must repeat the complaint that the vague and scanty memorials of the times will not afford any just estimate of the taxes the revenue and the resources of the Greek empire From every province of Europe and Asia the rivulets of gold and silver discharged into the Imperial reservoir a copious and perennial stream The separation of the branches from the trunk increased the relative magnitude of Constantinople and the maxims of despotism contracted the state to the capital the capital to the palace and the palace to the royal person A Jewish traveller who visited the East in the twelfth century is lost in his admiration of the Byzantine riches It is here says Benjamin of Tudela in the queen of cities that the tributes of the Greek empire are annually deposited and the lofty towers are filled with precious magazines of silk purple and gold It is said that Constantinople pays each day to her sovereign twenty thousand pieces of gold which are levied on the shops taverns and markets on the merchants of Persia and Egypt of Russia and Hungary of Italy and Spain who frequent the capital by sea and land twenty eight In all pecuniary matters the authority of a Jew is doubtless respectable but as the three hundred and sixty five days would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions sterling I am tempted to retrench at least the numerous festivals of the Greek calendar The mass of treasure that was saved by Theodora and Basil the Second will suggest a splendid though indefinite idea of their supplies and resources The mother of Michael before she retired to a cloister attempted to check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful son by a free and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited one hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold and three hundred thousand of silver the fruits of her own economy and that of her deceased husband twenty nine The avarice of Basil is not less renowned than his valor and fortune his victorious armies were paid and rewarded without breaking into the mass of two hundred thousand pounds of gold about eight millions sterling which he had buried in the subterraneous vaults of the palace thirty Such accumulation of treasure is rejected by the theory and practice of modern policy and we are more apt to compute the national riches by the use and abuse of the public credit Yet the maxims of antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his enemies by a republic respectable to her allies and both have attained their respective ends of military power and domestic tranquillity Footnote twenty eight Voyage de Benjamin de Tudele tom i c five p forty four

literal sense and strict computation would multiply sixty fold the treasure of Basil Whatever might be consumed for the present wants or reserved for the future use of the state the first and most sacred demand was for the pomp and pleasure of the emperor and his discretion only could define the measure of his private expense The princes of Constantinople were far removed from the simplicity of nature yet with the revolving seasons they were led by taste or fashion to withdraw to a purer air from the smoke and tumult of the capital They enjoyed or affected to enjoy the rustic festival of the vintage their leisure was amused by the exercise of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing and in the summer heats they were shaded from the sun and refreshed by the cooling breezes from the sea The coasts and islands of Asia and Europe were covered with their magnificent villas but instead of the modest art which secretly strives to hide itself and to decorate the scenery of nature the marble structure of their gardens served only to expose the riches of the lord and the labors of the architect The successive casualties of inheritance and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign proprietor of many stately houses in the city and suburbs of which twelve were appropriated to the ministers of state but the great palace thirty one the centre of the Imperial residence was fixed during eleven centuries to the same position between the hippodrome the cathedral of saint Sophia and the gardens which descended by many a terrace to the shores of the Propontis The primitive edifice of the first Constantine was a copy or rival of ancient Rome the gradual improvements of his successors aspired to emulate the wonders of the old world thirty two and in the tenth century the Byzantine palace excited the admiration at least of the Latins by an unquestionable preeminence of strength size and magnificence thirty three But the toil and treasure of so many ages had produced a vast and irregular pile each separate building was marked with the character of the times and of the founder and the want of space might excuse the reigning monarch who demolished perhaps with secret satisfaction the works of his predecessors The economy of the emperor Theophilus allowed a more free and ample scope for his domestic luxury and splendor A favorite ambassador who had astonished the Abbassides themselves by his pride and liberality presented on his return the model of a palace which the caliph of Bagdad had recently constructed on the banks of the Tigris The model was instantly copied and surpassed the new buildings of Theophilus thirty four were accompanied with gardens and with five churches one of which was conspicuous for size and beauty it was crowned with three domes the roof of gilt brass reposed on columns of Italian marble and the walls were incrusted with marbles of various colors In the face of the church a semicircular portico of the figure and name of the Greek sigma was supported by fifteen columns of Phrygian marble and the subterraneous vaults were of a similar construction The square before the sigma was decorated with a fountain and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed with plates of silver In the beginning of each season the basin instead of water was replenished with the most exquisite fruits which were abandoned to the populace for the entertainment of the prince He enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle from a throne resplendent with gold and gems which was raised by a marble staircase to the height of a lofty terrace Below the throne were seated the officers of his guards the magistrates the chiefs of the factions of the circus the inferior steps were occupied by the people and the place below was covered with troops of dancers singers and pantomimes The square was surrounded by the hall of justice the arsenal and the various offices of business and pleasure and the purple chamber was named from the annual distribution of robes of scarlet and purple by the hand of the empress herself The long series of the apartments was adapted to the seasons and decorated with marble and porphyry with painting sculpture and mosaics with a profusion of gold silver and precious stones His fanciful magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists as the times could afford but the taste of Athens would have despised their frivolous and costly labors a golden tree with its leaves and branches which sheltered a multitude of birds warbling their artificial notes and two lions of massy gold and of natural size who looked and roared like their brethren of the forest The successors of Theophilus of the Basilian and Comnenian dynasties were not less ambitious of leaving some memorial of their residence and the portion of the palace most splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden triclinium thirty five With becoming modesty the rich and noble Greeks aspired to imitate their sovereign and when they passed through the streets on horseback in their robes of silk and embroidery they were mistaken by the children for kings thirty six A matron of Peloponnesus thirty seven who had cherished the infant fortunes of Basil the Macedonian was excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the greatness of her adopted son In a journey of five hundred miles from Patras to Constantinople her age or indolence declined the fatigue of a horse or carriage the soft litter or bed of Danielis was transported on the shoulders of ten robust slaves and as they were relieved at easy distances a band of three hundred were selected for the performance of this service She was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence and the honors of a queen and whatever might be the origin of her wealth her gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity I have already described the fine and curious manufactures of Peloponnesus of linen silk and woollen but the most acceptable of her presents consisted in three hundred beautiful youths of whom one hundred were eunuchs thirty eight for she was not ignorant says the historian that the air of the palace is more congenial to such insects than a shepherd s dairy to the flies of the summer During her lifetime she bestowed the greater part of her estates in Peloponnesus and her testament instituted Leo the son of Basil her universal heir After the payment of the legacies fourscore villas or farms were added to the Imperial domain and three thousand slaves of Danielis were enfranchised by their new lord and transplanted as a colony to the Italian coast From this example of a private matron we may estimate the wealth and magnificence of the emperors Yet our enjoyments are confined by a narrow circle and whatsoever may be its value the luxury of life is possessed with more innocence and safety by the master of his own than by the steward of the public fortune Footnote thirty one For a copious and

government which levels the distinctions of noble and plebeian birth the sovereign is the sole fountain of honor and the rank both in the palace and the empire depends on the titles and offices which are bestowed and resumed by his arbitrary will Above a thousand years from Vespasian to Alexius Comnenus thirty nine the Caesar was the second person or at least the second degree after the supreme title of Augustus was more freely communicated to the sons and brothers of the reigning monarch To elude without violating his promise to a powerful associate the husband of his sister and without giving himself an equal to reward the piety of his brother Isaac the crafty Alexius interposed a new and supereminent dignity The happy flexibility of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound the names of Augustus and Emperor Sebastos and Autocrator and the union produces the sonorous title of Sebastocrator He was exalted above the Caesar on the first step of the throne the public acclamations repeated his name and he was only distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments of the head and feet The emperor alone could assume the purple or red buskins and the close diadem or tiara which imitated the fashion of the Persian kings forty It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels the crown was formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold at the summit the point of their intersection was placed a globe or cross and two strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek Instead of red the buskins of the Sebastocrator and Caesar were green and on their open coronets or crowns the precious gems were more sparingly distributed Beside and below the Caesar the fancy of Alexius created the Panhypersebastos and the Protosebastos whose sound and signification will satisfy a Grecian ear They imply a superiority and a priority above the simple name of Augustus and this sacred and primitive title of the Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and servants of the Byzantine court The daughter of Alexius applauds with fond complacency this artful gradation of hopes and honors but the science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity and this vain dictionary was easily enriched by the pride of his successors To their favorite sons or brothers they imparted the more lofty appellation of Lord or Despot which was illustrated with new ornaments and prerogatives and placed immediately after the person of the emperor himself The five titles of one Despot two Sebastocrator three Caesar four Panhypersebastos and five Protosebastos were usually confined to the princes of his blood they were the emanations of his majesty but as they exercised no regular functions their existence was useless and their authority precarious Footnote thirty nine See the Alexiad l iii p seventy eight seventy nine of Anna Comnena who except in filial piety may be compared to Mademoiselle de Montpensier In her

crowns of Constantinople Rome France c sur Joinville xxv p two hundred eighty nine three hundred three but of his thirty four models none exactly tally with Anne s description But in every monarchy the substantial powers of government must be divided and exercised by the ministers of the palace and treasury the fleet and army The titles alone can differ and in the revolution of ages the counts and praefects the praetor and quaestor insensibly descended while their servants rose above their heads to the first honors of the state one In a monarchy which refers every object to the person of the prince the care and ceremonies of the palace form the most respectable department The Curopalata forty one so illustrious in the age of Justinian was supplanted by the Protovestiare whose primitive functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe From thence his jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of pomp and luxury and he presided with his silver wand at the public and private audience two In the ancient system of Constantine the name of Logothete or accountant was applied to the receivers of the finances the principal officers were distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain of the posts the army the private and public treasure and the great Logothete the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues is compared with the chancellor of the Latin monarchies forty two His discerning eye pervaded the civil administration and he was assisted in due subordination by the eparch or praefect of the city the first secretary and the keepers of the privy seal the archives and the red or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature of the emperor alone forty three The introductor and interpreter of foreign ambassadors were the great Chiauss forty four and the Dragoman forty five two names of Turkish origin and which are still familiar to the Sublime Porte three From the humble style and service of guards the Domestics insensibly rose to the station of generals the military themes of the East and West the legions of Europe and Asia were often divided till the great Domestic was finally invested with the universal and absolute command of the land forces The Protostrator in his original functions was the assistant of the emperor when he mounted on horseback he gradually became the lieutenant of the great Domestic in the field and his jurisdiction extended over the stables the cavalry and the royal train of hunting and hawking The Stratopedarch was the great judge of the camp the Protospathaire commanded the guards the Constable forty six the great Aeteriarch and the Acolyth were the separate chiefs of the Franks the Barbarians and the Varangi or English the mercenary strangers who a the decay of the national spirit formed the nerve of the Byzantine armies four The naval powers were under the command of the great Duke in his absence they obeyed the great Drungaire of the fleet and in his place the Emir or Admiral a name of Saracen extraction forty seven but which has been naturalized in all the modern languages of Europe Of these officers and of many more whom it would be useless to enumerate the civil and military hierarchy was framed Their honors and emoluments their dress and titles their mutual salutations and respective preeminence were balanced with more exquisite labor than would have fixed the constitution of a free people and the code was almost perfect when this baseless fabric the monument of pride and servitude was forever buried in the ruins of the empire forty eight Footnote forty

humble postures which devotion has applied to the Supreme Being have been prostituted by flattery and fear to creatures of the same nature with ourselves The mode of adoration forty nine of falling prostrate on the ground and kissing the feet of the emperor was borrowed by Diocletian from Persian servitude but it was continued and aggravated till the last age of the Greek monarchy Excepting only on Sundays when it was waived from a motive of religious pride this humiliating reverence was exacted from all who entered the royal presence from the princes invested with the diadem and purple and from the ambassadors who represented their independent sovereigns the caliphs of Asia Egypt or Spain the kings of France and Italy and the Latin emperors of ancient Rome In his transactions of business Liutprand bishop of Cremona fifty asserted the free spirit of a Frank and the dignity of his master Otho Yet his sincerity cannot disguise the abasement of his first audience When he approached the throne the birds of the golden tree began to warble their notes which were accompanied by the roarings of the two lions of gold With his two companions Liutprand was compelled to bow and to fall prostrate and thrice to touch the ground with his forehead He arose but in the short interval the throne had been hoisted from the floor to the ceiling the Imperial figure appeared in new and more gorgeous apparel and the interview was concluded in haughty and majestic silence In this honest and curious narrative the Bishop of Cremona represents the ceremonies of the Byzantine court which are still practised in the Sublime Porte and which were preserved in the last age by the dukes of Muscovy or Russia After a long journey by sea and land from Venice to Constantinople the ambassador halted at the golden gate till he was conducted by the formal officers to the hospitable palace prepared for his reception but this palace was a prison and his jealous keepers prohibited all social intercourse either with strangers or natives At his first audience he offered the gifts of his master slaves and golden vases and costly armor The ostentatious payment of the officers and troops displayed before his eyes the riches of the empire he was entertained at a royal banquet fifty one in which the ambassadors of the nations were marshalled by the esteem or contempt of the Greeks from his own table the emperor as the most signal favor sent the plates which he had tasted and his favorites were dismissed with a robe of honor fifty two In the morning and evening of each day his civil and military servants attended their duty in the palace their labors were repaid by the sight perhaps by the smile of their lord his commands were signified by a nod or a sign but all earthly greatness stood silent and submissive in his presence In his regular or extraordinary processions through the capital he unveiled his person to the public view the rites of policy were connected with those of religion and his visits to the principal churches were regulated by the festivals of the Greek calendar On the eve of these processions the gracious or devout intention of the monarch was proclaimed by the heralds The streets were cleared and purified the pavement was strewed with flowers the most precious furniture the gold and silver plate and silken hangings were displayed from the windows and balconies and a severe discipline restrained and silenced the tumult of the populace The march was opened by the military officers at the head of their troops they were followed in long order by the magistrates and ministers of the civil government the person of the emperor was guarded by his eunuchs and domestics and at the church door he was solemnly received by the patriarch and his clergy The task of applause was not abandoned to the rude and spontaneous voices of the crowd The most convenient stations were occupied by the bands of the blue and green factions of the circus and their furious conflicts which had shaken the capital were insensibly sunk to an emulation of servitude From either side they echoed in responsive melody the praises of the emperor their poets and musicians directed the choir and long life fifty three and victory were the burden of every song The same acclamations were performed at the audience the banquet and the church and as an evidence of boundless sway they were repeated in the Latin fifty four Gothic Persian French and even English language fifty five by the mercenaries who sustained the real or fictitious character of those nations By the pen of Constantine Porphyrogenitus this science of form and flattery has been reduced into a pompous and trifling volume fifty six which the vanity of succeeding times might enrich with an ample supplement Yet the calmer reflection of a prince would surely suggest that the same acclamations were applied to every character and every reign and if he had risen from a private rank he might remember that his own voice had been the loudest and most eager in applause at the very moment when he envied the fortune or conspired against the life of his predecessor

were ambitious of mingling their blood with the blood of the Caesars by their marriage with a royal virgin or by the nuptials of their daughters with a Roman prince fifty eight The aged monarch in his instructions to his son reveals the secret maxims of policy and pride and suggests the most decent reasons for refusing these insolent and unreasonable demands Every animal says the discreet emperor is prompted by the distinction of language religion and manners A just regard to the purity of descent preserves the harmony of public and private life but the mixture of foreign blood is the fruitful source of disorder and discord Such had ever been the opinion and practice of the sage Romans their jurisprudence proscribed the marriage of a citizen and a stranger in the days of freedom and virtue a senator would have scorned to match his daughter with a king the glory of Mark Antony was sullied by an Egyptian wife fifty nine and the emperor Titus was compelled by popular censure to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice sixty This perpetual interdict was ratified by the fabulous sanction of the great Constantine The ambassadors of the nations more especially of the unbelieving nations were solemnly admonished that such strange alliances had been condemned by the founder of the church and city The irrevocable law was inscribed on the altar of saint Sophia and the impious prince who should stain the majesty of the purple was excluded from the civil and ecclesiastical communion of the Romans If the ambassadors were instructed by any false brethren in the Byzantine history they might produce three memorable examples of the violation of this imaginary law the marriage of Leo or rather of his father Constantine the Fourth with the daughter of the king of the Chozars the nuptials of the granddaughter of Romanus with a Bulgarian prince and the union of Bertha of France or Italy with young Romanus the son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus himself To these objections three answers were prepared which solved the difficulty and established the law I The deed and the guilt of Constantine Copronymus were acknowledged The Isaurian heretic who sullied the baptismal font and declared war against the holy images had indeed embraced a Barbarian wife By this impious alliance he accomplished the measure of his crimes and was devoted to the just censure of the church and of posterity II Romanus could not be alleged as a legitimate emperor he was a plebeian usurper ignorant of the laws and regardless of the honor of the monarchy His son Christopher the father of the bride was the third in rank in the college of princes at once the subject and the accomplice of a rebellious parent The Bulgarians were sincere and devout Christians and the safety of the empire with the redemption of many thousand captives depended on this preposterous alliance Yet no consideration could dispense from the law of Constantine the clergy the senate and the people disapproved the conduct of Romanus and he was reproached both in his life and death as the author of the public disgrace III For the marriage of his own son with the daughter of Hugo king of Italy a more honorable defence is contrived by the wise Porphyrogenitus Constantine the great and holy esteemed the fidelity and valor of the Franks sixty one and his prophetic spirit beheld the vision of their future greatness They alone were excepted from the general prohibition Hugo king of France was the lineal descendant of Charlemagne sixty two and his daughter Bertha inherited the prerogatives of her family and nation The voice of truth and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the Imperial court The patrimonial estate of Hugo was reduced from the monarchy of France to the simple county of Arles though it was not denied that in the confusion of the times he had usurped the sovereignty of Provence and invaded the kingdom of Italy His father was a private noble and if Bertha derived her female descent from the Carlovingian line every step was polluted with illegitimacy or vice The grandmother of Hugo was the famous Valdrada the concubine rather than the wife of the second Lothair whose adultery divorce and second nuptials had provoked against him the thunders of the Vatican His mother as she was styled the great Bertha was successively the wife of the count of Arles and of the marquis of Tuscany France and Italy were scandalized by her gallantries and till the age of threescore her lovers of every degree were the zealous servants of her ambition The example of maternal incontinence was copied by the king of Italy and the three favorite concubines of Hugo were decorated with the classic names of Venus Juno and Semele sixty three The daughter of Venus was granted to the solicitations of the Byzantine court her name of Bertha was changed to that of Eudoxia and she was wedded or rather betrothed to young Romanus the future heir of the empire of the East The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by the tender age of the two parties and at the end of five years the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse The second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian but of Roman birth and their two daughters Theophano and Anne were given in marriage to the princes of the earth The eldest was bestowed as the pledge of peace on the eldest son of the great Otho who had solicited this alliance with arms and embassies It might legally be questioned how far a Saxon was entitled to the privilege of the French nation but every scruple was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored the empire of the West After the death of her father in law and husband Theophano governed Rome Italy and Germany during the minority of her son the third Otho and the Latins have praised the virtues of an empress who sacrificed to a superior duty the remembrance of her country sixty four In the nuptials of her sister Anne every prejudice was lost and every consideration of dignity was superseded by the stronger argument of necessity and fear A Pagan of the North Wolodomir great prince of Russia aspired to a daughter of the Roman purple and his claim was enforced by the threats of war the promise of conversion and the offer of a powerful succor against a domestic rebel A victim of her religion and country the Grecian princess was torn from the palace of her fathers and condemned to a savage reign and a hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes or in the neighborhood of the Polar circle sixty five Yet the marriage of Anne was fortunate and fruitful the daughter of her grandson Joroslaus was recommended by her Imperial descent and the king of France Henry I sought a wife on the last borders of Europe

not have owned his ignorance of the country religion c of Jeroslaus a name so conspicuous in the Russian annals In the Byzantine palace the emperor was the first slave of the ceremonies which he imposed of the rigid forms which regulated each word and gesture besieged him in the palace and violated the leisure of his rural solitude But the lives and fortunes of millions hung on his arbitrary will and the firmest minds superior to the allurements of pomp and luxury may be seduced by the more active pleasure of commanding their equals The legislative and executive powers were centred in the person of the monarch and the last remains of the authority of the senate were finally eradicated by Leo the philosopher sixty seven A lethargy of servitude had benumbed the minds of the Greeks in the wildest tumults of rebellion they never aspired to the idea of a free constitution and the private character of the prince was the only source and measure of their public happiness Superstition rivetted their chains in the church of saint Sophia he was solemnly crowned by the patriarch at the foot of the altar they pledged their passive and unconditional obedience to his government and family On his side he engaged to abstain as much as possible from the capital punishments of death and mutilation his orthodox creed was subscribed with his own hand and he promised to obey the decrees of the seven synods and the canons of the holy church sixty eight But the assurance of mercy was loose and indefinite he swore not to his people but to an invisible judge and except in the inexpiable guilt of heresy the ministers of heaven were always prepared to preach the indefeasible right and to absolve the venial transgressions of their sovereign The Greek ecclesiastics were themselves the subjects of the civil magistrate at the nod of a tyrant the bishops were created or transferred or deposed or punished with an ignominious death whatever might be their wealth or influence they could never succeed like the Latin clergy in the establishment of an independent republic and the patriarch of Constantinople condemned what he secretly envied the temporal greatness of his Roman brother Yet the exercise of boundless despotism is happily checked by the laws of nature and necessity In proportion to his wisdom and virtue the master of an empire is confined to the path of his sacred and laborious duty In proportion to his vice and folly he drops the sceptre too weighty for his hands and the motions of the royal image are ruled by the imperceptible thread of some minister or favorite who undertakes for his private interest to exercise the task of the public oppression In some fatal moment the most absolute monarch may dread the reason or the caprice of a nation of slaves and experience has proved that whatever is gained in the extent is lost in the safety and solidity of regal power Footnote sixty seven A constitution of Leo the Philosopher lxxviii ne senatus consulta amplius fiant speaks the language of naked despotism Footnote sixty eight Codinus de Officiis c xvii p one hundred twenty one hundred twenty one gives an idea of this oath so strong to the church so weak to the people Whatever titles a despot may assume whatever claims he may assert it is on the sword that he must ultimately depend to guard him against his foreign and domestic enemies From the age of Charlemagne to that of the Crusades the world for I overlook the remote monarchy of China was occupied and disputed by the three great empires or nations of the Greeks the Saracens and the Franks Their military strength may be ascertained by a comparison of their courage their arts and riches and their obedience to a supreme head who might call into action all the energies of the state The Greeks far inferior to their rivals in the first were superior to the Franks and at least equal to the Saracens in the second and third of these warlike qualifications The wealth of the Greeks enabled them to purchase the service of the poorer nations and to maintain a naval power for the protection of their coasts and the annoyance of their enemies sixty nine A commerce of mutual benefit exchanged the gold of Constantinople for the blood of Sclavonians and Turks the Bulgarians and Russians their valor contributed to the victories of Nicephorus and Zimisces and if a hostile people pressed too closely on the frontier they were recalled to the defence of their country and the desire of peace by the well managed attack of a more distant tribe seventy The command of the Mediterranean from the mouth of the Tanais to the columns of Hercules was always claimed and often possessed by the successors of Constantine Their capital was filled with naval stores and dexterous artificers the situation of Greece and Asia the long coasts deep gulfs and numerous islands accustomed their subjects to the exercise of navigation and the trade of Venice and Amalfi supplied a nursery of seamen to the Imperial fleet seventy one Since the time of the Peloponnesian and Punic wars the sphere of action had not been enlarged and the science of naval architecture appears to have declined The art of constructing those stupendous machines which displayed three or six or ten ranges of oars rising above or falling behind each other was unknown to the ship builders of Constantinople as well as to the mechanicians of modern days seventy two The Dromones seventy three or light galleys of the Byzantine empire were content with two tier of oars each tier was composed of five and twenty benches and two rowers were seated on each bench who plied their oars on either side of the vessel To these we must add the captain or centurion who in time of action stood erect with his armor bearer on the poop two steersmen at the helm and two officers at the prow the one to manage the anchor the other to point and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire The whole crew as in the infancy of the art performed the double service of mariners and soldiers they were provided with defensive and offensive arms with bows and arrows which they used from the upper deck with long pikes which they pushed through the portholes of the lower tier Sometimes indeed the ships of war were of a larger and more solid construction and the labors of combat and navigation were more regularly divided between seventy soldiers and two hundred and thirty mariners But for the most part they were of the light and manageable size and as the Cape of Malea in Peloponnesus was still clothed with its ancient terrors an Imperial fleet was transported five miles over land across the Isthmus of Corinth seventy four The principles of maritime tactics had not undergone any change since the time of Thucydides a squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent charged to the front and strove to impel their sharp beaks against the feeble sides of their antagonists A machine for casting stones and darts was built of strong timbers in the midst of the deck and the operation of boarding was effected by a crane that hoisted baskets of armed men The language of signals so clear and copious in the naval grammar of the moderns was imperfectly expressed by the various positions and colors of a commanding flag In the darkness of the night the same orders to chase to attack to halt to retreat to break to form were conveyed by the lights of the leading galley By land the fire signals were repeated from one mountain to another a chain of eight stations commanded a space of five hundred miles and Constantinople in a few hours was apprised of the hostile motions of the Saracens of Tarsus seventy five Some estimate may be formed of the power of the Greek emperors by the curious and minute detail of the armament which was prepared for the reduction of Crete A fleet of one hundred and twelve galleys and seventy five vessels of the Pamphylian style was equipped in the capital the islands of the Aegean Sea and the seaports of Asia Macedonia and Greece It carried thirty four thousand mariners seven thousand three hundred and forty soldiers seven hundred Russians and five thousand and eighty seven Mardaites whose fathers had been transplanted from the mountains of Libanus Their pay most probably of a month was computed at thirty four centenaries of gold about one hundred and thirty six thousand pounds sterling Our fancy is bewildered by the endless recapitulation of arms and engines of clothes and linen of bread for the men and forage for the horses and of stores and utensils of every description inadequate to the conquest of a petty island but amply sufficient for the establishment of a flourishing colony seventy six Footnote sixty nine If we listen to

indivisible moment of time Miserable amplification which by saying too much says nothing How much more forcible and instructive would have been the definition of three or six or twelve hours Footnote seventy six See the Ceremoniale of Constantine Porphyrogenitus l ii c forty four p one hundred seventy six one hundred ninety two A critical reader will discern some inconsistencies in different parts of this account but they are not more obscure or more stubborn than the establishment and effectives the present and fit for duty the rank and file and the private of a modern return which retain in proper hands the knowledge of these profitable mysteries The invention of the Greek fire did not like that of gun powder produce a total revolution in the art of war To these liquid combustibles the city and empire of Constantine owed their deliverance and they were employed in sieges and sea fights with terrible effect But they were either less improved or less susceptible of improvement the engines of antiquity the catapultae balistae and battering rams were still of most frequent and powerful use in the attack and defence of fortifications nor was the decision of battles reduced to the quick and heavy fire of a line of infantry whom it were fruitless to protect with armor against a similar fire of their enemies Steel and iron were still the common instruments of destruction and safety and the helmets cuirasses and shields of the tenth century did not either in form or substance essentially differ from those which had covered the companions of Alexander or Achilles seventy seven But instead of accustoming the modern Greeks like the legionaries of old to the constant and easy use of this salutary weight their armor was laid aside in light chariots which followed the march till on the approach of an enemy they resumed with haste and reluctance the unusual encumbrance Their offensive weapons consisted of swords battle axes and spears but the Macedonian pike was shortened a fourth of its length and reduced to the more convenient measure of twelve cubits or feet The sharpness of the Scythian and Arabian arrows had been severely felt and the emperors lament the decay of archery as a cause of the public misfortunes and recommend as an advice and a command that the military youth till the age of forty should assiduously practise the exercise of the bow seventy eight The bands or regiments were usually three hundred strong and as a medium between the extremes of four and sixteen the foot soldiers of Leo and Constantine were formed eight deep but the cavalry charged in four ranks from the reasonable consideration that the weight of the front could not be increased by any pressure of the hindmost horses If the ranks of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled this cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line but of whom only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords of the Barbarians The order of battle must have varied according to the ground the object and the adversary but their ordinary disposition in two lines and a reserve presented a succession of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as the judgment of the Greeks seventy nine In case of a repulse the first line fell back into the intervals of the second and the reserve breaking into two divisions wheeled round the flanks to improve the victory or cover the retreat Whatever authority could enact was accomplished at least in theory by the camps and marches the exercises and evolutions the edicts and books of the Byzantine monarch eighty Whatever art could produce from the forge the loom or the laboratory was abundantly supplied by the riches of the prince and the industry of his numerous workmen But neither authority nor art could frame the most important machine the soldier himself and if the ceremonies of Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the emperor eighty one his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a defeat and procrastinating the war eighty two Notwithstanding some transient success the Greeks were sunk in their own esteem and that of their neighbors A cold hand and a loquacious tongue was the vulgar description of the nation the author of the tactics was besieged in his capital and the last of the Barbarians who trembled at the name of the Saracens or Franks could proudly exhibit the medals of gold and silver which they had extorted from the feeble sovereign of Constantinople What spirit their government and character denied might have been inspired in some degree by the influence of religion but the religion of the Greeks could only teach them to suffer and to yield The emperor Nicephorus who restored for a moment the discipline and glory of the Roman name was desirous of bestowing the honors of martyrdom on the Christians who lost their lives in a holy war against the infidels But this political law was defeated by the opposition of the patriarch the bishops and the principal senators and they strenuously urged the canons of saint Basil that all who were polluted by the bloody trade of a soldier should be separated during three years from the communion of the faithful eighty three Footnote seventy seven See the fifth sixth and seventh chapters and in the Tactics of Leo with the corresponding passages in those of Constantine Footnote seventy eight Leo Tactic p five hundred eighty one Constantin p twelve sixteen Yet such were not the maxims of the Greeks and Romans who despised the loose and distant practice of archery Footnote seventy nine Compare the passages of the Tactics p six hundred sixty nine and seven hundred twenty one and the xiith

such had been the opinion of the old Romans Leo had never reigned on the shores of the Thracian Bosphorus Footnote eighty three Zonaras tom ii l xvi p two hundred two two hundred three and Cedrenus Compend p six hundred sixty eight who relate the design of Nicephorus most unfortunately apply the epithet to the opposition of the patriarch These scruples of the Greeks have been compared with the tears of the primitive Moslems when they were held back from battle and this contrast of base superstition and high spirited enthusiasm unfolds to a philosophic eye the history of the rival nations The subjects of the last caliphs eighty four had undoubtedly degenerated from the zeal and faith of the companions of the prophet Yet their martial creed still represented the Deity as the author of war eighty five the vital though latent spark of fanaticism still glowed in the heart of their religion and among the Saracens who dwelt on the Christian borders it was frequently rekindled to a lively and active flame Their regular force was formed of the valiant slaves who had been educated to guard the person and accompany the standard of their lord but the Mussulman people of Syria and Cilicia of Africa and Spain was awakened by the trumpet which proclaimed a holy war against the infidels The rich were ambitious of death or victory in the cause of God the poor were allured by the hopes of plunder and the old the infirm and the women assumed their share of meritorious service by sending their substitutes with arms and horses into the field These offensive and defensive arms were similar in strength and temper to those of the Romans whom they far excelled in the management of the horse and the bow the massy silver of their belts their bridles and their swords displayed the magnificence of a prosperous nation and except some black archers of the South the Arabs disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors Instead of wagons they were attended by a long train of camels mules and asses the multitude of these animals whom they bedecked with flags and streamers appeared to swell the pomp and magnitude of their host and the horses of the enemy were often disordered by the uncouth figure and odious smell of the camels of the East Invincible by their patience of thirst and heat their spirits were frozen by a winter s cold and the consciousness of their propensity to sleep exacted the most rigorous precautions against the surprises of the night Their order of battle was a long square of two deep and solid lines the first of archers the second of cavalry In their engagements by sea and land they sustained with patient firmness the fury of the attack and seldom advanced to the charge till they could discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes But if they were repulsed and broken they knew not how to rally or renew the combat and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious prejudice that God had declared himself on the side of their enemies The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced this fearful opinion nor were there wanting among the Mahometans and Christians some obscure prophecies eighty six which prognosticated their alternate defeats The unity of the Arabian empire was dissolved but the independent fragments were equal to populous and powerful kingdoms and in their naval and military armaments an emir of Aleppo or Tunis might command no despicable fund of skill and industry and treasure In their transactions of peace and war with the Saracens the princes of Constantinople too often felt that these Barbarians had nothing barbarous in their discipline and that if they were destitute of original genius they had been endowed with a quick spirit of curiosity and imitation The model was indeed more perfect than the copy their ships and engines and fortifications were of a less skilful construction and they confess without shame that the same God who has given a tongue to the Arabians had more nicely fashioned the hands of the Chinese and the heads of the Greeks eighty seven Footnote eighty four The xviith chapter of the tactics of the different nations is the most historical and useful of

relates and interprets the oracles of the Greeks and Saracens in which after the fashion of prophecy the past is clear and historical the future is dark enigmatical and erroneous From this boundary of

hundred one but I cannot recollect the passage in which it is conveyed by this lively apothegm Chapter LIII Fate Of The Eastern Empire Part IV A name of some German tribes between the Rhine and the Weser had spread its victorious influence over the greatest part of Gaul Germany and Italy and the common appellation of Franks eighty eight was applied by the Greeks and Arabians to the Christians of the Latin church the nations of the West who stretched beyond their knowledge to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean The vast body had been inspired and united by the soul of Charlemagne but the division and degeneracy of his race soon annihilated the Imperial power which would have rivalled the Caesars of Byzantium and revenged the indignities of the Christian name The enemies no longer feared nor could the subjects any longer trust the application of a public revenue the labors of trade and manufactures in the military service the mutual aid of provinces and armies and the naval squadrons which were regularly stationed from the mouth of the Elbe to that of the Tyber In the beginning of the tenth century the family of Charlemagne had almost disappeared his monarchy was broken into many hostile and independent states the regal title was assumed by the most ambitious chiefs their revolt was imitated in a long subordination of anarchy and discord and the nobles of every province disobeyed their sovereign oppressed their vassals and exercised perpetual hostilities against their equals and neighbors Their private wars which overturned the fabric of government fomented the martial spirit of the nation In the system of modern Europe the power of the sword is possessed at least in fact by five or six mighty potentates their operations are conducted on a distant frontier by an order of men who devote their lives to the study and practice of the military art the rest of the country and community enjoys in the midst of war the tranquillity of peace and is only made sensible of the change by the aggravation or decrease of the public taxes In the disorders of the tenth and eleventh centuries every peasant was a soldier and every village a fortification each wood or valley was a scene of murder and rapine and the lords of each castle were compelled to assume the character of princes and warriors To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the safety of their family the protection of their lands and the revenge of their injuries and like the conquerors of a larger size they were too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive war The powers of the mind and body were hardened by the presence of danger and necessity of resolution the same spirit refused to desert a friend and to forgive an enemy and instead of sleeping under the guardian care of a magistrate they proudly disdained the authority of the laws In the days of feudal anarchy the instruments of agriculture and art were converted into the weapons of bloodshed the peaceful occupations of civil and ecclesiastical society were abolished or corrupted and the bishop who exchanged his mitre for a helmet was more forcibly urged by the manners of the times than by the obligation of his tenure eighty nine Footnote eighty eight Ex Francis quo nomine tam Latinos quam Teutones comprehendit ludum habuit Liutprand in Legat ad Imp Nicephorum p four hundred eighty three

beneficiary discipline Father Thomassin tom iii l i c forty forty five forty six forty seven may be usefully consulted A general law of Charlemagne exempted the bishops from personal service but the opposite practice which prevailed from the ixth to the xvth century is countenanced by the example or silence of saints and doctors You justify your cowardice by the holy canons says Ratherius of Verona the canons likewise forbid you to whore and yet The love of freedom and of arms was felt with conscious pride by the Franks themselves and is observed by the Greeks with some degree of amazement and terror The Franks says the emperor Constantine are bold and valiant to the verge of temerity and their dauntless spirit is supported by the contempt of danger and death In the field and in close onset they press to the front and rush headlong against the enemy without deigning to compute either his numbers or their own Their ranks are formed by the firm connections of consanguinity and friendship and their martial deeds are prompted by the desire of saving or revenging their dearest companions In their eyes a retreat is a shameful flight and flight is indelible infamy ninety A nation endowed with such high and intrepid spirit must have been secure of victory if these advantages had not been counter balanced by many weighty defects The decay of their naval power left the Greeks and Saracens in possession of the sea for every purpose of annoyance and supply In the age which preceded the institution of knighthood the Franks were rude and unskilful in the service of cavalry ninety one and in all perilous emergencies their warriors were so conscious of their ignorance that they chose to dismount from their horses and fight on foot Unpractised in the use of pikes or of missile weapons they were encumbered by the length of their swords the weight of their armor the magnitude of their shields and if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks by their unwieldy intemperance Their independent spirit disdained the yoke of subordination and abandoned the standard of their chief if he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their stipulation or service On all sides they were open to the snares of an enemy less brave but more artful than themselves They might be bribed for the Barbarians were venal or surprised in the night for they neglected the precautions of a close encampment or vigilant sentinels The fatigues of a summer s campaign exhausted their strength and patience and they sunk in despair if their voracious appetite was disappointed of a plentiful supply of wine and of food This general character of the Franks was marked with some national and local shades which I should ascribe to accident rather than to climate but which were visible both to natives and to foreigners An ambassador of the great Otho declared in the palace of Constantinople that the Saxons could dispute with swords better than with pens and that they preferred inevitable death to the dishonor of turning their backs to an enemy ninety two It was the glory of the nobles of France that in their humble dwellings war and rapine were the only pleasure the sole occupation of their lives They affected to deride the palaces the banquets the polished manner of the Italians who in the estimate of the Greeks themselves had degenerated from the liberty and valor of the ancient Lombards ninety three Footnote ninety In the xviiith chapter of his Tactics the emperor Leo has fairly stated the military vices and virtues of the Franks whom Meursius

national sovereign might fix his occasional or permanent residence in any province of their common country In the division of the East and West an ideal unity was scrupulously observed and in their titles laws and statutes the successors of Arcadius and Honorius announced themselves as the inseparable colleagues of the same office as the joint sovereigns of the Roman world and city which were bounded by the same limits After the fall of the Western monarchy the majesty of the purple resided solely in the princes of Constantinople and of these Justinian was the first who after a divorce of sixty years regained the dominion of ancient Rome and asserted by the right of conquest the august title of Emperor of the Romans ninety four A motive of vanity or discontent solicited one of his successors Constans the Second to abandon the Thracian Bosphorus and to restore the pristine honors of the Tyber an extravagant project exclaims the malicious Byzantine as if he had despoiled a beautiful and blooming virgin to enrich or rather to expose the deformity of a wrinkled and decrepit matron ninety five But the sword of the Lombards opposed his settlement in Italy he entered Rome not as a conqueror but as a fugitive and after a visit of twelve days he pillaged and forever deserted the ancient capital of the world ninety six The final revolt and separation of Italy was accomplished about two centuries after the conquests of Justinian and from his reign we may date the gradual oblivion of the Latin tongue That legislator had composed his Institutes his Code and his Pandects in a language which he celebrates as the proper and public style of the Roman government the consecrated idiom of the palace and senate of Constantinople of the campus and tribunals of the East ninety seven But this foreign dialect was unknown to the people and soldiers of the Asiatic provinces it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the interpreters of the laws and the ministers of the state After a short conflict nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete institutions of human power for the general benefit of his subjects Justinian promulgated his novels in the

Egypt and the extinction of the schools of Alexandria and Athens the studies of the Greeks insensibly retired to some regular monasteries and above all to the royal college of Constantinople which was

from their ancient libraries and taught them to know and reward the philosophers whose labors had been hitherto repaid by the pleasure of study and the pursuit of truth The Caesar Bardas the uncle of Michael the Third was the generous protector of letters a title which alone has preserved his memory and excused his ambition A particle of the treasures of his nephew was sometimes diverted from the indulgence of vice and folly a school was opened in the palace of Magnaura and the presence of Bardas excited the emulation of the masters and students At their head was the philosopher Leo archbishop of Thessalonica his profound skill in astronomy and the mathematics was admired by the strangers of the East and this occult science was magnified by vulgar credulity which modestly supposes that all knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration or magic At the pressing entreaty of the Caesar his friend the celebrated Photius one hundred seven renounced the freedom of a secular and studious life ascended the patriarchal throne and was alternately excommunicated and absolved by the synods of the East and West By the confession even of priestly hatred no art or science except poetry was foreign to this universal scholar who was deep in thought indefatigable in reading and eloquent in diction Whilst he exercised the office of protospathaire or captain of the guards Photius was sent ambassador to the caliph of Bagdad one hundred eight The tedious hours of exile perhaps of confinement were beguiled by the hasty composition of his Library a living monument of erudition and criticism Two hundred and fourscore writers historians orators philosophers theologians are reviewed without any regular method he abridges their narrative or doctrine appreciates their style and character and judges even the fathers of the church with a discreet freedom which often breaks through the superstition of the times The emperor Basil who lamented the defects of his own education intrusted to the care of Photius his son and successor Leo the philosopher and the reign of that prince and of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms one of the most prosperous aeras of the Byzantine literature By their munificence the treasures of antiquity were deposited in the Imperial library by their pens or those of their associates they were imparted in such extracts and abridgments as might amuse the curiosity without oppressing the indolence of the public Besides the Basilics or code of laws the arts of husbandry and war of feeding or destroying the human species were propagated with equal diligence and the history of Greece and Rome was digested into fifty three heads or titles of which two only of embassies and of virtues and vices have escaped the injuries of time In every station the reader might contemplate the image of the past world apply the lesson or warning of each page and learn to admire perhaps to imitate the examples of a brighter period I shall not expatiate on the works of the Byzantine Greeks who by the assiduous study of the ancients have deserved in some measure the remembrance and gratitude of the moderns The scholars of the present age may still enjoy the benefit of the philosophical commonplace book of Stobaeus the grammatical and historical lexicon of Suidas the Chiliads of Tzetzes which comprise six hundred narratives in twelve thousand verses and the commentaries on Homer of Eustathius archbishop of Thessalonica who from his horn of plenty has poured the names and authorities of four hundred writers From these originals and from the numerous tribe of scholiasts and critics one hundred nine some estimate may be formed of the literary wealth of the twelfth century Constantinople was enlightened by the genius of Homer and Demosthenes of Aristotle and Plato and in the enjoyment or neglect of our present riches we must envy the generation that could still peruse the history of Theopompus the orations of Hyperides the comedies of Menander one hundred ten and the odes of Alcaeus and Sappho The frequent labor of illustration attests not only the existence but the popularity of the Grecian classics the general knowledge of the age may be deduced from the example of two learned females the empress Eudocia and the princess Anna Comnena who cultivated in the purple the arts of rhetoric and philosophy

her flatterer may add with truth The princess was conversant with the artful dialogues of Plato and had studied quadrivium of astrology geometry arithmetic and music see he preface to the Alexiad with Ducange s notes In our modern education the painful though necessary attainment of two languages which are no longer living may consume the time and damp the ardor of the youthful student The poets and orators were long imprisoned in the barbarous dialects of our Western ancestors devoid of harmony or grace and their genius without precept or example was abandoned to the rule and native powers of their judgment and fancy But the Greeks of Constantinople after purging away the impurities of their vulgar speech acquired the free use of their ancient language the most happy composition of human art and a familiar knowledge of the sublime masters who had pleased or instructed the first of nations But these advantages only tend to aggravate the reproach and shame of a degenerate people They held in their lifeless hands the riches of their fathers without inheriting the spirit which had created and improved that sacred patrimony they read they praised they compiled but their languid souls seemed alike incapable of thought and action In the revolution of ten centuries not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity or promote the happiness of mankind Not a single idea has been added to the speculative systems of antiquity and a succession of patient disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers of the next servile generation Not a single composition of history philosophy or literature has been saved from oblivion by the intrinsic beauties of style or sentiment of original fancy or even of successful imitation In prose the least offensive of the Byzantine writers are absolved from censure by their naked and unpresuming simplicity but the orators most eloquent one hundred twelve in their own conceit are the farthest removed from the models whom they affect to emulate In every page our taste and reason are wounded by the choice of gigantic and obsolete words a stiff and intricate phraseology the discord of images the childish play of false or unseasonable ornament and the painful attempt to elevate themselves to astonish the reader and to involve a trivial meaning in the smoke of obscurity and exaggeration Their prose is soaring to the vicious affectation of poetry their poetry is sinking below the flatness and insipidity of prose The tragic epic and lyric muses were silent and inglorious the bards of Constantinople seldom rose above a riddle or epigram a panegyric or tale they forgot even the rules of prosody and with the melody of Homer yet sounding in their ears they confound all measure of feet and syllables in the impotent strains which have received the name of political or city verses one hundred thirteen The minds of the Greek were bound in the fetters of a base and imperious superstition which extends her dominion round the circle of profane science Their understandings were bewildered in metaphysical controversy in the belief of visions and miracles they had lost all principles of moral evidence and their taste was vitiates by the homilies of the monks an absurd medley of declamation and Scripture Even these contemptible studies were no longer dignified by the abuse of superior talents the

fourteen As saint Bernard of the Latin so saint John Damascenus in the viiith century is revered as the last father of the Greek church In all the pursuits of active and speculative life the emulation of states and individuals is the most powerful spring of the efforts and improvements of mankind The cities of ancient Greece were cast in the happy mixture of union and independence which is repeated on a larger scale but in a looser form by the nations of modern Europe the union of language religion and manners which renders them the spectators and judges of each other s merit one hundred fifteen the independence of government and interest which asserts their separate freedom and excites them to strive for preeminence in the career of glory The situation of the Romans was less favorable yet in the early ages of the republic which fixed the national character a similar emulation was kindled among the states of Latium and Italy and in the arts and sciences they aspired to equal or surpass their Grecian masters The empire of the Caesars undoubtedly checked the activity and progress of the human mind its magnitude might indeed allow some scope for domestic competition but when it was gradually reduced at first to the East and at last to Greece and Constantinople the Byzantine subjects were degraded to an abject and languid temper the natural effect of their solitary and insulated state From the North they were oppressed by nameless tribes of Barbarians to whom they scarcely imparted the appellation of men The language and religion of the more polished Arabs were an insurmountable bar to all social intercourse The conquerors of Europe were their brethren in the Christian faith but the speech of the Franks or Latins was unknown their manners were rude and they were rarely connected in peace or war with the successors of Heraclius Alone in the universe the self satisfied pride of the Greeks was not disturbed by the comparison of foreign merit and it is no wonder if they fainted in the race since they had neither competitors to urge their speed nor judges to crown their victory The nations of Europe and Asia were mingled by the expeditions to the Holy Land and it is under the Comnenian dynasty that a faint emulation of knowledge and military virtue was rekindled in the Byzantine empire Footnote one hundred fifteen Hume s Essays vol i p one hundred

Propagation In The West The Seeds Character And Consequences Of The Reformation In the profession of Christianity the variety of national characters may be clearly distinguished The natives of Syria and Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world and the wit of the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of metaphysical theology The incomprehensible mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation instead of commanding their silent submission were agitated in vehement and subtile controversies which enlarged their faith at the expense perhaps of their charity and reason From the council of Nice to the end of the seventh century the peace and unity of the church was invaded by these spiritual wars and so deeply did they affect the decline and fall of the empire that the historian has too often been compelled to attend the synods to explore the creeds and to enumerate the sects of this busy period of ecclesiastical annals From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages of the Byzantine empire the sound of controversy was seldom heard curiosity was exhausted zeal was fatigued and in the decrees of six councils the articles of the Catholic faith had been irrevocably defined The spirit of dispute however vain and pernicious requires some energy and exercise of the mental faculties and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast to pray and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his clergy During a long dream of superstition the Virgin and the Saints their visions and miracles their relics and images were preached by the monks and worshipped by the people and the appellation of people might be extended without injustice to the first ranks of civil society At an unseasonable moment the Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their subjects under their influence reason might obtain some proselytes a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible deities and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of orthodoxy In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical rulers were relieved from the toil or deprived of the pleasure of persecution The Pagans had disappeared the Jews were silent and obscure the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote hostilities against a national enemy and the sects of Egypt and Syria enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian caliphs About the middle of the seventh century a branch of Manichaeans was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny their patience was at length exasperated to despair and rebellion and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds of reformation These important events will justify some inquiry into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians one and as they cannot plead for themselves our candid criticism will magnify the good and abate or suspect the evil that is reported by their adversaries Footnote one The errors and virtues of the Paulicians are weighed with his usual judgment and candor by the learned Mosheim Hist Ecclesiast seculum ix p three hundred eleven c He draws his original intelligence from Photius contra Manichaeos l i and Peter Siculus Hist Manichaeorum The first of these accounts has not fallen into my hands the second which Mosheim prefers I have

fourto Note Compare Hallam s Middle Ages p four hundred sixty one four hundred seventy one mister Hallam justly observes that this chapter appears to be accurate as well as luminous and is at least far superior to any modern work on the subject M The Gnostics who had distracted the infancy were oppressed by the greatness and authority of the church Instead of emulating or surpassing the wealth learning and numbers of the Catholics their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East and West and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the Euphrates Some vestige of the Marcionites may be detected in the fifth century two but the numerous sects were finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans and these heretics who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster and Christ were pursued by the two religions with equal and unrelenting hatred Under the grandson of Heraclius in the neighborhood of Samosata more famous for the birth of Lucian than for the title of a Syrian kingdom a reformer arose esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth In his humble dwelling of Mananalis Constantine entertained a deacon who returned from Syrian captivity and received the inestimable gift of the New Testament which was already concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek and perhaps of the Gnostic clergy three These books became the measure of his studies and the rule of his faith and the Catholics who dispute his interpretation acknowledge that his text was genuine and sincere But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to the writings and character of saint Paul the name of the Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and domestic teacher but I am confident that they gloried in their affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles His disciples Titus Timothy Sylvanus Tychicus were represented by Constantine and his fellow laborers the names of the apostolic churches were applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and Cappadocia and this innocent allegory revived the example and memory of the first ages In the Gospel and the Epistles of saint Paul his faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive Christianity and whatever might be the success a Protestant reader will applaud the spirit of the inquiry But if the Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure they were not perfect Their founders rejected the two Epistles of saint Peter four the apostle of the circumcision whose dispute with their favorite for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven five They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt for the Old Testament the books of Moses and the prophets which have been consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church With equal boldness and doubtless with more reason Constantine the new Sylvanus disclaimed the visions which in so many bulky and splendid volumes had been published by the Oriental sects six the fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of the East the spurious gospels epistles and acts which in the first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code the theology of Manes and the authors of the kindred heresies and the thirty generations or aeons which had been created by the fruitful fancy of Valentine The Paulicians sincerely condemned the memory and opinions of the Manichaean sect and complained of the injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple votaries of saint Paul and of Christ Footnote two In the time of Theodoret the diocese of Cyrrhus in Syria contained eight hundred villages Of these two were inhabited by Arians and Eunomians and eight by Marcionites whom the laborious bishop reconciled to the Catholic church Dupin Bibliot

crime the Greeks of the ixth century must have been careless of the credit and honor of the Revelations Footnote five This contention which has not escaped the malice of Porphyry supposes some error and passion in one or both of the apostles By Chrysostom Jerome and Erasmus it is represented as a sham quarrel a pious fraud for the benefit of the Gentiles and the correction of the Jews Middleton s

thirty seven Even in Africa saint Austin could describe the Manichaean books tam multi tam grandes tam pretiosi codices contra Faust xiii fourteen but he adds without pity Incendite omnes illas membranas and his advice had been rigorously followed Of the ecclesiastical chain many links had been broken by the Paulician reformers and their liberty was enlarged as they reduced the number of masters at whose voice profane reason must bow to mystery and miracle The early separation of the Gnostics had preceded the establishment of the Catholic worship and against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion as by the silence of saint Paul and the evangelists The objects which had been transformed by the magic of superstition appeared to the eyes of the Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors An image made without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist to whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their merit or value The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and ashes destitute of life or virtue or of any relation perhaps with the person to whom they were ascribed The true and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber the body and blood of Christ a loaf of bread and a cup of wine the gifts of nature and the symbols of grace The mother of God was degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity and the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the laborious office of meditation in heaven and ministry upon earth In the practice or at least in the theory of the sacraments the Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of worship and the words of the gospel were in their judgment the baptism and communion of the faithful They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation of Scripture and as often as they were pressed by the literal sense they could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory Their utmost diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the Old and the New Testament since they adored the latter as the oracles of God and abhorred the former as the fabulous and absurd invention of men or daemons We cannot be surprised that they should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the Trinity but instead of confessing the human nature and substantial sufferings of Christ they amused their fancy with a celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through a pipe with a fantastic crucifixion that eluded the vain and important malice of the Jews A creed thus simple and spiritual was not adapted to the genius of the times seven and the rational Christian who might have been contented with the light yoke and easy burden of Jesus and his apostles was justly offended that the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God the first article of natural and revealed religion Their belief and their trust was in the Father of Christ of the human soul and of the invisible world But they likewise held the eternity of matter a stubborn and rebellious substance the origin of a second principle of an active being who has created this visible world and exercises his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin eight The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the two principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the East from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various swarms of the Gnostics A thousand shades may be devised in the nature and character of Ahriman from a rival god to a subordinate daemon from passion and frailty to pure and perfect malevolence but in spite of our efforts the goodness and the power of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the line and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal proportion from the other nine Footnote seven The six capital errors of the Paulicians are defined by Peter p seven hundred fifty

iii have labored to explore and discriminate the various systems of the Gnostics on the subject of the two principles The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the number of his disciples the secret recompense of spiritual ambition The remnant of the Gnostic sects and especially the Manichaeans of Armenia were united under his standard many Catholics were converted or seduced by his arguments and he preached with success in the regions of Pontus ten and Cappadocia which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster The Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their Scriptural names by the modest title of Fellow pilgrims by the austerity of their lives their zeal or knowledge and the credit of some extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit But they were incapable of desiring or at least of obtaining the wealth and honors of the Catholic prelacy such anti Christian pride they bitterly censured and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned as an institution of the Jewish synagogue The new sect was loosely spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward of the Euphrates six of their principal congregations represented the churches to which saint Paul had addressed his epistles and their founder chose his residence in the neighborhood of Colonia eleven in the same district of Pontus which had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona twelve and the miracles of Gregory thirteen After a mission of twenty seven years Sylvanus who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs fell a sacrifice to Roman persecution The laws of the pious emperors which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets the books and the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans the books were delivered to the flames and all who should presume to secrete such writings or to profess such opinions were devoted to an ignominious death fourteen A Greek minister armed with legal and military powers appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd and to reclaim if possible the lost sheep By a refinement of cruelty Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of his disciples who were commanded as the price of their pardon and the proof of their repentance to massacre their spiritual father They turned aside from the impious office the stones dropped from their filial hands and of the whole number only one executioner could be found a new David as he is styled by the Catholics who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy This apostate Justin was his name again deceived and betrayed his unsuspecting brethren and a new conformity to the acts of saint Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon like the apostle he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute renounced his honors and fortunes and required among the Paulicians the fame of a missionary and a martyr They were not ambitious of martyrdom fifteen but in a calamitous period of one hundred and fifty years their patience sustained whatever zeal could inflict and power was insufficient to eradicate the obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason From the blood and ashes of the first victims a succession of teachers and congregations repeatedly arose amidst their foreign hostilities they found leisure for domestic quarrels they preached they disputed they suffered and the virtues the apparent virtues of Sergius in a pilgrimage of thirty three years are reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians sixteen The native cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated by a pious cause and he vainly hoped to extinguish in a single conflagration the name and memory of the Paulicians By their primitive simplicity their abhorrence of popular superstition the Iconoclast princes might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines but they themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks and they chose to be the tyrants lest they should be accused as the accomplices of the Manichaeans Such a reproach has sullied the clemency of Nicephorus who relaxed in their favor the severity of the penal statutes nor will his character sustain the honor of a more liberal motive The feeble Michael the First the rigid Leo the Armenian were foremost in the race of persecution but the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion of Theodora who restored the images to the Oriental church Her inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that in a short reign one hundred thousand Paulicians were extirpated by the sword the gibbet or the flames Her guilt or merit has perhaps been stretched beyond the measure of truth but if the account be allowed it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts were punished under a more odious name and that some who were driven from the church unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy Footnote ten The countries between the

susceptible of fear or remorse the justice of their arms hardens them against the feelings of humanity and they revenge their fathers wrongs on the children of their tyrants Such have been the Hussites of Bohemia and the Calvinists of France and such in the ninth century were the Paulicians of Armenia and the adjacent provinces seventeen They were first awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop who exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or destroying the heretics and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected their independence and revenge A more dangerous and consuming flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora and the revolt of Carbeas a valiant Paulician who commanded the guards of the general of the East His father had been impaled by the Catholic inquisitors and religion or at least nature might justify his desertion and revenge Five thousand of his brethren were united by the same motives they renounced the allegiance of anti Christian Rome a Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the caliph and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to the implacable enemy of the Greeks In the mountains between Siwas and Trebizond he founded or fortified the city of Tephrice eighteen which is still occupied by a fierce or licentious people and the neighboring hills were covered with the Paulician fugitives who now reconciled the use of the Bible and the sword During more than thirty years Asia was afflicted by the calamities of foreign and domestic war in their hostile inroads the disciples of saint Paul were joined with those of Mahomet and the peaceful Christians the aged parent and tender virgin who were delivered into barbarous servitude might justly accuse the intolerant spirit of their sovereign So urgent was the mischief so intolerable the shame that even the dissolute Michael the son of Theodora was compelled to march in person against the Paulicians he was defeated under the walls of Samosata and the Roman emperor fled before the heretics whom his mother had condemned to the flames The Saracens fought under the same banners but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas and the captive generals with more than a hundred tribunes were either released by his avarice or tortured by his fanaticism The valor and ambition of Chrysocheir nineteen his successor embraced a wider circle of rapine and revenge In alliance with his faithful Moslems he boldly penetrated into the heart of Asia the troops of the frontier and the palace were repeatedly overthrown the edicts of persecution were answered by the pillage of Nice and Nicomedia of Ancyra and Ephesus nor could the apostle saint John protect from violation his city and sepulchre The cathedral of Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules and horses and the Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt and abhorrence of images and relics It is not unpleasing to observe the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had disdained the prayers of an injured people The emperor Basil the Macedonian was reduced to sue for peace to offer a ransom for the captives and to request in the language of moderation and charity that Chrysocheir would spare his fellow Christians and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and silk garments If the emperor replied the insolent fanatic be desirous of peace let him abdicate the East and reign without molestation in the West If he refuse the servants of the Lord will precipitate him from the throne The reluctant Basil suspended the treaty accepted the defiance and led his army into the land of heresy which he wasted with fire and sword The open country of the Paulicians was exposed to the same calamities which they had inflicted but when he had explored the strength of Tephrice the multitude of the Barbarians and the ample magazines of arms and provisions he desisted with a sigh from the hopeless siege On his return to Constantinople he labored by the foundation of convents and churches to secure the aid of his celestial patrons of Michael the archangel and the prophet Elijah and it was his daily prayer that he might live to transpierce with three arrows the head of his impious adversary Beyond his expectations the wish was accomplished after a successful inroad Chrysocheir was surprised and slain in his retreat and the rebel s head was triumphantly presented at the foot of the throne On the reception of this welcome trophy Basil instantly called for his bow discharged three arrows with unerring aim and accepted the applause of the court who hailed the victory of the royal archer With Chrysocheir the glory of the Paulicians faded and withered twenty on the second expedition of the emperor the impregnable Tephrice was deserted by the heretics who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders The city was ruined but the spirit of independence survived in the mountains the Paulicians defended above a century their

Chapter LIV Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians Part II About the middle of the eight century Constantine surnamed Copronymus by the worshippers of images had made an expedition into Armenia and found in the cities of Melitene and Theodosiopolis a great number of Paulicians his kindred heretics As a favor or punishment he transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and Thrace and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in Europe twenty one If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled with the promiscuous mass those of the country struck a deep root in a foreign soil The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms of persecution maintained a secret correspondence with their Armenian brethren and gave aid and comfort to their preachers who solicited not without success the infant faith of the Bulgarians twenty two In the tenth century they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful colony which John Zimisces twenty three transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount Haemus The Oriental clergy who would have preferred the destruction impatiently sighed for the absence of the Manichaeans the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valor their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief but on the side of the Danube against the Barbarians of Scythia their service might be useful and their loss would be desirable Their exile in a distant land was softened by a free toleration the Paulicians held the city of Philippopolis and the keys of Thrace the Catholics were their subjects the Jacobite emigrants their associates they occupied a line of villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus and many native Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire and the courage of these dogs ever greedy of war ever thirsty of human blood is noticed with astonishment and almost with reproach by the pusillanimous Greeks The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious they were easily provoked by caprice or injury and their privileges were often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy In the midst of the Norman war two thousand five hundred Manichaeans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus twenty four and retired to their native homes He dissembled till the moment of revenge invited the chiefs to a friendly conference and punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment confiscation and baptism In an interval of peace the emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church and state his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis and the thirteenth apostle as he is styled by his pious daughter consumed whole days and nights in theological controversy His arguments were fortified their obstinacy was melted by the honors and rewards which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes and a new city surrounded with gardens enriched with immunities and dignified with his own name was founded by Alexius for the residence of his vulgar converts The important station of Philippopolis was wrested from their hands the contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon or banished from their country and their lives were spared by the prudence rather than the mercy of an emperor at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt alive before the church of saint Sophia twenty five But the proud hope of eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by the invincible zeal of the Paulicians who ceased to dissemble or refused to obey After the departure and death of Alexius they soon resumed their civil and religious laws In the beginning of the thirteenth century their pope or primate a manifest corruption resided on the confines of Bulgaria Croatia and Dalmatia and governed by his vicars the filial congregations of Italy and France twenty six From that aera a minute scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition At the end of the last age the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount Haemus where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government The modern Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin and their religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross and the practice of bloody sacrifice which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary twenty seven Footnote twenty one Copronymus transported his heretics and thus says

the Manichaean theology had been repulsed by the people or suppressed by the prince The favor and success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be imputed to the strong though secret discontent which armed the most pious Christians against the church of Rome Her avarice was oppressive her despotism odious less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the worship of saints and images her innovations were more rapid and scandalous she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of transubstantiation the lives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt and the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles if they were compared with the lordly prelates who wielded by turns the crosier the sceptre and the sword Three different roads might introduce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe After the conversion of Hungary the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the course of the Danube in their journey and return they passed through Philippopolis and the sectaries disguising their name and heresy might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective countries The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the Adriatic and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of every climate and religion Under the Byzantine standard the Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily in peace and war they freely conversed with strangers and natives and their opinions were silently propagated in Rome Milan and the kingdoms beyond the Alps twenty eight It was soon discovered that many thousand Catholics of every rank and of either sex had embraced the Manichaean heresy and the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the first act and signal of persecution The Bulgarians twenty nine a name so innocent in its origin so odious in its application spread their branches over the face of Europe United in common hatred of idolatry and Rome they were connected by a form of episcopal and presbyterian government their various sects were discriminated by some fainter or darker shades of theology but they generally agreed in the two principles the contempt of the Old Testament and the denial of the body of Christ either on the cross or in the eucharist A confession of simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their enemies and so high was their standard of perfection that the increasing congregations were divided into two classes of disciples of those who practised and of those who aspired It was in the country of the Albigeois thirty in the southern provinces of France that the Paulicians were most deeply implanted and the same vicissitudes of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed in the neighborhood of the Euphrates were repeated in the thirteenth century on the banks of the Rhone The laws of the Eastern emperors were revived by Frederic the Second The insurgents of Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc Pope Innocent III surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora It was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of the Crusades and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by the founders of the Inquisition thirty one an office more adapted to confirm than to refute the belief of an evil principle The visible assemblies of the Paulicians or Albigeois were extirpated by fire and sword and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight concealment or Catholic conformity But the invincible spirit which they had kindled still lived and breathed in the Western world In the state in the church and even in the cloister a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of saint Paul who protested against the tyranny of Rome embraced the Bible as the rule of faith and purified their creed from all the visions of the Gnostic theology three thousand one hundred eleven The struggles of Wickliff in England of Huss in Bohemia were premature and ineffectual but the names of Zuinglius Luther and Calvin are pronounced with gratitude as the deliverers of nations Footnote twenty eight The introduction of the Paulicians into Italy and France is amply discussed by Muratori Antiquitat Italiae Medii Aevi tom v dissert lx p eighty one one hundred fifty two and Mosheim p three hundred seventy nine three hundred eighty two four hundred nineteen four hundred twenty

pages only fifteen men and four women were delivered to the secular arm Footnote three thousand one hundred eleven The popularity of Milner s History of the Church with some readers may make it proper to observe that his attempt to exculpate the Paulicians from the charge of Gnosticism or Manicheism is in direct defiance if not in ignorance of all the original authorities Gibbon himself it appears was not acquainted with the work of Photius Contra Manicheos Repullulantes the first book of which was edited by Montfaucon Bibliotheca Coisliniana pars ii p three hundred forty nine three hundred seventy five the whole by Wolf in his Anecdota Graeca Hamburg seventeen twenty two Compare a very sensible tract Letter to reverend S R Maitland by J G Dowling M A London eighteen thirty five M A philosopher who calculates the degree of their merit and the value of their reformation will prudently ask from what articles of faith above or against our reason they have enfranchised the Christians for such enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be compatible with truth and piety After a fair discussion we shall rather be surprised by the timidity than scandalized by the freedom of our first reformers thirty two With the Jews they adopted the belief and defence of all the Hebrew Scriptures with all their prodigies from the garden of Eden to the visions of the prophet Daniel and they were bound like the Catholics to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine law In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the reformers were severely orthodox they freely adopted the theology of the four or the six first councils and with the Athanasian creed they pronounced the eternal damnation of all who did not believe the Catholic faith Transubstantiation the invisible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and pleasantry but instead of consulting the evidence of their senses of their sight their feeling and their taste the first Protestants were entangled in their own scruples and awed by the words of Jesus in the institution of the sacrament Luther maintained a corporeal and Calvin a real presence of Christ in the eucharist and the opinion of Zuinglius that it is no more than a spiritual communion a simple memorial has slowly prevailed in the reformed churches thirty three But the loss of one mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of original sin redemption faith grace and predestination which have been strained from the epistles of saint Paul These subtile questions had most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and schoolmen but the final improvement and popular use may be attributed to the first reformers who enforced them as the absolute and essential terms of salvation Hitherto the weight of supernatural belief inclines against the Protestants and many a sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant Footnote thirty two The opinions and proceedings of the reformers are exposed in the second part of the general history of Mosheim but the balance which he has held with so clear an eye and so steady a hand begins to incline in favor of his Lutheran brethren Footnote thirty three Under Edward VI our reformation was more bold and perfect but in the fundamental articles of the church of England a strong and explicit declaration against the real presence was obliterated in the original copy to please the people or the Lutherans or Queen Elizabeth Burnet s History of the Reformation vol ii p eighty two one hundred twenty eight three hundred two Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and important and the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts thirty four I By their hands the lofty fabric of superstition from the abuse of indulgences to the intercesson of the Virgin has been levelled with the ground Myriads of both sexes of the monastic profession were restored to the liberty and labors of social life A hierarchy of saints and angels of imperfect and subordinate deities were stripped of their temporal power and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial happiness their images and relics were banished from the church and the credulity of the people was no longer nourished with the daily repetition of miracles and visions The imitation of Paganism was supplied by a pure and spiritual worship of prayer and thanksgiving the most worthy of man the least unworthy of the Deity It only remains to observe whether such sublime simplicity be consistent with popular devotion whether the vulgar in the absence of all visible objects will not be inflamed by enthusiasm or insensibly subside in languor and indifference II The chain of authority was broken which restrains the bigot from thinking as he pleases and the slave from speaking as he thinks the popes fathers and councils were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the world and each Christian was taught to acknowledge no law but the Scriptures no interpreter but his own conscience This freedom however was the consequence rather than the design of the Reformation The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding the tyrants whom they had dethroned They imposed with equal rigor their creeds and confessions they asserted the right of the magistrate to punish heretics with death The pious or personal animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus thirty five the guilt of his own rebellion thirty six and the flames of Smithfield in which he was afterwards consumed had been kindled for the Anabaptists by the zeal of Cranmer thirty seven The nature of the tiger wa s the same but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs A spiritual and temporal kingdom was possessed by the Roman pontiff the Protestant doctors were subjects of an humble rank without revenue or jurisdiction His decrees were consecrated by the antiquity of the Catholic church their arguments and disputes were submitted to the people and their appeal to private judgment was accepted beyond their wishes by curiosity and enthusiasm Since the days of Luther and Calvin a secret reformation has been silently working in the bosom of the reformed churches many weeds of prejudice were eradicated and the disciples of Erasmus thirty eight diffused a spirit of freedom and moderation The liberty of conscience has been claimed as a common benefit an inalienable right thirty nine the free governments of Holland forty and England forty one introduced the practice of toleration and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the prudence and humanity of the times In the exercise the mind has understood the limits of its powers and the words and shadows that might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly reason The volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs the doctrine of a Protestant church is far removed from the knowledge or belief of its private members and the forms of orthodoxy the articles of faith are subscribed with a sigh or a smile by the modern clergy Yet the friends of Christianity are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished the web of mystery is unravelled by the Arminians Arians and Socinians whose number must not be computed from their separate congregations and the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those men who preserve the name without the substance of religion who indulge the license without the temper of philosophy forty two four thousand two hundred eleven Footnote thirty four Had it not been for such men as Luther and myself said the fanatic Whiston to Halley the philosopher you would now be kneeling before an image of saint Winifred Footnote thirty five The article of Servet in the Dictionnaire Critique of Chauffepie is the best account which I have seen of this shameful transaction See likewise the Abbe d Artigny Nouveaux Memoires d Histoire c tom ii p fifty five one hundred fifty four Footnote thirty six I am more deeply scandalized at the single execution of Servetus than at the hecatombs which have blazed in the Auto de Fes of Spain and Portugal one The zeal of Calvin seems to have been envenomed by personal malice and perhaps envy He accused his adversary before their common enemies the judges of Vienna and betrayed for his destruction the sacred trust of a private correspondence two The deed of cruelty was not varnished by the pretence of danger to the church or state In his passage through Geneva Servetus was a harmless stranger who neither preached nor printed nor made proselytes three A Catholic inquisition yields the same obedience which he requires but Calvin violated the golden rule of doing as he would be done by a rule which I read in a moral treatise of Isocrates in Nicocle tom i p ninety three edit Battie four hundred years before the publication of the Gospel Note Gibbon has not accurately rendered the sense of this passage which does not contain the maxim of charity Do unto others as you would they should do unto you but simply

could not possibly be compressed into a note and would indeed embrace the whole religious and irreligious history of the time which has elapsed since Gibbon wrote M Chapter LV The Bulgarians The

Syria Egypt and Africa the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of defending their capital against the Saracens If in the account of this interesting people I have deviated from the

their decay the Arabians press themselves on our curiosity the first overthrow of the church and empire of the Greeks may be imputed to their arms and the disciples of Mahomet still hold the civil and religious sceptre of the Oriental world But the same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the swarms of savages who between the seventh and the twelfth century descended from the plains of Scythia in transient inroad or perpetual emigration one Their names are uncouth their origins doubtful their actions obscure their superstition was blind their valor brutal and the uniformity of their public and private lives was neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy The majesty of the Byzantine throne repelled and survived their disorderly attacks the greater part of these Barbarians has disappeared without leaving any memorial of their existence and the despicable remnant continues and may long continue to groan under the dominion of a foreign tyrant From the antiquities of I Bulgarians II Hungarians and III Russians I shall content myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be remembered The conquests of the IV Normans and the monarchy of the V Turks will naturally terminate in the memorable Crusades to the Holy Land and the double fall of the city and empire of Constantine Footnote one All the passages of the Byzantine history which relate to the

suspected that the same or a similar appellation was revived by strange colonies from the Borysthenes the Tanais or the Volga A king of the ancient Bulgaria bequeathed to his five sons a last lesson of moderation and concord It was received as youth has ever received the counsels of age and experience the five princes buried their father divided his subjects and cattle forgot his advice separated from each other and wandered in quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart of Italy under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna four But the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the capital The modern Bulgaria along the southern banks of the Danube was stamped with the name and image which it has retained to the present hour the new conquerors successively acquired by war or treaty the Roman provinces of Dardania Thessaly and the two Epirus five the ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from the native city of Justinian and in their prosperous age the obscure town of Lychnidus or Achrida was honored with the throne of a king and a patriarch six The unquestionable evidence of language attests the descent of the Bulgarians from the original stock of

the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small acknowledgment of their fidelity to the Roman empire and to appease by an annual tribute the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians The kingdom of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans or feudatory lords and their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and one hundred thousand foot A long sea coast indented with capacious harbors covered with a string of islands and almost in sight of the Italian shores disposed both the natives and strangers to the practice of navigation The boats or brigantines of the Croats were constructed after the fashion of the old Liburnians one hundred and eighty vessels may excite the idea of a respectable navy but our seamen will smile at the allowance of ten or twenty or forty men for each of these ships

treaty his enemies collected their spirits and their forces the passes of retreat were insuperably barred and the trembling Nicephorus was heard to exclaim Alas alas unless we could assume the wings of birds we cannot hope to escape Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of despair but on the morning of the third the Bulgarians surprised the camp and the Roman prince with the great officers of the empire were slaughtered in their tents The body of Valens had been saved from insult but the head of Nicephorus was exposed on a spear and his skull enchased with gold was often replenished in the feasts of victory The Greeks bewailed the dishonor of the throne but they acknowledged the just punishment of avarice and cruelty This savage cup was deeply tinctured with the manners of the Scythian wilderness but they were softened before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with the Greeks the possession of a cultivated region and the introduction of the Christian worship The nobles of Bulgaria were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople and Simeon fourteen a youth of the royal line was instructed in the rhetoric of Demosthenes and the logic of Aristotle He relinquished the profession of a monk for that of a king and warrior and in his reign of more than forty years Bulgaria assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth The Greeks whom he repeatedly attacked derived a faint consolation from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and sacrilege They purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks but Simeon in a second battle redeemed the loss of the first at a time when it was esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation The Servians were overthrown made captive and dispersed and those who visited the country before their restoration could discover no more than fifty vagrants without women or children who extorted a precarious subsistence from the chase On classic ground on the banks of Achelous the greeks were defeated their horn was broken by the strength of the Barbaric Hercules fifteen He formed the siege of Constantinople and in a personal conference with the emperor Simeon imposed the conditions of peace They met with the most jealous precautions the royal gallery was drawn close to an artificial and well fortified platform and the majesty of the purple was emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian Are you a Christian said the humble Romanus it is your duty to abstain from the blood of your fellow Christians Has the thirst of riches seduced you from the blessings of peace Sheathe your sword open your hand and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires The reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance the freedom of trade was granted or restored the first honors of the court were secured to the friends of Bulgaria above the ambassadors of enemies or strangers sixteen and her princes were dignified with the high and invidious title of Basileus or emperor But this friendship was soon disturbed after the death of Simeon the nations were again in arms his feeble successors were divided and extinguished and in the beginning of the eleventh century the second Basil who was born in the purple deserved the appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians His avarice was in some measure gratified by a treasure of four hundred thousand pounds sterling ten thousand pounds weight of gold which he found in the palace of Lychnidus His cruelty inflicted a cool and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been guilty of the defence of their country They were deprived of sight but to one of each hundred a single eye was left that he might conduct his blind century to the presence of their king Their king is said to have expired of grief and horror the nation was awed by this terrible example the Bulgarians were swept away from their settlements and circumscribed within a narrow province the surviving chiefs bequeathed to their children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge Footnote thirteen The first kingdom of the Bulgarians may be found under the proper dates in the Annals of Cedrenus and Zonaras The Byzantine

of the Scriptures the signs and forerunners of the end of the world seventeen Since the introduction of letters they have explored their own antiquities with a strong and laudable impulse of patriotic curiosity eighteen Their rational criticism can no longer be amused with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns but they complain that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar war that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since forgotten and that the fragments of a rude chronicle nineteen must be painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign intelligence of the imperial geographer twenty Magiar is the national and oriental denomination of the Hungarians but among the tribes of Scythia they are distinguished by the Greeks under the proper and peculiar name of Turks as the descendants of that mighty people who had conquered and reigned from China to the Volga The Pannonian colony preserved a correspondence of trade and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines of Persia and after a separation of three hundred and fifty years the missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their ancient country near the banks of the Volga They were hospitably entertained by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the name of Hungarians conversed in their native tongue recollected a tradition of their long lost brethren and listened with amazement to the marvellous tale of their new kingdom and religion The zeal of conversion was animated by the interest of consanguinity and one of the greatest of their princes had formed the generous though fruitless design of replenishing the solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the heart of Tartary twenty one From this primitive country they were driven to the West by the tide of war and emigration by the weight of the more distant tribes who at the same time were fugitives and conquerors twenty one eleven Reason or fortune directed their course towards the frontiers of the Roman empire they halted in the usual stations along the banks of the great rivers and in the territories of Moscow Kiow and Moldavia some vestiges have been discovered of their temporary residence In this long and various peregrination they could not always escape the dominion of the stronger and the purity of their blood was improved or sullied by the mixture of a foreign race from a motive of compulsion or choice several tribes of the Chazars were associated to the standard of their ancient vassals introduced the use of a second language and obtained by their superior renown the most honorable place in the front of battle The military force of the Turks and their allies marched in seven equal and artificial divisions each division was formed of thirty thousand eight hundred and fifty seven warriors and the proportion of women children and servants supposes and requires at least a million of emigrants Their public counsels were directed by seven vayvods or hereditary chiefs but the experience of discord and weakness recommended the more simple and vigorous administration of a single person The sceptre which had been declined by the modest Lebedias was granted to the birth or merit of Almus and his son Arpad and the authority of the supreme khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of the prince and people of the people to obey his commands of the prince to consult their happiness and glory Footnote seventeen A bishop of Wurtzburgh submitted his opinion to a reverend abbot but he more gravely decided that Gog and Magog were the spiritual persecutors of

intoxicated with the wines of the Danube and the wretched fugitives who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar circle Arms and freedom have ever been the ruling though too often the unsuccessful passion of the Hungarians who are endowed by nature with a vigorous constitution of soul and body twenty seven Extreme cold has diminished the stature and congealed the faculties of the Laplanders and

philosophy their brutal ignorance Chapter LV The Bulgarians The Hungarians And The Russians Part II It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Tactics twenty nine that all the Scythian hordes resembled each other in their pastoral and military life that they all practised the same means of subsistence and employed the same instruments of destruction But he adds that the two nations of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to their brethren and similar to each other in the improvements however rude of their discipline and government their visible likeness determines Leo to confound his friends and enemies in one common description and the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries of the tenth century Except the merit and fame of military prowess all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to these Barbarians whose native fierceness was stimulated by the consciousness of numbers and freedom The tents of the Hungarians were of leather their garments of fur they shaved their hair and scarified their faces in speech they were slow in action prompt in treaty perfidious and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn engagements Their simplicity has been praised yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known whatever they saw they coveted their desires were insatiate and their sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine By the definition of a pastoral nation I have recalled a long description of the economy the warfare and the government that prevail in that state of society I may add that to fishing as well as to the chase the Hungarians were indebted for a part of their subsistence and since they seldom cultivated the ground they must at least in their new settlements have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful husbandry In their emigrations perhaps in their expeditions the host was accompanied by thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of formidable dust and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of milk and animal food A plentiful command of forage was the first care of the general and if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the enemy After some experience of the Roman tactics they adopted the use of the sword and spear the helmet of the soldier and the iron breastplate of his steed but their native and deadly weapon was the Tartar bow from the earliest infancy their children and servants were exercised in the double science of archery and horsemanship their arm was strong their aim was sure and in the most rapid career they were taught to throw themselves backwards and to shoot a volley of arrows into the air In open combat in secret ambush in flight or pursuit they were equally formidable an appearance of order was maintained in the foremost ranks but their charge was driven forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds They pursued headlong and rash with loosened reins and horrific outcries but if they fled with real or dissembled fear the ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution In the abuse of victory they astonished Europe yet smarting from the wounds of the Saracen and the Dane mercy they rarely asked and more rarely bestowed both sexes were accused is equally inaccessible to pity and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular tale that they drank the blood and feasted on the hearts of the slain Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those principles of justice and humanity which nature has implanted in every bosom The license of public and private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments and in the security of an open camp theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence Among the Barbarians there were many whose spontaneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manners who performed the duties and sympathized with the affections of social life Footnote twenty nine Leo has observed that the government of the Turks was monarchical and that their punishments were rigorous Tactic p eight hundred ninety six Rhegino in Chron A D eight hundred eighty nine mentions theft as a capital crime and his jurisprudence is confirmed by the original code of saint Stephen A D ten sixteen If a slave were guilty he was chastised for the first time with the loss of his nose or a fine of five heifers for the second with the loss of his ears or a similar fine for the third with death which the freeman did not incur till the fourth offence as his first penalty was the loss of liberty Katona Hist Regum Hungar tom i p two hundred thirty one two hundred thirty two After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory the Turkish hordes approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires Their first conquests and final settlements extended on either side of the Danube above Vienna below Belgrade and beyond the measure of the Roman province of Pannonia or the modern kingdom of Hungary thirty That ample and fertile land was loosely occupied by the Moravians a Sclavonian name and tribe which were driven by the invaders into the compass of a narrow province Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire as far as the edge of Transylvania but after the failure of his legitimate line the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and tribute to the monarchs of Oriental France The bastard Arnulph was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks they rushed through the real or figurative wall which his indiscretion had thrown open and the king of Germany has been justly reproached as a traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the Christians During the life of Arnulph the Hungarians were checked by gratitude or fear but in the infancy of his son Lewis they discovered and invaded Bavaria and such was their Scythian speed that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians maintained their advantage till the seventh hour of the day they were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the Turkish cavalry The conflagration spread over the provinces of Bavaria Swabia and Franconia and the Hungarians thirty one promoted the reign of anarchy by forcing the stoutest barons to discipline their vassals and fortify their castles The origin of walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period nor could any distance be secure against an enemy who almost at the same instant laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of saint Gall and the city of Bremen on the shores of the northern ocean Above thirty years the Germanic empire or kingdom was subject to the ignominy of tribute and resistance was disarmed by the menace the serious and effectual menace of dragging the women and children into captivity and of slaughtering the males above the age of ten years I have neither power nor inclination to follow the Hungarians beyond the Rhine but I must observe with surprise that the southern provinces of France were blasted by the tempest and that Spain behind her Pyrenees was astonished at the approach of these formidable strangers thirty two The vicinity of Italy had tempted their early inroads but from their camp on the Brenta they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and populousness of the new discovered country They requested leave to retire their request was proudly rejected by the Italian king and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness Among the cities of the West the royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor and the preeminence of Rome itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles The Hungarians appeared Pavia was in flames forty three churches were consumed and after the massacre of the people they spared about two hundred wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver a vague exaggeration from the smoking ruins of their country In these annual excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua the churches that yet escaped resounded with a fearful litany O save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians But the saints were deaf or inexorable and the torrent rolled forwards till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria thirty three A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each Italian subject and ten bushels of silver were poured forth in the Turkish camp But falsehood is the natural antagonist of violence and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the metal On the side of the East the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the equal arms of the Bulgarians whose faith forbade an alliance with the Pagans and whose situation formed the barrier of the Byzantine empire The barrier was overturned the emperor of Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks and one of their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle axe into the golden gate The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the assault but the Hungarians might boast in their retreat that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the majesty of the Caesars thirty four The remote and rapid operations of the same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the Turks but their courage is most deserving of praise since a light troop of three or four hundred horse would often attempt and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica and Constantinople At this disastrous aera of the ninth and tenth centuries Europe was afflicted by a triple scourge from the North the East and the South the Norman the Hungarian and the Saracen sometimes trod the same ground of desolation and these savage foes might have

invasion of his country but his mind was vigorous and his prudence successful My companions said he on the morning of the combat maintain your ranks receive on your bucklers the first arrows of the Pagans and prevent their second discharge by the equal and rapid career of your lances They obeyed and conquered and the historical picture of the castle of Merseburgh expressed the features or at least the character of Henry who in an age of ignorance intrusted to the finer arts the perpetuity of his name thirty seven At the end of twenty years the children of the Turks who had fallen by his sword invaded the empire of his son and their force is defined in the lowest estimate at one hundred thousand horse They were invited by domestic faction the gates of Germany were treacherously unlocked and they spread far beyond the Rhine and the Meuse into the heart of Flanders But the vigor and prudence of Otho dispelled the conspiracy the princes were made sensible that unless they were true to each other their religion and country were irrecoverably lost and the national powers were reviewed in the plains of Augsburgh They marched and fought in eight legions according to the division of provinces and tribes the first second and third were composed of Bavarians the fourth of Franconians the fifth of Saxons under the immediate command of the monarch the sixth and seventh consisted of Swabians and the eighth legion of a thousand Bohemians closed the rear of the host The resources of discipline and valor were fortified by the arts of superstition which on this occasion may deserve the epithets of generous and salutary The soldiers were purified with a fast the camp was blessed with the relics of saints and martyrs and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of Constantine grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne and waved the banner of saint Maurice the praefect of the Thebaean legion But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance thirty eight whose point was fashioned of the nails of the cross and which his father had extorted from the king of Burgundy by the threats of war and the gift of a province The Hungarians were expected in the front they secretly passed the Lech a river of Bavaria that falls into the Danube turned the rear of the Christian army plundered the baggage and disordered the legion of Bohemia and Swabia The battle was restored by the Franconians whose duke the valiant Conrad was pierced with an arrow as he rested from his fatigues the Saxons fought under the eyes of their king and his victory surpassed in merit and importance the triumphs of the last two hundred years The loss of the Hungarians was still greater in the flight than in the action they were encompassed by the rivers of Bavaria and their past cruelties excluded them from the hope of mercy Three captive princes were hanged at Ratisbon the multitude of prisoners was slain or mutilated and the fugitives who presumed to appear in the face of their country were condemned to everlasting poverty and disgrace thirty nine Yet the spirit of the nation was humbled and the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with a ditch and rampart Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and peace the robbers of the West acquiesced in a sedentary life and the next generation was taught by a discerning prince that far more might be gained by multiplying and exchanging the produce of a fruitful soil The native race the Turkish or Fennic blood was mingled with new colonies of Scythian or Sclavonian origin forty many thousands of robust and industrious captives had been imported from all the countries of Europe forty one and after the marriage of Geisa with a Bavarian princess he bestowed honors and estates on the nobles of Germany forty two The son of Geisa was invested with the regal title and the house of Arpad reigned three hundred years in the kingdom of Hungary But the freeborn Barbarians were not dazzled

great duke or chagan or czar of the Russians In their journey to Constantinople they had traversed many hostile nations and they hoped to escape the dangers of their return by requesting the French monarch to transport them by sea to their native country A closer examination detected their origin they were the brethren of the Swedes and Normans whose name was already odious and formidable in France and it might justly be apprehended that these Russian strangers were not the messengers of peace but the emissaries of war They were detained while the Greeks were dismissed and Lewis expected a more satisfactory account that he might obey the laws of hospitality or prudence according to the interest of both empires forty four This Scandinavian origin of the people or at least the princes of Russia may be confirmed and illustrated by the national annals forty five and the general history of the North The Normans who had so long been concealed by a veil of impenetrable darkness suddenly burst forth in the spirit of naval and military enterprise The vast and as it is said the populous regions of Denmark Sweden and Norway were crowded with independent chieftains and desperate adventurers who sighed in the laziness of peace and smiled in the agonies of death Piracy was the exercise the trade the glory and the virtue of the Scandinavian youth Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits they started from the banquet grasped their arms sounded their horn ascended their vessels and explored every coast that promised either spoil or settlement The Baltic was the first scene of their naval achievements they visited the eastern shores the silent residence of Fennic and Sclavonic tribes and the primitive Russians of the Lake Ladoga paid a tribute the skins of white squirrels to these strangers whom they saluted with the title of Varangians forty six or Corsairs Their superiority in arms discipline and renown commanded the fear and reverence of the natives In their wars against the more inland savages the Varangians condescended to serve as friends and auxiliaries and gradually by choice or conquest obtained the dominion of a people whom they were qualified to protect Their tyranny was expelled their valor was again recalled till at length Ruric a Scandinavian chief became the father of a dynasty which reigned above seven hundred years His

seventy five three hundred eleven As long as the descendants of Ruric were considered as aliens and conquerors they ruled by the sword of the Varangians distributed estates and subjects to their faithful captains and supplied their numbers with fresh streams of adventurers from the Baltic coast forty seven But when the Scandinavian chiefs had struck a deep and permanent root into the soil they mingled with the Russians in blood religion and language and the first Waladimir had the merit of delivering his country from these foreign mercenaries They had seated him on the throne his riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands but they listened to his pleasing advice that they should seek not a more grateful but a more wealthy master that they should embark for Greece where instead of the skins of squirrels silk and gold would be the recompense of their service At the same time the Russian prince admonished his Byzantine ally to disperse and employ to recompense and restrain these impetuous children of the North Contemporary writers have recorded the introduction name and character of the Varangians each day they rose in confidence and esteem the whole body was assembled at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards and their strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen from the Island of Thule On this occasion the vague appellation of Thule is applied to England and the new Varangians were a colony of English and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman conqueror The habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the countries of the earth these exiles were entertained in the Byzantine court and they preserved till the last age of the empire the inheritance of spotless loyalty and the use of the Danish or English tongue With their broad and double edged battle axes on their shoulders they attended the Greek emperor to the temple the senate and the hippodrome he slept and feasted under their trusty guard and the keys of the palace the treasury and the capital were held by the firm and faithful hands of the Varangians forty eight Footnote forty seven Yet as late as the year ten eighteen Kiow and Russia were still

Codinus maintains them till the fifteenth century in the use of their native English In the tenth century the geography of Scythia was extended far beyond the limits of ancient knowledge and the monarchy of the Russians obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of Constantine forty nine The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir or Moscow and if they were confined on that side by the hordes of the East their western frontier in those early days was enlarged to the Baltic Sea and the country of the Prussians Their northern reign ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean regions which fancy had peopled with monsters or clouded with eternal darkness To the south they followed the course of the Borysthenes and approached with that river the neighborhood of the Euxine Sea The tribes that dwelt or wandered in this ample circuit were obedient to the same conqueror and insensibly blended into the same nation The language of Russia is a dialect of the Sclavonian but in the tenth century these two modes of speech were different from each other and as the Sclavonian prevailed in the South it may be presumed that the original Russians of the North the primitive subjects of the Varangian chief were a portion of the Fennic race With the emigration union or dissolution of the wandering tribes the loose and indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually shifted But the most ancient map of Russia affords some places which still retain their name and position and the two capitals Novogorod fifty and Kiow fifty one are coeval with the first age of the monarchy Novogorod had not yet deserved the epithet of great nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League which diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of freedom Kiow could not yet boast of three hundred churches an innumerable people and a degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the Caesars In their origin the two cities were no more than camps or fairs the most convenient stations in which the Barbarians might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade Yet even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of society a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern provinces and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the sea and land from the Baltic to the Euxine from the mouth of the Oder to the port of Constantinople In the days of idolatry and barbarism the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and enriched by the Normans who had prudently secured a free mart of purchase and exchange fifty two From this harbor at the entrance of the Oder the corsair or merchant sailed in forty three days to the eastern shores of the Baltic the most distant nations were intermingled and the holy groves of Curland are said to have been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold fifty three Between the sea and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered in the summer through a gulf a lake and a navigable river in the winter season over the hard and level surface of boundless snows From the neighborhood of that city the Russians descended the streams that fall into the Borysthenes their canoes of a single tree were laden with slaves of every age furs of every species the spoil of their beehives and the hides of their cattle and the whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the magazines of Kiow The month of June was the ordinary season of the departure of the fleet the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats and they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks which traverse the bed and precipitate the waters of the river At the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels but the deeper cataracts were impassable and the mariners who dragged their vessels and their slaves six miles over land were exposed in this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert fifty four At the first island below the falls the Russians celebrated the festival of their escape at a second near the mouth of the river they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and more perilous voyage of the Black Sea If they steered along the coast the Danube was accessible with a fair wind they could reach in thirty six or forty hours the opposite shores of Anatolia and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the strangers of the North They returned at the stated season with a rich cargo of corn wine and oil the manufactures of Greece and the spices of India Some of their countrymen resided in the capital and provinces and the national treaties protected the persons effects

ii p seven hundred seventy Chapter LV The Bulgarians The Hungarians And The Russians Part III But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit was soon abused for the injury of mankind In a period of one hundred and ninety years the Russians made four attempts to plunder the treasures of Constantinople the event was various but the motive the means and the object were the same in these naval expeditions fifty six The Russian traders had seen the magnificence and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars A marvellous tale and a scanty supply excited the desires of their savage countrymen they envied the gifts of nature which their climate denied they coveted the works of art which they were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase the Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean fifty seven The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century in the fleets of the Cossacks which issued from the Borysthenes to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose fifty eight The Greek appellation of monoxyla or single canoes might justly be applied to the bottom of their vessels It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either side with planks till it attained the length of sixty and the height of about twelve feet These boats were built without a deck but with two rudders and a mast to move with sails and oars and to contain from forty to seventy men with their arms and provisions of fresh water and salt fish The first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred boats but when the national force was exerted they might arm against Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels Their fleet was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon but it was magnified in the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its strength and numbers Had the Greek emperors been endowed with foresight to discern and vigor to prevent perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes Their indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a piratical war which after an interval of six hundred years again infested the Euxine but as long as the capital was respected the sufferings of a distant province escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian The storm which had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond at length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace a strait of fifteen miles in which the rude vessels of the Russians might have been stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary In their first enterprise fifty nine under the princes of Kiow they passed without opposition and occupied the port of Constantinople in the absence of the emperor Michael the son of Theophilus Through a crowd of perils he landed at the palace stairs and immediately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary sixty By the advice of the patriarch her garment a precious relic was drawn from the sanctuary and dipped in the sea and a seasonable tempest which determined the retreat of the Russians was devoutly ascribed to the mother of God sixty one The silence of the Greeks may inspire some doubt of the truth or at least of the importance of the second attempt by Oleg the guardian of the sons of Ruric sixty two A strong barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus they were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the isthmus and this simple operation is described in the national chronicles as if the Russian fleet had sailed over dry land with a brisk and favorable gale The leader of the third armament Igor the son of Ruric had chosen a moment of weakness and decay when the naval powers of the empire were employed against the Saracens But if courage be not wanting the instruments of defence are seldom deficient Fifteen broken and decayed galleys were boldly launched against the enemy but instead of the single tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow the sides and stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid combustible The engineers were dexterous the weather was propitious many thousand Russians who chose rather to be drowned than burnt leaped into the sea and those who escaped to the Thracian shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers Yet one third of the canoes escaped into shallow water and the next spring Igor was again prepared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge sixty three After a long peace Jaroslaus the great grandson of Igor resumed the same project of a naval invasion A fleet under the command of his son was repulsed at the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial flames But in the rashness of pursuit the vanguard of the Greeks was encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men their provision of fire was probably exhausted and twenty four galleys were either taken sunk or destroyed sixty four Footnote fifty six The wars of the Russians and Greeks in the ixth xth and xith centuries are related in

two hundred fifty four but they grow more weighty and credible as they draw near to their own times Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more frequently diverted by treaty than by arms In these naval hostilities every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks their savage enemy afforded no mercy his poverty promised no spoil his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an opinion that no honor could be gained or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians At first their demands were high and inadmissible three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of the fleet the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest and glory but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary sages Be content they said with the liberal offers of Caesar it is not far better to obtain without a combat the possession of gold silver silks and all the objects of our desires Are we sure of victory Can we conclude a treaty with the sea We do not tread on the land we float on the abyss of water and a common death hangs over our heads sixty five The memory of these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the Imperial city By the vulgar of every rank it was asserted and believed that an equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed with a prophecy how the Russians in the last days should become masters of Constantinople sixty six In our own time a Russian armament instead of sailing from the Borysthenes has circumnavigated the continent of Europe and the Turkish capital has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of war each of which with its naval science and thundering artillery could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes such as those of their ancestors Perhaps the present generation may yet behold the accomplishment of the prediction of a rare prediction of which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable Footnote sixty five Nestor apud Leveque Hist de Russie tom i p eighty seven Footnote sixty six This brazen statue which had been brought from Antioch and was

land the Russians were less formidable than by sea and as they fought for the most part on foot their irregular legions must often have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian hordes Yet their growing towns however slight and imperfect presented a shelter to the subject and a barrier to the enemy the monarchy of Kiow till a fatal partition assumed the dominion of the North and the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus sixty seven the son of Igor the son of Oleg the son of Ruric The vigor of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and savage life Wrapped in a bear skin Swatoslaus usually slept on the ground his head reclining on a saddle his diet was coarse and frugal and like the heroes of Homer sixty eight his meat it was often horse flesh was broiled or roasted on the coals The exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army and it may be presumed that no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief By an embassy from Nicephorus the Greek emperor he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria and a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to defray the expense or reward the toils of the expedition An army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked they sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube their landing was effected on the Maesian shore and after a sharp encounter the swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the Bulgarian horse The vanquished king sunk into the grave his children were made captive and his dominions as far as Mount Haemus were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders But instead of relinquishing his prey and performing his engagements the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than to retire and had his ambition been crowned with success the seat of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position in which he could unite by exchange or rapine the various productions of the earth By an easy navigation he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs wax and hydromed Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the West and Greece abounded with gold silver and the foreign luxuries which his poverty had affected to disdain The bands of Patzinacites Chozars and Turks repaired to the standard of victory and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust assumed the purple and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the Eastern world From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople a formal summons to evacuate the Roman province was dismissed with contempt and Swatoslaus fiercely replied that Constantinople might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master Footnote sixty seven The life of Swatoslaus or Sviatoslaf or Sphendosthlabus is extracted from the Russian Chronicles by M Levesque Hist de Russie tom i p ninety four one hundred seven Footnote sixty eight This resemblance may be clearly seen in the ninth book of the Iliad two hundred five two hundred twenty one in the minute detail of the cookery of Achilles By such a picture a modern epic poet would disgrace his work and disgust his reader but the Greek verses are harmonious a dead language can seldom appear low or familiar and at the distance of two thousand seven hundred years we are amused with the primitive manners of antiquity Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces sixty nine who in a diminutive body possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero The first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign allies twenty thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword or provoked to revolt or tempted to desert Thrace was delivered but seventy thousand Barbarians were still in arms and the legions that had been recalled from the new conquests of Syria prepared with the return of the spring to march under the banners of a warlike prince who declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria The passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded they were instantly occupied the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals a proud imitation of the Persian style the emperor led the main body of ten thousand five hundred foot and the rest of his forces followed in slow and cautious array with the baggage and military engines The first exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis or Peristhlaba seventy in two days the trumpets sounded the walls were scaled eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison and invested with a nominal diadem After these repeated losses Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of Drista on the banks of the Danube and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay The Byzantine galleys ascended the river the legions completed a line of circumvallation and the Russian prince was encompassed assaulted and famished in the fortifications of the camp and city Many deeds of valor were performed several desperate sallies were attempted nor was it till after a siege of sixty five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the victor who respected the valor and apprehended the despair of an unconquered mind The great duke of Russia bound himself by solemn imprecations to relinquish all hostile designs a safe passage was opened for his return the liberty of trade and navigation was restored a measure of corn was distributed to each of his soldiers and the allowance of twenty two thousand measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians After a painful voyage they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes but their provisions were exhausted the season was unfavorable they passed the winter on the ice and before they could prosecute their march Swatoslaus was surprised and oppressed by the neighboring tribes with whom the Greeks entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence seventy one Far different was the return of Zimisces who was received in his capital like Camillus or Marius the saviors of ancient Rome But the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother of God and the image of the Virgin Mary with the divine infant in her arms was placed on a triumphal car adorned with the spoils of war and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty Zimisces made his public entry on horseback the diadem on his head a crown of laurel in his hand and Constantinople was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign seventy two Footnote sixty nine This singular epithet is derived from the Armenian language As I

Constantinople a patriarch whose ambition was equal to his curiosity congratulates himself and the Greek church on the conversion of the Russians seventy three Those fierce and bloody Barbarians had been persuaded by the voice of reason and religion to acknowledge Jesus for their God the Christian missionaries for their teachers and the Romans for their friends and brethren His triumph was transient and premature In the various fortune of their piratical adventures some Russian chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of baptism and a Greek bishop with the name of metropolitan might administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow to a congregation of slaves and natives But the seed of the gospel was sown on a barren soil many were the apostates the converts were few and the baptism of Olga may be fixed as the aera of Russian Christianity seventy four A female perhaps of the basest origin who could revenge the death and assume the sceptre of her husband Igor must have been endowed with those active virtues which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians In a moment of foreign and domestic peace she sailed from Kiow to Constantinople and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus has described with minute diligence the ceremonial of her reception in his capital and palace The steps the titles the salutations the banquet the presents were exquisitely adjusted to gratify the vanity of the stranger with due reverence to the superior majesty of the purple seventy five In the sacrament of baptism she received the venerable name of the empress Helena and her conversion might be preceded or followed by her uncle two interpreters sixteen damsels of a higher and eighteen of a lower rank twenty two domestics or ministers and forty four Russian merchants who composed the retinue of the great princess Olga After her return to Kiow and Novogorod she firmly persisted in her new religion but her labors in the propagation of the gospel were not crowned with success and both her family and nation adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of their fathers Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his companions and her grandson Wolodomir devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments of ancient worship The savage deities of the North were still propitiated with human sacrifices in the choice of the victim a citizen was preferred to a stranger a Christian to an idolater and the father who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep though secret impression in the minds of the prince and people the Greek missionaries continued to preach to dispute and to baptize and the ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of Constantinople They had gazed with admiration on the dome of saint Sophia the lively pictures of saints and martyrs the riches of the altar the number and vestments of the priests the pomp and order of the ceremonies they were edified by the alternate succession of devout silence and harmonious song nor was it difficult to persuade them that a choir of angels descended each day from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians seventy six But the conversion of Wolodomir was determined or hastened by his desire of a Roman bride At the same time and in the city of Cherson the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated by the Christian pontiff the city he restored to the emperor Basil the brother of his spouse but the brazen gates were transported as it is said to Novogorod and erected before the first church as a trophy of his victory and faith seventy seven At his despotic command Peround the god of thunder whom he had so long adored was dragged through the streets of Kiow and twelve sturdy Barbarians battered with clubs the misshapen image which was indignantly cast into the waters of the Borysthenes The edict of Wolodomir had proclaimed that all who should refuse the rites of baptism would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince and the rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient Russians who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke and his boyars In the next generation the relics of Paganism were finally extirpated but as the two brothers of Wolodomir had died without baptism their bones were taken from the grave and sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament Footnote seventy three Phot Epistol ii No thirty five p fifty eight edit Montacut It was unworthy of the learning of the editor to mistake the Russian nation for a war cry of

the gospel and of the church was extended over Bulgaria Hungary Bohemia Saxony Denmark Norway Sweden Poland and Russia seventy eight The triumphs of apostolic zeal were repeated in the iron age of Christianity and the northern and eastern regions of Europe submitted to a religion more different in theory than in practice from the worship of their native idols A laudable ambition excited the monks both of Germany and Greece to visit the tents and huts of the Barbarians poverty hardships and dangers were the lot of the first missionaries their courage was active and patient their motive pure and meritorious their present reward consisted in the testimony of their conscience and the respect of a grateful people but the fruitful harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the proud and wealthy prelates of succeeding times The first conversions were free and spontaneous a holy life and an eloquent tongue were the only arms of the missionaries but the domestic fables of the Pagans were silenced by the miracles and visions of the strangers and the favorable temper of the chiefs was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest The leaders of nations who were saluted with the titles of kings and saints seventy nine held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith on their subjects and neighbors the coast of the Baltic from Holstein to the Gulf of Finland was invaded under the standard of the cross and the reign of idolatry was closed by the conversion of Lithuania in the fourteenth century Yet truth and candor must acknowledge that the conversion of the North imparted many temporal benefits both to the old and the new Christians The rage of war inherent to the human species could not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace and the

Roger Victories Of Robert Over The Emperors Of The East And West Roger King Of Sicily Invades Africa And Greece The Emperor Manuel Comnenus Wars Of The Greeks And Normans Extinction Of The Normans The three great nations of the world the Greeks the Saracens and the Franks encountered each other on the theatre of Italy one The southern provinces which now compose the kingdom of Naples were subject for the most part to the Lombard dukes and princes of Beneventum two so powerful in war that they checked for a moment the genius of Charlemagne so liberal in peace that they maintained in their capital an academy of thirty two philosophers and grammarians The division of this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento Salerno and Capua and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance During a calamitous period of two hundred years Italy was exposed to a repetition of wounds which the invaders were not capable of healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest Their frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo and were entertained with too much indulgence by the Christians of Naples the more formidable fleets were prepared on the African coast and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect In the revolution of human events a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine Forks the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second time with the blood of the Africans and the sovereign of Rome again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum A colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari which commands the entrance of the Adriatic Gulf and their impartial depredations provoked the resentment and conciliated the union of the two emperors An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the Macedonian the first of his race and Lewis the great grandson of Charlemagne three and each party supplied the deficiencies of his associate It would have been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an Italian campaign and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf The fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks and by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks and after a defence of four years the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis who commanded in person the operations of the siege This important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East and West but their recent amity was soon imbittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and pride The Greeks assumed as their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph extolled the greatness of their powers and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of Barbarians who appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince His reply is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth We confess the magnitude of your preparation says the great grandson of Charlemagne Your armies were indeed as numerous as a cloud of summer locusts who darken the day flap their wings and after a short flight tumble weary and breathless to the ground Like them ye sunk after a feeble effort ye were vanquished by your own cowardice and withdrew from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian subjects of the Sclavonian coast We were few in number and why were we few Because after a tedious expectation of your arrival I had dismissed my host and retained only a chosen band of warriors to continue the blockade of the city If they indulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death did these feasts abate the vigor of their enterprise Is it by your fasting that the walls of Bari have been overturned Did not these valiant Franks diminished as they were by languor and fatigue intercept and vanish the three most powerful emirs of the Saracens and did not their defeat precipitate the fall of the city Bari is now fallen Tarentum trembles Calabria will be delivered and if we command the sea the Island of Sicily may be rescued from the hands of the infidels My brother accelerate a name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek accelerate your naval succors respect your allies and distrust your flatterers four

the originals in the first volumes of Muratori s great collection of the Scriptores Rerum Italicarum Footnote two Camillo Pellegrino a learned Capuan of the last century has illustrated the history of

the anonymous historian of Salerno These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the death of Lewis and the decay of the Carlovingian house and whoever might deserve the honor the Greek emperors Basil and his son Leo secured the advantage of the reduction of Bari The Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge their supremacy and an ideal line from Mount Garganus to the Bay of Salerno leaves the far greater part of the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire Beyond that line the dukes or republics of Amalfi five and Naples who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance rejoiced in the neighborhood of their lawful sovereign and Amalfi was enriched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of Asia But the Lombard princes of Benevento Salerno and Capua six were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world and too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute The city of Bari rose to dignity and wealth as the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy the title of patrician and afterwards the singular name of Catapan seven was assigned to the supreme governor and the policy both of the church and state was modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy their efforts were feeble and adverse and the Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of Germany which descended from the Alps under the Imperial standard of the Othos The first and greatest of those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of Bari the second after the loss of his stoutest bishops and barons escaped with honor from the bloody field of Crotona On that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by the valor of the Saracens eight These corsairs had indeed been driven by the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy but a sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or resentment and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally The successors of Basil amused themselves with the belief that the conquest of Lombardy had been achieved and was still preserved by the justice of their laws the virtues of their ministers and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and oppression A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into the palace of Constantinople and the illusions of flattery were dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman adventurers Footnote five See an excellent

eighty gives a far different character of the Greeks during the five years A D eight hundred ninety one eight hundred ninety six that Leo was master of the city The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and Calabria a melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and the tenth century of the Christian aera At the former period the coast of Great Greece as it was then styled was planted with free and opulent cities these cities were peopled with soldiers artists and philosophers and the military strength of Tarentum Sybaris or Crotona was not inferior to that of a powerful kingdom At the second aera these once flourishing provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny and depopulated by Barbarian war nor can we severely accuse the exaggeration of a contemporary that a fair and ample district was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth after the general deluge nine Among the hostilities of the Arabs the Franks and the Greeks in the southern Italy I shall select two or three anecdotes expressive of their national manners one It was the amusement of the Saracens to profane as well as to pillage the monasteries and churches At the siege of Salerno a Mussulman chief spread his couch on the communion table and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a Christian nun As he wrestled with a reluctant maid a beam in the roof was accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head and the death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful spouse ten two The Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and Capua after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne the Lombards implored the clemency and aid of the Greek emperor eleven A fearless citizen dropped from the walls passed the intrenchments accomplished his commission and fell into the hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the welcome news They commanded him to assist their enterprise and deceive his countrymen with the assurance that wealth and honors should be the reward of his falsehood and that his sincerity would be punished with immediate death He affected to yield but as soon as he was conducted within hearing of the Christians on the rampart Friends and brethren he cried with a loud voice be bold and patient maintain the city your sovereign is informed of your distress and your deliverers are at hand I know my doom and commit my wife and children to your gratitude The rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence and the self devoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears He deserves to live in the memory of the virtuous but the repetition of the same story in ancient and modern times may sprinkle some doubts on the reality of this generous deed twelve three The recital of a third incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war Theobald marquis of Camerino and Spoleto thirteen supported the rebels of Beneventum and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a hero His captives of the Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest that he wished to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs the most precious ornaments of the Byzantine court The garrison of a castle had been defeated in a sally and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary operation But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic female who with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair and importunate clamors compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint Is it thus she cried ye magnanimous heroes that ye wage war against women against women who have never injured ye and whose only arms are the distaff and the loom Theobald denied the charge and protested that since the Amazons he had never heard of a female war And how she furiously exclaimed can you attack us more directly how can you wound us in a more vital part than by robbing our husbands of what we most dearly cherish the source of our joys and the hope of our posterity The plunder of our flocks and herds I have endured without a murmur but this fatal injury this irreparable loss subdues my patience and calls aloud on the justice of heaven and earth A general laugh applauded her eloquence the savage Franks inaccessible to pity were moved by her ridiculous yet rational despair and with the deliverance of the captives she obtained the restitution of her effects As she returned in triumph to the castle she was overtaken by a messenger to inquire in the name of Theobald what punishment should be inflicted on her husband were he again taken in arms Should such she answered without hesitation be his guilt and misfortune he has eyes and a nose and hands and feet These are his own and these he may deserve to forfeit by his personal offences But let my lord be pleased to spare what his little handmaid presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful property

Sicily fifteen is an event most romantic in its origin and in its consequences most important both to Italy and the Eastern empire The broken provinces of the Greeks Lombards and Saracens were exposed to every invader and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit of the Scandinavian pirates After a long indulgence of rapine and slaughter a fair and ample territory was accepted occupied and named by the Normans of France they renounced their gods for the God of the Christians sixteen and the dukes of Normandy acknowledged themselves the vassals of the successors of Charlemagne and Capet The savage fierceness which they had brought from the snowy mountains of Norway was refined without being corrupted in a warmer climate the companions of Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives they imbibed the manners language seventeen and gallantry of the French nation and in a martial age the Normans might claim the palm of valor and glorious achievements Of the fashionable superstitions they embraced with ardor the pilgrimages of Rome Italy and the Holy Land one hundred seventy one In this active devotion the minds and bodies were invigorated by exercise danger was the incentive novelty the recompense and the prospect of the world was decorated by wonder credulity and ambitious hope They confederated for their mutual defence and the robbers of the Alps who had been allured by the garb of a pilgrim were often chastised by the arm of a warrior In one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus in Apulia which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel Michael eighteen they were accosted by a stranger in the Greek habit but who soon revealed himself as a rebel a fugitive and a mortal foe of the Greek empire His name was Melo a noble citizen of Bari who after an unsuccessful revolt was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country The bold appearance of the Normans revived his hopes and solicited his confidence they listened to the complaints and still more to the promises of the patriot The assurance of wealth demonstrated the justice of his cause and they viewed as the inheritance of the brave the fruitful land which was oppressed by effeminate tyrants On their return to Normandy they kindled a spark of enterprise and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the deliverance of Apulia They passed the Alps by separate roads and in the disguise of pilgrims but in the neighborhood of Rome they were saluted by the chief of Bari who supplied the more indigent with arms and horses and instantly led them to the field of action In the first conflict their valor prevailed but in the second engagement they were overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy eighteen eleven The unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany his Norman followers excluded from their native and their promised land wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy and earned their daily subsistence by the sword To that formidable sword the princes of Capua Beneventum Salerno and Naples alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels the superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory to the side which they espoused and their cautious policy observed the balance of power lest the preponderance of any rival state should render their aid less important and their service less profitable Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes of Campania but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the duke of Naples with a more plentiful and permanent seat Eight miles from his residence as a bulwark against Capua the town of Aversa was built and fortified for their use and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits the meadows and groves of that fertile district The report of their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers the poor were urged by necessity the rich were excited by hope and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of ease and ambitious of renown The independent standard of Aversa afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the province to every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or justice of his superiors and these foreign associates were quickly assimilated in manners and language to the Gallic colony The first leader of the Normans was Count Rainulf and in the origin of society preeminence of rank is the reward and the proof of superior merit nineteen

This account is not accurate After the retreat of the emperor Henry II the Normans united under the command of Rainulf had taken possession of Aversa then a small castle in the duchy of Naples They had been masters of it a few years when Pandulf IV prince of Capua found means to take Naples by surprise Sergius master of the soldiers and head of the republic with the principal citizens abandoned a city in which he could not behold without horror the establishment of a foreign dominion he retired to Aversa and when with the assistance of the Greeks and that of the citizens faithful to their country he had collected money enough to satisfy the rapacity of the Norman adventurers he advanced at their head to attack the garrison of the prince of Capua defeated it and reentered Naples It was then that he confirmed the Normans in the possession of Aversa and its territory which he raised into a count s fief and granted the investiture to Rainulf Hist des Rep Ital tom i p two hundred sixty seven Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs the Grecian emperors had been anxious to regain that valuable possession but their efforts however strenuous had been opposed by the distance and the sea Their costly armaments after a gleam of success added new pages of calamity and disgrace to the Byzantine annals twenty thousand of their best troops were lost in a single expedition and the victorious Moslems derided the policy of a nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their women but with the command of their men twenty After a reign of two hundred years the Saracens were ruined by their divisions twenty one The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis the people rose against the emir the cities were usurped by the chiefs each meaner rebel was independent in his village or castle and the weaker of two rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians In every service of danger the Normans were prompt and useful and five hundred knights or warriors on horseback were enrolled by Arduin the agent and interpreter of the Greeks under the standard of Maniaces governor of Lombardy Before their landing the brothers were reconciled the union of Sicily and Africa was restored and the island was guarded to the water s edge The Normans led the van and the Arabs of Messina felt the valor of an untried foe In a second action the emir of Syracuse was unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of William of Hauteville In a third engagement his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand Saracens and left the Greeks no more than the labor of the pursuit a splendid victory but of which the pen of the historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans It is however true that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces who reduced thirteen cities and the greater part of Sicily under the obedience of the emperor But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny In the division of the spoils the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten and neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious treatment They complained by the mouth of their interpreter their complaint was disregarded their interpreter was scourged the sufferings were his the insult and resentment belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered Yet they dissembled till they had obtained or stolen a safe passage to the Italian continent their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their indignation and the province of Apulia was invaded as the forfeit of the debt twenty two Above twenty years after the first emigration the Normans took the field with no more than seven hundred horse and five hundred foot and after the recall of the Byzantine legions twenty three from the Sicilian war their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat of battle was the unanimous cry of the Normans and one of their stoutest warriors with a stroke of his fist felled to the ground the horse of the Greek messenger He was dismissed with a fresh horse the insult was concealed from the Imperial troops but in two successive battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries In the plains of Cannae the Asiatics fled before the adventurers of France the duke of Lombardy was made prisoner the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion and the four places of Bari Otranto Brundusium and Tarentum were alone saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes From this aera we may date the establishment of the Norman power which soon eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa Twelve counts twenty four were chosen by the popular suffrage and age birth and merit were the motives of their choice The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands and at the head of his vassals In the centre of the province the common habitation of Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the republic a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of the twelve counts and the national concerns were regulated by this military senate The first of his peers their president and general was entitled count of Apulia and this dignity was conferred on William of the iron arm who in the language of the age is styled a lion in battle a lamb in society and an angel in council twenty five The manners of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national historian twenty six The Normans says Malaterra are a cunning and revengeful people eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary qualities they can stoop to flatter but unless they are curbed by the restraint of law they indulge the licentiousness of nature and passion Their princes affect the praises of popular munificence the people observe the medium or rather blond the extremes of avarice and prodigality and in their eager thirst of wealth and dominion they despise whatever they possess and hope whatever they desire Arms and horses the luxury of dress the exercises of hunting and hawking twenty seven are the delight of the Normans but on pressing occasions they can endure with incredible patience the inclemency of every climate and the toil and absence of a military life twenty eight Footnote twenty

appreciates like a philosophic historian the vices and virtues of the Saxons and Normans England was assuredly a gainer by the conquest Chapter LVI The Saracens The Franks And The Normans Part II The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two empires and according to the policy of the hour they accepted the investiture of their lands from the sovereigns of Germany or Constantinople But the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest they neither loved nor trusted they were neither trusted nor beloved the contempt of the princes was mixed with fear and the fear of the natives was mingled with hatred and resentment Every object of desire a horse a woman a garden tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the strangers twenty nine and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by the more specious names of ambition and glory The twelve counts were sometimes joined in the league of injustice in their domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people the virtues of William were buried in his grave and Drogo his brother and successor was better qualified to lead the valor than to restrain the violence of his peers Under the reign of Constantine Monomachus the policy rather than benevolence of the Byzantine court attempted to relieve Italy from this adherent mischief more grievous than a flight of Barbarians thirty and Argyrus the son of Melo was invested for this purpose with the most lofty titles thirty one and the most ample commission The memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans and he had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces and to avenge their own and the public injury It was the design of Constantine to transplant the warlike colony from the Italian provinces to the Persian war and the son of Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of Greece as the first fruits of the Imperial bounty But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia his gifts or at least his proposals were rejected and they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune After the means of persuasion had failed Argyrus resolved to compel or to destroy the Latin powers were solicited against the common enemy and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the two emperors of the East and West The throne of saint Peter was occupied by Leo the Ninth a simple saint thirty two of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least compatible with the practice of religion His humanity was affected by the complaints perhaps the calumnies of an injured people the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of tithes and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers who were deaf to the censures of the church As a German of noble birth and royal kindred Leo had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor Henry the Third and in search of arms and allies his ardent zeal transported him from Apulia to Saxony from the Elbe to the Tyber During these hostile preparations Argyrus indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons a crowd of Normans became the victims of public or private revenge and the valiant Drogo was murdered in a church But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey the third count of Apulia The assassins were chastised and the son of Melo overthrown and wounded was driven from the field to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari and to await the tardy succor of his allies Footnote twenty nine The biographer of saint Leo IX pours his holy venom on the Normans Videns indisciplinatam et alienam

public and private history of that pope is diligently treated by M de saint Marc Abrege tom ii p one hundred forty two hundred ten and p twenty five ninety five second column But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war the mind of Henry was feeble and irresolute and the pope instead of repassing the Alps with a German army was accompanied only by a guard of seven hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine In his long progress from Mantua to Beneventum a vile and promiscuous multitude of Italians was enlisted under the holy standard thirty three the priest and the robber slept in the same tent the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march of encampment and of combat The Normans of Apulia could muster in the field no more than three thousand horse with a handful of infantry the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat and their spirit incapable of fear was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe On the hostile approach of Leo they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father But the pope was inexorable his lofty Germans affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries and the Normans were informed that death or exile was their only alternative Flight they disdained and as many of them had been three days without tasting food they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death They climbed the hill of Civitella descended into the plain and charged in three divisions the army of the pope On the left and in the centre Richard count of Aversa and Robert the famous Guiscard attacked broke routed and pursued the Italian multitudes who fought without discipline and fled without shame A harder trial was reserved for the valor of Count Humphrey who led the cavalry of the right wing The Germans thirty four have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx and neither man nor steed nor armor could resist the weight of their long and two handed swords After a severe conflict they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes and the satisfaction of revenge The gates of Civitella were shut against the flying pope and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors who kissed his feet to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ and though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition In the calm of retirement the well meaning pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood which must be imputed to his account he felt that he had been the author of sin and scandal and as his undertaking had failed the indecency of his military character was universally condemned thirty five With these dispositions he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans By whatever hands they had been usurped the provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the donation of Constantine and the patrimony of saint Peter the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland and since this memorable transaction the kingdom of Naples has remained above seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See thirty six Footnote thirty three See the expedition of Leo XI

Yet he vainly strives to reconcile the duties of patriot and Catholic adopts an empty distinction of Ecclesia Romana non dedit sed accepit and shrinks from an honest but dangerous confession of the truth The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard thirty seven is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy from the peasants by the pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess thirty eight from the dukes by the ignorance and flattery of the Italian subjects thirty nine His genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility forty He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets of the diocese of Coutances in the Lower Normandy the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke and his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights Two marriages of a rank not unworthy of his own made him the father of twelve sons who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his second wife But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny they saw around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance Two only remained to perpetuate the race and cherish their father s age their ten brothers as they successfully attained the vigor of manhood departed from the castle passed the Alps and joined the Apulian camp of the Normans The elder were prompted by native spirit their success encouraged their younger brethren and the three first in seniority William Drogo and Humphrey deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second marriage and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness and to the decline of life he maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form His complexion was ruddy his shoulders were broad his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen color his eyes sparkled with fire and his voice like that of Achilles could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle In the ruder ages of chivalry such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians they may observe that Robert at once and with equal dexterity could wield in the right hand his sword his lance in the left that in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the warriors of the two armies forty one His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth in the pursuit of greatness he was never arrested by the scruples of justice and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity though not insensible of fame the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage The surname of Guiscard forty two was applied to this master of political wisdom which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness in his highest fortune he was accessible and courteous to his fellow soldiers and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country He grasped with a rapacious that he might distribute with a liberal hand his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality the gain of a merchant was not below his attention and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty to force a discovery of their secret treasure According to the Greeks he departed from Normandy with only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot yet even this allowance appears too bountiful the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim and his first military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber To surprise a castle or a convent to ensnare a wealthy citizen to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food were the obscure labors which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body The volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard and under his command the peasants of Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans Footnote thirty seven The birth character and first actions of Robert Guiscard may be found in Jeffrey Malaterra l

sicuti post bella probatum est Victor vel victus tam magnos edidit ictus Footnote forty two The Norman writers and editors most conversant with their own idiom interpret Guiscard or Wiscard by Callidus a cunning man The root wise is familiar to our ear and in the old word Wiseacre I can discern something of a similar sense and termination It is no bad translation of the surname and character of Robert As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother by whom in a transient quarrel his life was threatened and his liberty restrained After the death of Humphrey the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command they were reduced to a private estate by the ambition of their guardian and uncle and Guiscard was exalted on a buckler and saluted count of Apulia and general of the republic With an increase of authority and of force he resumed the conquest of Calabria and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals By some acts of rapine or sacrilege he had incurred a papal excommunication but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice that the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Melphi and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the Roman pontiff His gratitude and policy conferred on Robert and his posterity the ducal title forty three with the investiture of Apulia Calabria and all the lands both in Italy and Sicily which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the unbelieving Saracens forty four This apostolic sanction might justify his arms but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent and Guiscard dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of Consenza and Reggio In the hour of triumph he assembled his troops and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke and the counts his former equals pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation After this inauguration Robert styled himself By the grace of God and saint Peter duke of Apulia Calabria and hereafter of Sicily and it was the labor of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty appellations Such sardy progress in a narrow space may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation but the Normans were few in number their resources were scanty their service was voluntary and precarious The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons the twelve counts of popular election conspired against his authority and against their perfidious uncle the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge By his policy and vigor Guiscard discovered their plots suppressed their rebellions and punished the guilty with death or exile but in these domestic feuds his years and the national strength were unprofitably consumed After the defeat of his foreign enemies the Greeks Lombards and Saracens their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea coast They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage The resistance of Salerno was maintained above eight months the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near four years In these actions the Norman duke was the foremost in every danger in every fatigue the last and most patient As he pressed the citadel of Salerno a huge stone from the rampart shattered one of his military engines and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast Before the gates of Bari he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack composed of dry branches and thatched with straw a perilous station on all sides open to the inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy forty five Footnote forty three The acquisition of the ducal title by Robert Guiscard is a nice and obscure business With the good advice of Giannone Muratori and saint Marc I have endeavored to form a consistent and probable narrative Footnote forty four Baronius Annal Eccles A D ten fifty nine No sixty nine has published the original act He professes to have copied it from the Liber Censuum a Vatican Ms Yet a Liber Censuum of the xiith century has been printed by Muratori Antiquit Medii Aevi tom v p eight

and third books of the Apulian the first and second books of Malaterra The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years forty six The monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces of Calabria and Apulia of the Lombard principality of Salerno the republic of Amalphi and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum Three districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection the first forever the two last till the middle of the succeeding century The city and immediate territory of Benevento had been transferred by gift or exchange from the German emperor to the Roman pontiff and although this holy land was sometimes invaded the name of saint Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers The dukes of Naples the present metropolis maintained the popular freedom under the shadow of the Byzantine empire Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard the science of Salerno forty seven and the trade of Amalphi forty eight may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader I Of the learned faculties jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic and if our diseases are inflamed by luxury the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society The treasures of Grecian medicine had been communicated to the Arabian colonies of Africa Spain and Sicily and in the intercourse of peace and war a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno an illustrious city in which the men were honest and the women beautiful forty nine A school the first that arose in the darkness of Europe was consecrated to the healing art the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession and a crowd of patients of the most eminent rank and most distant climates invited or visited the physicians of Salerno They were protected by the Norman conquerors and Guiscard though bred in arms could discern the merit and value of a philosopher After a pilgrimage of thirty nine years Constantine an African Christian returned from Bagdad a master of the language and learning of the Arabians and Salerno was enriched by the practice the lessons and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms bound together in the Leonine verses or Latin rhymes of the twelfth century fifty II Seven miles to the west of Salerno and thirty to the south of Naples the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the power and rewards of industry The land however fertile was of narrow extent but the sea was accessible and open the inhabitants first assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom The government was popular under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek emperor Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold silver and the objects of precious luxury The mariners who swarmed in her port excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy and the discovery of the compass which has opened the globe is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune Their trade was extended to the coasts or at least to the commodities of Africa Arabia and India and their settlements in Constantinople Antioch Jerusalem and Alexandria acquired the privileges of independent colonies fifty one After three hundred years of prosperity Amalphi was oppressed by the arms of the Normans and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa but the poverty of one thousand five thousand one hundred

been long detained in Normandy by his own and his father age He accepted the welcome summons hastened to the Apulian camp and deserved at first the esteem and afterwards the envy of his elder brother Their valor and ambition were equal but the youth the beauty the elegant manners of Roger engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people So scanty was his allowance for himself and forty followers that he descended from conquest to robbery and from robbery to domestic theft and so loose were the notions of property that by his own historian at his special command he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi fifty two His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war and the invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard After the retreat of the Greeks the idolaters a most audacious reproach of the Catholics had retrieved their losses and possessions but the deliverance of the island so vainly undertaken by the forces of the Eastern empire was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers fifty three In the first attempt Roger braved in an open boat the real and fabulous dangers of Scylla and Charybdis landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore drove the Saracens to the gates of Messina and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country In the fortress of Trani his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous In his old age he related with pleasure that by the distress of the siege himself and the countess his wife had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle which they wore alternately that in a sally his horse had been slain and he was dragged away by the Saracens but that he owed his rescue to his good sword and had retreated with his saddle on his back lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants In the siege of Trani three hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island In the field of Ceramio fifty thousand horse and foot were overthrown by one hundred and thirty six Christian soldiers without reckoning saint George who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks The captive banners with four camels were reserved for the successor of saint Peter and had these barbaric spoils been exposed not in the Vatican but in the Capitol they might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs These insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their knights the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank each of whom was attended by five or six followers in the field fifty four yet with the aid of this interpretation and after every fair allowance on the side of valor arms and reputation the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable The Arabs of Sicily derived a frequent and powerful succor from their countrymen of Africa in the siege of Palermo the Norman cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa and in the hour of action the envy of the two brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation After a war of thirty years fifty five Roger with the title of great count obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind above the limits of his age and education The Moslems were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property fifty six a philosopher and physician of Mazara of the race of Mahomet harangued the conqueror and was invited to court his geography of the seven climates was translated into Latin and Roger after a diligent perusal preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the Grecian Ptolemy fifty seven A remnant of Christian natives had promoted the success of the Normans they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff new bishops were planted in the principal cities and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries Yet the Catholic hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged by the singular bull which declares the princes of Sicily

embrace or create the first occasion of invading perhaps of subduing the Roman empire of the East fifty nine From his first wife the partner of his humble fortune he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity and her son Bohemond was destined to imitate rather than to succeed his illustrious father The second wife of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno the Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger their five daughters were given in honorable nuptials sixty and one of them was betrothed in a tender age to Constantine a beautiful youth the son and heir of the emperor Michael sixty one But the throne of Constantinople was shaken by a revolution the Imperial family of Ducas was confined to the palace or the cloister and Robert deplored and resented the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally A Greek who styled himself the father of Constantine soon appeared at Salerno and related the adventures of his fall and flight That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke and adorned with the pomp and titles of Imperial dignity in his triumphal progress through Apulia and Calabria Michael sixty two was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted the bishops to preach and the Catholics to fight in the pious work of his restoration His conversations with Robert were frequent and familiar and their mutual promises were justified by the valor of the Normans and the treasures of the East Yet this Michael by the confession of the Greeks and Latins was a pageant and an impostor a monk who had fled from his convent or a domestic who had served in the palace The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard and he trusted that after this pretender had given a decent color to his arms he would sink at the nod of the conqueror into his primitive obscurity But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks and the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to their credulity the Norman veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition In his new levies Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority and some acts of violence might justify the reproach that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince After two years incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto at the heel or extreme promontory of Italy and Robert was accompanied by his wife who fought by his side his son Bohemond and the representative of the emperor Michael Thirteen hundred knights sixty three of Norman race or discipline formed the sinews of the army which might be swelled to thirty thousand sixty four followers of every denomination The men the horses the arms the engines the wooden towers covered with raw

shores of Italy and Epirus incline towards each other The space between Brundusium and Durazzo the Roman passage is no more than one hundred miles sixty five at the last station of Otranto it is contracted to fifty sixty six and this narrow distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge Before the general embarkation the Norman duke despatched Bohemond with fifteen galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu to survey the opposite coast and to secure a harbor in the neighborhood of Vallona for the landing of the troops They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks The islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert who led his fleet and army from Corfu I use the modern appellation to the siege of Durazzo That city the western key of the empire was guarded by ancient renown and recent fortifications by George Palaeologus a patrician victorious in the Oriental wars and a numerous garrison of Albanians and Macedonians who in every age have maintained the character of soldiers In the prosecution of his enterprise the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of danger and mischance In the most propitious season of the year as his fleet passed along the coast a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast of the south and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the Acroceraunian rocks sixty seven The sails the masts and the oars were shattered or torn away the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels with arms and dead bodies and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves and Robert halted seven days on the adjacent cape to collect the relics of his loss and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers The Normans were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean They had wept during the tempest they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the Byzantine court The first day s action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond a beardless youth sixty eight who led the naval powers of his father All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent and the victory of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions the station of their archers the weight of their javelins and the borrowed aid of the Greek fire The Apulian and Ragusian vessels fled to the shore several were cut from their cables and dragged away by the conqueror and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the Norman duke A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death and the list of burials if all could obtain a decent burial amounted to ten thousand persons Under these calamities the mind of Guiscard alone was firm and invincible and while he collected new forces from Apulia and Sicily he battered or scaled or sapped the walls of Durazzo But his industry and valor were encountered by equal valor and more perfect industry A movable turret of a size and capacity to contain five hundred soldiers had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames Footnote sixty five The Itinerary of Jerusalem p six hundred nine edit Wesseling gives a true and reasonable space of a thousand

surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius an illustrious captain and the founder of the Comnenian dynasty The princess Anne his daughter and historian observes in her affected style that even Hercules was unequal to a double combat and on this principle she approves a hasty peace with the Turks which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo On his accession Alexius found the camp without soldiers and the treasury without money yet such were the vigor and activity of his measures that in six months he assembled an army of seventy thousand men sixty nine and performed a march of five hundred miles His troops were levied in Europe and Asia from Peloponnesus to the Black Sea his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse guards and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes some of whom in rapid succession had been clothed with the purple and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity Their youthful ardor might animate the multitude but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief and their importunate clamors for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the Roman world the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror and the garrisons of Anatolia or Asia Minor had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks The strength of the Greek army consisted in the Varangians the Scandinavian guards whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule Under the yoke of the Norman conqueror the Danes and English were oppressed and united a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery the sea was open to their escape and in their long pilgrimage they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge They were entertained in the service of the Greek emperor and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic shore but Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valor seventy The name of a Norman invader revived the memory of their wrongs they marched with alacrity against the national foe and panted to regain in Epirus the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings The Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or Latins and the rebels who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny of Guiscard were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge In this emergency the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and Bulgaria and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valor seventy one The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks and the arrows of the Scythian horse were opposed to the lances of the Norman cavalry On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers Robert assembled a council of his principal officers You behold said he your danger it is urgent and inevitable The hills are covered with arms and standards and the emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars and triumphs Obedience and union are our only safety and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies assured him in that perilous moment of their esteem and confidence and the duke thus continued Let us trust in the rewards of victory and deprive cowardice of the means of escape Let us burn our vessels and our baggage and give battle on this spot as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial The resolution was unanimously approved and without confining himself to his lines Guiscard awaited in battle array the nearer approach of the enemy His rear was covered by a small river his right wing extended to the sea his left to the hills nor was he conscious perhaps that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had formerly disputed the empire of the world seventy two Footnote sixty nine Muratori Annali d Italia tom ix p one hundred thirty six

It is a pity that Quintus Icilius M Guichard did not live to analyze these operations as he has done the campaigns of Africa and Spain Against the advice of his wisest captains Alexius resolved to risk the event of a general action and exhorted the garrison of Durazzo to assist their own deliverance by a well timed sally from the town He marched in two columns to surprise the Normans before daybreak on two different sides his light cavalry was scattered over the plain the archers formed the second line and the Varangians claimed the honors of the vanguard In the first onset the battle axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard which was now reduced to fifteen thousand men The Lombards and Calabrians ignominiously turned their backs they fled towards the river and the sea but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys who played their engines among the disorderly throng On the verge of ruin they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs Gaita the wife of Robert is painted by the Greeks as a warlike Amazon a second Pallas less skilful in arts but not less terrible in arms than the Athenian goddess seventy three though wounded by an arrow she stood her ground and strove by her exhortation and example to rally the flying troops seventy four Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the Norman duke as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council Whither he cried aloud whither do ye fly Your enemy is implacable and death is less grievous than servitude The moment was decisive as the Varangians advanced before the line they discovered the nakedness of their flanks the main battle of the duke of eight hundred knights stood firm and entire they couched their lances and the Greeks deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the French cavalry seventy five Alexius was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians and the flight of the Turks than he despised his subjects and despaired of his fortune The princess Anne who drops a tear on this melancholy event is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father s horse and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance which had shivered the Imperial helmet His desperate valor broke through a squadron of Franks who opposed his flight and after wandering two days and as many nights in the mountains he found some repose of body though not of mind in the walls of Lychnidus The victorious Robert reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field the wealth and luxury of the Byzantine camp and the glory of defeating an army five times more numerous than his own A multitude of Italians had been the victims of their own fears but only thirty of his knights were slain in this memorable day In the Roman host the loss of Greeks Turks and English amounted to five or six thousand seventy six the plain of Durazzo

hundred seventy three Their modesty is singular and laudable they might with so little trouble have slain two or three myriads of schismatics and infidels It is more than probable that Guiscard was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks After their defeat they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo and a Venetian commander supplied the place of George Palaeologus who had been imprudently called away from his station The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks to sustain the inclemency of the winter and in answer to the defiance of the garrison Robert insinuated that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy seventy seven Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a Venetian noble who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage At the dead of night several rope ladders were dropped from the walls the light Calabrians ascended in silence and the Greeks were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror Yet they defended the streets three days against an enemy already master of the rampart and near seven months elapsed between the first investment and the final surrender of the place From Durazzo the Norman duke advanced into the heart of Epirus or Albania traversed the first mountains of Thessaly surprised three hundred English in the city of Castoria approached Thessalonica and made Constantinople tremble A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs By shipwreck pestilence and the sword his army was reduced to a third of the original numbers and instead of being recruited from Italy he was informed by plaintive epistles of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia the distress of the pope and the approach or invasion of Henry king of Germany Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety he repassed the sea in a single brigantine and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the Norman counts exhorting Bohemond to respect the freedom of his peers and the counts to obey the authority of their leader The son of Guiscard trod in the footsteps of his father and the two destroyers are compared by the Greeks to the caterpillar and the locust the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former seventy eight After winning two battles against the emperor he descended into the plain of Thessaly and besieged Larissa the fabulous realm of Achilles seventy nine which contained the treasure and magazines of the Byzantine camp Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times In the poverty of the state he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches the desertion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia a reenforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren and the Greek soldiers were exercised to ride to draw the bow and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions Alexius had been taught by experience that the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for action and almost incapable of motion eighty his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack In the neighborhood of Larissa the events of war were protracted and balanced The courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous and often successful but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks the city was impregnable and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard betrayed their trusts and enlisted in the service of the emperor Alexius returned to Constantinople with the advantage rather than the honor of victory After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend the son of Guiscard embarked for Italy and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit and sympathized in his misfortune Footnote seventy seven The Romans had changed the inauspicious name of Epidamnus to

Fourth king of Germany and Italy and future emperor of the West The epistle of the Greek monarch eighty one to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie He congratulates Henry on his success in a just and pious war and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age a radiated crown of gold a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast a case of relics with the names and titles of the saints a vase of crystal a vase of sardonyx some balm most probably of Mecca and one hundred pieces of purple To these he added a more solid present of one hundred and forty four thousand Byzantines of gold with a further assurance of two hundred and sixteen thousand so soon as Henry should have entered in arms the Apulian territories and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy The German eighty two who was already in Lombardy at the head of an army and a faction accepted these liberal offers and marched towards the south his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo but the influence of his arms or name in the hasty return of Robert was a full equivalent for the Grecian bribe Henry was the severe adversary of the Normans the allies and vassals of Gregory the Seventh his implacable foe The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest eighty three the king and the pope had degraded each other and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel Henry descended into Italy to assume the Imperial crown and to drive from the Vatican the tyrant of the church eighty four But the Roman people adhered to the cause of Gregory their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany In the fourth year he corrupted as it is said with Byzantine gold the nobles of Rome whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war The gates the bridges and fifty hostages were delivered into his hands the anti pope Clement the Third was consecrated in the Lateran the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the Capitol as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne The ruins of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of Gregory the pope himself was invested in the castle of saint Angelo and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his Norman vassal Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints but on this pressing occasion Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his oath by his interest more potent than oaths by the love of fame and his enmity to the two emperors Unfurling the holy banner he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles the most numerous of his armies six thousand horse and thirty thousand foot was instantly assembled and his march from Salerno to Rome was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favor Henry invincible in sixty six battles trembled at his approach recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy exhorted the Romans to persevere in their allegiance and hastily retreated three days before the entrance of the Normans In less than three years the son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope and of compelling the two emperors of the East and West to fly before his victorious arms eighty five But the triumph of Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome By the aid of the friends of Gregory the walls had been perforated or scaled but the Imperial faction was still powerful and active on the third day the people rose in a furious tumult and a hasty word of the conqueror in his defence or revenge was the signal of fire and pillage eighty six The Saracens of Sicily the subjects of Roger and auxiliaries of his brother embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians many thousands of the citizens in the sight and by the allies of their spiritual father were exposed to violation captivity or death and a spacious quarter of the city from the Lateran to the Coliseum was consumed by the flames and devoted to perpetual solitude eighty seven From a city where he was now hated and might be no longer feared Gregory retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown but this dangerous measure which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany Footnote eighty one The epistle itself Alexias l iii p ninety

himself in a season of repose but in the same year of the flight of the German emperor the indefatigable Robert resumed the design of his eastern conquests The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had promised to his valor the kingdoms of Greece and Asia eighty eight his troops were assembled in arms flushed with success and eager for action Their numbers in the language of Homer are compared by Anna to a swarm of bees eighty nine yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of Guiscard have been already defined they were contained on this second occasion in one hundred and twenty vessels and as the season was far advanced the harbor of Brundusium ninety was preferred to the open road of Otranto Alexius apprehensive of a second attack had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire and obtained from the republic of Venice an important succor of thirty six transports fourteen galleys and nine galiots or ships of extra ordinary strength and magnitude Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople and a tribute to saint Mark the more acceptable as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi By the union of the Greeks and Venetians the Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet but their own neglect or the vigilance of Robert the change of a wind or the shelter of a mist opened a free passage and the Norman troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus With twenty strong and well appointed galleys their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy and though more accustomed to fight on horseback he trusted his own life and the lives of his brother and two sons to the event of a naval combat The dominion of the sea was disputed in three engagements in sight of the Isle of Corfu in the two former the skill and numbers of the allies were superior but in the third the Normans obtained a final and complete victory ninety one The light brigantines of the Greeks were scattered in ignominious flight the nine castles of the Venetians maintained a more obstinate conflict seven were sunk two were taken two thousand five hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor and the daughter of Alexius deplores the loss of thirteen thousand of his subjects or allies The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard and each evening when he had sounded a retreat he calmly explored the causes of his repulse and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects and to baffle the advantages of the enemy The winter season suspended his progress with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople but instead of traversing the hills of Epirus he turned his arms against Greece and the islands where the spoils would repay the labor and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigor and effect But in the Isle of Cephalonia his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease Robert himself in the seventieth year of his age expired in his tent and a suspicion of poison was imputed by public rumor to his wife or to the Greek emperor ninety two This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits and the event sufficiently declares that the Norman greatness was founded on his life ninety three Without the appearance of an enemy a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation and Alexius who had trembled for his empire rejoiced in his deliverance The galley which transported the remains of Guiscard was ship wrecked on the Italian shore but the duke s body was recovered from the sea and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia ninety four a place more illustrious for the birth of Horace ninety five than for the burial of the Norman heroes Roger his second son and successor immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia the esteem or partiality of

of a line of kings and the son of the great count was endowed with the name the conquests and the spirit of the first Roger ninety seven The heir of that Norman adventurer was born in Sicily and at the age of only four years he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island a lot which reason might envy could she indulge for a moment the visionary though virtuous wish of dominion Had Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the Greek colonies ninety eight the opulence and power of Sicily alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo of which one moiety had been ceded to the elder branch struggled to enlarge his Calabrian limits beyond the measure of former treaties and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin William of Apulia the grandson of Robert On the first intelligence of his premature death Roger sailed from Palermo with seven galleys cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno received after ten days negotiation an oath of fidelity from the Norman capital commanded the submission of the barons and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal The sacred spot of Benevento was respectfully spared as the patrimony of saint Peter but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his uncle Guiscard and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count and the Isle of Sicily with a third perhaps of the continent of Italy might form the basis of a kingdom ninety nine which would only yield to the monarchies of France and England The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at Palermo might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was insufficient to justify his regal character and the nine kings of the Latin world one hundred might disclaim their new associate unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff The pride of Anacletus was pleased to confer a title which the pride of the Norman had stooped to solicit one hundred one but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second and while Anacletus sat in the Vatican the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe The infant monarchy of Roger was shaken and almost overthrown by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron and the sword of Lothaire the Second of Germany the excommunications of Innocent the fleets of Pisa and the zeal of saint Bernard were united for the ruin of the Sicilian robber After a gallant resistance the Norman prince was driven from the continent of Italy a new duke of Apulia was invested by the pope and the emperor each of whom held one end of the gonfanon or flagstaff as a token that they asserted their right and suspended their quarrel But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration the German armies soon vanished in disease and desertion one hundred two the Apulian duke with all his adherents was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living like his predecessor Leo the Ninth the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard who now

of the Saracens the Normans whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an African power When the Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a gift of his royal mantle and forty Arabian horses his palace with its sumptuous furniture and the government of the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers The Zeirides one hundred three the descendants of Joseph forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity and after running the little course of an Oriental dynasty were now fainting in their own weakness On the side of the land they were pressed by the Almohades the fanatic princes of Morocco while the sea coast was open to the enterprises of the Greeks and Franks who before the close of the eleventh century had extorted a ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold By the first arms of Roger the island or rock of Malta which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily Tripoli one hundred four a strong and maritime city was the next object of his attack and the slaughter of the males the captivity of the females might

Roger one hundred seven After his death that sword was broken and these transmarine possessions were neglected evacuated or lost under the troubled reign of his successor one hundred eight The

public and private union with the Greek princes whose alliance would dignify his regal character he demanded in marriage a daughter of the Comnenian family and the first steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favorable event But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch and the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated according to the laws of nations by the sufferings of a guiltless people one hundred nine With the fleet of seventy galleys George the admiral of Sicily appeared before Corfu and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute In this invasion of some moment in the annals of commerce the Normans spread themselves by sea and over the provinces of Greece and the venerable age of Athens Thebes and Corinth was violated by rapine and cruelty Of the wrongs of Athens no memorial remains The ancient walls which encompassed without guarding the opulence of Thebes were scaled by the Latin Christians but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry On the approach of the Normans the lower town of Corinth was evacuated the Greeks retired to the citadel which was seated on a lofty eminence abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene an impregnable fortress if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor their sole labor of climbing the hill their general from the commanding eminence admired his own victory and testified his gratitude to Heaven by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore the tutelary saint The silk weavers of both sexes whom George transported to Sicily composed the most valuable part of the spoil and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of using The progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous events the rescue of the king of France and the insult of the Byzantine capital In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks who basely violated the laws of honor and religion The fortunate encounter of the Norman fleet delivered the royal captive and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily Louis continued his journey to Rome and Paris one hundred ten In the absence of the emperor Constantinople and the Hellespont were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger The clergy and people for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys which boldly cast anchor in the front of the Imperial city The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis but George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens and pointed with silver or most probably with fire the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars one hundred eleven This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily who had surprised an unguarded moment Manuel affected to despise while his martial spirit and the forces of the empire were awakened to revenge The Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice but I know not by what favorable allowance of transports victuallers and pinnaces our reason or even our fancy can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen hundred vessels which is proposed by a Byzantine historian These operations were directed with prudence and energy in his homeward voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys which were separated and taken after an obstinate defence Corfu implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign nor could a ship a soldier of the Norman prince be found unless as a captive within the limits of the Eastern empire The prosperity and the health of Roger were already in a declining state while he listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory or defeat the invincible Manuel the foremost in every assault was celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or the Hercules of the age Footnote one hundred nine The silence of the Sicilian historians who end too soon or begin too late must be supplied by Otho of Frisingen a German de Gestis Frederici I l i c thirty three in Muratori Script tom vi p six hundred sixty eight the Venetian

insult These arrows by the compiler Vincent de Beauvais are again transmuted into gold Chapter LVI The Saracens The Franks And The Normans Part V A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian It was the right and duty it might be the interest and glory of Manuel to restore the ancient majesty of the empire to recover the provinces of Italy and Sicily and to chastise this pretended king the grandson of a Norman vassal one hundred twelve The natives of Calabria were still attached to the Greek language and worship which had been inexorably proscribed by the Latin clergy after the loss of her dukes Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword and his death had abated the fear without healing the discontent of his subjects the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion and a nephew of Roger himself invited the enemies of his family and nation The majesty of the purple and a series of Hungarian and Turkish wars prevented Manuel from embarking his person in the Italian expedition To the brave and noble Palaeologus his lieutenant the Greek monarch intrusted a fleet and army the siege of Bari was his first exploit and in every operation gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory Salerno and some places along the western coast maintained their fidelity to the Norman king but he lost in two campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions and the modest emperor disdaining all flattery and falsehood was content with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of Apulia and Calabria whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace The prejudices of the Latins were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the German Caesars one hundred thirteen but the successor of Constantine soon renounced this ignominious pretence claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy and professed his design of chasing the Barbarians beyond the Alps By the artful speeches liberal gifts and unbounded promises of their Eastern ally the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of Frederic Barbarossa the walls of Milan were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel and he poured says the historian a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona whose attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians one hundred fourteen The situation and trade of Ancona rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople and the most intrepid patriots the most faithful servants were rewarded by the wealth and honors of the Byzantine court one hundred fifteen The pride of Manuel disdained and rejected a Barbarian colleague his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the German usurpers and of establishing in the West as in the East his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans With this view he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek monarch the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family one hundred sixteen and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis one hundred seventeen During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third the pope twice received in the Vatican the ambassadors of Constantinople They flattered his piety by the long promised union of the two churches tempted the avarice of his venal court and exhorted the Roman pontiff to seize the just provocation the favorable moment to humble the savage insolence of the Alemanni and to acknowledge the true representative of Constantine and Augustus one

eluded by the prudence of Alexander the Third who paused on this deep and momentous revolution one hundred nineteen nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the Latin name After the reunion with Frederic he spoke a more peremptory language confirmed the acts of his predecessors excommunicated the adherents of Manuel and pronounced the final separation of the churches or at least the empires of Constantinople and Rome one hundred twenty The free cities of Lombardy no longer remembered their foreign benefactor and without preserving the friendship of Ancona he soon incurred the enmity of Venice one hundred twenty one By his own avarice or the complaints of his subjects the Greek emperor was provoked to arrest the persons and confiscate the effects of the Venetian merchants This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people one hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days they swept the coasts of Dalmatia and Greece but after some mutual wounds the war was terminated by an agreement inglorious to the empire insufficient for the republic and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation The lieutenant of Manuel had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily His prophecy was soon verified the death of Palaeologus devolved the command on several chiefs alike eminent in rank alike defective in military talents the Greeks were oppressed by land and sea and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the Normans and Saracens abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror one hundred twenty two Yet the king of Sicily esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel who had landed a second army on the Italian shore he respectfully addressed the new Justinian solicited a peace or truce of thirty years accepted as a gift the regal title and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the Roman empire one hundred twenty three The Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion without expecting perhaps without desiring the service of a Norman army and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any hostilities between Sicily and Constantinople About the end of that period the throne of Manuel was usurped by an inhuman tyrant who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind the sword of William the Second the grandson of Roger was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race and the subjects of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies The Latin historians one hundred twenty four expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts who invaded Romania with a fleet and army and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily The Greeks one hundred twenty five accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica the second city of the empire The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe The latter applaud in songs of triumph the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis on the banks of the Strymon and under the walls of Durazzo A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus had united against the Franks the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents ten thousand were slain in battle and Isaac Angelus the new emperor might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of four thousand captives Such was the event of the last contest between the Greeks and Normans before the expiration of twenty years the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude and the successors of Constantine did not long survive to

observe that Homer s great commentator Eustathias archbishop of Thessalonica refused to desert his flock The sceptre of Roger successively devolved to his son and grandson they might be confounded under the name of William they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good but these epithets which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue cannot strictly be applied to either of the Norman princes When he was roused to arms by danger and shame the first William did not degenerate from the valor of his race but his temper was slothful his manners were dissolute his passions headstrong and mischievous and the monarch is responsible not only for his personal vices but for those of Majo the great admiral who abused the confidence and conspired against the life of his benefactor From the Arabian conquest Sicily had imbibed a deep tincture of Oriental manners the despotism the pomp and even the harem of a sultan and a Christian people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs who openly professed or secretly cherished the religion of Mahomet An eloquent historian of the times one hundred twenty six has delineated the misfortunes of his country one hundred twenty seven the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo the revolt and punishment of his assassins the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself the private feuds that arose from the public confusion and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo the island and the continent during the reign of William the First and the minority of his son The youth innocence and beauty of William the Second one hundred twenty eight endeared him to the nation the factions were reconciled the laws were revived and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince Sicily enjoyed a short season of peace justice and happiness whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity The legitimate male posterity of Tancred of Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William but his aunt the daughter of Roger had married the most powerful prince of the age and Henry the Sixth the son of Frederic Barbarossa descended from the Alps to claim the Imperial crown and the inheritance of his wife Against the unanimous wish of a free people this inheritance could only be acquired by arms and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus who writes at the moment and on the spot with the feelings of a patriot and the prophetic eye of a statesman Constantia the daughter of Sicily nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty and educated in the arts and manners of this fortunate isle departed long since to enrich the Barbarians with our treasures and now returns with her savage allies to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians our opulent cities the places flourishing in a long peace are shaken with fear desolated by slaughter consumed by rapine and polluted by intemperance and lust I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens the rapes of our virgins and matrons one hundred twenty nine In this extremity he interrogates a friend how must the Sicilians act By the unanimous election of a king of valor and experience Sicily and Calabria might yet be preserved one hundred thirty for in the levity of the Apulians ever eager for new revolutions I can repose neither confidence nor hope one hundred thirty one Should Calabria be lost the lofty towers the numerous youth and the naval strength of Messina one hundred thirty two might guard the passage against a foreign invader If the savage Germans coalesce with the pirates of Messina if they destroy with fire the fruitful region so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna one hundred thirty three what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian one hundred thirty four Catana has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake the ancient virtue of Syracuse expires in poverty and solitude one hundred thirty five but Palermo is still crowned with a diadem and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of Christians and Saracens If the two nations under one king can unite for their common safety they may rush on the Barbarians with invincible arms But if the Saracens fatigued by a repetition of injuries should now retire and rebel if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea coast the unfortunate Christians exposed to a double attack and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude one hundred thirty six We must not forget that a priest here prefers his country to his religion and that the Moslems whose alliance he seeks were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily Footnote one hundred twenty six The Historia Sicula of Hugo Falcandus which properly extends from eleven fifty four to eleven sixty nine is inserted in the viiith volume of Muratori s Collection tom vii p two hundred fifty nine three hundred forty four and preceded by a eloquent preface or epistle p two hundred fifty one two hundred fifty eight de Calamitatibus Siciliae Falcandus has been styled the Tacitus of Sicily and after a just but immense abatement from the ist to the xiith century from a senator to a monk I would not strip him of his title his narrative is rapid and perspicuous his style bold and elegant his observation keen he had studied mankind and feels like a man I can only regret the narrow and barren field on which his labors have been cast Footnote one hundred twenty seven The laborious Benedictines l Art de verifier les Dates p eight hundred ninety six are of opinion that the true name of Falcandus is Fulcandus or Foucault According to them Hugues Foucalt a Frenchman by birth and at length abbot of saint Denys had followed into Sicily his patron Stephen de la Perche uncle to the mother of William II archbishop of Palermo and great chancellor of the kingdom Yet Falcandus has all the feelings of a Sicilian and the title of Alumnus which he bestows on himself appears to indicate that he was born or at least educated in the island Footnote one hundred twenty eight Falcand p three hundred three

suppetunt et conatus tuos tam inopia civium quam paucitas bellatorum elidunt Footnote one hundred thirty six The Normans and Sicilians appear to be confounded The hopes or at least the wishes of Falcandus were at first gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred the grandson of the first king whose birth was illegitimate but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish During four years the term of his life and reign he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the Apulian frontier against the powers of Germany and the restitution of a royal captive of Constantia herself without injury or ransom may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason After his decease the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle and Henry pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo The political balance of Italy was destroyed by his success and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the German empire with the kingdom of Sicily But the subtle policy for which the Vatican has so often been praised or arraigned was on this occasion blind and inactive and if it were true that Celestine the Third had kicked away the Imperial crown from the head of the prostrate Henry one hundred thirty seven such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy The Genoese who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure one hundred thirty eight their fleet commanded the straits of Messina and opened the harbor of Palermo and the first act of his government was to abolish the privileges and to seize the property of these imprudent allies The last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the discord of the Christians and Mahometans they fought in the capital several thousands of the latter were slain but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains and disturbed above thirty years the peace of the island By the policy of Frederic the Second sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera in Apulia In their wars against the Roman church the emperor and his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy till they were extirpated at the end of the thirteenth century by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou one hundred thirty nine All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the German conqueror He violated the royal sepulchres thirteen ninety one and explored the secret treasures of the palace Palermo and the whole kingdom the pearls and jewels however precious might be easily removed but one hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily one hundred forty The young king his mother and sisters and the nobles of both sexes were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps and on the slightest rumor of rebellion the captives were deprived of life of their eyes or of the hope of posterity Constantia herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country and the heiress of the Norman line might struggle to check her despotic husband and to save the patrimony of her new born son of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of Frederic the Second Ten years after this revolution the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted by a granddaughter of William the Conqueror to the house of Plantagenet and the adventurous Normans who had raised so many trophies in France England and Ireland in Apulia Sicily and the East were lost either in victory or servitude among the vanquished nations Footnote one hundred thirty seven The testimony of an

Caliphs Defeat And Captivity Of The Emperor Romanus Diogenes By Alp Arslan Power And Magnificence Of Malek Shah Conquest Of Asia Minor And Syria State And Oppression Of Jerusalem Pilgrimages To The Holy Sepulchre From the Isle of Sicily the reader must transport himself beyond the Caspian Sea to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans against whom the first crusade was principally directed Their Scythian empire of the sixth century was long since dissolved but the name was still famous among the Greeks and Orientals and the fragments of the nation each a powerful and independent people were scattered over the desert from China to the Oxus and the Danube the colony of Hungarians was admitted into the republic of Europe and the thrones of Asia were occupied by slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction While Apulia and Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance a swarm of these northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia their princes of the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire from Samarcand to the confines of Greece and Egypt and the Turks have maintained their dominion in Asia Minor till the victorious crescent has been planted on the dome of saint Sophia One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud one the Gaznevide who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia one thousand years after the birth of Christ His father Sebectagi was the slave of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful But in this descent of servitude the first degree was merely titular since it was filled by the sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan who still paid a nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad The second rank was that of a minister of state a lieutenant of the Samanides two who broke by his revolt the bonds of political slavery But the third step was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel from which Sebectagi by his courage and dexterity ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of Gazna three as the son in law and successor of his grateful master The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected and at last overthrown by their servants and in the public disorders the fortune of Mahmud continually increased From him the title of Sultan four was first invented and his kingdom was enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighborhood of Ispahan from the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus But the principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan In this foreign narrative I may not consume a page and a volume would scarcely suffice to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions Never was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons the height of the mountains the breadth of the rivers the barrenness of the desert the multitudes of the enemy or the formidable array of their elephants of war five The sultan of Gazna surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander after a march of three months over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet he reached the famous city of Kinnoge six on the Upper Ganges and in a naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus he fought and vanquished four thousand boats of the natives Delhi Lahor and Multan were compelled to open their gates the fertile kingdom of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay and his avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean On the payment of a tribute the rajahs preserved their dominions the people their lives and fortunes but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous Mussulman was cruel and inexorable many hundred temples or pagodas were levelled with the ground many thousand idols were demolished and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guzarat in the neighborhood of Diu one of the last remaining possessions of the Portuguese seven It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand villages two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service of the Deity whom they washed each morning and evening in water from the distant Ganges the subordinate ministers consisted of three hundred musicians three hundred barbers and five hundred dancing girls conspicuous for their birth or beauty Three sides of the temple were protected by the ocean the narrow isthmus was fortified by a natural or artificial precipice and the city and adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics They confessed the sins and the punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi but if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy precincts he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the divine vengeance By this challenge the faith of Mahmud was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian deity Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the spear of the Moslems the walls were scaled the sanctuary was profaned and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol The trembling Brahmins are said to have offered ten millions seven hundred eleven sterling for his ransom and it was urged by the wisest counsellors that the destruction of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos and that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true believers Your reasons replied the sultan are specious and strong but never in the eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of idols seven hundred twelve He repeated his blows and a treasure of pearls and rubies concealed in the belly of the statue explained in some degree the devout prodigality of the Brahmins The fragments of the idol were distributed to Gazna Mecca and Medina Bagdad listened to the edifying tale and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the title of guardian of the fortune and faith of Mahomet Footnote one I am

Price vol ii p two hundred eighty nine M From the paths of blood and such is the history of nations I cannot refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or virtue The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in the East his subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace his vices were concealed by the veil of religion and two familiar examples will testify his justice and magnanimity I As he sat in the Divan an unhappy subject bowed before the throne to accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had driven him from his house and bed Suspend your clamors said Mahmud inform me of his next visit and ourself in person will judge and punish the offender The sultan followed his guide invested the house with his guards and extinguishing the torches pronounced the death of the criminal who had been seized in the act of rapine and adultery After the execution of his sentence the lights were rekindled Mahmud fell prostrate in prayer and rising from the ground demanded some homely fare which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger The poor man whose injury he had avenged was unable to suppress his astonishment and curiosity and the courteous monarch condescended to explain the motives of this singular behavior I had reason to suspect that none except one of my sons could dare to perpetrate such an outrage and I extinguished the lights that my justice might be blind and inexorable My prayer was a thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender and so painful was my anxiety that I had passed three days without food since the first moment of your complaint II The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of the Bowides the sovereigns of the western Persia he was disarmed by an epistle of the sultana mother and delayed his invasion till the manhood of her son eight During the life of my husband said the artful regent I was ever apprehensive of your ambition he was a prince and a soldier worthy of your arms He is now no more his sceptre has passed to a woman and a child and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness How inglorious would be your conquest how shameful your defeat and yet the event of war is in the hand of the Almighty Avarice was the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of Mahmud and never has that passion been more richly satiated eight hundred eleven The Orientals exceed the measure of credibility in the account of millions of gold and silver such as the avidity of man has never accumulated in the magnitude of pearls diamonds and rubies such as have never been produced by the workmanship of nature nine Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with precious minerals her trade in every age has attracted the gold and silver of the world and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of the Mahometan conquerors His behavior in the last days of his life evinces the vanity of these possessions so laboriously won so dangerously held and so inevitably lost He surveyed the vast and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna burst into tears and again closed the doors without bestowing any portion of the wealth which he could no longer hope to preserve The following day he reviewed the state of his military force one hundred thousand foot fifty five thousand horse and thirteen hundred elephants of battle ten He again wept the instability of human greatness and his grief was imbittered by the hostile progress of the Turkmans whom he had introduced into the heart of his Persian kingdom Footnote eight D Herbelot Bibliotheque Orientale p five hundred twenty seven

Arabs Curds and Turkmans eleven Of the last mentioned people two considerable branches extend on either side of the Caspian Sea the western colony can muster forty thousand soldiers the eastern less obvious to the traveller but more strong and populous has increased to the number of one hundred thousand families In the midst of civilized nations they preserve the manners of the Scythian desert remove their encampments with a change of seasons and feed their cattle among the ruins of palaces and temples Their flocks and herds are their only riches their tents either black or white according to the color of the banner are covered with felt and of a circular form their winter apparel is a sheep skin a robe of cloth or cotton their summer garment the features of the men are harsh and ferocious the countenance of their women is soft and pleasing Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise of arms they fight on horseback and their courage is displayed in frequent contests with each other and with their neighbors For the license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the sovereign of the land but the domestic jurisdiction is in the hands of the chiefs and elders The first emigration of the Eastern Turkmans the most ancient of the race may be ascribed to the tenth century of the Christian aera twelve In the decline of the caliphs and the weakness of their lieutenants the barrier of the Jaxartes was often violated in each invasion after the victory or retreat of their countrymen some wandering tribe embracing the Mahometan faith obtained a free encampment in the spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged these emigrations which recruited their armies awed their subjects and rivals and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of Turkestan and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide beyond the example of former times He was admonished of his error by the chief of the race of Seljuk who dwelt in the territory of Bochara The sultan had inquired what supply of men he could furnish for military service If you send replied Ismael one of these arrows into our camp fifty thousand of your servants will mount on horseback And if that number continued Mahmud should not be sufficient Send this second arrow to the horde of Balik and you will find fifty thousand more But said the Gaznevide dissembling his anxiety if I should stand in need of the whole force of your kindred tribes Despatch my bow was the last reply of Ismael and as it is circulated around the summons will be obeyed by two hundred thousand horse The apprehension of such formidable friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most obnoxious tribes into the heart of Chorasan where they would be separated from their brethren of the River Oxus and enclosed on all sides by the walls of obedient cities But the face of the country was an object of temptation rather than terror and the vigor of government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of Gazna The shepherds were converted into robbers the bands of robbers were collected into an army of conquerors as far as Ispahan and the Tigris Persia was afflicted by their predatory inroads and the Turkmans were not ashamed or afraid to measure their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Asia Massoud the son and successor of Mahmud had too long neglected the advice of his wisest Omrahs Your enemies they repeatedly urged were in their origin a swarm of ants they are now little snakes and unless they be instantly crushed they will acquire the venom and magnitude of serpents After some alternatives of truce and hostility after the repulse or partial success of his lieutenants the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans who attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular onset Massoud says the Persian historian thirteen plunged singly to oppose the torrent of gleaming arms exhibiting such acts of gigantic force and valor as never king had before displayed A few of his friends roused by his words and actions and that innate honor which inspires the brave seconded their lord so well that wheresoever he turned his fatal sword the enemies were mowed down or retreated before him But now when victory seemed to blow on his standard misfortune was active behind it for when he looked round be beheld almost his whole army excepting that body he commanded in person devouring the paths of flight The Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or treachery of some generals of Turkish race and this memorable day of Zendecan fourteen founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd kings fifteen Footnote eleven See a just and natural

errors of these Greeks which I shall not stop to unravel may inspire some distrust of the story of Cyaxares and Cyrus as it is told by their most eloquent predecessor The victorious Turkmans immediately proceeded to the election of a king and if the probable tale of a Latin historian sixteen deserves any credit they determined by lot the choice of their new master A number of arrows were successively inscribed with the name of a tribe a family and a candidate they were drawn from the bundle by the hand of a child and the important prize was obtained by Togrul Beg the son of Michael the son of Seljuk whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of his posterity The sultan Mahmud who valued himself on his skill in national genealogy professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk yet the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and renown seventeen For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince Seljuk was banished from Turkestan with a numerous tribe of his friends and vassals he passed the Jaxartes encamped in the neighborhood of Samarcand embraced the religion of Mahomet and acquired the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels His age of a hundred and seven years surpassed the life of his son and Seljuk adopted the care of his two grandsons Togrul and Jaafar the eldest of whom at the age of forty five was invested with the title of Sultan in the royal city of Nishabur The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues of the successful candidate It would be superfluous to praise the valor of a Turk and the ambition of Togrul eighteen was equal to his valor By his arms the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern kingdoms of Persia and gradually driven to the banks of the Indus in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest In the West he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides and the sceptre of Irak passed from the Persian to the Turkish nation The princes who had felt or who feared the Seljukian arrows bowed their heads in the dust by the conquest of Aderbijan or Media he approached the Roman confines and the shepherd presumed to despatch an ambassador or herald to demand the tribute and obedience of the emperor of Constantinople nineteen In his own dominions Togrul was the father of his soldiers and people by a firm and equal administration Persia was relieved from the evils of anarchy and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood became the guardians of justice and the public peace The more rustic perhaps the wisest portion of the Turkmans twenty continued to dwell in the tents of their ancestors and from the Oxus to the Euphrates these military colonies were protected and propagated by their native princes But the Turks of the court and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure they imitated the dress language and manners of Persia and the royal palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and magnificence of a great monarchy The most deserving of the Arabians and Persians were promoted to the honors of the state and the whole body of the Turkish nation embraced with fervor and sincerity the religion of Mahomet The northern swarms of Barbarians who overspread both Europe and Asia have been irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar conduct Among the Moslems as among the Christians their vague and local traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of the prevailing system to the fame of antiquity and the consent of nations But the triumph of the Koran is more pure and meritorious as it was not assisted by any visible splendor of worship which might allure the Pagans by some resemblance of idolatry The first of the Seljukian sultans was conspicuous by his zeal and faith each day he repeated the five prayers which are enjoined to the true believers of each week the two first days were consecrated by an extraordinary fast and in every city a mosch was completed before Togrul presumed to lay the

Seljuk imbibed a lively reverence for the successor of the prophet But that sublime character was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt and each of the rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the judgment of the strong though illiterate Barbarians Mahmud the Gaznevide had declared himself in favor of the line of Abbas and had treated with indignity the robe of honor which was presented by the Fatimite ambassador Yet the ungrateful Hashemite had changed with the change of fortune he applauded the victory of Zendecan and named the Seljukian sultan his temporal vicegerent over the Moslem world As Togrul executed and enlarged this important trust he was called to the deliverance of the caliph Cayem and obeyed the holy summons which gave a new kingdom to his arms twenty two In the palace of Bagdad the commander of the faithful still slumbered a venerable phantom His servant or master the prince of the Bowides could no longer protect him from the insolence of meaner tyrants and the Euphrates and Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of the Turkish and Arabian emirs The presence of a conqueror was implored as a blessing and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were excused as the sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the health of the republic At the head of an irresistible force the sultan of Persia marched from Hamadan the proud were crushed the prostrate were spared the prince of the Bowides disappeared the heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of Togrul and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of Mosul and Bagdad After the chastisement of the guilty and the restoration of peace the royal shepherd accepted the reward of his labors and a solemn comedy represented the triumph of religious prejudice over Barbarian power twenty three The Turkish sultan embarked on the Tigris landed at the gate of Racca and made his public entry on horseback At the palace gate he respectfully dismounted and walked on foot preceded by his emirs without arms The caliph was seated behind his black veil the black garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders and he held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God The conqueror of the East kissed the ground stood some time in a modest posture and was led towards the throne by the vizier and interpreter After Togrul had seated himself on another throne his commission was publicly read which declared him the temporal lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet He was successively invested with seven robes of honor and presented with seven slaves the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian empire His mystic veil was perfumed with musk two crowns two hundred thirty one were placed on his head two cimeters were girded to his side as the symbols of a double reign over the East and West After this inauguration the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a second time but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faithful and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of the Moslems In a second visit to Bagdad the Seljukian prince again rescued the caliph from his enemies and devoutly on foot led the bridle of his mule from the prison to the palace Their alliance was cemented by the marriage of Togrul s sister with the successor of the prophet Without reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem but Cayem proudly refused his daughter to the sultan disdained to mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian shepherd and protracted the negotiation many months till the gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was still in the hands of a master The royal nuptials were followed by the death of Togrul himself twenty four as he left no children his nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title and prerogatives of sultan and his name after that of the caliph was pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems Yet in this revolution the Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power On the throne of Asia the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the domestic administration of Bagdad and the commanders of the faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which they had been exposed by the presence and poverty of the Persian dynasty Footnote twenty two Consult the Bibliotheque Orientale in the articles of the

discord and degeneracy of the Saracens respected the Asiatic provinces of Rome which by the victories of Nicephorus Zimisces and Basil had been extended as far as Antioch and the eastern boundaries of Armenia Twenty five years after the death of Basil his successors were suddenly assaulted by an unknown race of Barbarians who united the Scythian valor with the fanaticism of new proselytes and the art and riches of a powerful monarchy twenty five The myriads of Turkish horse overspread a frontier of six hundred miles from Tauris to Arzeroum and the blood of one hundred and thirty thousand Christians was a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet Yet the arms of Togrul did not make any deep or lasting impression on the Greek empire The torrent rolled away from the open country the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege of an Armenian city the obscure hostilities were continued or suspended with a vicissitude of events and the bravery of the Macedonian legions renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia twenty six The name of Alp Arslan the valiant lion is expressive of the popular idea of the perfection of man and the successor of Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal animal He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish cavalry and entered Caesarea the metropolis of Cappadocia to which he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple of saint Basil The solid structure resisted the destroyer but he carried away the doors of the shrine incrusted with gold and pearls and profaned the relics of the tutelar saint whose mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable rust of antiquity The final conquest of Armenia and Georgia was achieved by Alp Arslan In Armenia the title of a kingdom and the spirit of a nation were annihilated the artificial fortifications were yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople by strangers without faith veterans without pay or arms and recruits without experience or discipline The loss of this important frontier was the news of a day and the Catholics were neither surprised nor displeased that a people so deeply infected with the Nestorian and Eutychian errors had been delivered by Christ and his mother into the hands of the infidels twenty seven The woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus were more strenuously defended by the native Georgians twenty eight or Iberians but the Turkish sultan and his son Malek were indefatigable in this holy war their captives were compelled to promise a spiritual as well as temporal obedience and instead of their collars and bracelets an iron horseshoe a badge of ignominy was imposed on the infidels who still adhered to the worship of their fathers The change however was not sincere or universal and through ages of servitude the Georgians have maintained the succession of their princes and bishops But a race of men whom nature has cast in her most perfect mould is degraded by poverty ignorance and vice their profession and still more their practice of Christianity is an empty name and if they have emerged from heresy it is only because they are too illiterate to remember a metaphysical creed twenty nine

campaign he most scandalously took the field during the holy festival of Easter In the palace Diogenes was no more than the husband of Eudocia in the camp he was the emperor of the Romans and he sustained that character with feeble resources and invincible courage By his spirit and success the soldiers were taught to act the subjects to hope and the enemies to fear The Turks had penetrated into the heart of Phrygia but the sultan himself had resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war and their numerous detachments were scattered over Asia in the security of conquest Laden with spoil and careless of discipline they were separately surprised and defeated by the Greeks the activity of the emperor seemed to multiply his presence and while they heard of his expedition to Antioch the enemy felt his sword on the hills of Trebizond In three laborious campaigns the Turks were driven beyond the Euphrates in the fourth and last Romanus undertook the deliverance of Armenia The desolation of the land obliged him to transport a supply of two months provisions and he marched forwards to the siege of Malazkerd thirty an important fortress in the midway between the modern cities of Arzeroum and Van His army amounted at the least to one hundred thousand men The troops of Constantinople were reenforced by the disorderly multitudes of Phrygia and Cappadocia but the real strength was composed of the subjects and allies of Europe the legions of Macedonia and the squadrons of Bulgaria the Uzi a Moldavian horde who were themselves of the Turkish race thirty one and above all the mercenary and adventurous bands of French and Normans Their lances were commanded by the valiant Ursel of Baliol the kinsman or father of the Scottish kings thirty two and were allowed to excel in the

exchanged the sword for the gown On the report of this bold invasion which threatened his hereditary dominions Alp Arslan flew to the scene of action at the head of forty thousand horse thirty three His rapid and skilful evolutions distressed and dismayed the superior numbers of the Greeks and in the defeat of Basilacius one of their principal generals he displayed the first example of his valor and clemency The imprudence of the emperor had separated his forces after the reduction of Malazkerd It was in vain that he attempted to recall the mercenary Franks they refused to obey his summons he disdained to await their return the desertion of the Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion and against the most salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and decisive action Had he listened to the fair proposals of the sultan Romanus might have secured a retreat perhaps a peace but in these overtures he supposed the fear or weakness of the enemy and his answer was conceived in the tone of insult and defiance If the Barbarian wishes for peace let him evacuate the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his sincerity Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand but he wept the death of so many faithful Moslems and after a devout prayer proclaimed a free permission to all who were desirous of retiring from the field With his own hands he tied up his horse s tail exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and cimeter clothed himself in a white garment perfumed his body with musk and declared that if he were vanquished that spot should be the place of his burial thirty four The sultan himself had affected to cast away his missile weapons but his hopes of victory were placed in the arrows of the Turkish cavalry whose squadrons were loosely distributed in the form of a crescent Instead of the successive lines and reserves of the Grecian tactics Romulus led his army in a single and solid phalanx and pressed with vigor and impatience the artful and yielding resistance of the Barbarians In this desultory and fruitless combat he spent the greater part of a summer s day till prudence and fatigue compelled him to return to his camp But a retreat is always perilous in the face of an active foe and no sooner had the standard been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken by the base cowardice or the baser jealousy of Andronicus a rival prince who disgraced his birth and the purple of the Caesars thirty five The Turkish squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on this moment of confusion and lassitude and the horns of their formidable crescent were closed in the rear of the Greeks In the destruction of the army and pillage of the camp it would be needless to mention the number of the slain or captives The Byzantine writers deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl they forgot to mention that in this fatal day the Asiatic provinces of Rome were irretrievably sacrificed

treason As long as a hope survived Romanus attempted to rally and save the relics of his army When the centre the Imperial station was left naked on all sides and encompassed by the victorious Turks he still with desperate courage maintained the fight till the close of day at the head of the brave and faithful subjects who adhered to his standard They fell around him his horse was slain the emperor was wounded yet he stood alone and intrepid till he was oppressed and bound by the strength of multitudes The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed by a slave and a soldier a slave who had seen him on the throne of Constantinople and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been excused on the promise of some signal service Despoiled of his arms his jewels and his purple Romanus spent a dreary and perilous night on the field of battle amidst a disorderly crowd of the meaner Barbarians In the morning the royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan who doubted of his fortune till the identity of the person was ascertained by the report of his ambassadors and by the more pathetic evidence of Basilacius who embraced with tears the feet of his unhappy sovereign The successor of Constantine in a plebeian habit was led into the Turkish divan and commanded to kiss the ground before the lord of Asia He reluctantly obeyed and Alp Arslan starting from his throne is said to have planted his foot on the neck of the Roman emperor thirty six But the fact is doubtful and if in this moment of insolence the sultan complied with the national custom the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise of his bigoted foes and may afford a lesson to the most civilized ages He instantly raised the royal captive from the ground and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy assured him that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his equals and the vicissitudes of fortune From the divan Romanus was conducted to an adjacent tent where he was served with pomp and reverence by the officers of the sultan who twice each day seated him in the place of honor at his own table In a free and familiar conversation of eight days not a word not a look of insult escaped from the conqueror but he severely censured the unworthy subjects who had deserted their valiant prince in the hour of danger and gently admonished his antagonist of some errors which he had committed in the management of the war In the preliminaries of negotiation Alp Arslan asked him what treatment he expected to receive and the calm indifference of the emperor displays the freedom of his mind If you are cruel said he you will take my life if you listen to pride you will drag me at your chariot wheels if you consult your interest you will accept a ransom and restore me to my country And what continued the sultan would have been your own behavior had fortune smiled on your arms The reply of the Greek betrays a sentiment which prudence and even gratitude should have taught him to suppress Had I vanquished he fiercely said I would have inflicted on thy body many a stripe The Turkish conqueror smiled at the insolence of his captive observed that the Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of injuries and nobly declared that he would not imitate an example which he condemned After mature deliberation Alp Arslan dictated the terms of liberty and peace a ransom of a million three hundred sixty one an annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces of gold thirty seven the marriage of the royal children and the deliverance of all the Moslems who were in the power of the Greeks Romanus with a sigh subscribed this treaty so disgraceful to the majesty of the empire he was immediately invested with a Turkish robe of honor his nobles and patricians were restored to their sovereign and the sultan after a courteous embrace dismissed him with rich presents and a military guard No sooner did he reach the confines of the empire than he was informed that the palace and provinces had disclaimed their allegiance to a captive a sum of two hundred thousand pieces was painfully collected and the fallen monarch transmitted this part of his ransom with a sad confession of his impotence and disgrace The generosity or perhaps the ambition of the sultan prepared to espouse the cause of his ally but his designs were prevented by the defeat imprisonment and death of Romanus Diogenes thirty eight Footnote thirty six This circumstance which we read and doubt in

Abulfeda and his epitomizer Benschounah a Chronicle of the Caliphs by Abulmahasen of Egypt and Novairi of Africa In the treaty of peace it does not appear that Alp Arslan extorted any province or city from the captive emperor and his revenge was satisfied with the trophies of his victory and the spoils of Anatolia from Antioch to the Black Sea The fairest part of Asia was subject to his laws twelve hundred princes or the sons of princes stood before his throne and two hundred thousand soldiers marched under his banners The sultan disdained to pursue the fugitive Greeks but he meditated the more glorious conquest of Turkestan the original seat of the house of Seljuk He moved from Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus a bridge was thrown over the river and twenty days were consumed in the passage of his troops But the progress of the great king was retarded by the governor of Berzem and Joseph the Carizmian presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East When he was produced a captive in the royal tent the sultan instead of praising his valor severely reproached his obstinate folly and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence that he should be fastened to four stakes and left to expire in that painful situation At this command the desperate Carizmian drawing a dagger rushed headlong towards the throne the guards raised their battle axes their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan the most skilful archer of the age he drew his bow but his foot slipped the arrow glanced aside and he received in his breast the dagger of Joseph who was instantly cut in pieces The wound was mortal and the Turkish prince bequeathed a dying admonition to the pride of kings In my youth said Alp Arslan I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God to distrust my own strength and never to despise the most contemptible foe I have neglected these lessons and my neglect has been deservedly punished Yesterday as from an eminence I beheld the numbers the discipline and the spirit of my armies the earth seemed to tremble under my feet and I said in my heart Surely thou art the king of the world the greatest and most invincible of warriors These armies are no longer mine and in the confidence of my personal strength I now fall by the hand of an assassin thirty nine Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a Turk and a Mussulman his voice and stature commanded the reverence of mankind his face was shaded with long whiskers and his ample turban was fashioned in the shape of a crown The remains of the sultan were deposited in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty and the passenger might read and meditate this useful inscription forty O ye who have seen the glory of Alp Arslan exalted to the heavens repair to Maru and you will behold it buried in the dust The annihilation of the inscription and the tomb itself more forcibly proclaims the instability of human greatness Footnote thirty nine This interesting death is told by D Herbelot p one hundred three one

four three hundred forty five Footnote forty A critic of high renown the late doctor Johnson who has severely scrutinized the epitaphs of Pope might cavil in this sublime inscription at the words repair to Maru since the reader must already be at Maru before he could peruse the inscription During the life of Alp Arslan his eldest son had been acknowledged as the future sultan of the Turks On his father s death the inheritance was disputed by an uncle a cousin and a brother they drew their cimeters and assembled their followers and the triple victory of Malek Shah forty one established his own reputation and the right of primogeniture In every age and more especially in Asia the thirst of power has inspired the same passions and occasioned the same disorders but from the long series of civil war it would not be easy to extract a sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the Turkish prince On the eve of the battle he performed his devotions at Thous before the tomb of the Imam Riza As the sultan rose from the ground he asked his vizier Nizam who had knelt beside him what had been the object of his secret petition That your arms may be crowned with victory was the prudent and most probably the sincere answer of the minister For my part replied the generous Malek I implored the Lord of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown if my brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems The favorable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph and for the first time the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful was communicated to a Barbarian But this Barbarian by his personal merit and the extent of his empire was the greatest prince of his age After the settlement of Persia and Syria he marched at the head of innumerable armies to achieve the conquest of Turkestan which had been undertaken by his father In his passage of the Oxus the boatmen who had been employed in transporting some troops complained that their payment was assigned on the revenues of Antioch The sultan frowned at this preposterous choice but he miled at the artful flattery of his vizier It was not to postpone their reward that I selected those remote places but to leave a memorial to posterity that under your reign Antioch and the Oxus were subject to the same sovereign But this description of his limits was unjust and parsimonious beyond the Oxus he reduced to his obedience the cities of Bochara Carizme and Samarcand and crushed each rebellious slave or independent savage who dared to resist Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes the last boundary of Persian civilization the hordes of Turkestan yielded to his supremacy his name was inserted on the coins and in the prayers of Cashgar a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China From the Chinese frontier he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or feudatory sway to the west and south as far as the mountains of Georgia the neighborhood of Constantinople the holy city of Jerusalem and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix Instead of resigning himself to the luxury of his harem the shepherd king both in peace and war was in action and in the field By the perpetual motion of the royal camp each province was successively blessed with his presence and he is said to have perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his dominions which surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs Of these expeditions the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of Mecca the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by his arms the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the profusion of his alms and the desert was cheered by the places of relief and refreshment which he instituted for the use of his brethren Hunting was the pleasure and even the passion of the sultan and his train consisted of forty seven thousand horses but after the massacre of a Turkish chase for each piece of game he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor a slight atonement at the expense of the people for the cost and mischief of the amusement of kings In the peaceful prosperity of his reign the cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and hospitals with moschs and colleges few departed from his Divan without reward and none without justice The language and literature of Persia revived under the house of Seljuk forty two and if Malek emulated the liberality of a Turk less potent than himself forty three his palace might resound with the songs of a hundred poets The sultan bestowed a more serious and learned care on the reformation of the calendar which was effected by a general assembly of the astronomers of the East By a law of the prophet the Moslems are confined to the irregular course of the lunar months in Persia since the age of Zoroaster the revolution of the sun has been known and celebrated as an annual festival forty four but after the fall of the Magian empire the intercalation had been neglected the fractions of minutes and hours were multiplied into days and the date of the springs was removed from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces The reign of Malek was illustrated by the Gelalaean aera and all errors either past or future were corrected by a computation of time which surpasses the Julian and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style forty five Footnote forty one The Bibliotheque Orientale has given the

veterum Persarum c sixteen p two hundred two hundred eleven In a period when Europe was plunged in the deepest barbarism the light and splendor of Asia may be ascribed to the docility rather than the knowledge of the Turkish conquerors An ample share of their wisdom and virtue is due to a Persian vizier who ruled the empire under the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son Nizam one of the most illustrious ministers of the East was honored by the caliph as an oracle of religion and science he was trusted by the sultan as the faithful vicegerent of his power and justice After an administration of thirty years the fame of the vizier his wealth and even his services were transformed into crimes He was overthrown by the insidious arts of a woman and a rival and his fall was hastened by a rash declaration that his cap and ink horn the badges of his office were connected by the divine decree with the throne and diadem of the sultan At the age of ninety three years the venerable statesman was dismissed by his master accused by his enemies and murdered by a fanatic four hundred fifty one the last words of Nizam attested his innocence and the remainder of Malek s life was short and inglorious From Ispahan the scene of this disgraceful transaction the sultan moved to Bagdad with the design of transplanting the caliph and of fixing his own residence in the capital of the Moslem world The feeble successor of Mahomet obtained a respite of ten days and before the expiration of the term the Barbarian was summoned by the angel of death His ambassadors at Constantinople had asked in marriage a Roman princess but the proposal was decently eluded and the daughter of Alexius who might herself have been the victim expresses her abhorrence of his unnatural conjunction

vacant throne was disputed by his brother and his four sons four hundred sixty one and after a series of civil wars the treaty which reconciled the surviving candidates confirmed a lasting separation in the Persian dynasty the eldest and principal branch of the house of Seljuk The three younger dynasties were those of Kerman of Syria and of Roum the first of these commanded an extensive though obscure forty seven dominion on the shores of the Indian Ocean forty eight the second expelled the Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus and the third our peculiar care invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor The generous policy of Malek contributed to their elevation he allowed the princes of his blood even those whom he had vanquished in the field to seek new kingdoms worthy of their ambition nor was he displeased that they should draw away the more ardent spirits who might have disturbed the tranquillity of his reign As the supreme head of his family and nation the great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his royal brethren the thrones of Kerman and Nice of Aleppo and Damascus the Atabeks and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia erected their standards under the shadow of his sceptre forty nine and the hordes of Turkmans overspread the plains of the Western Asia After the death of Malek the bands of union and subordination were relaxed and finally dissolved the indulgence of the house of Seljuk invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms and in the Oriental style a crowd of princes arose from the dust of their feet fifty Footnote four hundred

a tear over his grave His five sons strong in arms ambitious of power and eager for revenge unsheathed their cimeters against the son of Alp Arslan The two armies expected the signal when the caliph forgetful of the majesty which secluded him from vulgar eyes interposed his venerable mediation Instead of shedding the blood of your brethren your brethren both in descent and faith unite your forces in a holy war against the Greeks the enemies of God and his apostle They listened to his voice the sultan embraced his rebellious kinsmen and the eldest the valiant Soliman accepted the royal standard which gave him the free conquest and hereditary command of the provinces of the Roman empire from Arzeroum to Constantinople and the unknown regions of the West fifty one Accompanied by his four brothers he passed the Euphrates the Turkish camp was soon seated in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia and his flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as the Hellespont and the Black Sea Since the decline of the empire the peninsula of Asia Minor had been exposed to the transient though destructive inroads of the Persians and Saracens but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for the Turkish sultan and his arms were introduced by the Greeks who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country Since the captivity of Romanus six years the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled under the weight of the Imperial crown till the provinces of the East and West were lost in the same month by a double rebellion of either chief Nicephorus was the common name but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the European and Asiatic candidates Their reasons or rather their promises were weighed in the Divan and after some hesitation Soliman declared himself in favor of Botoniates opened a free passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice and joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross After his ally had ascended the throne of Constantinople the sultan was hospitably entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari and a body of two thousand Turks was transported into Europe to whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the defeat and captivity of his rival Bryennius But the conquest of Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont and the regular progress of the Turks who fortified the passes of the rivers and mountains left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion Another candidate implored the aid of the sultan Melissenus in his purple robes and red buskins attended the motions of the Turkish camp and the desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a Roman prince who immediately surrendered them into the hands of the Barbarians These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of peace with the emperor Alexius his fear of Robert compelled him to seek the friendship of Soliman and

splendor of the Augustan age existed only in books and ruins which were equally obscure in the eyes of the Scythian conquerors Yet in the present decay Anatolia still contains some wealthy and populous cities and under the Byzantine empire they were far more flourishing in numbers size and opulence By the choice of the sultan Nice the metropolis of Bithynia was preferred for his palace and fortress the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum was planted one hundred miles from Constantinople and the divinity of Christ was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been

suffer the triumph of the Pagans and the apostasy of their brethren many thousand children were marked by the knife of circumcision and many thousand captives were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their masters fifty four After the loss of Asia Antioch still maintained her primitive allegiance to Christ and Caesar but the solitary province was separated from all Roman aid and surrounded on all sides by the Mahometan powers The despair of Philaretus the governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and loyalty had not his guilt been prevented by his son who hastened to

the most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that of Jerusalem fifty eight which soon became the theatre of nations In their capitulation with Omar the inhabitants had stipulated the assurance of their religion and property but the articles were interpreted by a master against whom it was dangerous to dispute and in the four hundred years of the reign of the caliphs the political climate of Jerusalem was exposed to the vicissitudes of storm and sunshine fifty nine By the increase of proselytes and population the Mahometans might excuse the usurpation of three fourths of the city but a peculiar quarter was resolved for the patriarch with his clergy and people a tribute of two pieces of gold was the price of protection and the sepulchre of Christ with the church of the Resurrection was still left in the hands of his votaries Of these votaries the most numerous and respectable portion were strangers to Jerusalem the pilgrimages to the Holy Land had been stimulated rather than suppressed by the conquest of the Arabs and the enthusiasm which had always prompted these perilous journeys was nourished by the congenial passions of grief and indignation A crowd of pilgrims from the East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre and the adjacent sanctuaries more especially at the festival of Easter and the Greeks and Latins the Nestorians and Jacobites the Copts and Abyssinians the Armenians and Georgians maintained the chapels the clergy and the poor of their respective communions The harmony of prayer in so many various tongues the worship of so many nations in the common temple of their religion might have afforded a spectacle of edification and peace but the zeal of the Christian sects was imbittered by hatred and revenge and in the kingdom of a suffering Messiah who had pardoned his enemies they aspired to command and persecute their spiritual brethren The preeminence was asserted by the spirit and numbers of the Franks and the greatness of Charlemagne sixty protected both the Latin pilgrims and the Catholics of the East The poverty of Carthage Alexandria and Jerusalem was relieved by the alms of that pious emperor and many monasteries of Palestine were founded or restored by his liberal devotion Harun Alrashid the greatest of the Abbassides esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy of genius and power their friendship was cemented by a frequent intercourse of gifts and embassies and the caliph without resigning the substantial dominion presented the emperor with the keys of the holy sepulchre and perhaps of the city of Jerusalem In the decline of the Carlovingian monarchy the republic of Amalphi promoted the interest of trade and religion in the East Her vessels transported the Latin pilgrims to the coasts

revere the tomb of a prophet the disciples of Mahomet instead of blaming would have imitated their piety but these rigid Unitarians were scandalized by a worship which represents the birth death and resurrection of a God the Catholic images were branded with the name of idols and the Moslems smiled with indignation sixty two at the miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the holy sepulchre sixty three This pious fraud first devised in the ninth century sixty four was devoutly cherished by the Latin crusaders and is annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek Armenian and

will not attempt with Mosheim to explain the mode Our travellers have failed with the blood of saint Januarius at Naples The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides to the Fatimites was a benefit rather than an injury to the Holy Land A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the importance of Christian trade and the emirs of Palestine were less remote from the justice and power of the throne But the third of these Fatimite caliphs was the famous Hakem sixty seven a frantic youth who was delivered by his impiety and despotism from the fear either of God or man and whose reign was a wild mixture of vice and folly Regardless of the most ancient customs of Egypt he imposed on the women an absolute confinement the restraint excited the clamors of both sexes their clamors provoked his fury a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a bloody conflict At first the caliph declared himself a zealous Mussulman the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges twelve hundred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at his expense in letters of gold and his edict extirpated the vineyards of the Upper Egypt But his vanity was soon flattered by the hope of introducing a new religion he aspired above the fame of a prophet and styled himself the visible image of the Most High God who after nine apparitions on earth was at length manifest in his royal person At the name of Hakem the lord of the living and the dead every knee was bent in religious adoration his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith and at the present hour a free and warlike people the Druses of Mount Libanus are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman and tyrant sixty eight In his divine character Hakem hated the Jews and Christians as the servants of his rivals while some remains of prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favor of the law of Mahomet Both in Egypt and Palestine his cruel and wanton persecution made some martyrs and many apostles the common rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of strangers and natives The temple of the Christian world the church of the Resurrection was demolished to its foundations the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted and much profane labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which properly constitutes the holy sepulchre At the report of this sacrilege the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land they contented themselves with burning or banishing the Jews as the secret advisers of the impious Barbarian sixty nine Yet the calamities of Jerusalem were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy or repentance of Hakem himself and the royal mandate was sealed for the restitution of the churches when the tyrant was assassinated by the emissaries of his sister The succeeding caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and policy a free toleration was again granted with the pious aid of the emperor of Constantinople the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins and after a short abstinence the pilgrims returned with an increase of appetite to the spiritual feast seventy In the sea voyage of Palestine the dangers were frequent and the opportunities rare but the conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between Germany and Greece The charity of saint Stephen the apostle of his kingdom relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren seventy one and from Belgrade to Antioch they traversed fifteen hundred miles of a Christian empire Among the Franks the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times and the roads were covered with multitudes of either sex and of every rank who professed their contempt of life so soon as they should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer Princes and prelates abandoned the care of their dominions and the numbers of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross About thirty years before the first crusade the arch bishop of Mentz with the bishops of Utrecht Bamberg and Ratisbon undertook this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan and the multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons At Constantinople they were hospitably entertained by the emperor but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild Arabs they drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance and sustained siege in the village of Capernaum till they were rescued by the venal protection of the Fatimite emir After visiting the holy places they embarked for Italy but only a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety in their native land Ingulphus a secretary of William the Conqueror was a companion of this pilgrimage he observes that they sailed from Normandy thirty stout and well appointed horsemen but that they repassed the Alps twenty miserable palmers with the staff in their hand and the wallet at their back seventy two Footnote sixty seven See D

industrious Niebuhr Voyages tom ii p three hundred fifty four three hundred fifty seven and the second volume of the recent and instructive Travels of M de Volney Note The religion of the Druses has within the present year been fully developed from their own writings which have long lain neglected in the libraries of Paris and Oxford in the Expose de la Religion des Druses by M Silvestre de Sacy Deux tomes Paris eighteen thirty eight The learned author has prefixed a life of Hakem Biamr Allah which enables us to correct several errors in the account of Gibbon These errors chiefly arose from his want of knowledge or of attention to the chronology of Hakem s life Hakem succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the year of the Hegira three hundred eighty six He did not assume his divinity till four hundred eight His life was indeed a wild mixture of vice and folly to which may be added of the most sanguinary cruelty During his reign eighteen thousand persons were victims of his ferocity Yet such is the god observes M de Sacy whom the Druses have worshipped for eight hundred years See p ccccxxix All his wildest and most extravagant actions were interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric meaning alluding to the destruction of other religions and the propagation of his own It does not seem to have been the vanity of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion The curious point in the new faith is that Hamza the son of Ali the real founder of the Unitarian religion such is its boastful title was content to take a secondary part While Hakem was God the one Supreme the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence It was not in his divine character that Hakem hated the Jews and Christians but in that of a Mahometan bigot which he displayed in the earlier years of his reign His barbarous persecution and the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem belong entirely to that period and his assumption of divinity was followed by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians The Mahometans whose religion he then treated with hostility and contempt being far the most numerous were his most dangerous enemies and therefore the objects of his most inveterate hatred It is another singular fact that the religion of Hakem was by no means confined to Egypt and Syria M de Sacy quotes a letter addressed to the chief of the sect in India and there is likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine son of Armanous Romanus and the clergy of the empire Constantine VIII M de Sacy supposes but this is irreconcilable with chronology it must mean Constantine XI Monomachus The assassination of Hakem is of course disbelieved by his sectaries M de Sacy seems to consider the fact obscure and doubtful According to his followers he disappeared but is hereafter to return At his return the resurrection is to take place the triumph of Unitarianism and the final discomfiture of all other religions The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to destruction It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final consummation and of the reappearance of Hakem is that Christianity shall be gaining a manifest predominance over Mahometanism As for the religion of the Druses I cannot agree with Gibbon that it does not deserve to be better known and am grateful to M de Sacy notwithstanding the prolixity and occasional repetition in his two large volumes for the full examination of the most extraordinary religious aberration which ever extensively affected the mind of man The worship of a mad tyrant is the basis of a subtle metaphysical creed and of a severe and even ascetic morality M Footnote sixty nine See Glaber l iii c seven and the Annals of Baronius and Pagi A D ten oh nine Footnote seventy Per idem

marched into Syria at the head of a powerful army and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword Hems and the other cities of the province acknowledged the caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of Persia and the victorious emir advanced without resistance to the banks of the Nile the Fatimite was preparing to fly into the heart of Africa but the negroes of his guard and the inhabitants of Cairo made a desperate sally and repulsed the Turk from the confines of Egypt In his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and rapine the judge and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his camp and their execution was followed by the massacre of three thousand citizens The cruelty or the defeat of Atsiz was soon punished by the sultan Toucush the brother of Malek Shah who with a higher title and more formidable powers asserted the dominion of Syria and Palestine The house of Seljuk reigned about twenty years in Jerusalem seventy four but the hereditary command of the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the emir Ortok the chief of a tribe of Turkmans whose children after their expulsion from Palestine formed two dynasties on the borders of Armenia and Assyria seventy five The Oriental Christians and the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution which instead of the regular government and old alliance of the caliphs imposed on their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North seventy six In his court and camp the great sultan had adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia but the body of the Turkish nation and more especially the pastoral tribes still breathed the fierceness of the desert From Nice to Jerusalem the western countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic hostility and the shepherds of Palestine who held a precarious sway on a doubtful frontier had neither leisure nor capacity to await the slow profits of commercial and religious freedom The pilgrims who through innumerable perils had reached the gates of Jerusalem were the victims of private rapine or public oppression and often sunk under the pressure of famine and disease before they were permitted to salute the holy sepulchre A spirit of native barbarism or recent zeal prompted the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect the patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement and cast into a dungeon to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock and the divine worship in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by the savage rudeness of its masters The pathetic tale excited the millions of the West to march under the standard of the cross to the relief of the Holy Land and yet how trifling is the sum of these accumulated evils if compared with the single act of the sacrilege of Hakem which had been so patiently endured by the Latin Christians A slighter provocation inflamed the more irascible temper of their descendants a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and papal dominion a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling and

resentment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the oppression of the Christian name he mingled his tears with those of the patriarch and earnestly inquired if no hopes of relief could be entertained from the Greek emperors of the East The patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the successors of Constantine I will rouse exclaimed the hermit the martial nations of Europe in your cause and Europe was obedient to the call of the hermit The astonished patriarch dismissed him with epistles of credit and complaint and no sooner did he land at Bari than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff His stature was small his appearance contemptible but his eye was keen and lively and he possessed that vehemence of speech which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul two He was born of a gentleman s family for we must now adopt a modern idiom and his military service was under the neighboring counts of Boulogne the heroes of the first crusade But he soon relinquished the sword and the world and if it be true that his wife however noble was aged and ugly he might withdraw with the less reluctance from her bed to a convent and at length to a hermitage two hundred eleven In this austere solitude his body was emaciated his fancy was inflamed whatever he wished he believed whatever he believed he saw in dreams and revelations From Jerusalem the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic but as he excelled in the popular madness of the times Pope Urban the Second received him as a prophet applauded his glorious design promised to support it in a general council and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff his zealous missionary traversed with speed and success the provinces of Italy and France His diet was abstemious his prayers long and fervent and the alms which he received with one hand he distributed with the other his head was bare his feet naked his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment he bore and displayed a weighty crucifix and the ass on which he rode was sanctified in the public eye by the service of the man of God He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches the streets and the highways the hermit entered with equal confidence the palace and the cottage and the people for all was people was impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms When he painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine every heart was melted to compassion every breast glowed with indignation when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend their brethren and rescue their Savior his ignorance of art and language was compensated by sighs and tears and ejaculations and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud and frequent appeals to

glory or reproach of executing though not in person this holy enterprise was reserved for Urban the Second four the most faithful of his disciples He undertook the conquest of the East whilst the larger portion of Rome was possessed and fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna who contended with Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate He attempted to unite the powers of the West at a time when the princes were separated from the church and the people from their princes by the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had thundered against the emperor and the king of France Philip the First of France supported with patience the censures which he had provoked by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage Henry the Fourth of Germany asserted the right of investitures the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the delivery of the ring and crosier But the emperor s party was crushed in Italy by the arms of the Normans and the Countess Mathilda and the long quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of his son Conrad and the shame of his wife five who in the synods of Constance and Placentia confessed the manifold prostitutions to which she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor and his own six So popular was the cause of Urban so weighty was his influence that the council which he summoned at Placentia seven was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy France Burgandy Swabia and Bavaria Four thousand of the clergy and thirty thousand of the laity attended this important meeting and as the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the multitude the session of seven days was held in a plain adjacent to the city The ambassadors of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus were introduced to plead the distress of their sovereign and the danger of Constantinople which was divided only by a narrow sea from the victorious Turks the common enemies of the Christian name In their suppliant address they flattered the pride of the Latin princes and appealing at once to their policy and religion exhorted them to repel the Barbarians on the confines of Asia rather than to expect them in the heart of Europe At the sad tale of the misery and perils of their Eastern brethren the assembly burst into tears the most eager champions declared their readiness to march and the Greek ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and powerful succor The relief of Constantinople was included in the larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem but the prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second synod which he proposed to celebrate in some city of France in the autumn of the same year The short delay would propagate the flame of enthusiasm and his firmest hope was in a nation of soldiers eight still proud of the preeminence of their name and ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne nine who in the popular romance of Turpin ten had achieved the conquest of the Holy Land A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence the choice of Urban he was himself a native of France a monk of Clugny and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne of saint Peter The pope had illustrated his family and province nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to revisit in a conspicuous dignity the humble and laborious scenes of our youth

erect in the heart of France the tribunal from whence he hurled his anathemas against the king but our surprise will vanish so soon as we form a just estimate of a king of France of the eleventh century eleven Philip the First was the great grandson of Hugh Capet the founder of the present race who in the decline of Charlemagne s posterity added the regal title to his patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans In this narrow compass he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction but in the rest of France Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the feudal lords of about sixty dukes and counts of independent and hereditary power twelve who disdained the control of laws and legal assemblies and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged by the disobedience of their inferior vassals At Clermont in the territories of the count of Auvergne thirteen the pope might brave with impunity the resentment of Philip and the council which he convened in that city was not less numerous or respectable than the synod of Placentia fourteen Besides his court and council of Roman cardinals he was supported by thirteen archbishops and two hundred and twenty five bishops the number of mitred prelates was computed at four hundred and the fathers of the church were blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the age From the adjacent kingdoms a martial train of lords and knights of power and renown attended the council fifteen in high expectation of its resolves and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity that the city was filled and many thousands in the month of November erected their tents or huts in the open field A session of eight days produced some useful or edifying canons for the reformation of manners a severe censure was pronounced against the license of private war the Truce of God sixteen was confirmed a suspension of hostilities during four days of the week women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the church and a protection of three years was extended to husbandmen and merchants the defenceless victims of military rapine But a law however venerable be the sanction cannot suddenly transform the temper of the times and the benevolent efforts of Urban deserve the less praise since he labored to appease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates From the synod of Placentia the rumor of his great design had gone forth among the nations the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land and when the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market place of Clermont his eloquence was addressed to a well prepared and impatient audience His topics were obvious his exhortation was vehement his success inevitable The orator was interrupted by the shout of thousands who with one voice and in their rustic idiom exclaimed aloud God wills it God wills it seventeen It is indeed the will of God replied the pope and let this memorable word the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit be forever adopted as your cry of battle to animate the devotion and courage of the champions of Christ His cross is the symbol of your salvation wear it a red a bloody cross as an external mark on your breasts or shoulders as a pledge of your sacred and irrevocable engagement The proposal was joyfully accepted great numbers both of the clergy and laity impressed on their garments the sign of the cross eighteen and solicited the pope to march at their head This dangerous honor was declined by the more prudent successor of Gregory who alleged the schism of the church and the duties of his pastoral office recommending to the faithful who were disqualified by sex or profession by age or infirmity to aid with their prayers and alms the personal service of their robust brethren The name and powers of his legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop of Puy the first who had received the cross at his hands The foremost of the temporal chiefs was Raymond count of Thoulouse whose ambassadors in the council excused the absence and pledged the honor of their master After the confession and absolution of

seem to insist on the right of natural and religious defence their peculiar title to the Holy Land and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes twenty I The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and spiritual allies it depends on the existence of danger and that danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the malice and the power of our enemies A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the Mahometans the duty of extirpating all other religions by the sword This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran by the history of the Mussulman conquerors and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian worship But it cannot be denied that the Oriental churches are depressed under their iron yoke that in peace and war they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire and that in their orthodox creed the unbelieving nations are continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty In the eleventh century the victorious arms of the Turks presented a real and urgent apprehension of these losses They had subdued in less than thirty years the kingdoms of Asia as far as Jerusalem and the Hellespont and the Greek empire tottered on the verge of destruction Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren the Latins had a right and interest in the support of Constantinople the most important barrier of the West and the privilege of defence must reach to prevent as well as to repel an impending assault But this salutary purpose might have been accomplished by a moderate succor and our calmer reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts and remote operations which overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe twenty eleven Footnote twenty If the reader will turn to the first scene of the First Part of Henry the Fourth he will see in the text of Shakespeare the natural feelings of enthusiasm and in the notes of doctor Johnson the workings of a bigoted though vigorous mind greedy of every pretence to hate and persecute those who dissent from his creed Footnote twenty eleven The manner in which the war was conducted surely has little relation to the abstract question of the justice or injustice of the war The most just and necessary war may be conducted with the most prodigal waste of human life and the wildest fanaticism the most unjust with the coolest moderation and consummate generalship The question is whether the liberties and religion of Europe were in danger from the aggressions of Mahometanism If so it is difficult to limit the right though it may be proper to question the wisdom of overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole continent and repelling if possible the invading conqueror into his native deserts The crusades are monuments of human folly but to which of the more regular wars civilized Europe waged for personal ambition or national jealousy will our calmer reason appeal as monuments either of human justice or human wisdom M II Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of that distant and narrow province The Christians affirmed that their inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood of their divine Savior it was their right and duty to rescue their inheritance from the unjust possessors who profaned his sepulchre and oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples Vainly would it be alleged that the preeminence of Jerusalem and the sanctity of Palestine have been abolished with the Mosaic law that the God of the Christians is not a local deity and that the recovery of Bethlem or Calvary his cradle or his tomb will not atone for the violation of the moral precepts of the gospel Such arguments glance aside from the leaden shield of superstition and the religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle III But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of the globe from Egypt to Livonia and from Peru to Hindostan require the support of some more general and flexible tenet It has been often supposed and sometimes affirmed that a difference of religion is a worthy cause of hostility that obstinate unbelievers may be slain or subdued by the champions of the cross and that grace is the sole fountain of dominion as well as of mercy twenty twelve Above four hundred years before the first crusade the eastern and western provinces of the Roman empire had been acquired about the same time and in the same manner by the Barbarians of Germany and Arabia Time and treaties had legitimated the conquest of the Christian Franks but in the eyes of their subjects and neighbors the Mahometan princes were still tyrants and usurpers who by the arms of war or rebellion might be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession twenty one Footnote twenty twelve God says the abbot Guibert invented the crusades as a new way for the laity to atone for their sins and to merit salvation This extraordinary and characteristic passage must be given entire Deus nostro tempore praelia sancta instituit ut ordo equestris et vulgus oberrans qui vetustae Paganitatis exemplo in mutuas versabatur caedes novum reperirent salutis promerendae genus ut nec funditus electa ut fieri assolet monastica conversatione seu religiosa qualibet professione saeculum relinquere congerentur

Discourse of Fleury on Ecclesiastical History p two hundred twenty three two hundred sixty one contains an accurate and rational view of the causes and effects of the crusades As the manners of the Christians were relaxed their discipline of penance twenty two was enforced and with the multiplication of sins the remedies were multiplied In the primitive church a voluntary and open confession prepared the work of atonement In the middle ages the bishops and priests interrogated the criminal compelled him to account for his thoughts words and actions and prescribed the terms of his reconciliation with God But as this discretionary power might alternately be abused by indulgence and tyranny a rule of discipline was framed to inform and regulate the spiritual judges This mode of legislation was invented by the Greeks their penitentials twenty three were translated or imitated in the Latin church and in the time of Charlemagne the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar In this dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments each case was supposed each difference was remarked by the experience or penetration of the monks some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have suspected and others which reason cannot believe and the more ordinary offences of fornication and adultery of perjury and sacrilege of rapine and murder were expiated by a penance which according to the various circumstances was prolonged from forty days to seven years During this term of mortification the patient was healed the criminal was absolved by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse and he humbly abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life But the rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the palace the camp and the city the Barbarians of the West believed and trembled but nature often rebelled against principle and the magistrate labored without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest A literal accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable the guilt of adultery was multiplied by daily repetition that of homicide might involve the massacre of a whole people each act was separately numbered and in those times of anarchy and vice a modest sinner might easily incur a debt of three hundred years His insolvency was relieved by a commutation or indulgence a year of penance was appreciated at twenty six solidi twenty four of silver about four pounds sterling for the rich at three solidi or nine shillings for the indigent and these alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church which derived from the redemption of sins an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion A debt of three hundred years or twelve hundred pounds was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune the scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of land and the princely donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are expressly given for the remedy of their soul It is a maxim of the civil law that whosoever cannot pay with his purse must pay with his body and the practice of flagellation was adopted by the monks a cheap though painful equivalent By a fantastic arithmetic a year of penance was taxed at three thousand lashes twenty five and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit saint Dominic of the iron Cuirass twenty six that in six days he could discharge an entire century by a whipping of three hundred thousand stripes His example was followed by many penitents of both sexes and as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his benefactors twenty seven These compensations of the purse and the person introduced in the eleventh century a more honorable mode of satisfaction The merit of military service against the Saracens of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors of Urban the Second In the council of Clermont that pope proclaimed a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of the cross the absolution of all their sins and a full receipt for all that might be due of canonical penance twenty eight The cold philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful and fanatic world At the voice of their pastor the robber the incendiary the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination None were pure none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin and those who were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their pious courage If they fell the spirit of the Latin clergy did not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom twenty nine and should they survive they could expect without impatience the delay and increase of their heavenly reward They offered their blood to the Son of God who had laid down his life for their salvation they took up the cross and entered with confidence into the way of the Lord His providence would watch over their safety perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise The cloud and pillar of Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the rivers would open for their passage that the walls of their strongest cities would fall at the sound of their trumpets and that the sun would be arrested in his mid career to allow them time for the destruction of the infidels Footnote twenty two The penance indulgences c of the middle ages are amply discussed by Muratori Antiquitat Italiae Medii Aevi tom v dissert lxviii p seven hundred nine seven hundred sixty

merit the hope of reward and the assurance of divine aid But I am equally persuaded that in many it was not the sole that in some it was not the leading principle of action The use and abuse of religion are feeble to stem they are strong and irresistible to impel the stream of national manners Against the private wars of the Barbarians their bloody tournaments licentious love and judicial duels the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder It is a more easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks to drive into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism to sanctify the patience of slaves and cowards or to assume the merit of the humanity and benevolence of modern Christians War and exercise were the reigning passions of the Franks or Latins they were enjoined as a penance to gratify those passions to visit distant lands and to draw their swords against the nation of the East Their victory or even their attempt would immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross and the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid prospect of military glory In the petty quarrels of Europe they shed the blood of their friends and countrymen for the acquisition perhaps of a castle or a village They could march with alacrity against the distant and hostile nations who were devoted to their arms their fancy already grasped the golden sceptres of Asia and the conquest of Apulia and Sicily by the Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most private adventurer Christendom in her rudest state must have yielded to the climate and cultivation of the Mahometan countries and their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the tales of pilgrims and the gifts of an imperfect commerce The vulgar both the great and small were taught to believe every wonder of lands flowing with milk and honey of mines and treasures of gold and diamonds of palaces of marble and jasper and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and frankincense In this earthly paradise each warrior depended on his sword to carve a plenteous and honorable establishment which he measured only by the extent of his wishes thirty Their vassals and soldiers trusted their fortunes to God and their master the spoils of a Turkish emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp and the flavor of the wines the beauty of the Grecian women thirty one were temptations more adapted to the nature than to the profession of the champions of the cross The love of freedom was a powerful incitement to the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or ecclesiastical tyranny Under this holy sign the peasants and burghers who were attached to the servitude of the glebe might escape from a haughty lord and transplant themselves and their families to a land of liberty The monk might release himself from the discipline of his convent the debtor might suspend the accumulation of usury and the pursuit of his creditors and outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to brave the laws and elude the punishment of their crimes thirty two Footnote thirty The same hopes were displayed in the letters of the adventurers ad animandos qui in

hundred fifty two These motives were potent and numerous when we have singly computed their weight on the mind of each individual we must add the infinite series the multiplying powers of example and fashion The first proselytes became the warmest and most effectual missionaries of the cross among their friends and countrymen they preached the duty the merit and the recompense of their holy vow and the most reluctant hearers were insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and authority The martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion of cowardice the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre of Christ was embraced by the old and infirm by women and children who consulted rather their zeal than their strength and those who in the evening had derided the folly of their companions were the most eager the ensuing day to tread in their footsteps The ignorance which magnified the hopes diminished the perils of the enterprise Since the Turkish conquest the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated the chiefs themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and the state of their enemies and such was the stupidity of the people that at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the limits of their knowledge they were ready to ask whether that was not the Jerusalem the term and object of their labors Yet the more prudent of the crusaders who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with a shower of quails or manna provided themselves with those precious metals which in every country are the representatives of every commodity To defray according to their rank the expenses of the road princes alienated their provinces nobles their lands and castles peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry The value of property was depreciated by the eager competition of multitudes while the price of arms and horses was raised to an exorbitant height by the wants and impatience of the buyers thirty three Those who remained at home with sense and money were enriched by the epidemical disease the sovereigns acquired at a cheap rate the domains of their vassals and the ecclesiastical purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of their prayers The cross which was commonly sewed on the garment in cloth or silk was inscribed by some zealots on their skin a hot iron or indelible liquor was applied to perpetuate the mark and a crafty monk who showed the miraculous impression on his breast was repaid with the popular veneration and the richest benefices of Palestine thirty four Footnote thirty three Guibert p four hundred eighty one paints in lively colors this general emotion He was one of the few contemporaries who had genius enough to feel the astonishing scenes that were passing before their eyes Erat itaque videre miraculum caro omnes emere atque vili vendere c Footnote thirty four Some instances of these stigmata are given in the Esprit des Croisades tom iii p one hundred sixty nine c from authors whom I have not seen The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of Clermont for the departure of the pilgrims but the day was anticipated by the thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians and I shall briefly despatch the calamities which they inflicted and suffered before I enter on the more serious and successful enterprise of the chiefs Early in the spring from the confines of France and Lorraine above sixty thousand of the populace of both sexes flocked round the first missionary of the crusade and pressed him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the holy sepulchre The hermit assuming the character without the talents or authority of a general impelled or obeyed the forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and Danube Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate and his lieutenant Walter the Penniless a valiant though needy soldier conducted a van guard of pilgrims whose condition may be determined from the proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen thousand foot The example and footsteps of Peter were closely pursued by another fanatic the monk Godescal whose sermons had swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the villages of Germany Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two hundred thousand the most stupid and savage refuse of the people who mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine prostitution and drunkenness Some counts and gentlemen at the head of three thousand horse attended the motions of the multitude to partake in the spoil but their genuine leaders may we credit such folly were a goose and a goat who were carried in the front and to whom these worthy Christians ascribed an infusion of the divine spirit thirty five Of these and of other bands of enthusiasts the first and most easy warfare was against the Jews the murderers of the Son of God In the trading cities of the Moselle and the Rhine their colonies were numerous and rich and they enjoyed under the protection of the emperor and the bishops the free exercise of their religion thirty six At Verdun Treves Mentz Spires Worms many thousands of that unhappy people were pillaged and massacred thirty seven nor had they felt a more bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian A remnant was saved by the firmness of their bishops who accepted a feigned and transient conversion but the more obstinate Jews opposed their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians barricadoed their houses and precipitating themselves their families and their wealth into the rivers or the flames disappointed the malice or at least the avarice of their implacable foes Footnote thirty five Fuit et aliud scelus detestabile in hac congregatione pedestris populi stulti et vesanae levitatis anserem

founded an empire they might have introduced as in Egypt the worship of animals which their philosophic descend ants would have glossed over with some specious and subtile allegory Note A singular allegoric explanation of this strange fact has recently been broached it is connected with the charge of idolatry and Eastern heretical opinions subsequently made against the Templars We have no doubt that they were Manichee or Gnostic standards The author says the animals themselves were carried before the army M The goose in Egyptian symbols as every Egyptian scholar knows meant divine Son or Son of God The goat meant Typhon or Devil Thus we have the Manichee opposing principles of good and evil as standards at the head of the ignorant mob of crusading invaders Can any one doubt that a large portion of this host must have been infected with the Manichee or Gnostic idolatry Account of the Temple Church by R W Billings p five London eighteen thirty eight This is at all events a curious

sarcasm against saint Bernard He stood above all rivalry of this kind See note thirty one c l x M Between the frontiers of Austria and the seat of the Byzan tine monarchy the crusaders were compelled to traverse as interval of six hundred miles the wild and desolate countries of Hungary thirty eight and Bulgaria The soil is fruitful and intersected with rivers but it was then covered with morasses and forests which spread to a boundless extent whenever man has ceased to exercise his dominion over the earth Both nations had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity the Hungarians were ruled by their native princes the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of the Greek emperor but on the slightest provocation their ferocious nature was rekindled and ample provocation was afforded by the disorders of the first pilgrims Agriculture must have been unskilful and languid among a people whose cities were built of reeds and timber which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of hunters and shepherds A scanty supply of provisions was rudely demanded forcibly seized and greedily consumed and on the first quarrel the crusaders gave a loose to indignation and revenge But their ignorance of the country of war and of discipline exposed them to every snare The Greek praefect of Bulgaria commanded a regular force three hundred eighty one at the trumpet of the Hungarian king the eighth or the tenth of his martial subjects bent their bows and mounted on horseback their policy was insidious and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting and bloody thirty nine About a third of the naked fugitives and the hermit Peter was of the number escaped to the Thracian mountains and the emperor who respected the pilgrimage and succor of the Latins conducted them by secure and easy journeys to Constantinople and advised them to await the arrival of their brethren For a while they remembered their faults and losses but no sooner were they revived by the hospitable entertainment than their venom was again inflamed they stung their benefactor and neither gardens nor palaces nor churches were safe from their depredations For his own safety Alexius allured them to pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus but their blind impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had assigned and to rush headlong against the Turks who occupied the road to Jerusalem The hermit conscious of his shame had withdrawn from the camp to Constantinople and his lieutenant Walter the Penniless who was worthy of a better command attempted without success to introduce some order and prudence among the herd of savages They separated in quest of prey and themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the sultan By a rumor that their foremost companions were rioting in the spoils

Events Of The First Crusade None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in the first crusade The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed to obey the summons of the pope Philip the First of France was occupied by his pleasures William Rufus of England by a recent conquest the kin gs of Spain were engaged in a domestic war against the Moors and the northern monarchs of Scotland Denmark forty two Sweden and Poland were yet strangers to the passions and interests of the South The religious ardor was more strongly felt by the princes of the second order who held an important place in the feudal system Their situation will naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their names and characters but I may escape some needless repetition by observing at once that courage and the exercise of arms are the common attribute of these Christian adventurers I The first rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon and happy would it have been for the crusaders if they had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished hero a worthy representative of Charlemagne from whom he was descended in the female line His father was of the noble race of the counts of Boulogne Brabant the lower province of Lorraine forty three was the inheritance of his mother and by the emperor s bounty he was himself invested with that ducal title which has been improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the Ardennes forty four In the service of Henry the Fourth he bore the great standard of the empire and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph the rebel king Godfrey was the first who ascended the walls of Rome and his sickness his vow perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the pope confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre not as a pilgrim but a deliverer His valor was matured by prudence and moderation his piety though blind was sincere and in the tumult of a camp he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent Superior to the private factions of the chiefs he reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ and though he gained a kingdom by the attempt his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by his rivals Godfrey of Bouillon forty five was accompanied by his two brothers by Eustace the elder who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne and by the younger Baldwin a character of more ambiguous virtue The duke of Lorraine was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine from his birth and education he was equally conversant with the French and Teutonic languages the barons of France Germany and Lorraine assembled their vassals and the confederate force that marched under his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse II In the parliament that was held at Paris in the king s presence about two months after the council of Clermont Hugh count of Vermandois was the most conspicuous of the princes who assumed the cross But the appellation of the Great was applied not so much to his merit or possessions though neither were contemptible as to the royal birth of the brother of the king of France forty six Robert duke of Normandy was the eldest son of William the Conqueror but on his father s death he was deprived of the kingdom of England by his own indolence and the activity of his brother Rufus The worth of Robert was degraded by an excessive levity and easiness of temper his cheerfulness seduced him to the indulgence of pleasure his profuse liberality impoverished the prince and people his indiscriminate clemency multiplied the number of offenders and the amiable qualities of a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign For the trifling sum of ten thousand marks he mortgaged Normandy during his absence to the English usurper forty seven but his engagement and behavior in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of manners and restored him in some degree to the public esteem Another Robert was count of Flanders a royal province which in this century gave three queens to the thrones of France England and Denmark he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the Christians but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot the duties of a general Stephen count of Chartres of Blois and of Troyes was one of the richest princes of the age and the number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and sixty five days of the year His mind was improved by literature and in the council of the chiefs the eloquent Stephen forty eight was chosen to discharge the office of their president These four were the principal leaders of the French the Normans and the pilgrims of the British isles but the list of the barons who were possessed of three or four towns would exceed says a contemporary the catalogue of the Trojan war forty nine III In the south of France the command was assumed by Adhemar bishop of Puy the pope egate and by Raymond count of saint Giles and Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and marquis of Provence The former was a respectable prelate alike qualified for this world and the next The latter was a veteran warrior who had fought against the Saracens of Spain and who consecrated his declining age not only to the deliverance but to the perpetual service of the holy sepulchre His experience and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the Christian camp whose distress he was often able and sometimes willing to relieve But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the Infidels than to preserve the love of his subjects and associates His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper haughty envious and obstinate and though he resigned an ample patrimony for the cause of God his piety in the public opinion was not exempt from avarice and ambition fifty A mercantile rather than a martial spirit prevailed among his provincials fifty one a common name which included the natives of Auvergne and Languedoc fifty two the vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles From the adjacent frontier of Spain he drew a band of hardy adventurers as he marched through Lombardy a crowd of Italians flocked to his standard and his united force consisted of one hundred thousand horse and foot If Raymond was the first to enlist and the last to depart the delay may be excused by the greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting farewell IV The name of Bohemond the son of Robert Guiscard was already famous by his double victory over the Greek emperor but his father s will had reduced him to the principality of Tarentum and the remembrance of his Eastern trophies till he was awakened by the rumor and passage of the French pilgrims It is in the person of this Norman chief that we may seek for the coolest policy and ambition with a small allay of religious fanaticism His conduct may justify a belief that he had secretly directed the design of the pope which he affected to second with astonishment and zeal at the siege of Amalphi his example and discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army he instantly tore his garment to supply crosses for the numerous candidates and prepared to visit Constantinople and Asia at the head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot Several princes of the Norman race accompanied this veteran general and his cousin Tancred fifty

Crusade Part III Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades a revolution had taken place among the Spaniards the Normans and the French which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe The service of the infantry was degraded to the plebeians the cavalry formed the strength of the armies and the honorable name of miles or soldier was confined to the gentlemen fifty five who served on horseback and were invested with the character of knighthood The dukes and counts who had usurped the rights of sovereignty divided the provinces among their faithful barons the barons distributed among their vassals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiction and these military tenants the peers of each other and of their lord composed the noble or equestrian order which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same species with themselves The dignity of their birth was preserved by pure and equal alliances their sons alone who could produce four quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach might legally pretend to the honor of knighthood but a valiant plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword and became the father of a new race A single knight could impart according to his judgment the character which he received and the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this personal distinction than from the lustre of their diadem This ceremony of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and the woods of Germany fifty six was in its origin simple and profane the candidate after some previous trial was invested with the sword and spurs and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight blow as an emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for him to endure But superstition mingled in every public and private action of life in the holy wars it sanctified the profession of arms and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood The bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism his sword which he offered on the altar was blessed by the ministers of religion his solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils and he was created a knight in the name of God of saint George and of saint Michael the archangel He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession and education example and the public opinion were the inviolable guardians of his oath As the champion of God and the ladies I blush to unite such discordant names he devoted himself to speak the truth to maintain the right to protect the distressed to practise courtesy a virtue less familiar to the ancients to pursue the infidels to despise the allurements of ease and safety and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honor of his character The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military discipline Yet the benefits of this institution to refine the temper of Barbarians and to infuse some principles of faith justice and humanity were strongly felt and have been often observed The asperity of national prejudice was softened and the community of religion and arms spread a similar color and generous emulation over the face of Christendom Abroad in enterprise and pilgrimage at home in martial exercise the warriors of every country were perpetually associated and impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic games of classic antiquity fifty seven Instead of the naked spectacles which corrupted the manners of the Greeks and banished from the stadium the virgins and matrons the pompous decoration of the lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high born beauty from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his dexterity and courage The skill and strength that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to the merit of a soldier but the tournaments as they were invented in France and eagerly adopted both in the East and West presented a lively image of the business of the field The single combats the general skirmish the defence of a pass or castle were rehearsed as in actual service and the contest both in real and mimic war was decided by the superior management of the horse and lance The lance was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight his horse was of a large and heavy breed but this charger till he was roused by the approaching danger was usually led by an attendant and he quietly rode a pad or palfrey of a more easy pace His helmet and sword his greaves and buckler it would be superfluous to describe but I may remark that at the period of the crusades the armor was less ponderous than in later times and that instead of a massy cuirass his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail When their long lances were fixed in the rest the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the foe and the light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge Each knight was attended to the field by his faithful squire a youth of equal birth and similar hopes he was followed by his archers and men at arms and four or five or six soldiers were computed as the furniture of a complete lance In the expeditions to the neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted the voluntary service of the knights and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment or purchased with rewards and promises and the numbers of each squadron were measured by the power the wealth and the fame of each independent chieftain They were distinguished by his banner his armorial coat and his cry of war and the most ancient families of Europe must seek in these achievements the origin and proof of their nobility In this rapid portrait of chivalry I have been urged to anticipate on the story of the crusades at once an effect and a cause of this memorable institution fifty eight Footnote fifty five Of the words gentilis gentilhomme gentleman two etymologies are produced one From the Barbarians of the fifth century the soldiers and at length the conquerors of the Roman empire who were vain of their foreign nobility and two From

assumed the cross for the deliverance of the holy sepulchre As soon as they were relieved by the absence of the plebeian multitude they encouraged each other by interviews and messages to accomplish their vow and hasten their departure Their wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the danger and merit of the pilgrimage their portable treasures were conveyed in bars of silver and gold and the princes and barons were attended by their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to supply their table The difficulty of procuring subsistence for so many myriads of men and horses engaged them to separate their forces their choice or situation determined the road and it was agreed to meet in the neighborhood of Constantinople and from thence to begin their operations against the Turks From the banks of the Meuse and the Moselle Godfrey of Bouillon followed the direct way of Germany Hungary and Bulgaria and as long as he exercised the sole command every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virtue On the confines of Hungary he was stopped three weeks by a Christian people to whom the name or at least the abuse of the cross was justly odious The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received from the first pilgrims in their turn they had abused the right of defence and retaliation and they had reason to apprehend a severe revenge from a hero of the same nation and who was engaged in the same cause But after weighing the motives and the events the virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and misfortunes of his worthless brethren and his twelve deputies the messengers of peace requested in his name a free passage and an equal market To remove their suspicions Godfrey trusted himself and afterwards his brother to the faith of Carloman five hundred eighty one king of Hungary who treated them with a simple but hospitable entertainment the treaty was sanctified by their common gospel and a proclamation under pain of death restrained the animosity and license of the Latin soldiers From Austria to Belgrade they traversed the plains of Hungary without enduring or offering an injury and the proximity of Carloman who hovered on their flanks with his numerous cavalry was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his own They reached the banks of the Save and no sooner had they passed the river than the king of Hungary restored the hostages and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the success of their enterprise With the same conduct and discipline Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers of Thrace and might congratulate himself that he had almost reached the first term of his pilgrimage without drawing his sword against a Christian adversary After an easy and pleasant journey through Lombardy from Turin to Aquileia Raymond and his provincials marched forty days through the savage country of Dalmatia fifty nine and Sclavonia The weather was a perpetual fog the land was mountainous and desolate the natives were either fugitive or hostile loose in their religion and government they refused to furnish provisions or guides murdered the stragglers and exercised by night and day the vigilance of the count who derived more security from the punishment of some captive robbers than from his interview and treaty with the prince of Scodra sixty His march between Durazzo and Constantinople was harassed without being stopped by the peasants and soldiers of the Greek emperor and the same faint and ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs who passed the Adriatic from the coast of Italy Bohemond had arms and vessels and foresight and discipline and his name was not forgotten in the provinces of Epirus and Thessaly Whatever obstacles he encountered were surmounted by his military conduct and the valor of Tancred and if the Norman prince affected to spare the Greeks he gorged his soldiers with the full plunder of an heretical castle sixty one The nobles of France pressed forwards with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their nation has been sometimes accused From the Alps to Apulia the march of Hugh the Great of the two Roberts and of Stephen of Chartres through a wealthy country and amidst the applauding Catholics was a devout or triumphant progress they kissed the feet of the Roman pontiff and the golden standard of saint Peter was delivered to the brother of the French monarch sixty two But in this visit of piety and pleasure they neglected to secure the season and the means of their embarkation the winter was insensibly lost their troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns of Italy They separately accomplished their passage regardless of safety or dignity and within nine months from the feast of the Assumption the day appointed by Urban all the Latin princes had reached Constantinople But the count of Vermandois was produced as a captive his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest and his person against the law of nations was detained by the lieutenants of Alexius Yet the arrival of Hugh had been announced by four and twenty knights in golden armor who commanded the emperor to revere the general of the Latin Christians the brother of the king of kings sixty three six hundred thirty one Footnote five hundred eighty one Carloman or Calmany demanded the brother of Godfrey as

have read the fable of a shepherd who was ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes he had prayed for water the Ganges was turned into his grounds and his flock and cottage were swept away by the inundation Such was the fortune or at least the apprehension of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus whose name has already appeared in this history and whose conduct is so differently represented by his daughter Anne sixty four and by the Latin writers sixty five In the council of Placentia his ambassadors had solicited a moderate succor perhaps of ten thousand soldiers but he was astonished by the approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations The emperor fluctuated between hope and fear between timidity and courage but in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom I cannot believe I cannot discern that he maliciously conspired against the life or honor of the French heroes The promiscuous multitudes of Peter the Hermit were savage beasts alike destitute of humanity and reason nor was it possible for Alexius to prevent or deplore their destruction The troops of Godfrey and his peers were less contemptible but not less suspicious to the Greek emperor Their motives might be pure and pious but he was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond six hundred fifty one and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs the courage of the French was blind and headstrong they might be tempted by the luxury and wealth of Greece and elated by the view and opinion of their invincible strength and Jerusalem might be forgotten in the prospect of Constantinople After a long march and painful abstinence the troops of Godfrey encamped in the plains of Thrace they heard with indignation that their brother the count of Vermandois was imprisoned by the Greeks and their reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of retaliation and rapine They were appeased by the submission of Alexius he promised to supply their camp and as they refused in the midst of winter to pass the Bosphorus their quarters were assigned among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea But an incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations who despised each other as slaves and Barbarians Ignorance is the ground of suspicion and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations prejudice is blind hunger is deaf and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault the Latins in a dangerous post on all sides encompassed with the waters sixty six Godfrey sounded his trumpets burst the net overspread the plain and insulted the suburbs but the gates of Constantinople were strongly fortified the ramparts were lined with archers and after a doubtful conflict both parties listened to the voice of peace and religion The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of the western strangers as a Christian warrior he rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise which he engaged to second with his troops and treasures On the return of spring Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in Asia and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus than the Greek vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore The same policy was repeated with the succeeding chiefs who were swayed by the example and weakened by the departure of their foremost companions By his skill and diligence Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople and before the feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast of Europe Footnote sixty four Anna Comnena was born the first of December A D ten eighty three indiction vii Alexiad l vi p one hundred sixty six one hundred sixty seven

the Bosphorus and Hellespont The fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the recent patrimony of the Roman emperor and his ancient and perpetual claim still embraced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt In his enthusiasm Alexius indulged or affected the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones of the East but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and lawless Barbarians His prudence or his pride was content with extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity and a solemn promise that they would either restore or hold their Asiatic conquests as the humble and loyal vassals of the Roman empire Their independent spirit was fired at the mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude they successively yielded to the dexterous application of gifts and flattery and the first proselytes became the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the companions of their shame The pride of Hugh of Vermandois was soothed by the honors of his captivity and in the brother of the French king the example of submission was prevalent and weighty In the mind of Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate to the glory of God and the success of the crusade He had firmly resisted the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond who urged the attack and conquest of Constantinople Alexius esteemed his virtues deservedly named him the champion of the empire and dignified his homage with the filial name and the rights of adoption sixty seven The hateful Bohemond was received as a true and ancient ally and if the emperor reminded him of former hostilities it was only to praise the valor that he had displayed and the glory that he had acquired in the fields of Durazzo and Larissa The son of Guiscard was lodged and entertained and served with Imperial pomp one day as he passed through the gallery of the palace a door was carelessly left open to expose a pile of gold and silver of silk and gems of curious and costly furniture that was heaped in seeming disorder from the floor to the roof of the chamber What conquests exclaimed the ambitious miser might not be achieved by the possession of such a treasure It is your own replied a Greek attendant who watched the motions of his soul and Bohemond after some hesitation condescended to accept this magnificent present The Norman was flattered by the assurance of an independent principality and Alexius eluded rather than denied his daring demand of the office of great domestic or general of the East The two Roberts the son of the conqueror of England and the kinsmen of three queens sixty eight bowed in their turn before the Byzantine throne A private letter of Stephen of Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor the most excellent and liberal of men who taught him to believe that he was a favorite and promised to educate and establish his youngest son In his southern province the count of saint Giles and Thoulouse faintly recognized the supremacy of the king of France a prince of a foreign nation and language At the head of a hundred thousand men he declared that he was the soldier and servant of Christ alone and that the Greek might be satisfied with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship His obstinate resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission and he shone says the princess Anne among the Barbarians as the sun amidst the stars of heaven His disgust of the noise and insolence of the French his suspicions of the designs of Bohemond the emperor imparted to his faithful Raymond and that aged statesman might clearly discern that however false in friendship he was sincere in his enmity sixty nine The spirit of chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred and none could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that gallant knight He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician escaped to Asia in the habit of a private soldier and yielded with a sigh to the authority of Bohemond and the interest of the Christian cause The best and most ostensible reason was the impossibility of passing the sea and accomplishing their vow without the license and the vessels of Alexius but they cherished a secret hope that as soon as they trod the continent of Asia their swords would obliterate their shame and dissolve the engagement which on his side might not be very faithfully performed The ceremony of their homage was grateful to a people who had long since considered pride as the substitute of power High on his throne the emperor sat mute and immovable his majesty was adored by the Latin princes and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his knees an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to confess and unable to deny seventy Footnote sixty seven There are two sorts of adoption the one by arms the other by introducing the son between the shirt and skin of

seventy The proud historians of the crusades slide and stumble over this humiliating step Yet since the heroes knelt to salute the emperor as he sat motionless on his throne it is clear that they must have kissed either his feet or knees It is only singular that Anna should not have amply supplied the silence or ambiguity of the Latins The abasement of their princes would have added a fine chapter to the Ceremoniale Aulae Byzantinae Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes and counts but a French baron he is supposed to be Robert of Paris seventy one presumed to ascend the throne and to place himself by the side of Alexius The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to exclaim in his barbarous idiom Who is this rustic that keeps his seat while so many valiant captains are standing round him The emperor maintained his silence dissembled his indignation and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of the words which he partly suspected from the universal language of gesture and countenance Before the departure of the pilgrims he endeavored to learn the name and condition of the audacious baron I am a Frenchman replied Robert of the purest and most ancient nobility of my country All that I know is that there is a church in my neighborhood seventy two the resort of those who are desirous of approving their valor in single combat Till an enemy appears they address their prayers to God and his saints That church I have frequently visited But never have I found an antagonist who dared to accept my defiance Alexius dismissed the challenger

in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry The principal force of the crusaders consisted in their cavalry and when that force was mustered in the plains of Bithynia the knights and their martial attendants on horseback amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men completely armed with the helmet and coat of mail The value of these soldiers deserved a strict and authentic account and the flower of European chivalry might furnish in a first effort this formidable body of heavy horse A part of the infantry might be enrolled for the service of scouts pioneers and archers but the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder and we depend not on the eyes and knowledge but on the belief and fancy of a chaplain of Count Baldwin seventy four in the estimate of six hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear arms besides the priests and monks the women and children of the Latin camp The reader starts and before he is recovered from his surprise I shall add on the same testimony that if all who took the cross had accomplished their vow above six millions would have migrated from Europe to Asia Under this oppression of faith I derive some relief from a more sagacious and thinking writer seventy five who after the same review of the cavalry accuses the credulity of the priest of Chartres and even doubts whether the Cisalpine regions in the geography of a Frenchman were sufficient to produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes The coolest scepticism will remember that of these religious volunteers great numbers never beheld Constantinople and Nice Of enthusiasm the influence is irregular and transient many were detained at home by reason or cowardice by poverty or weakness and many were repulsed by the obstacles of the way the more insuperable as they were unforeseen to these ignorant fanatics The savage countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were whitened with their bones their vanguard was cut in pieces by the Turkish sultan and the loss of the first adventure by the sword or climate or fatigue has already been stated at three hundred thousand men Yet the myriads that survived that marched that pressed forwards on the holy pilgrimage were a subject of astonishment to themselves and to the Greeks The copious energy of her language sinks under the efforts of the princess Anne seventy six the images of locusts of leaves and flowers of the sands of the sea or the stars of heaven imperfectly represent what she had seen and heard and the daughter of Alexius exclaims that Europe was loosened from its foundations and hurled against Asia The ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the same doubt of a vague and indefinite magnitude but I am inclined to believe that a larger number has never been contained within the lines of a single camp than at the siege of Nice the first operation of the Latin princes Their motives their characters and their arms have been already displayed Of their troops the most numerous portion were natives of France the Low Countries the banks of the Rhine and Apulia sent a powerful reenforcement some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain Lombardy and England seventy seven and from the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland or Scotland seventy eight issued some naked and savage fanatics ferocious at home but unwarlike abroad Had not superstition condemned the sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage the useless crowd with mouths but without hands might have been stationed in the Greek empire till their companions had opened and secured the way of the Lord A small remnant of the pilgrims who passed the Bosphorus was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre Their northern constitution was scorched by the rays and infected by the vapors of a Syrian sun They consumed with heedless prodigality their stores of water and provision their numbers exhausted the inland country the sea was remote the Greeks were unfriendly and the Christians of every sect fled before the voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren In the dire necessity of famine they sometimes roasted and devoured the flesh of their infant or adult captives Among the Turks and Saracens the idolaters of Europe were rendered more odious by the name and reputation of Cannibals the spies who introduced themselves into the

with pleasure on the first steps of the crusaders as they paint the manners and character of Europe but I shall abridge the tedious and uniform narrative of their blind achievements which were performed by strength and are described by ignorance From their first station in the neighborhood of Nicomedia they advanced in successive divisions passed the contracted limit of the Greek empire opened a road through the hills and commenced by the siege of his capital their pious warfare against the Turkish sultan His kingdom of Roum extended from the Hellespont to the confines of Syria and barred the pilgrimage of Jerusalem his name was Kilidge Arslan or Soliman eighty of the race of Seljuk and son of the first conqueror and in the defence of a land which the Turks considered as their own he deserved the praise of his enemies by whom alone he is known to posterity Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent he deposited his family and treasure in Nice retired to the mountains with fifty thousand horse and twice descended to assault the camps or quarters of the Christian besiegers which formed an imperfect circle of above six miles The lofty and solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch and flanked by three hundred and seventy towers and on the verge of Christendom the Moslems were trained in arms and inflamed by religion Before this city the French princes occupied their stations and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or subordination emulation prompted their valor but their valor was sullied by cruelty and their emulation degenerated into envy and civil discord In the siege of Nice the arts and engines of antiquity were employed by the Latins the mine and the battering ram the tortoise and the belfrey or movable turret artificial fire and the

Raymond was made on the side of the besiegers But the Turks could protract their resistance and secure their escape as long as they were masters of the Lake eighty two Ascanius which stretches several miles to the westward of the city The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and industry of Alexius a great number of boats was transported on sledges from the sea to the lake they were filled with the most dexterous of his archers the flight of the sultana was intercepted Nice was invested by land and water and a Greek emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master s protection and to save themselves by a timely surrender from the rage of the savages of Europe In the moment of victory or at least of hope the crusaders thirsting for blood and plunder were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed from the citadel eight hundred twenty one and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important conquest The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honor or interest and after a halt of nine days they directed their march towards Phrygia under the guidance of a Greek general whom they suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan The consort and the principal servants of Soliman had been honorably restored without ransom and the emperor s generosity to the miscreants eighty three was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause Footnote eighty

by the French crusaders and confined in that language to its primitive sense It should seem that the zeal of our ancestors boiled higher and that they branded every unbeliever as a rascal A similar prejudice still lurks in the minds of many who think themselves Christians Soliman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his capital he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange invasion of the Western Barbarians the Turkish emirs obeyed the call of loyalty or religion the Turkman hordes encamped round his standard and his whole force is loosely stated by the Christians at two hundred or even three hundred and sixty thousand horse Yet he patiently waited till they had left behind them the sea and the Greek frontier and hovering on the flanks observed their careless and confident progress in two columns beyond the view of each other Some miles before they could reach Dorylaeum in Phrygia the left and least numerous division was surprised and attacked and almost oppressed by the Turkish cavalry eighty four The heat of the weather the clouds of arrows and the barbarous onset overwhelmed the crusaders they lost their order and confidence and the fainting fight was sustained by the personal valor rather than by the military conduct of Bohemond Tancred and Robert of Normandy They were revived by the welcome banners of Duke Godfrey who flew to their succor with the count of Vermandois and sixty thousand horse and was followed by Raymond of Tholouse the bishop of Puy and the remainder of the sacred army Without a moment s pause they formed in new order and advanced to a second battle They were received with equal resolution and in their common disdain for the unwarlike people of Greece and Asia it was confessed on both sides that the Turks and the Franks were the only nations entitled to the appellation of soldiers eighty five Their encounter was varied and balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline of the direct charge and wheeling evolutions of the couched lance and the brandished javelin of a weighty broadsword and a crooked sabre of cumbrous armor and thin flowing robes and of the long Tartar bow and the arbalist or crossbow a deadly weapon yet unknown to the Orientals eighty six As long as the horses were fresh and the quivers full Soliman maintained the advantage of the day and four thousand Christians were pierced by the Turkish arrows In the evening swiftness yielded to strength on either side the numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold or any generals could manage but in turning the hills the last division of Raymond and his provincials was led perhaps without design on the rear of an exhausted enemy and the long contest was determined Besides a nameless and unaccounted multitude three thousand Pagan knights were slain in the battle and pursuit the camp of Soliman was pillaged and in the variety of precious spoil the curiosity of the Latins was amused with foreign arms and apparel and the new aspect of dromedaries and camels The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty retreat of the sultan reserving ten thousand guards of the relics of his army Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum and hastened to implore the aid and kindle the resentment of his Eastern brethren In a march of five hundred miles the crusaders traversed the Lesser Asia through a wasted land and deserted towns without finding either a friend or an enemy The geographer eighty seven may trace the position of Dorylaeum Antioch of Pisidia Iconium Archelais and Germanicia and may compare those classic appellations with the modern names of Eskishehr the old city Akshehr the white city Cogni Erekli and Marash As the pilgrims passed over a desert where a draught of water is exchanged for silver they were tormented by intolerable thirst and on the banks of the first rivulet their haste and intemperance were still more pernicious to the disorderly throng They climbed with toil and danger the steep and slippery sides of Mount Taurus many of the soldiers cast away their arms to secure their footsteps and had not terror preceded their van the long and trembling file might have been driven down the precipice by a handful of resolute enemies Two of their most respectable chiefs the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse were carried in litters Raymond was raised as

Kinneir in Asia Minor throws considerable light on the geography of this march of the crusaders M To improve the general consternation the cousin of Bohemond and the brother of Godfrey were detached from the main army with their respective squadrons of five and of seven hundred knights They overran in a rapid career the hills and sea coast of Cilicia from Cogni to the Syrian gates the Norman standard was first planted on the walls of Tarsus and Malmistra but the proud injustice of Baldwin at length provoked the patient and generous Italian and they turned their consecrated swords against each other in a private and profane quarrel Honor was the motive and fame the reward of Tancred but fortune smiled on the more selfish enterprise of his rival eighty eight He was called to the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant who had been suffered under the Turkish yoke to reign over the Christians of Edessa Baldwin accepted the character of his son and champion but no sooner was he introduced into the city than he inflamed the people to the massacre of his father occupied the throne and treasure extended his conquests over the hills of Armenia and the plain of Mesopotamia and founded the first principality of the Franks or Latins which subsisted fifty four years beyond the Euphrates eighty nine Footnote eighty eight This detached conquest of Edessa is best represented by Fulcherius Carnotensis or of Chartres in the collections of Bongarsius Duchesne and Martenne the valiant chaplain of Count Baldwin Esprit des Croisades tom i p thirteen fourteen In the disputes of that prince with Tancred his partiality is encountered by the partiality of Radulphus Cadomensis the soldier and historian of the gallant marquis Footnote eighty nine See de Guignes Hist des Huns tom i p four hundred fifty six Before the Franks could enter Syria the summer and even the autumn were completely wasted the siege of Antioch or the separation and repose of the army during the winter season was strongly debated in their council the love of arms and the holy sepulchre urged them to advance and reason perhaps was on the side of resolution since every hour of delay abates the fame and force of the invader and multiplies the resources of defensive war The capital of Syria was protected by the River Orontes and the iron bridge eight hundred ninety one of nine arches derives its name from the massy gates of the two towers which are constructed at either end They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy his victory gave entrance to three hundred thousand crusaders an account which may allow some scope for losses and desertion but which clearly detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice In the description of Antioch ninety it is not easy to define a middle term between her ancient magnificence under the successors of Alexander and Augustus and the modern aspect of Turkish desolation The Tetrapolis or four cities if they retained their name and position must have left a large vacuity in a circumference of twelve miles and that measure as well as the number of four hundred towers are not perfectly consistent with the five gates so often mentioned in the history of the siege Yet Antioch must have still flourished as a great and populous capital At the head of the Turkish emirs Baghisian a veteran chief commanded in the place his garrison was composed of six or seven thousand horse and fifteen or twenty thousand foot one hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by the sword and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks Armenians and Syrians who had been no more than fourteen years the slaves of the house of Seljuk From the remains of a solid and stately wall it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet in the valleys and wherever less art and labor had been applied the ground was supposed to be defended by the river the morass and the mountains Notwithstanding these fortifications the city had been repeatedly taken by the Persians the Arabs the Greeks and the Turks so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack and in a siege that was formed about the middle of October the vigor of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt Whatever strength and valor could perform in the field was abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross in the frequent occasions of sallies of forage of the attack and defence of convoys they were often victorious and we can only complain that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the scale of probability and truth The sword of Godfrey ninety one divided a Turk from the shoulder to the haunch and one half of the infidel fell to the ground while the other was transported by his horse to the city gate As Robert of Normandy rode against his antagonist I devote thy head he piously exclaimed to the daemons of hell and that head was instantly cloven to the breast by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion But the reality or the report of such gigantic prowess ninety two must have taught the Moslems to keep within their walls and against those walls of earth or stone the sword and the lance were unavailing weapons In the slow and successive labors of a siege the crusaders were supine and ignorant without skill to contrive or money to purchase or industry to use the artificial engines and implements of assault In the conquest of Nice they had been powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek emperor his absence was poorly supplied by some Genoese and Pisan vessels that were attracted by religion or trade to the coast of Syria the stores were scanty the return precarious and the communication difficult and dangerous Indolence or weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire circuit and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the wants and recruited the garrison of the city At the end of seven months after the ruin of their cavalry and an enormous loss by famine desertion and fatigue the progress of the crusaders was imperceptible and their success remote if the Latin Ulysses the artful and ambitious Bohemond had not employed the arms of cunning and deceit The Christians of Antioch were numerous and discontented Phirouz a Syrian renegado had acquired the favor of the emir and the command of three towers and the merit of his repentance disguised to the Latins and perhaps to himself the foul design of perfidy and treason A secret correspondence for their mutual interest was soon established between Phirouz and the prince of Tarento and Bohemond declared in the council of the chiefs that he could deliver the city into their hands nine hundred twenty one But he claimed the sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his service and the proposal which had been rejected by the envy was at length extorted from the distress of his equals The nocturnal surprise was executed by the French and Norman princes who ascended in person the scaling ladders that were thrown from the walls their new proselyte after the murder of his too scrupulous brother embraced and introduced the servants of Christ the army rushed through the gates and the Moslems soon found that although mercy was hopeless resistance was impotent But the citadel still refused to surrender and the victims themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the innumerable forces of Kerboga prince of Mosul who with twenty eight Turkish emirs advanced to the deliverance of Antioch Five and twenty days the Christians spent on the verge of destruction and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death ninety three In this extremity they collected the relics of their strength sallied from the town and in a single memorable day annihilated or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians which they might safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand men ninety four Their supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider the human causes of the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the Franks and the surprise the discord perhaps the errors of their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries The battle is described with as much disorder as it was fought but we may observe the tent of Kerboga a movable and spacious palace enriched with the luxury of Asia and capable of holding above two

A speculative reasoner might suppose that their faith had a strong and serious influence on their practice and that the soldiers of the cross the deliverers of the holy sepulchre prepared themselves by a sober and virtuous life for the daily contemplation of martyrdom Experience blows away this charitable illusion and seldom does the history of profane war display such scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under the walls of Antioch The grove of Daphne no longer flourished but the Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices the Christians were seduced by every temptation ninety five that nature either prompts or reprobates the authority of the chiefs was despised and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those scandalous disorders not less pernicious to military discipline than repugnant to evangelic purity In the first days of the siege and the possession of Antioch the Franks consumed with wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of weeks and months the desolate country no longer yielded a supply and from that country they were at length excluded by the arms of the besieging Turks Disease the faithful companion of want was envenomed by the rains of the winter the summer heats unwholesome food and the close imprisonment of multitudes The pictures of famine and pestilence are always the same and always disgustful and our imagination may suggest the nature of their sufferings and their resources The remains of treasure or spoil were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor since after paying three marks of silver for a goat and fifteen for a lean camel ninety six the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner and Duke Godfrey to borrow a horse Sixty thousand horse had been reviewed in the camp before the end of the siege they were diminished to two thousand and scarcely two hundred fit for service could be mustered on the day of battle Weakness of body and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm of the pilgrims and every motive of honor and religion was subdued by the desire of life ninety seven Among the chiefs three heroes may be found without fear or reproach Godfrey of Bouillon was supported by his magnanimous piety Bohemond by ambition and interest and Tancred declared in the true spirit of chivalry that as long as he was at the head of forty knights he would never relinquish the enterprise of Palestine But the count of Tholouse and Provence was suspected of a voluntary indisposition the duke of Normandy was recalled from the sea shore by the censures of the church Hugh the Great though he led the vanguard of the battle embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to France and Stephen count of Chartres basely deserted the standard which he bore and the council in which he presided The soldiers were discouraged by the flight of William viscount of Melun surnamed the Carpenter from the weighty strokes of his axe and the saints were scandalized by the fall nine hundred seventy one of Peter the Hermit who after arming Europe against Asia attempted to escape from the penance of a necessary fast Of the multitude of recreant warriors the names says an historian are blotted from the book of life and the opprobrious epithet of the rope dancers was applied to the deserters who dropped in the night from the walls of Antioch The emperor Alexius ninety eight who seemed to advance to the succor of the Latins was dismayed by the assurance of their hopeless condition They expected their fate in silent despair oaths and punishments were tried without effect and to rouse the soldiers to the defence of the walls it was found necessary to set fire to their quarters

three hundred seventeen three hundred twenty seven Anna was so prone to exaggeration that she magnifies the exploits of the Latins For their salvation and victory they were indebted to the same fanaticism which had led them to the brink of ruin In such a cause and in such an army visions prophecies and miracles were frequent and familiar In the distress of Antioch they were repeated with unusual energy and success saint Ambrose had assured a pious ecclesiastic that two years of trial must precede the season of deliverance and grace the deserters were stopped by the presence and reproaches of Christ himself the dead had promised to arise and combat with their brethren the Virgin had obtained the pardon of their sins and their confidence was revived by a visible sign the seasonable and splendid discovery of the Holy Lance The policy of their chiefs has on this occasion been admired and might surely be excused but a pious baud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons and a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise and the credulity of the people Of the diocese of Marseilles there was a priest of low cunning and loose manners and his name was Peter Bartholemy He presented himself at the door of the council chamber to disclose an apparition of saint Andrew which had been thrice reiterated in his sleep with a dreadful menace if he presumed to suppress the commands of Heaven At Antioch said the apostle in the church of my brother saint Peter near the high altar is concealed the steel head of the lance that pierced the side of our Redeemer In three days that instrument of eternal and now of temporal salvation will be manifested to his disciples Search and ye shall find bear it aloft in battle and that mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the miscreants The pope s legate the bishop of Puy affected to listen with coldness and distrust but the revelation was eagerly accepted by Count Raymond whom his faithful subject in the name of the apostle had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance The experiment was resolved and on the third day after a due preparation of prayer and fasting the priest of Marseilles introduced twelve trusty spectators among whom were the count and his chaplain and the church doors were barred against the impetuous multitude The ground was opened in the appointed place but the workmen who relieved each other dug to the depth of twelve feet without discovering the object of their search In the evening when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post and the weary assistants began to murmur Bartholemy in his shirt and without his shoes boldly descended into the pit the darkness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and deposit the head of a Saracen lance and the first sound the first gleam of the steel was saluted with a devout rapture The holy lance was drawn from its recess wrapped in a veil of silk and gold and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders their anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope and the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm of valor Whatever had been the arts and whatever might be the sentiments of the chiefs they skilfully improved this fortunate revolution by every aid that discipline and devotion could afford The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with an injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching conflict freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and their horses and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of victory On the festival of saint Peter and saint Paul the gates of Antioch were thrown open a martial psalm Let the Lord arise and let his enemies be scattered was chanted by a procession of priests and monks the battle array was marshalled in twelve divisions in honor of the twelve apostles and the holy lance in the absence of Raymond was intrusted to the hands of his chaplain The influence of his relic or trophy was felt by the servants and perhaps by the enemies of Christ ninety nine and its potent energy was heightened by an accident a stratagem or a rumor of a miraculous complexion Three knights in white garments and resplendent arms either issued or seemed to issue from the hills the voice of Adhemar the pope s legate proclaimed them as the martyrs saint George saint Theodore and saint Maurice the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or scrutiny and the welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the imagination of a fanatic army nine hundred ninety one In the season of danger and triumph the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseilles was unanimously asserted but as soon as the temporary service was accomplished the personal dignity and liberal arms which the count of Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance provoked the envy and awakened the reason of his rivals A Norman clerk presumed to sift with a philosophic spirit the truth of the legend the circumstances of the discovery and the character of the prophet and the pious Bohemond ascribed their deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone For a while the Provincials defended their national palladium with clamors and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit of the discovery The prevalence of incredulity compelled the author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of God A pile of dry fagots four feet high and fourteen long was erected in the midst of the camp the flames burnt fiercely to the elevation of thirty cubits and a narrow path of twelve inches was left for the perilous trial The unfortunate priest of Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed but the thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat he expired the next day nine hundred ninety two and the logic of believing minds will pay some regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth Some efforts were made by the Provincials to substitute a cross a ring or a tabernacle in the place of the holy lance which soon vanished in contempt and oblivion one hundred Yet the revelation of Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding historians and such is the progress of credulity that miracles most doubtful on the spot and at the moment will be received with implicit faith at a convenient distance of time and space Footnote ninety nine The Mahometan Aboulmahasen apud De Guignes tom ii p ii p ninety five is more correct in his account of the holy lance than the Christians Anna Comnena and Abulpharagius

and strenuous The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion till the decline of the Turkish empire one hundred one Under the manly government of the three first sultans the kingdoms of Asia were united in peace and justice and the innumerable armies which they led in person were equal in courage and superior in discipline to the Barbarians of the West But at the time of the crusade the inheritance of Malek Shaw was disputed by his four sons their private ambition was insensible of the public danger and in the vicissitudes of their fortune the royal vassals were ignorant or regardless of the true object of their allegiance The twenty eight emirs who marched with the standard or Kerboga were his rivals or enemies their hasty levies were drawn from the towns and tents of Mesopotamia and Syria and the Turkish veterans were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the Tigris The caliph of Egypt embraced this opportunity of weakness and discord to recover his ancient possessions and his sultan Aphdal besieged Jerusalem and Tyre expelled the children of Ortok and restored in Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical authority of the Fatimites one hundred two They heard with astonishment of the vast armies of Christians that had passed from Europe to Asia and rejoiced in the sieges and battles which broke the power of the Turks the adversaries of their sect and monarchy But the same Christians were the enemies of the prophet and from the overthrow of Nice and Antioch the motive of their enterprise which was gradually understood would urge them forwards to the banks of the Jordan or perhaps of the Nile An intercourse of epistles and embassies which rose and fell with the events of war was maintained between the throne of Cairo and the camp of the Latins and their adverse pride was the result of ignorance and enthusiasm The ministers of Egypt declared in a haughty or insinuated in a milder tone that their sovereign the true and lawful commander of the faithful had rescued Jerusalem from the Turkish yoke and that the pilgrims if they would divide their numbers and lay aside their arms should find a safe and hospitable reception at the sepulchre of Jesus In the belief of their lost condition the caliph Mostali despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies the conquest and victory of Antioch prompted him to solicit those formidable champions with gifts of horses and silk robes of vases and purses of gold and silver and in his estimate of their merit or power the first place was assigned to Bohemond and the second to Godfrey In either fortune the answer of the crusaders was firm and uniform they disdained to inquire into the private claims or possessions of the followers of Mahomet whatsoever was his name or nation the usurper of Jerusalem was their enemy and instead of prescribing the mode and terms of their pilgrimage it was only by a timely surrender of the city and province their sacred right that he

their importance than the contemporary writers Yet this attack when they were within the view and reach of their glorious prize was suspended above ten months after the defeat of Kerboga The zeal and courage of the crusaders were chilled in the moment of victory and instead of marching to improve the consternation they hastily dispersed to enjoy the luxury of Syria The causes of this strange delay may be found in the want of strength and subordination In the painful and various service of Antioch the cavalry was annihilated many thousands of every rank had been lost by famine sickness and desertion the same abuse of plenty had been productive of a third famine and the alternative of intemperance and distress had generated a pestilence which swept away above fifty thousand of the pilgrims Few were able to command and none were willing to obey the domestic feuds which had been stifled by common fear were again renewed in acts or at least in sentiments of hostility the fortune of Baldwin and Bohemond excited the envy of their companions the bravest knights were enlisted for the defence of their new principalities and Count Raymond exhausted his troops and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of Syria ten thirty one The winter was consumed in discord and disorder a sense of honor and religion was rekindled in the spring and the private soldiers less susceptible of ambition and jealousy awakened with angry clamors the indolence of their chiefs In the month of May the relics of this mighty host proceeded from Antioch to Laodicea about forty thousand Latins of whom no more than fifteen hundred horse and twenty thousand foot were capable of immediate service Their easy march was continued between Mount Libanus and the sea shore their wants were liberally supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa and they drew large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli Tyre Sidon Acre and Caesarea who granted a free passage and promised to

walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain one hundred five These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades The bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored the Jews their nation and worship were forever banished but nature is less changeable than man and the site of Jerusalem though somewhat softened and somewhat removed was still strong against the assaults of an enemy By the experience of a recent siege and a three years possession the Saracens of Egypt had been taught to discern and in some degree to remedy the defects of a place which religion as well as honor forbade them to resign Aladin or Iftikhar the caliph s lieutenant was intrusted with the defence his policy strove to restrain the native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the holy sepulchre to animate the Moslems by the assurance of temporal and eternal rewards His garrison is said to have consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabians and if he could muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants it must be confessed that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army one hundred six Had the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins allowed them to grasp the whole circumference of four thousand yards about two English miles and a half one hundred seven to what useful purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and torrent of Cedron one hundred eight or approach the precipices of the south and east from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and western sides of the city Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary to the left as far as saint Stephen s gate the line of attack was continued by Tancred and the two Roberts and Count Raymond established his quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion which was no longer included within the precincts of the city On the fifth day the crusaders made a general assault in the fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines and of scaling them without ladders By the dint of brutal force they burst the first barrier but they were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems and time and labor were found to be the only means of victory The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days but they were forty days of calamity and anguish A repetition of the old complaint of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the Franks but the stony soil of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water the scanty springs and hasty torrents were dry in the summer season nor was the thirst of the besiegers relieved as in the city by the artificial supply of cisterns and aqueducts The circumjacent country is equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building but some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders a wood near Sichem the enchanted grove of Tasso one hundred nine was cut down the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigor and dexterity of Tancred and the engines were framed by some Genoese artists who had fortunately landed in the harbor of Jaffa Two movable turrets were constructed at the expense and in the stations of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse and rolled forwards with devout labor not to the most accessible but to the most neglected parts of the fortification Raymond s Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged but his colleague was more vigilant and successful ten ninety one the enemies were driven by his archers from the rampart the draw bridge was let down and on a Friday at three in the afternoon the day and hour of the passion Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the walls of Jerusalem His example was followed on every side by the emulation of valor and about four hundred and sixty years after the conquest of Omar the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan yoke In the pillage of public and private wealth the adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the first occupant and the spoils of the great mosque seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and silver rewarded the diligence and displayed the generosity of Tancred A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify their implacable rage they indulged themselves three days in a promiscuous massacre one hundred ten and the infection of the dead bodies produced an epidemical disease After seventy thousand Moslems had been put to the sword and the harmless Jews had been burnt in their synagogue they could still reserve a multitude of captives whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare Of these savage heroes of the cross Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion yet we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond who granted a capitulation and safe conduct to the garrison of the citadel one hundred eleven The holy sepulchre was now free and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow Bareheaded and barefoot with contrite hearts and in an humble posture they ascended the hill of Calvary amidst the loud anthems of the clergy kissed the stone which had covered the Savior of the world and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of their redemption This union of the fiercest and most tender passions has been variously considered by two philosophers by the one one hundred twelve as easy and natural by the other one hundred thirteen as absurd and incredible Perhaps it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and the same hour the example of the virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions while they cleansed their bodies they purified their minds nor shall I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre Footnote one hundred five See the masterly description of Tacitus Hist v eleven twelve thirteen who supposes that the Jewish lawgivers had provided for a perpetual state of hostility against the rest of mankind Note This is an exaggerated inference from the words of Tacitus who speaks of the founders of the city not the lawgivers

of a king to guard and govern their conquests in Palestine Hugh the Great and Stephen of Chartres had retired with some loss of reputation which they strove to regain by a second crusade and an honorable death Baldwin was established at Edessa and Bohemond at Antioch and two Roberts the duke of Normandy one hundred fourteen and the count of Flanders preferred their fair inheritance in the West to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre The jealousy and ambition of Raymond were condemned by his own followers and the free the just the unanimous voice of the army proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most worthy of the champions of Christendom His magnanimity accepted a trust as full of danger as of glory but in a city where his Savior had been crowned with thorns the devout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of royalty and the founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem contented himself with the modest title of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre His government of a single year one hundred fifteen too short for the public happiness was interrupted in the first fortnight by a summons to the field by the approach of the vizier or sultan of Egypt who had been too slow to prevent but who was impatient to avenge the loss of Jerusalem His total overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the establishment of the Latins in Syria and signalized the valor of the French princes who in this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of numbers though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot eleven fifty one on the side of the Fatimites but except three thousand Ethiopians or Blacks who were armed with flails or scourges of iron the Barbarians of the South fled on the first onset and afforded a pleasing comparison between the active valor of the Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of the natives of Egypt After suspending before the holy sepulchre the sword and standard of the sultan the new king he deserves the title embraced his departing companions and could retain only with the gallant Tancred three hundred knights and two thousand foot soldiers for the defence of Palestine His sovereignty was soon attacked by a new enemy the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward Adhemar bishop of Puy who excelled both in council and action had been swept away in the last plague at Antioch the remaining ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their character and their seditious clamors had required that the choice of a bishop should precede that of a king The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the Latin clergy the exclusion of the Greeks and Syrians was justified by the reproach of heresy or schism one hundred sixteen and under the iron yoke of their deliverers the Oriental Christians regretted the tolerating government of the Arabian caliphs Daimbert archbishop of Pisa had long been trained in the secret policy of Rome he brought a fleet at his countrymen to the succor of the Holy Land and was installed without a competitor the spiritual and temporal head of the church eleven sixty one The new patriarch one

investiture of their feudal possessions Nor was this sufficient Daimbert claimed the immediate property of Jerusalem and Jaffa instead of a firm and generous refusal the hero negotiated with the priest a quarter of either city was ceded to the church and the modest bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest on the death of Godfrey without children or on the future acquisition

towns of the adjacent country one hundred eighteen Within this narrow verge the Mahometans were still lodged in some impregnable castles and the husbandman the trader and the pilgrim were exposed to daily and domestic hostility By the arms of Godfrey himself and of the two Baldwins his brother and cousin who succeeded to the throne the Latins breathed with more ease and safety and at length they equalled in the extent of their dominions though not in the millions of their subjects the ancient princes of Judah and Israel one hundred nineteen After the reduction of the maritime cities of Laodicea Tripoli Tyre and Ascalon one hundred twenty which were powerfully assisted by the fleets of Venice Genoa and Pisa and even of Flanders and Norway one hundred twenty one the range of sea coast from Scanderoon to the borders of Egypt was possessed by the Christian pilgrims If the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy the counts of Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the vassals of the king of Jerusalem the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates and the four cities of Hems Hamah Damascus and Aleppo were the only relics of the Mahometan conquests in Syria one hundred twenty two The laws and language the manners and titles of the French nation and Latin church were introduced into these transmarine colonies According to the feudal jurisprudence the principal states and subordinate baronies descended in the line of male and female succession one hundred twenty three but the children of the first conquerors one hundred twenty four a motley and degenerate race were dissolved by the luxury of the climate the arrival of new crusaders from Europe was a doubtful hope and a casual event The service of the feudal tenures one hundred twenty five was performed by six hundred and sixty six knights who might expect the aid of two hundred more under the banner of the count of Tripoli and each knight was attended to the field by four squires or archers on horseback one hundred twenty six Five thousand and seventy sergeants most probably foot soldiers were supplied by the churches and cities and the whole legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed eleven thousand men a slender defence against the surrounding myriads of Saracens and Turks one hundred twenty seven But the firmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded on the knights of the Hospital of saint John one hundred twenty eight and of the temple of Solomon one hundred twenty nine on the strange association of a monastic and military life which fanaticism might suggest but which policy must approve The flower of the nobility of Europe aspired to wear the cross and to profess the vows of these respectable orders their spirit and discipline were immortal and the speedy donation of twenty eight thousand farms or manors one hundred thirty enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry and infantry for the defence of Palestine The austerity of the convent soon evaporated in the exercise of arms the world was scandalized by the pride avarice and corruption of these Christian soldiers their claims of immunity and jurisdiction disturbed the harmony of the church and state and the public peace was endangered by their jealous emulation But in their most dissolute period the knights of their hospital and temple maintained their fearless and fanatic character they neglected to live but they were prepared to die in the service of Christ and the spirit of chivalry the parent and offspring of the crusades has been transplanted by this institution from the holy sepulchre to the Isle of Malta one

flattering picture of the order while it was employed for the defence of Palestine The subsequent books pursue their emigration to Rhodes and Malta The spirit of freedom which pervades the feudal institutions was felt in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross who elected for their chief the most deserving of his peers Amidst the slaves of Asia unconscious of the lesson or example a model of political liberty was introduced and the laws of the French kingdom are derived from the purest source of equality and justice Of such laws the first and indispensable condition is the assent of those whose obedience they require and for whose benefit they are designed No sooner had Godfrey of Bouillon accepted the office of supreme magistrate than he solicited the public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims who were the best skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe From these materials with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and barons of the clergy and laity Godfrey composed the Assise of Jerusalem one hundred thirty two a precious monument of feudal jurisprudence The new code attested by the seals of the king the patriarch and the viscount of Jerusalem was deposited in the holy sepulchre enriched with the improvements of succeeding times and respectfully consulted as often as any doubtful question arose in the tribunals of Palestine With the kingdom and city all was lost one hundred thirty three the fragments of the written law were preserved by jealous tradition one hundred thirty four and variable practice till the middle of the

of the Assise c two hundred eighty one Yet Jerusalem capitulated with Saladin the queen and the principal Christians departed in peace and a code so precious and so portable could not provoke the

sealed with four seals and deposited in the cathedral of Nicosia see the preface to the Assises The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by two tribunals of unequal dignity which were instituted by Godfrey of Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem The king in person presided in the upper court the court of the barons Of these the four most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee the lord of Sidon and Caesarea and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli who perhaps with the constable and marshal one hundred thirty seven were in a special manner the compeers and judges of each other But all the nobles who held their lands immediately of the crown were entitled and bound to attend the king s court and each baron exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of his own feudatories The connection of lord and vassal was honorable and voluntary reverence was due to the benefactor protection to the dependant but they mutually pledged their faith to each other and the obligation on either side might be suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury The cognizance of marriages and testaments was blended with religion and usurped by the clergy but the civil and criminal causes of the nobles the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs formed the proper occupation of the supreme court Each member was the judge and guardian both of public and private rights It was his duty to assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal the confederate peers stood forth to maintain his quarrel by word and deed They boldly affirmed his innocence and his wrongs demanded the restitution of his liberty or his lands suspended after a fruitless demand their own service rescued their brother from prison and employed every weapon in his defence without offering direct violence to the person of their lord which was ever sacred in their eyes one hundred thirty eight In their pleadings replies and rejoinders the advocates of the court were subtle and copious but the use of argument and evidence was often superseded by judicial combat and the Assise of Jerusalem admits in many cases this barbarous institution which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of Europe Footnote one hundred thirty seven The cautious John D Ibelin argues rather than affirms that Tripoli is the fourth barony and expresses some doubt concerning the right or pretension of the constable and marshal c three hundred twenty three Footnote one hundred thirty eight Entre

twelve The form of their remonstrances is conceived with the noble simplicity of freedom The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which affected the life or limb or honor of any person and in all civil transactions of or above the value of one mark of silver It appears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser who except in a charge of treason avenged his personal injury or the death of those persons whom he had a right to represent but wherever from the nature of the charge testimony could be obtained it was necessary for him to produce witnesses of the fact In civil cases the combat was not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had or assumed to have knowledge of the fact The combat was then the privilege of the defendant because he charged the witness with an attempt by perjury to take away his right He came therefore to be in the same situation as the appellant in criminal cases It was not then as a mode of proof that the combat was received nor as making negative evidence according to the supposition of Montesquieu one hundred thirty nine but in every case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of an injury and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle and with the same spirit as a private duel Champions were only allowed to women and to men maimed or past the age of sixty The consequence of a defeat was death to the person accused or to the champion or witness as well as to the accuser himself but in civil cases the demandant was punished with infamy and the loss of his suit while his witness and champion suffered ignominious death In many cases it was in the option of the judge to award or to refuse the combat but two are specified in which it was the inevitable result of the challenge if a faithful vassal gave the lie to his compeer who unjustly claimed any portion of their lord s demesnes or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach the judgment and veracity of the court He might impeach them but the terms were severe and perilous in the same day he successively fought all the members of the tribunal even those who had been absent a single defeat was followed by death and infamy and where none could hope for victory it is highly probable that none would adventure the trial In the Assise of Jerusalem the legal subtlety of the count of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude than to facilitate the judicial combat which he derives from a principle of honor rather than of superstition one hundred forty Footnote one hundred thirty nine See l Esprit des Loix l xxviii In the forty years since its publication no work has been more read and criticized and the spirit of inquiry which it has excited is not the least of our obligations to the author Footnote one hundred forty For the intelligence of this obscure and obsolete jurisprudence c eighty one hundred eleven I am deeply indebted to the friendship of a learned lord who with an accurate and discerning eye has surveyed the philosophic history of law By his studies posterity might be enriched the merit of the orator and the judge can be felt only by his contemporaries Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of feudal tyranny the institution of cities and corporations is one of the most powerful and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first crusade they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner of the cross and it was the policy of the French princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen It is expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem that after instituting for his knights and barons the court of peers in which he presided himself Godfrey of Bouillon established a second tribunal in which his person was represented by his viscount The jurisdiction of this inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom and it was composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens who were sworn to judge according to the laws of the actions and fortunes of their equals one hundred forty one In the conquest and settlement of new cities the example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their great vassals and above thirty similar corporations were founded before the loss of the Holy Land Another class of subjects the Syrians one hundred forty two or Oriental Christians were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy and protected by the toleration of the state Godfrey listened to their reasonable prayer that they might be judged by their own national laws A third court was instituted for their use of limited and domestic jurisdiction the sworn members were Syrians in blood language and religion but the office of the president in Arabic of the rais was sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city At an immeasurable distance below the nobles the burgesses and the strangers the Assise of Jerusalem condescends to mention the villains and slaves the peasants of the land and the captives of war who were almost equally considered as the objects of property The relief or protection of these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator but he diligently provides for the recovery though not indeed for the punishment of the fugitives Like hounds or hawks who had strayed from the lawful owner they might be lost and claimed the slave and falcon were of the same value but three slaves or twelve oxen were accumulated to equal the price of the war horse and a sum of three hundred pieces of gold was fixed in the age of chivalry as the equivalent of the more noble animal one
