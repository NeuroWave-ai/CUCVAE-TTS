none	none	but many months before as the logical result of a process which began as far back as nineteen fifteen The corrupt reactionaries in control of the Tsar s Court deliberately undertook to wreck Russia in order to make a separate peace with Germany The lack of arms on the front which had caused the great retreat of the summer of nineteen fifteen the lack of food in the army and in the great cities the break down of manufactures and transportation in nineteen sixteen all these we know now were part of a gigantic campaign of sabotage This was halted just in time by the March Revolution For the first few months of the new regime in spite of the confusion incident upon a great Revolution when one hundred and sixty millions of the world s most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty both the internal situation and the combative power of the army actually improved But the honeymoon was short The propertied classes wanted merely a political revolution which would take the power from the Tsar and give it to them They wanted Russia to be a constitutional Republic like France or the United States or a constitutional Monarchy like England On the other hand the masses of the people wanted real industrial and agrarian democracy William English Walling in his book Russia s Message an account of the Revolution of nineteen oh five describes very well the state of mind of the Russian workers who were later to support Bolshevism almost unanimously They the working people saw it was possible that even under a free Government if it fell into the hands of other social classes they might still continue to starve The Russian workman is revolutionary but he is neither violent dogmatic nor unintelligent He is ready for barricades but he has studied them and alone of the workers of the world he has learned about them from actual experience He is ready and willing to fight his oppressor the capitalist class to a finish But he does not ignore the existence of other classes He merely asks that the other classes take one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws near They the workers were all agreed that our American political institutions were preferable to their own but they were not very anxious to exchange one despot for another i e the capitalist class The workingmen of Russia did not have themselves shot down executed by hundreds in Moscow Riga and Odessa imprisoned by thousands in every Russian jail and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions in exchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of Goldfields and Cripple Creek And so developed in Russia in the midst of a foreign war the Social Revolution on top of the Political Revolution culminating in the triumph of Bolshevism mister A J Sack director in this country of the Russian Information Bureau which opposes the Soviet Government has this to say in his book The Birth of the Russian Democracy The Bolsheviks organised their own cabinet with Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon Trotsky Minister of Foreign Affairs The inevitability of their coming into power became evident almost immediately after the March Revolution The history of the Bolsheviki after the Revolution is a history of their steady growth Foreigners and Americans especially frequently emphasise the ignorance of the Russian workers It is true they lacked the political experience of the peoples of the West but they were very well trained in voluntary organisation In nineteen seventeen there were more than twelve million members of the Russian consumers Cooperative societies and the Soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of their organising genius Moreover there is probably not a people in the world so well educated in Socialist theory and its practical application William English Walling thus characterises them The Russian working people are for the most part able to read and write For many years the country has been in such a disturbed condition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only of intelligent individuals in their midst but of a large part of the equally revolutionary educated class who have turned to the working people with their ideas for the political and social regeneration of Russia Many writers explain their hostility to the Soviet Government by arguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was simply a struggle of the respectable elements against the brutal attacks of Bolshevism However it was the propertied classes who when they realised the growth in power of the popular revolutionary organisations undertook to destroy them and to halt the Revolution To this end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measures In order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and the Soviets transportation was disorganised and internal troubles provoked to crush the Factory Shop Committees plants were shut down and fuel and raw materials diverted to break the Army Committees at the front capital punishment was restored and military defeat connived at This was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire The Bolsheviki retorted by preaching the class war and by asserting the supremacy of the Soviets Between these two extremes with the other factions which whole heartedly or half heartedly supported them were the so called moderate Socialists the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries and several smaller parties These groups were also attacked by the propertied classes but their power of resistance was crippled by their theories Roughly the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed that Russia was not economically ripe for a social revolution that only a political revolution was possible According to their interpretation the Russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power any attempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction by means of which some ruthless opportunist might restore the old regime And so it followed that when the moderate Socialists were forced to assume the power they were afraid to use it They believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political and economic development known to Western Europe and emerge at last with the rest of the world into full fledged Socialism Naturally therefore they agreed with the propertied classes that Russia must first be a parliamentary state though with some improvements on the Western democracies As a consequence they insisted upon the collaboration of the propertied classes in
6694_70837_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 the Government 
none	none	From this it was an easy step to supporting them The moderate Socialists needed the bourgeoisie But the bourgeoisie did not need the moderate Socialists So it resulted in the Socialist Ministers being obliged to give way little by little on their entire program while the propertied classes grew more and more insistent And at the end when the Bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromise the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found themselves fighting on the side of the propertied classes In almost every country in the world to day the same phenomenon is visible Instead of being a destructive force it seems to me that the Bolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive program and the power to impose it on the country If they had not succeeded to the Government when they did there is little doubt in my mind that the armies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow in December and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar It is still fashionable after a whole year of the Soviet Government to speak of the Bolshevik insurrection as an adventure Adventure it was and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked upon sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses and staking everything on their vast and simple desires Already the machinery had been set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributed among the peasants The Factory Shop Committees and the Trade Unions were there to put into operation workers control of industry In every village town city district and province there were Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies prepared to assume the task of local administration No matter what one thinks of Bolshevism it is undeniable that the Russian Revolution is one of the great events of human history and the rise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon of world wide importance Just as historians search the records for the minutest details of the story of the Paris Commune so they will want to know what happened in Petrograd in November nineteen seventeen the spirit which animated the people and how the leaders looked talked and acted It is with this in view that I have written this book In the struggle my sympathies were not neutral But in telling the story of those great days I have tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter interested in setting down the truth J R New York January first nineteen nineteen Notes and Explanations To the average reader the multiplicity of Russian organisations political groups Committees and Central Committees Soviets Dumas and Unions will prove extremely confusing For this reason I am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations Political Parties In the elections to the Constituent Assembly there were seventeen tickets in Petrograd and in some of the provincial towns as many as forty but the following summary of the aims and composition of political parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned in this book Only the essence of their programmes and the general character of their constituencies can be noticed one Monarchists of various shades Octobrists et cetera These once powerful factions no longer existed openly they either worked underground or their members joined the Cadets as the Cadets came by degrees to stand for their political programme Representatives in this book Rodzianko Shulgin two Cadets So called from the initials of its name Constitutional Democrats Its official name is Party of the People s Freedom Under the Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertied classes the Cadets were the great party of political reform roughly corresponding to the Progressive Party in America When the Revolution broke out in March nineteen seventeen the Cadets formed the first Provisional Government The Cadet Ministry was overthrown in April because it declared itself in favour of Allied imperialistic aims including the imperialistic aims of the Tsar s Government As the Revolution became more and more a social economic Revolution the Cadets grew more and more conservative Its representatives in this book are Miliukov Vinaver Shatsky twoa Group of Public Men After the Cadets had become unpopular through their relations with the Kornilov counter revolution the Group of Public Men was formed in Moscow Delegates from the Group of Public Men were given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet The Group declared itself non partisan although its intellectual leaders were men like Rodzianko and Shulgin It was composed of the more modern bankers merchants and manufacturers who were intelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought by their own weapon economic organisation Typical of the Group Lianozov Konovalov three Populist Socialists or Trudoviki Labour Group Numerically a small party composed of cautious intellectuals the leaders of the Cooperative societies and conservative peasants Professing to be Socialists the Populists really supported the interests of the petty bourgeoisie clerks shopkeepers et cetera By direct descent inheritors of the compromising tradition of the Labour Group in the Fourth Imperial Duma which was composed largely of peasant representatives Kerensky was the leader of the Trudoviki in the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March nineteen seventeen broke out The Populist Socialists are a nationalistic party Their representatives in this book are Peshekhanov Tchaikovsky four Russian Social Democratic Labour Party Originally Marxian Socialists At a party congress held in nineteen oh three the party split on the question of tactics into two factions the Majority Bolshinstvo and the Minority Menshinstvo From this sprang the names Bolsheviki and Mensheviki members of the majority and members of the minority These two wings became two separate parties both calling themselves Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and both professing to be Marxians Since the Revolution of nineteen oh five the Bolsheviki were really the minority becoming again the majority in September nineteen seventeen a Mensheviki This party includes all shades of Socialists who believe that society must progress by natural evolution toward Socialism and that the working class must conquer political power first Also a nationalistic party This was the party of the Socialist intellectuals which means all the means of education having been in the hands of the propertied classes the intellectuals instinctively reacted to their training and took the side of the propertied classes Among their representatives in this book are Dan Lieber Tseretelli b Mensheviki Internationalists The radical wing of the Mensheviki internationalists and opposed to all coalition with the propertied classes yet unwilling to break loose from the conservative Mensheviki and opposed to the dictatorship of the working class advocated by the Bolsheviki Trotzky was long a member of this group Among their leaders Martov Martinov c Bolsheviki Now call themselves the Communist Party in order to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition of moderate or parliamentary Socialism which dominates the Mensheviki and the so called Majority Socialists in all countries The Bolsheviki proposed immediate proletarian insurrection and seizure of the reins of Government in order to hasten the coming of Socialism by forcibly taking over industry land natural resources and financial institutions This party expresses the desires chiefly of the factory workers but also of a large section of the poor peasants The name Bolshevik can not be translated by Maximalist The Maximalists are a separate group See paragraph fiveb Among the leaders Lenin Trotzky Lunatcharsky d United Social Democrats Internationalists Also called the Novaya Zhizn New Life group from the name of the very influential newspaper which was its organ A little group of intellectuals with a very small following among the working class except the personal following of Maxim Gorky its leader Intellectuals with almost the same programme as the Mensheviki Internationalists except that the Novaya Zhizn group refused to be tied to either of the two great factions Opposed the Bolshevik tactics but remained in the Soviet Government Other representatives in this book Avilov Kramarov e Yedinstvo A very small and dwindling group composed almost entirely of the personal following of Plekhanov one of the pioneers of the Russian Social Democratic movement in the eighty s and its greatest theoretician Now an old man Plekhanov was extremely patriotic too conservative even for the Mensheviki After the Bolshevik coup d etat Yedinstvo disappeared five Socialist Revolutionary party Called Essaires from the initials of their name Originally the revolutionary party of the peasants the party of the Fighting Organisations the Terrorists After the March Revolution it was joined by many who had never been Socialists At that time it stood for the abolition of private property in land only the owners to be compensated in some fashion Finally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced the Essaires to abandon the compensation clause and led to the younger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main party in the fall of nineteen seventeen and forming a new party the Left Socialist Revolutionary party The Essaires who were afterward always called by the radical groups Right Socialist Revolutionaries adopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki and worked together with them They finally came to represent the wealthier peasants the intellectuals and the politically uneducated populations of remote rural districts Among them there was however a wider difference of shades of political and economic opinion than among the Mensheviki Among their leaders mentioned in these pages Avksentiev Gotz Kerensky Tchernov Babuschka Breshkovskaya a Left Socialist Revolutionaries Although theoretically sharing the Bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the working class at first were reluctant to follow the ruthless Bolshevik tactics However the Left Socialist Revolutionaries remained in the Soviet Government sharing the Cabinet portfolios especially that of Agriculture They withdrew from the Government several times but always returned As the peasants left the ranks of the Essaires in increasing numbers they joined the Left Socialist Revolutionary party which became the great peasant party supporting the Soviet Government standing for confiscation without compensation of the great landed estates and their disposition by the peasants themselves Among the leaders Spiridonova Karelin Kamkov Kalagayev b Maximalists An off shoot of the Socialist Revolutionary party in the Revolution of nineteen oh five when it was a powerful peasant movement demanding the immediate application of the maximum Socialist programme Now an insignificant group of peasant anarchists Parliamentary Procedure Russian meetings and conventions are organised after the continental model rather than our own The first action is usually the election of officers and the presidium The presidium is a presiding committee composed of representatives of the groups and political factions represented in the assembly in proportion to their numbers The presidium arranges the Order of Business and its members can be called upon by the President to take the chair pro tem Each question vopros is stated in a general way and then debated and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted by the different factions and each one voted on separately The Order of Business can be and usually is smashed to pieces in the first half hour On the plea of emergency which the crowd almost always grants anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on any subject The crowd controls the meeting practically the only functions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a little bell and to recognise speakers Almost all the real work of the session is done in caucuses of the different groups and political factions which almost always cast their votes in a body and are represented by floor leaders The result is however that at every important new point or vote the session takes a recess to enable the different groups and political factions to hold a caucus The crowd is extremely noisy cheering or heckling speakers over riding the plans of the presidium Among the customary cries are Prosim Please Go on Pravilno or Eto vierno That s true Right Do volno Enough Doloi Down with him Posor Shame and Teesche Silence Not so noisy Popular Organisations one Soviet The word soviet means council Under the Tsar the Imperial Council of State was called Gosudarstvennyi Soviet Since the Revolution however the term Soviet has come to be associated with a certain type of parliament elected by members of working class economic organisations the Soviet of Workers of Soldiers or of Peasants Deputies I have therefore limited the word to these bodies and wherever else it occurs I have translated it Council Besides the local Soviets elected in every city town and village of Russia and in large cities also Ward Raionny Soviets there are also the oblastne or gubiernsky district or provincial Soviets and the Central Executive Committee of the All Russian Soviets in the capital called from its initials Tsay ee kah See below Central Committees Almost everywhere the Soviets of Workers and of Soldiers Deputies combined very soon after the March Revolution In special matters concerning their peculiar interests however the Workers and the Soldiers Sections continued to meet separately The Soviets of Peasants Deputies did not join the other two until after the Bolshevik coup d etat They too were organised like the workers and soldiers with an Executive Committee of the All Russian Peasants Soviets in the capital two Trade Unions Although mostly industrial in form the Russian labour unions were still called Trade Unions and at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution had from three to four million members These Unions were also organised in an All Russian body a sort of Russian Federation of Labour which had its Central Executive Committee in the capital three Factory Shop Committees These were spontaneous organisations created in the factories by the workers in their attempt to control industry taking advantage of the administrative break down incident upon the Revolution Their function was by revolutionary action to take over and run the factories The Factory Shop Committees also had their All Russian organisation with a Central Committee at Petrograd which company operated with the Trade Unions four Dumas The word duma means roughly deliberative body The old Imperial Duma which persisted six months after the Revolution in a democratised form died a natural death in September nineteen seventeen The City Duma referred to in this book was the reorganised Municipal Council often called Municipal Self Government It was elected by direct and secret ballot and its only reason for failure to hold the masses during the Bolshevik Revolution was the general decline in influence of all purely political representation in the fact of the growing power of organisations based on economic groups five Zemstvos May be roughly translated county councils Under the Tsar semi political semi social bodies with very little administrative power developed and controlled largely by intellectual Liberals among the land owning classes Their most important function was education and social service among the peasants During the war the Zemstvos gradually took over the entire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army as well as the buying from foreign countries and work among the soldiers generally corresponding to the work of the American Y M C A at the Front After the March Revolution the Zemstvos were democratized with a view to making them the organs of local government in the rural districts But like the City Dumas they could not compete with the Soviets six Cooperatives These were the workers and peasants Consumers Cooperative societies which had several million members all over Russia before the Revolution Founded by Liberals and moderate Socialists the Cooperative movement was not supported by the revolutionary Socialist groups because it was a substitute for the complete transference of means of production and distribution into the hands of the workers After the March Revolution the Cooperatives spread rapidly and were dominated by Populist Socialists Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries and acted as a conservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution However it was the Cooperatives which fed Russia when the old structure of commerce and transportation collapsed seven Army Committees The Army Committees were formed by the soldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the old regime officers Every company regiment brigade division and corps had its committee over all of which was elected the Army Committee The Central Army Committee cooperated with the General Staff The administrative break down in the army incident upon the Revolution threw upon the shoulders of the Army Committees most of the work of the Quartermaster s Department and in some cases even the command of troops eight Fleet Committees The corresponding organisations in the Navy Central Committees In the spring and summer of nineteen seventeen All Russian conventions of every sort of organisation were held at Petrograd There were national congresses of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Soviets Trade Unions Factory Shop Committees Army and Fleet Committees besides every branch of the military and naval service Cooperatives Nationalities et cetera Each of these conventions elected a Central Committee or a Central Executive Committee to guard its particular interests at the seat of Government As the Provisional Government grew weaker these Central Committees were forced to assume more and more administrative powers The most important Central Committees mentioned in this book are Union of Unions During the Revolution of nineteen oh five Professor Miliukov and other Liberals established unions of professional men doctors lawyers physicians et cetera These were united under one central organisation the Union of Unions In nineteen oh five the Union of Unions acted with the revolutionary democracy in nineteen seventeen however the Union of Unions opposed the Bolshevik uprising and united the Government employees who went on strike against the authority of the Soviets Tsay ee kah All Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies So called from the initials of its name Tsentroflot Centre Fleet the Central Fleet Committee Vikzhel All Russian Central Committee of the Railway Workers Union So called from the initials of its name Other Organisations Red Guards The armed factory workers of Russia The Red Guards were first formed during the Revolution of nineteen oh five and sprang into existence again in the days of March nineteen seventeen when a force was needed to keep order in the city At that time they were armed and all efforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more or less unsuccessful At every great crisis in the Revolution the Red Guards appeared on the streets untrained and undisciplined but full of Revolutionary zeal White Guards Bourgeois volunteers who emerged in the last stages of the Revolution to defend private property from the Bolshevik attempt to abolish it A great many of them were University students Tekhintsi The so called Savage Division in the army made up of Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia and personally devoted to General Kornilov The Tekhintsi were noted for their blind obedience and their savage cruelty in warfare Death Battalions Or Shock Battalions The Women s Battalion is known to the world as the Death Battalion but there were many Death Battalions composed of men These were formed in the summer of nineteen seventeen by Kerensky for the purpose of strengthening the discipline and combative fire of the army by heroic example The Death Battalions were composed mostly of intense young patriots These came for the most part from among the sons of the propertied classes Union of Officers An organisation formed among the reactionary officers in the army to combat politically the growing power of the Army Committees Knights of saint George The Cross of saint George was awarded for distinguished action in battle Its holder automatically became a Knight of saint George The predominant influence in the organisation was that of the supporters of the military idea Peasants Union In nineteen oh five the Peasants Union was a revolutionary peasants organisation In nineteen seventeen however it had become the political expression of the more prosperous peasants to fight the growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants Deputies Chronology and Spelling I have adopted in this book our Calendar throughout instead of the former Russian Calendar which was thirteen days earlier In the spelling of Russian names and words I have made no attempt to follow any scientific rules for transliteration but have tried to give the spelling which would lead the English speaking reader to the simplest approximation of their pronunciation Sources Much of the material in this book is from my own notes I have also relied however upon a heterogeneous file of several hundred assorted Russian newspapers covering almost every day of the time described of files of the English paper the Russian Daily News and of the two French papers Journal de Russie and Entente But far more valuable than these is the Bulletin de la Presse issued daily by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd which reports all important happenings speeches and the comment of the Russian press Of this I have an almost complete file from the spring of nineteen seventeen to the end of January nineteen eighteen Besides the foregoing I have in my possession almost every proclamation decree and announcement posted on the walls of Petrograd from the middle of September nineteen seventeen to the end of January nineteen eighteen Also the official publication of all Government decrees and orders and the official Government publication of the secret treaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when the Bolsheviki took it over Ten Days That Shook The World Chapter I Background Toward the end of September nineteen seventeen an alien Professor of Sociology visiting Russia came to see me in Petrograd He had been informed by business men and intellectuals that the Revolution was slowing down The Professor wrote an article about it and then travelled around the country visiting factory towns and peasant communities where to his astonishment the Revolution seemed to be speeding up Among the wage earners and the land working people it was common to hear talk of all land to the peasants all factories to the workers If the Professor had visited the front he would have heard the whole Army talking Peace The Professor was puzzled but he need not have been both observations were correct The property owning classes were becoming more conservative the masses of the people more radical There was a feeling among business men and the intelligentzia generally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough and lasted too long that things should settle down This sentiment was shared by the dominant moderate Socialist groups the oborontsi See App I Sect one Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries who supported the Provisional Government of Kerensky On October fourteenth the official organ of the moderate Socialists said The drama of Revolution has two acts the destruction of the old regime and the creation of the new one The first act has lasted long enough Now it is time to go on to the second and to play it as rapidly as possible As a great revolutionist put it Let us hasten friends to terminate the Revolution He who makes it last too long will not gather the fruits Among the worker soldier and peasant masses however there was a stubborn feeling that the first act was not yet played out On the front the Army Committees were always running foul of officers who could not get used to treating their men like human beings in the rear the Land Committees elected by the peasants were being jailed for trying to carry out Government regulations concerning the land and the workmen See App I Sect two in the factories were fighting black lists and lockouts Nay furthermore returning political exiles were being excluded from the country as undesirable citizens and in some cases men who returned from abroad to their villages were prosecuted and imprisoned for revolutionary acts committed in nineteen oh five To the multiform discontent of the people the moderate Socialists had one answer Wait for the Constituent Assembly which is to meet in December But the masses were not satisfied with that The Constituent Assembly was all well and good but there were certain definite things for which the Russian Revolution had been made and for which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark Brotherhood Grave on Mars Field that must be achieved Constituent Assembly or no Constituent Assembly Peace Land and Workers Control of Industry The Constituent Assembly had been postponed and postponed would probably be postponed again until the people were calm enough perhaps to modify their demands At any rate here were eight months of the Revolution gone and little enough to show for it Meanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by simply deserting the peasants burned manor houses and took over the great estates the workers sabotaged and struck

none	none	as was natural the manufacturers land owners and army officers exerted all their influence against any democratic compromise The policy of the Provisional Government alternated between ineffective reforms and stern repressive measures An edict from the Socialist Minister of Labour ordered all the Workers Committees henceforth to meet only after working hours Among the troops at the front agitators of opposition political parties were arrested radical newspapers closed down and capital punishment applied to revolutionary propagandists Attempts were made to disarm the Red Guard Cossacks were sent to keep order in the provinces These measures were supported by the moderate Socialists and their leaders in the Ministry who considered it necessary to cooperate with the propertied classes The people rapidly deserted them and went over to the Bolsheviki who stood for Peace Land and Workers Control of Industry and a Government of the working class In September nineteen seventeen matters reached a crisis Against the overwhelming sentiment of the country Kerensky and the moderate Socialists succeeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with the propertied classes and as a result the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries lost the confidence of the people forever An article in Rabotchi Put Workers Way about the middle of October entitled The Socialist Ministers expressed the feeling of the masses of the people against the moderate Socialists Here is a list of their services See App I Sect three Tseretelli disarmed the workmen with the assistance of General Polovtsev checkmated the revolutionary soldiers and approved of capital punishment in the army Skobeliev commenced by trying to tax the capitalists one hundred of their profits and finished and finished by an attempt to dissolve the Workers Committees in the shops and factories Avksentiev put several hundred peasants in prison members of the Land Committees and suppressed dozens of workers and soldiers newspapers Tchernov signed the Imperial manifest ordering the dissolution of the Finnish Diet Savinkov concluded an open alliance with General Kornilov If this saviour of the country was not able to betray Petrograd it was due to reasons over which he had no control Zarudny with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky put some of the best workers of the Revolution soldiers and sailors in prison Nikitin acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway Workers Kerensky it is better not to say anything about him The list of his services is too long A Congress of delegates of the Baltic Fleet at Helsingfors passed a resolution which began as follows We demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the Provisional Government of the Socialist the political adventurer Kerensky as one who is scandalising and ruining the great Revolution and with it the revolutionary masses by his shameless political blackmail on behalf of the bourgeoisie The direct result of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki Since March nineteen seventeen when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers beating upon the Tauride Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Duma to assume the supreme power in Russia it was the masses of the people workers soldiers and peasants which forced every change in the course of the Revolution They hurled the Miliukov Ministry down it was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world the Russian peace terms No annexations no indemnities and the right of self determination of peoples and again in July it was the spontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once more stormed the Tauride Palace to demand that the Soviets take over the Government of Russia The Bolsheviki then a small political sect put themselves at the head of the movement As a result of the disastrous failure of the rising public opinion turned against them and their leaderless hordes slunk back into the Viborg Quarter which is Petrograd s St Antoine Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki hundreds were imprisoned among them Trotzky Madame Kollontai and Kameniev Lenin and Zinoviev went into hiding fugitives from justice the Bolshevik papers were suppressed Provocators and reactionaries raised the cry that the Bolsheviki were German agents until people all over the world believed it But the Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiate its accusations the documents proving pro German conspiracy were discovered to be forgeries one and one by one the Bolsheviki were released from prison without trial on nominal or no bail until only six remained The impotence and indecision of the ever changing Provisional Government was an argument nobody could refute The Bolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses All Power to the Soviets and they were not merely self seeking for at that time the majority of the Soviets was moderate Socialist their bitter enemy one Part of the famous Sisson Documents But more potent still they took the crude simple desires of the workers soldiers and peasants and from them built their immediate programme And so while the oborontsi Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with the bourgeoisie the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses In July they were hunted and despised by September the metropolitan workmen the sailors of the Baltic Fleet and the soldiers had been won almost entirely to their cause The September municipal elections in the large cities See App I Sect four were significant only eighteen per cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary against more than seventy per cent in June There remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers the fact that the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets the Central Army and Fleet Committees two and the Central Committees of some of the Unions notably the Post and Telegraph Workers and the Railway Workers opposed the Bolsheviki with the utmost violence These Central Committees had all been elected in the middle of the summer or even before when the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries had an enormous following and they delayed or prevented any new elections Thus according to the constitution of the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies the All Russian Congress should have been called in September but the Tsay ee kah two would not call the meeting on the ground that the Constituent Assembly was only two months away at which time they hinted the Soviets would abdicate Meanwhile one by one the Bolsheviki were winning in the local Soviets all over the country in the Union branches and the ranks of the soldiers and sailors The Peasants Soviets remained still conservative because in the sluggish rural districts political consciousness developed slowly and the Socialist Revolutionary party had been for a generation the party which had agitated among the peasants But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was forming It showed itself clearly in October when the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionaries split off and formed a new political faction the Left Socialist Revolutionaries two See Notes and Explanations At the same time there were signs everywhere that the forces of reaction were gaining confidence See App I Sect five At the Troitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd for example a burlesque called Sins of the Tsar was interrupted by a group of Monarchists who threatened to lynch the actors for insulting the Emperor Certain newspapers began to sigh for a Russian Napoleon It was the usual thing among bourgeois intelligentzia to refer to the Soviets of Workers Deputies Rabotchikh Deputatov as Sabatchikh Deputatov Dogs Deputies On October fifteenth I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist Stepan Georgevitch Lianozov known as the Russian Rockefeller a Cadet by political faith Revolution he said is a sickness Sooner or later the foreign powers must intervene here as one would intervene to cure a sick child and teach it how to walk Of course it would be more or less improper but the nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism in their own countries such contagious ideas as proletarian dictatorship and world social revolution There is a chance that this intervention may not be necessary Transportation is demoralised the factories are closing down and the Germans are advancing Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian people to their senses mister Lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened it would be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit the existence of the workers Shop Committees or to allow the workers any share in the management of industry As for the Bolsheviki they will be done away with by one of two methods The Government can evacuate Petrograd then a state of siege declared and the military commander of the district can deal with these gentlemen without legal formalities Or if for example the Constituent Assembly manifests any Utopian tendencies it can be dispersed by force of arms Winter was coming on the terrible Russian winter I heard business men speak of it so Winter was always Russia s best friend Perhaps now it will rid us of Revolution On the freezing front miserable armies continued to starve and die without enthusiasm The railways were breaking down food lessening factories closing The desperate masses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of the people causing defeat on the Front Riga had been surrendered just after General Kornilov said publicly Must we pay with Riga the price of bringing the country to a sense of its duty three three See Kornilov to Brest Litovsk by John Reed Boni and Liveright N Y nineteen nineteen To Americans it is incredible that the class war should develop to such a pitch But I have personally met officers on the Northern Front who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with the Soldiers Committees The secretary of the Petrograd branch of the Cadet party told me that the break down of the country s economic life was part of a campaign to discredit the Revolution An Allied diplomat whose name I promised not to mention confirmed this from his own knowledge I know of certain coal mines near Kharkov which were fired and flooded by their owners of textile factories at Moscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they left of railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of crippling locomotives A large section of the propertied classes preferred the Germans to the Revolution even to the Provisional Government and didn t hesitate to say so In the Russian household where I lived the subject of conversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming of the Germans bringing law and order One evening I spent at the house of a Moscow merchant during tea we asked the eleven people at the table whether they preferred Wilhelm or the Bolsheviki The vote was ten to one for Wilhelm The speculators took advantage of the universal disorganisation to pile up fortunes and to spend them in fantastic revelry or the corruption of Government officials Foodstuffs and fuel were hoarded or secretly sent out of the country to Sweden In the first four months of the Revolution for example the reserve food supplies were almost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses of Petrograd until the two years provision of grain had fallen to less than enough to feed the city for one month According to the official report of the last Minister of Supplies in the Provisional Government coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two rubles a pound and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen In all the stores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing but only the rich could buy them In a provincial town I knew a merchant family turned speculator maradior bandit ghoul the Russians call it The three sons had bribed their way out of military service One gambled in foodstuffs Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines to mysterious parties in Finland The third owned a controlling interest in a chocolate factory which supplied the local Cooperative societies on condition that the Cooperatives furnished him everything he needed And so while the masses of the people got a quarter pound of black

none	none	on their bread cards he had an abundance of white bread sugar tea candy cake and butter Yet when the soldiers at the front could no longer fight from cold hunger and exhaustion how indignantly did this family scream Cowards how ashamed they were to be Russians When finally the Bolsheviki found and requisitioned vast hoarded stores of provisions what Robbers they were Beneath all this external rottenness moved the old time Dark Forces unchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second secret still and very active The agents of the notorious Okhrana still functioned for and against the Tsar for and against Kerensky whoever would pay In the darkness underground organisations of all sorts such as the Black Hundreds were busy attempting to restore reaction in some form or other In this atmosphere of corruption of monstrous half truths one clear note sounded day after day the deepening chorus of the Bolsheviki All Power to the Soviets All power to the direct representatives of millions on millions of common workers soldiers peasants Land bread an end to the senseless war an end to secret diplomacy speculation treachery The Revolution is in danger and with it the cause of the people all over the world The struggle between the proletariat and the middle class between the Soviets and the Government which had begun in the first March days was about to culminate Having at one bound leaped from the Middle Ages into the twentieth century Russia showed the startled world two systems of Revolution the political and the social in mortal combat What a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution after all these months of starvation and disillusionment The bourgeoisie should have better known its Russia Not for a long time in Russia will the sickness of Revolution have run its course Looking back Russia before the November insurrection seems of another age almost incredibly conservative So quickly did we adapt ourselves to the newer swifter life just as Russian politics swung bodily to the Left until the Cadets were outlawed as enemies of the people Kerensky became a counter revolutionist the middle Socialist leaders Tseretelli Dan Lieber Gotz and Avksentiev were too reactionary for their following and men like Victor Tchernov and even Maxim Gorky belonged to the Right Wing About the middle of December nineteen seventeen a group of Socialist Revolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George Buchanan the British Ambassador and implored him not to mention the fact that they had been there because they were considered too far Right And to think said Sir George One year ago my Government instructed me not to receive Miliukov because he was so dangerously Left September and October are the worst months of the Russian year especially the Petrograd year Under dull grey skies in the shortening days the rain fell drenching incessant The mud underfoot was deep slippery and clinging tracked everywhere by heavy boots and worse than usual because of the complete break down of the Municipal administration Bitter damp winds rushed in from the Gulf of Finland and the chill fog rolled through the streets At night for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins the street lights were few and far between in private dwellings and apartment houses the electricity was turned on from six o clock until midnight with candles forty cents apiece and little kerosene to be had It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten in the morning Robberies and housebreakings increased In apartment houses the men took turns at all night guard duty armed with loaded rifles This was under the Provisional Government Week by week food became scarcer The daily allowance of bread fell from a pound and a half to a pound then three quarters half and a quarter pound Toward the end there was a week without any bread at all Sugar one was entitled to at the rate of two pounds a month if one could get it at all which was seldom A bar of chocolate or a pound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten rubles at least a dollar There was milk for about half the babies in the city most hotels and private houses never saw it for months In the fruit season apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on the street corner For milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one had to stand in queue long hours in the chill rain Coming home from an all night meeting I have seen the kvost tail beginning to form before dawn mostly women some with babies in their arms Carlyle in his French Revolution has described the French people as distinguished above all others by their faculty of standing in queue Russia had accustomed herself to the practice begun in the reign of Nicholas the Blessed as long ago as nineteen fifteen and from then continued intermittently until the summer of nineteen seventeen when it settled down as the regular order of things Think of the poorly clad people standing on the iron white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian winter I have listened in the bread lines hearing the bitter acrid note of discontent which from time to time burst up through the miraculous goodnature of the Russian crowd Of course all the theatres were going every night including Sundays Karsavina appeared in a new Ballet at the Marinsky all dance loving Russia coming to see her Shaliapin was singing At the Alexandrinsky they were reviving Meyerhold s production of Tolstoy s Death of Ivan the Terrible and at that performance I remember noticing a student of the Imperial School of Pages in his dress uniform who stood up correctly between the acts and faced the empty Imperial box with its eagles all erased The Krivoye Zerkalo staged a sumptuous version of Schnitzler s Reigen Although the Hermitage and other picture galleries had been evacuated to Moscow there were weekly exhibitions of paintings Hordes of the female intelligentzia went to hear lectures on Art Literature and the Easy Philosophies It was a particularly active season for Theosophists And the Salvation Army admitted to Russia for the first time in history plastered the walls with announcements of gospel meetings which amused and astounded Russian audiences As in all such times the petty conventional life of the city went on ignoring the Revolution as much as possible The poets made verses but not about the Revolution The realistic painters painted scenes from mediaeval Russian history anything but the Revolution Young ladies from the provinces came up to the capital to learn French and cultivate their voices and the gay young beautiful officers wore their gold trimmed crimson bashliki and their elaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies The ladies of the minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the afternoon carrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar box and half a loaf of bread in her muff and wished that the Tsar were back or that the Germans would come or anything that would solve the servant problem The daughter of a friend of mine came home one afternoon in hysterics because the woman street car conductor had called her Comrade All around them great Russia was in travail bearing a new world The servants one used to treat like animals and pay next to nothing were getting independent A pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles and as wages averaged about thirty five rubles a month the servants refused to stand in queue and wear out their shoes But more than that In the new Russia every man and woman could vote there were working class newspapers saying new and startling things there were the Soviets and there were the Unions The izvoshtchiki cab drivers had a Union they were also represented in the Petrograd Soviet The waiters and hotel servants were organised and refused tips On the walls of restaurants they put up signs which read No tips taken here or Just because a man has to make his living waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him a tip At the Front the soldiers fought out their fight with the officers and learned self government through their committees In the factories those unique Russian organisations the Factory Shop Committees four gained experience and strength and a realisation of their historical mission by combat with the old order All Russia was learning to read and reading politics economics history because the people wanted to know In every city in most towns along the Front each political faction had its newspaper sometimes several Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands of organisations and poured into the armies the villages the factories the streets The thirst for education so long thwarted burst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression From Smolny Institute alone the first six months went out every day tons car loads train loads of literature saturating the land Russia absorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water insatiable And it was not fables falsified history diluted religion and the cheap fiction that corrupts but social and economic theories philosophy the works of Tolstoy Gogol and Gorky four See Notes and Explanations Then the Talk beside which Carlyle s flood of French speech was a mere trickle Lectures debates speeches in theatres circuses school houses clubs Soviet meeting rooms Union headquarters barracks Meetings in the trenches at the Front in village squares factories What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky Zavod the Putilov factory pour out its forty thousand to listen to Social Democrats Socialist Revolutionaries Anarchists anybody whatever they had to say as long as they would talk For months in Petrograd and all over Russia every street corner was a public tribune In railway trains street cars always the spurting up of impromptu debate everywhere And the All Russian Conferences and Congresses drawing together the men of two continents conventions of Soviets of Cooperatives Zemstvos five nationalities priests peasants political parties the Democratic Conference the Moscow Conference the Council of the Russian Republic There were always three or four conventions going on in Petrograd At every meeting attempts to limit the time of speakers voted down and every man free to express the thought that was in him five See Notes and Explanations We came down to the front of the Twelfth Army back of Riga where gaunt and bootless men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches and when they saw us they started up with their pinched faces and the flesh showing blue through their torn clothing demanding eagerly Did you bring anything to read What though the outward and visible signs of change were many what though the statue of Catharine the Great before the Alexandrinsky Theatre bore a little red flag in its hand and others somewhat faded floated from all public buildings and the Imperial monograms and eagles were either torn down or covered up and in place of the fierce gorodovoye city police a mild mannered and unarmed citizen militia patrolled the streets still there were many quaint anachronisms For example Peter the Great s Tabel o Rangov Table of Ranks which he rivetted upon Russia with an iron hand still held sway Almost everybody from the school boy up wore his prescribed uniform with the insignia of the Emperor on button and shoulder strap Along about five o clock in the afternoon the streets were full of subdued old gentlemen in uniform with portfolios going home from work in the huge barrack like Ministries or Government institutions calculating perhaps how great a mortality among their superiors would advance them to the coveted tchin rank of Collegiate Assessor or Privy Councillor with the prospect of retirement on a comfortable pension and possibly the Cross of saint Anne There is the story of Senator Sokolov who in full tide of Revolution came to a meeting of the Senate one day in civilian clothes and was not admitted because he did not wear the prescribed livery of the Tsar s service It was against this background of a whole nation in ferment and disintegration that the pageant of the Rising of the Russian Masses unrolled Chapter II The Coming Storm In September General Kornilov marched on Petrograd to make himself military dictator of Russia Behind him was suddenly revealed the mailed fist of the bourgeoisie boldly attempting to crush the Revolution Some of the Socialist Ministers were implicated even Kerensky was under suspicion See App II Sect one Savinkov summoned to explain to the Central Committee of his party the Socialist Revolutionaries refused and was expelled Kornilov was arrested by the Soldiers Committees Generals were dismissed Ministers suspended from their functions and the Cabinet fell Kerensky tried to form a new Government including the Cadets party of the bourgeoisie His party the Socialist Revolutionaries ordered him to exclude the Cadets Kerensky declined to obey and threatened to resign from the Cabinet if the Socialists insisted However popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did not dare oppose it and a temporary Directorate of Five of the old Ministers with Kerensky at the head assumed the power until the question should be settled The Kornilov affair drew together all the Socialist groups moderates as well as revolutionists in a passionate impulse of self defence There must be no more Kornilovs A new Government must be created responsible to the elements supporting the Revolution So the Tsay ee kah invited the popular organisations to send delegates to a Democratic Conference which should meet at Petrograd in September In the Tsay ee kah three factions immediately appeared The Bolsheviki demanded that the All Russian Congress of Soviets be summoned and that they take over the power The centre Socialist Revolutionaries led by Tchernov joined with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries led by Kamkov and Spiridonova the Mensheviki Internationalists under Martov and the centre Mensheviki six represented by Bogdanov and Skobeliev in demanding a purely Socialist Government Tseretelli Dan and Lieber at the head of the right wing Mensheviki and the right Socialist Revolutionaries under Avksentiev and Gotz insisted that the propertied classes must be represented in the new Government six See Notes and Explanations Almost immediately the Bolsheviki won a majority in the Petrograd Soviet and the Soviets of Moscow Kiev Odessa and other cities followed suit Alarmed the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries in control of the Tsay ee kah decided that after all they feared the danger of Kornilov less than the danger of Lenin They revised the plan of representation in the Democratic Conference See App II Sect two admitting more delegates from the Cooperative Societies and other conservative bodies Even this packed assembly at first voted for a Coalition Government without the Cadets Only Kerensky s open threat of resignation and the alarming cries of the moderate Socialists that the Republic is in danger persuaded the Conference by a small majority to declare in favour of the principle of coalition with the bourgeoisie and to sanction the establishment of a sort of consultative Parliament without any legislative power called the Provisional Council of the Russian Republic In the new Ministry the propertied classes practically controlled and in the Council of the Russian Republic they occupied a disproportionate number of seats The fact is that the Tsay ee kah no longer represented the rank and file of the Soviets and had illegally refused to call another All Russian Congress of Soviets due in September It had no intention of calling this Congress or of allowing it to be called Its official organ Izviestia News began to hint that the function of the Soviets was nearly at an end See App II Sect three and that they might soon be dissolved At this time too the new Government announced as part of its policy the liquidation of irresponsible organisations i e the Soviets The Bolsheviki responded by summoning the All Russian Soviets to meet at Petrograd on November two and take over the Government of Russia At the same time they withdrew from the Council of the Russian Republic stating that they would not participate in a Government of Treason to the People See App II Sect four The withdrawal of the Bolsheviki however did not bring tranquillity to the ill fated Council The propertied classes now in a position of power became arrogant The Cadets declared that the Government had no legal right to declare Russia a republic They demanded stern measures in the Army and Navy to destroy the Soldiers and Sailors Committees and denounced the Soviets On the other side of the chamber the Mensheviki Internationalists and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries advocated immediate peace land to the peasants and workers control of industry practically the Bolshevik programme I heard Martov s speech in answer to the Cadets Stooped over the desk of the tribune like the mortally sick man he was and speaking in a voice so hoarse it could hardly be heard he shook his finger toward the right benches You call us defeatists but the real defeatists are those who wait for a more propitious moment to conclude peace insist upon postponing peace until later until nothing is left of the Russian army until Russia becomes the subject of bargaining between the different imperialist groups You are trying to impose upon the Russian people a policy dictated by the interests of the bourgeoisie The question of peace should be raised without delay You will see then that not in vain has been the work of those whom you call German agents of those Zimmerwaldists seven who in all the lands have prepared the awakening of the conscience of the democratic masses seven Members of the revoloutionary internationalist wing of the Socialists of Europe so called because of their participation in the International Conference held at Zimmerwald Switzerland in nineteen fifteen Between these two groups the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries wavered irresistibly forced to the left by the pressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses Deep hostility divided the chamber into irreconcilable groups This was the situation when the long awaited announcement of the Allied Conference in Paris brought up the burning question of foreign policy Theoretically all Socialist parties in Russia were in favour of the earliest possible peace on democratic terms As long ago as May nineteen seventeen the Petrograd Soviet then under control of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries had proclaimed the famous Russian peace conditions They had demanded that the Allies hold a conference to discuss war aims This conference had been promised for August then postponed until September then until October and now it was fixed for November tenth The Provisional Government suggested two representatives General Alexeyev reactionary military man and Terestchenko Minister of Foreign Affairs The Soviets chose Skobeliev to speak for them and drew up a manifesto the famous nakaz See App II Sect five instructions The Provisional Government objected to Skobeliev and his nakaz the Allied ambassadors protested and finally Bonar Law in the British House of Commons in answer to a question responded coldly As far as I know the Paris Conference will not discuss the aims of the war at all but only the methods of conducting it At this the conservative Russian press was jubilant and the Bolsheviki cried See where the compromising tactics of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries have led them Along a thousand miles of front the millions of men in Russia s armies stirred like the sea rising pouring into the capital their hundreds upon hundreds of delegations crying Peace Peace I went across the river to the Cirque Moderne to one of the great popular meetings which occurred all over the city more numerous night after night The bare gloomy amphitheatre lit by five tiny lights hanging from a thin wire was packed from the ring up the steep sweep of grimy benches to the very roof soldiers sailors workmen women all listening as if their lives depended upon it A soldier was speaking from the Five Hundred and Forty eight Division wherever and whatever that was

none	none	he cried and there was real anguish in his drawn face and despairing gestures The people at the top are always calling upon us to sacrifice more sacrifice more while those who have everything are left unmolested We are at war with Germany Would we invite German generals to serve on our Staff Well we re at war with the capitalists too and yet we invite them into our Government The soldier says Show me what I am fighting for Is it Constantinople or is it free Russia Is it the democracy or is it the capitalist plunderers If you can prove to me that I am defending the Revolution then I ll go out and fight without capital punishment to force me When the land belongs to the peasants and the factories to the workers and the power to the Soviets then we ll know we have something to fight for and we ll fight for it In the barracks the factories on the street corners end less soldier speakers all clamouring for an end to the war declaring that if the Government did not make an energetic effort to get peace the army would leave the trenches and go home The spokesman for the Eighth Army We are weak we have only a few men left in each company They must give us food and boots and reinforcements or soon there will be left only empty trenches Peace or supplies either let the Government end the war or support the Army For the Forty sixth Siberian Artillery The officers will not work with our Committees they betray us to the enemy they apply the death penalty to our agitators and the counter revolutionary Government supports them We thought that the Revolution would bring peace But now the Government forbids us even to talk of such things and at the same time doesn t give us enough food to live on or enough ammunition to fight with From Europe came rumours of peace at the expense of Russia See App II Sect six News of the treatment of Russian troops in France added to the discontent The First Brigade had tried to replace its officers with Soldiers Committees like their comrades at home and had refused an order to go to Salonika demanding to be sent to Russia They had been surrounded and starved and then fired on by artillery and many killed See App II Sect seven On October twenty ninth I went to the white marble and crimson hall of the Marinsky palace where the Council of the Republic sat to hear Terestchenko s declaration of the Government s foreign policy awaited with such terrible anxiety by all the peace thirsty and exhausted land A tall impeccably dressed young man with a smooth face and high cheek bones suavely reading his careful non committal speech See App II Sect eight Nothing Only the same platitudes about crushing German militarism with the help of the Allies about the state interests of Russia about the embarrassment caused by Skobeliev s nakaz He ended with the key note Russia is a great power Russia will remain a great power whatever happens We must all defend her we must show that we are defenders of a great ideal and children of a great power Nobody was satisfied The reactionaries wanted a strong imperialist policy the democratic parties wanted an assurance that the Government would press for peace I reproduce an editorial in Rabotchi i Soldat Worker and Soldier organ of the Bolshevik Petrograd Soviet THE GOVERNMENT S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHES The most taciturn of our Ministers mister Terestchenko has actually told the trenches the following one We are closely united with our Allies Not with the peoples but with the Governments two There is no use for the democracy to discuss the possibility or impossibility of a winter campaign That will be decided by the Governments of our Allies three The first of July offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair He did not mention the consequences four It is not true that our Allies do not care about us The Minister has in his possession very important declarations Declarations What about deeds What about the behaviour of the British fleet See App II Sect nine The parleying of the British king with exiled counter revolutionary General Gurko The Minister did not mention all this five The nakaz to Skobeliev is bad the Allies don t like it and the Russian diplomats don t like it In the Allied Conference we must all speak one language And is that all That is all What is the way out The solution is faith in the Allies and in Terestchenko When will peace come When the Allies permit That is how the Government replied to the trenches about peace Now in the background of Russian politics began to form the vague outlines of a sinister power the Cossacks Novaya Zhizn New Life Gorky s paper called attention to their activities At the beginning of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to shoot down the people When Kornilov marched on Petrograd they refused to follow him From passive loyalty to the Revolution the Cossacks have passed to an active political offensive against it From the back ground of the Revolution they have suddenly advanced to the front of the stage Kaledin ataman of the Don Cossacks had been dismissed by the Provisional Government for his complicity in the Kornilov affair He flatly refused to resign and surrounded by three immense Cossack armies lay at Novotcherkask plotting and menacing So great was his power that the Government was forced to ignore his insubordination More than that it was compelled formally to recognise the Council of the Union of Cossack Armies and to declare illegal the newly formed Cossack Section of the Soviets In the first part of October a Cossack delegation called upon Kerensky arrogantly insisting that the charges against Kaledin be dropped and reproaching the Minister President for yielding to the Soviets Kerensky agreed to let Kaledin alone and then is reported to have said In the eyes of the Soviet leaders I am a despot and a tyrant As for the Provisional Government not only does it not depend upon the Soviets but it considers it regrettable that they exist at all At the same time another Cossack mission called upon the British ambassador treating with him boldly as representatives of the free Cossack people In the Don something very like a Cossack Republic had been established The Kuban declared itself an independent Cossack State The Soviets of Rostov on Don and Yekaterinburg were dispersed by armed Cossacks and the headquarters of the Coal Miners Union at Kharkov raided In all its manifestations the Cossack movement was anti Socialist and militaristic Its leaders were nobles and great land owners like Kaledin Kornilov Generals Dutov Karaulov and Bardizhe and it was backed by the powerful merchants and bankers of Moscow Old Russia was rapidly breaking up In Ukraine in Finland Poland White Russia the nationalist movements gathered strength and became bolder The local Governments controlled by the propertied classes claimed autonomy refusing to obey orders from Petrograd At Helsingfors the Finnish Senate declined to loan money to the Provisional Government declared Finland autonomous and demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops The bourgeois Rada at Kiev extended the boundaries of Ukraine until they included all the richest agricultural lands of South Russia as far east as the Urals and began the formation of a national army Premier Vinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with Germany and the Provisional Government was helpless Siberia the Caucasus demanded separate Constituent Assemblies And in all these countries there was the beginning of a bitter struggle between the authorities and the local Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Conditions were daily more chaotic Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were deserting the front and beginning to move in vast aimless tides over the face of the land The peasants of Tambov and Tver Governments tired of waiting for the land exasperated by the repressive measures of the Government were burning manor houses and massacring land owners Immense strikes and lock outs convulsed Moscow Odessa and the coal mines of the Don Transportation was paralysed the army was starving and in the big cities there was no bread The Government torn between the democratic and reactionary factions could do nothing when forced to act it always supported the interests of the propertied classes Cossacks were sent to restore order among the peasants to break the strikes In Tashkent Government authorities suppressed the Soviet In Petrograd the Economic Council established to rebuild the shattered economic life of the country came to a deadlock between the opposing forces of capital and labour and was dissolved by Kerensky The old regime military men backed by Cadets demanded that harsh measures be adopted to restore discipline in the Army and the Navy In vain Admiral Verderevsky the venerable Minister of Marine and General Verkhovsky Minister of War insisted that only a new voluntary democratic discipline based on cooperation with the soldiers and sailors Committees could save the army and navy Their recommendations were ignored The reactionaries seemed determined to provoke popular anger The trial of Kornilov was coming on More and more openly the bourgeois press defended him speaking of him as the great Russian patriot Burtzev s paper Obshtchee Dielo Common Cause called for a dictatorship of Kornilov Kaledin and Kerensky I had a talk with Burtzev one day in the press gallery of the Council of the Republic A small stooped figure with a wrinkled face eyes near sighted behind thick glasses untidy hair and beard streaked with grey Mark my words young man What Russia needs is a Strong Man We should get our minds off the Revolution now and concentrate on the Germans Bunglers bunglers to defeat Kornilov and back of the bunglers are the German agents Kornilov should have won On the extreme right the organs of the scarcely veiled Monarchists Purishkevitch s Narodny Tribun People s Tribune Novaya Rus New Russia and Zhivoye Slovo Living Word openly advocated the extermination of the revolutionary democracy On the twenty third of October occurred the naval battle with a German squadron in the Gulf of Riga On the pretext that Petrograd was in danger the Provisional Government drew up plans for evacuating the capital First the great munitions works were to go distributed widely throughout Russia and then the Government itself was to move to Moscow Instantly the Bolsheviki began to cry out that the Government was abandoning the Red Capital in order to weaken the Revolution Riga had been sold to the Germans now Petrograd was being betrayed The bourgeois press was joyful At Moscow said the Cadet paper Ryetch Speech the Government can pursue its work in a tranquil atmosphere without being interfered with by anarchists Rodzianko leader of the right wing of the Cadet party declared in Utro Rossii The Morning of Russia that the taking of Petrograd by the Germans would be a blessing because it would destroy the Soviets and get rid of the revolutionary Baltic Fleet Petrograd is in danger he wrote I say to myself Let God take care of Petrograd They fear that if Petrograd is lost the central revolutionary organisations will be destroyed To that I answer that I rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed for they will bring nothing but disaster upon Russia With the taking of Petrograd the Baltic Fleet will also be destroyed But there will be nothing to regret most of the battleships are completely demoralised In the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan of evacuation was repudiated Meanwhile the Congress of Soviets loomed over Russia like a thunder cloud shot through with lightnings It was opposed not only by the Government but by all the moderate Socialists The Central Army and Fleet Committees the Central Committees of some of the Trade Unions the Peasants Soviets but most of all the Tsay ee kah itself spared no pains to prevent the meeting Izviestia and Golos Soldata Voice of the Soldier newspapers founded by the Petrograd Soviet but now in the hands of the Tsay ee kah fiercely assailed it as did the entire artillery of the Socialist Revolutionary party press Dielo Naroda People s Cause and Volia Naroda People s Will Delegates were sent through the country messages flashed by wire to committees in charge of local Soviets to Army Committees instructing them to halt or delay elections to the Congress Solemn public resolutions against the Congress declarations that the democracy was opposed to the meeting so near the date of the Constituent Assembly representatives from the Front from the Union of Zemstvos the Peasants Union Union of Cossack Armies Union of Officers Knights of saint George Death Battalions eight protesting The Council of the Russian Republic was one chorus of disapproval The entire machinery set up by the Russian Revolution of March functioned to block the Congress of Soviets eight See Notes and Explanations On the other hand was the shapeless will of the proletariat the workmen common soldiers and poor peasants Many local Soviets were already Bolshevik then there were the organisations of the industrial workers the Fabritchno Zavodskiye Comitieti Factory Shop Committees and the insurgent Army and Fleet organisations In some places the people prevented from electing their regular Soviet delegates held rump meetings and chose one of their number to go to Petrograd In others they smashed the old obstructionist committees and formed new ones A ground swell of revolt heaved and cracked the crust which had been slowly hardening on the surface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months Only an spontaneous mass movement could bring about the All Russian Congress of Soviets Day after day the Bolshevik orators toured the barracks and factories violently denouncing this Government of civil war One Sunday we went on a top heavy steam tram that lumbered through oceans of mud between stark factories and immense churches to Obukhovsky Zavod a Government munitions plant out on the Schluesselburg Prospekt The meeting took place between the gaunt brick walls of a huge unfinished building ten thousand black clothed men and women packed around a scaffolding draped in red people heaped on piles of lumber and bricks perched high upon shadowy girders intent and thunder voiced Through the dull heavy sky now and again burst the sun flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows upon the mass of simple faces upturned to us Lunatcharsky a slight student like figure with the sensitive face of an artist was telling why the power must be taken by the Soviets Nothing else could guarantee the Revolution against its enemies who were deliberately ruining the country ruining the army creating opportunities for a new Konilov A soldier from the Rumanian front thin tragical and fierce cried Comrades We are starving at the front we are stiff with cold We are dying for no reason I ask the American comrades to carry word to America that the Russians will never give up their Revolution until they die We will hold the fort with all our strength until the peoples of the world rise and help us Tell the American workers to rise and fight for the Social Revolution Then came Petrovsky slight slow voiced implacable Now is the time for deeds not words The economic situation is bad but we must get used to it They are trying to starve us and freeze us They are trying to provoke us But let them know that they can go too far that if they dare to lay their hands upon the organisations of the proletariat we will sweep them away like scum from the face of the earth The Bolshevik press suddenly expanded Besides the two party papers Rabotchi Put and Soldat Soldier there appeared a new paper for the peasants Derevenskaya Byednota Village Poorest poured out in a daily half million edition and on October seventeenth Rabotchi i Soldat Its leading article summed up the Bolshevik point of view The fourth year s campaign will mean the annihilation of the army and the country There is danger for the safety of Petrograd Counter revolutionists rejoice in the people s misfortunes The peasants brought to desperation come out in open rebellion the landlords and Government authorities massacre them with punitive expeditions factories and mines are closing down workmen are threatened with starvation The bourgeoisie and its Generals want to restore a blind discipline in the army Supported by the bourgeoisie the Kornilovtsi are openly getting ready to break up the meeting of the Constituent Assembly The Kerensky Government is against the people He will destroy the country This paper stands for the people and by the people the poor classes workers soldiers and peasants The people can only be saved by the completion of the Revolution and for this purpose the full power must be in the hands of the Soviets This paper advocates the following All power to the Soviets both in the capital and in the provinces Immediate truce on all fronts An honest peace between peoples Landlord estates without compensation to the peasants Workers control over industrial production A faithfully and honestly elected Constituent Assembly It is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that same paper the organ of those Bolsheviki so well known to the world as German agents The German kaiser covered with the blood of millions of dead people wants to push his army against Petrograd Let us call to the German workmen soldiers and peasants who want peace not less than we do to stand up against this damned war This can be done only by a revolutionary Government which would speak really for the workmen soldiers and peasants of Russia and would appeal over the heads of the diplomats directly to the German troops fill the German trenches with proclamations in the German language Our airmen would spread these proclamations all over Germany In the Council of the Republic the gulf between the two sides of the chamber deepened day by day The propertied classes cried Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries want to exploit the revolutionary machine of the State to bind Russia to the war chariot of the Allies The revolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy Old Nicholas Tchaikovsky representing the Populist Socialists spoke against giving the land to the peasants and took the side of the Cadets We must have immediately strong discipline in the army Since the beginning of the war I have not ceased to insist that it is a crime to undertake social and economic reforms in war time We are committing that crime and yet I am not the enemy of these reforms because I am a Socialist Cries from the Left We don t believe you Mighty applause from the Right Adzhemov for the Cadets declared that there was no necessity to tell the army what it was fighting for since every soldier ought to realise that the first task was to drive the enemy from Russian territory Kerensky himself came twice to plead passionately for national unity once bursting into tears at the end The assembly heard him coldly interrupting with ironical remarks Smolny Institute headquarters of the Tsay ee kah and of the Petrograd Soviet lay miles out on the edge of the city beside the wide Neva I went there on a street car moving snail like with a groaning noise through the cobbled muddy streets and jammed with people At the end of the line rose the graceful smoke blue cupolas of Smolny Convent outlined in dull gold beautiful and beside it the great barracks like facade of Smolny Institute two hundred yards long and three lofty stories high the Imperial arms carved hugely in stone still insolent over the entrance Under the old regime a famous convent school for the daughters of the Russian nobility patronised by the Tsarina herself the Institute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations of workers and soldiers Within were more than a hundred huge rooms white and bare on their doors enamelled plaques still informing the passerby that within was Ladies Class room Number four or Teachers Bureau but over these hung crudely lettered signs evidence of the vitality of the new order Central Committee of the Petrograd Soviet and Tsay ee kah and Bureau of Foreign Affairs Union of Socialist Soldiers Central Committee of the All Russian Trade Unions Factory Shop Committees Central Army Committee and the central offices and caucus rooms of the political parties The long vaulted corridors lit by rare electric lights were thronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen some bent under the weight of huge bundles of newspapers proclamations printed propaganda of all sorts The sound of their heavy boots made a deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor Signs were posted up everywhere Comrades For the sake of your health preserve cleanliness Long tables stood at the head of the stairs on every floor and on the landings heaped with pamphlets and the literature of the different political parties for sale The spacious low ceilinged refectory downstairs was still a dining room For two rubles I bought a ticket entitling me to dinner and stood in line with a thousand others waiting to get to the long serving tables where twenty men and women were ladling from immense cauldrons cabbage soup hunks of meat and piles of kasha slabs of black bread Five kopeks paid for tea in a tin cup From a basket one grabbed a greasy wooden spoon The benches along the wooden tables were packed with hungry proletarians wolfing their food plotting shouting rough jokes across the room Graphic page thirty three text of placard in russian translation follows COMRADES FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH PRESERVE CLEANLINESS Upstairs was another eating place reserved for the Tsay ee kah though every one went there Here could be had bread thickly buttered and endless glasses of tea In the south wing on the second floor was the great hall of meetings the former ball room of the Institute A lofty white room lighted by glazed white chandeliers holding hundreds of ornate electric bulbs and divided by two rows of massive columns at one end a dais flanked with two tall many branched light standards and a gold frame behind from which the Imperial portrait had been cut Here on festal occasions had been banked brilliant military and ecclesiastical uniforms a setting for Grand Duchesses Just across the hall outside was the office of the Credentials Committee for the Congress of Soviets I stood there watching the new delegates come in burly bearded soldiers workmen in black blouses a few long haired peasants The girl in charge a member of Plekhanov s Yedinstvo nine group smiled contemptuously These are very different people from the delegates to the first Siezd Congress she remarked See how rough and ignorant they look The Dark People It was true the depths of Russia had been stirred and it was the bottom which came uppermost now The Credentials Committee appointed by the old Tsay ee kah was challenging delegate after delegate on the ground that they had been illegally elected Karakhan member of the Bolshevik Central Committee simply grinned Never mind he said When the time comes we ll see that you get your seats nine See Notes and Explanations Rabotchi i Soldat said The attention of delegates to the new All Russian Congress is called to attempts of certain members of the Organising Committee to break up the Congress by asserting that it will not take place and that delegates had better leave Petrograd Pay no attention to these lies Great days are coming It was evident that a quorum would not come together by November two so the opening of the Congress was postponed to the seventh But the whole country was now aroused and the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries realising that they were defeated suddenly changed their tactics and began to wire frantically to their provincial organisations to elect as many moderate Socialist delegates as possible At the same time the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets issued an emergency call for a Peasants Congress to meet December thirteenth and offset whatever action the workers and soldiers might take What would the Bolsheviki do Rumours ran through the city that there would be an armed demonstration a vystuplennie coming out of the workers and soldiers The bourgeois and reactionary press prophesied insurrection and urged the Government to arrest the Petrograd Soviet or at least to prevent the meeting of the Congress Such sheets as Novaya Rus advocated a general Bolshevik massacre Gorky s paper Novaya Zhizn agreed with the Bolsheviki that the reactionaries were attempting to destroy the Revolution and that if necessary they must be resisted by force of arms but all the parties of the revolutionary democracy must present a united front As long as the democracy has not organised its principal forces so long as the resistance to its influence is still strong there is no advantage in passing to the attack But if the hostile elements appeal to force then the revolutionary democracy should enter the battle to seize the power and it will be sustained by the most profound strata of the people Gorky pointed out that both reactionary and Government newspapers were inciting the Bolsheviki to violence An insurrection however would prepare the way for a new Kornilov He urged the Bolsheviki to deny the rumours Potressov in the Menshevik Dien Day published a sensational story accompanied by a map which professed to reveal the secret Bolshevik plan of campaign As if by magic the walls were covered with warnings See App II Sect ten proclamations appeals from the Central Committees of the moderate and conservative factions and the Tsay ee kah denouncing any demonstrations imploring the workers and soldiers not to listen to agitators For instance this from the Military Section of the Socialist Revolutionary party Again rumours are spreading around the town of an intended vystuplennie What is the source of these rumours What organisation authorises these agitators who preach insurrection The Bolsheviki to a question addressed to them in the Tsay ee kah denied that they have anything to do with it But these rumours themselves carry with them a great danger It may easily happen that not taking into consideration the state of mind of the majority of the workers soldiers and peasants individual hot heads will call out part of the workers and soldiers on the streets inciting them to an uprising In this fearful time through which revolutionary Russia is passing any insurrection can easily turn into civil war and there can result from it the destruction of all organisations of the proletariat built up with so much labour The counter revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage of this insurrection to destroy the Revolution open the front to Wilhelm and wreck the Constituent Assembly Stick stubbornly to your posts Do not come out On October twenty eighth in the corridors of Smolny I spoke with Kameniev a little man with a reddish pointed beard and Gallic gestures He was not at all sure that enough delegates would come If there is a Congress he said it will represent the overwhelming sentiment of the people If the majority is Bolshevik as I think it will be we shall demand that the power be given to the Soviets and the Provisional Government must resign Volodarsky a tall pale youth with glasses and a bad complexion was more definite The Lieber Dans and the other compromisers are sabotaging the Congress If they succeed in preventing its meeting well then we are realists enough not to depend on that Under date of October twenty ninth I find entered in my notebook the following items culled from the newspapers of the day Moghilev General Staff Headquarters Concentration here of loyal Guard Regiments the Savage Division Cossacks and Death Battalions The yunkers of the Officers Schools of Pavlovsk Tsarskoye Selo and Peterhof ordered by the Government to be ready to come to Petrograd Oranienbaum yunkers arrive in the city Part of the Armoured Car Division of the Petrograd garrism stationed in the Winter Palace Upon orders signed by Trotzky several thousand rifles delivered by the Government Arms Factory at Sestroretzk to delegates of the Petrograd workmen At a meeting of the City Militia of the Lower Liteiny Quarter a resolution demanding that all power be given to the Soviets This is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish days when everybody knew that something was going to happen but nobody knew just what At a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny the night of October thirtieth Trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois press that the Soviet contemplated armed insurention as an attempt of the reactionaries to discredit and wreck the Congress of Soviets The Petrograd Soviet he declared had not ordered any uystuplennie If it is necessary we shall do so and we will be supported by the Petrogruad garrison They the Government are preparing a counter revolution and we shall answer with an offensive which will be merciless and decisive It is true that the Petrograd Soviet had not ordered a demonstration but the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party was considering the question of insurrection All night long the twenty threed they met There were present all the party intellectuals the leaders and delegates of the Petrograd workers and garrison Alone of the intellectuals Lenin and Trotzky stood for insurrection Even the military men opposed it A vote was taken Insurrection was defeated Then arose a rough workman his face convulsed with rage I speak for the Petrograd proletariat he said harshly We are in favour of insurrection Have it your own way but I tell you now that if you allow the Soviets to be destroyed we re through with you Some soldiers joined him And after that they voted again insurrection won However the right wing of the Bolsheviki led by Riazanov Kameniev and Zinoviev continued to campaign against an armed rising On the morning of October thirty first appeared in Rabotchi Put the first instalment of Lenin s Letter to the Comrades See App II Sect eleven one of the most audacious pieces of political propaganda the world has ever seen In it Lenin seriously presented the arguments in favour of insurrection taking as text the objections of Kameniev and Riazonov Either we must abandon our slogan All Power to the Soviets he wrote or else we must make an insurrection There is no middle course That same afternoon Paul Miliukov leader of the Cadets made a brilliant bitter speech See App II Sect twelve in the Council of the Republic branding the Skobeliev nakaz as pro German declaring that the revolutionary democracy was destroying Russia sneering at Terestchenko and openly declaring that he preferred German diplomacy to Russian The Left benches were one roaring tumult all through On its part the Government could not ignore the significance of the success of the Bolshevik propaganda On the twenty ninth joint commission of the Government and the Council of the Republic hastily drew up two laws one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants and the other for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace The next day Kerensky suspended capital punishment in the army That same afternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of the new Commission for Strengthening the Republican Regime and Fighting Against Anarchy and Counter Revolution of which history shows not the slightest further trace The following morning with two other correspondents I interviewed Kerensky See App II Sect thirteen the last time he received journalists The Russian people he said bitterly are suffering from economic fatigue and from disillusionment with the Allies The world thinks that the Russian Revolution is at an end Do not be mistaken The Russian Revolution is just beginning Words more prophetic perhaps than he knew Stormy was the all night meeting of the Petrograd Soviet the thirtieth of October at which I was present The moderate Socialist intellectuals officers members of Army Committees the Tsay ee kah were there in force Against them rose up workmen peasants and common soldiers passionate and simple A peasant told of the disorders in Tver which he said were caused by the arrest of the Land Committees This Kerensky is nothing but a shield to the pomieshtchiki landowners he cried They know that at the Constituent Assembly we will take the land anyway so they are trying to destroy the Constituent Assembly A machinist from the Putilov works described how the superintendents were closing down the departments one by one on the pretext that there was no fuel or raw materials The Factory Shop Committee he declared had discovered huge hidden supplies It is a provocatzia said he They want to starve us or drive us to violence Among the soldiers one began Comrades I bring you greetings from the place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches Then arose a tall gaunt young soldier with flashing eyes met with a roar of welcome It was Tchudnovsky reported killed in the July fighting and now risen from the dead The soldier masses no longer trust their officers Even the Army Committees who refused to call a meeting of our Soviet betrayed us The masses of the soldiers want the Constituent Assembly to be held exactly when it was called for and those who dare to postpone it will be cursed and not only platonic curses either for the Army has guns too He told of the electoral campaign for the Constituent now raging in the Fifth Army The officers and especially the Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionaries are trying deliberately to cripple the Bolsheviki Our papers are not allowed to circulate in the trenches Our speakers are arrested Why don t you speak about the lack of bread shouted another soldier Man shall not live by bread alone answered Tchudnovsky sternly Followed him an officer delegate from the Vitebsk Soviet a Menshevik oboronetz It isn t the question of who has the power The trouble is not with the Government but with the war and the war must be won before any change At this hoots and ironical cheers These Bolshevik agitators are demagogues The hall rocked with laughter Let us for a moment forget the class struggle But he got no farther A voice yelled Don t you wish we would Petrograd presented a curious spectacle in those days In the factories the committee rooms were filled with stacks of rifles couriers came and went the Red Guard ten drilled In all the barracks meetings every night and all day long interminable hot arguments On the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomy evening pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the Nevsky fighting for the newspapers Hold ups increased to such an extent that it was dangerous to walk down side streets On the Sadovaya one afternoon I saw a crowd of several hundred people beat and trample to death a soldier caught stealing Mysterious individuals circulated around the shivering women who waited in queue long cold hours for bread and milk whispering that the Jews had cornered the food supply and that while the people starved the Soviet members lived luxuriously ten See Notes and Explanations At Smolny there were strict guards at the door and the outer gates demanding everybody s pass The committee rooms buzzed and hummed all day and all night hundreds of soldiers and workmen slept on the floor wherever they could find room Upstairs in the great hall a thousand people crowded to the uproarious sessions of the Petrograd Soviet Gambling clubs functioned hectically from dusk to dawn with champagne flowing and stakes of twenty thousand rubles In the centre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels and expensive furs walked up and down crowded the cafes Monarchist plots German spies smugglers hatching schemes And in the rain the bitter chill the great throbbing city under grey skies rushing faster and faster toward what Chapter III On the Eve In the relations of a weak Government and a rebellious people there comes a time when every act of the authorities exasperates the masses and every refusal to act excites their contempt The proposal to abandon Petrograd raised a hurricane Kerensky s public denial that the Government had any such intention was met with hoots of derision Pinned to the wall by the pressure of the Revolution cried Rabotchi Put the Government of provisional bourgeois tries to get free by giving out lying assurances that it never thought of fleeing from Petrograd and that it didn t wish to surrender the capital In Kharkov thirty thousand coal miners organised adopting the preamble of the I W W constitution The working class and the employing class have nothing in common Dispersed by Cossacks some were locked out by the mine owners and the rest declared a general strike Minister of Commerce and Industry Konovalov appointed his assistant Orlov with plenary powers to settle the trouble Orlov was hated by the miners But the Tsay ee kah not only supported his appointment but refused to demand that the Cossacks be recalled from the Don Basin This was followed by the dispersal of the Soviet at Kaluga The Bolsheviki having secured a majority in the Soviet set free some political prisoners With the sanction of the Government Commissar the Municipal Duma called in troops from Minsk and bombarded the Soviet headquarters with artillery The Bolsheviki yielded but as they left the building Cossacks attacked them crying This is what we ll do to all the other Bolshevik Soviets including those of Moscow and Petrograd This incident sent a wave of panic rage throughout Russia In Petrograd was ending a regional Congress of Soviets of the North presided over by the Bolshevik Krylenko By an immense majority it resolved that all power should be assumed by the All Russian Congress and concluded by greeting the Bolsheviki in prison bidding them rejoice for the hour of their liberation was at hand At the same time the first All Russian Conference of Factory Shop Committees See App III Sect one declared emphatically for the Soviets and continued significantly After liberating themselves politically from Tsardom the working class wants to see the democratic regime triumphant in the sphere of its productive activity This is best expressed by Workers Control over industrial production which naturally arose in the atmosphere of economic decomposition created by the criminal policy of the dominating classes The Union of Railwaymen was demanding the resignation of Liverovsky Minister of Ways and Communications In the name of the Tsay ee kah Skobeliev insisted that the nakaz be presented at the Allied Conference and formally protested against the sending of Terestchenko to Paris Terestchenko offered to resign General Verkhovsky unable to accomplish his reorganisation of the army only came to Cabinet meetings at long intervals On November threed Burtzev s Obshtchee Dielo came out with great headlines Citizens Save the fatherland I have just learned that yesterday at a meeting of the Commission for National Defence Minister of War General Verkhovsky one of the principal persons responsible for the fall of Kornilov proposed to sign a separate peace independently of the Allies That is treason to Russia Terestchenko declared that the Provisional Government had not even examined Verkhovsky s proposition You might think said Terestchenko that we were in a madhouse The members of the Commission were astounded at the General s words General Alexeyev wept No It is not madness It is worse It is direct treason to Russia Kerensky Terestchenko and Nekrassov must immediately answer us concerning the words of Verkhovsky Citizens arise Russia is being sold Save her What Verkhovsky really said was that the Allies must be pressed to offer peace because the Russian army could fight no longer Both in Russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous Verkhovsky was given indefinite leave of absence for ill health and left the Government Obshtchee Dielo was suppressed Sunday November fourth was designated as the Day of the Petrograd Soviet with immense meetings planned all over the city ostensibly to raise money for the organisation and the press really to make a demonstration of strength Suddenly it was announced that on the same day the Cossacks would hold a Krestny Khod Procession of the Cross in honour of the Ikon of sixteen twelve through whose miraculous intervention Napoleon had been driven from Moscow The atmosphere was electric a spark might kindle civil war The Petrograd Soviet issued a manifesto headed Brothers Cossacks You Cossacks are being incited against us workers and soldiers This plan of Cain is being put into operation by our common enemies the oppressors the privileged classes generals bankers landlords former officials former servants of the Tsar We are hated by all grafters rich men princes nobles generals including your Cossack generals They are ready at any moment to destroy the Petrograd Soviet and crush the Revolution On the fourth of November somebody is organising a Cossack religious procession It is a question of the free consciousness of every individual whether he will or will not take part in this procession We do not interfere in this matter nor do we obstruct anybody However we warn you Cossacks Look out and see to it that under the pretext of a Krestni Khod your Kaledins do not instigate you against workmen against soldiers The procession was hastily called off In the barracks and the working class quarters of the town the Bolsheviki were preaching All Power to the Soviets and agents of the Dark Forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter the Jews shop keepers Socialist leaders On one side the Monarchist press inciting to bloody repression on the other Lenin s great voice roaring Insurrection We cannot wait any longer Even the bourgeois press was uneasy See App III Sect two Birjevya Viedomosti Exchange Gazette called the Bolshevik propaganda an attack on the most elementary principles of society personal security and the respect for private property Graphic page forty six Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet Appeal of the Petrograd Soviet to the Cosacks to call off their Krestny Khod the religious procession planned for November fourth our calendar Brothers Cossacks it begins The Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies addresses you But it was the moderate Socialist journals which were the most hostile See App III Sect three The Bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the Revolution declared Dielo Naroda Said the Menshevik Dien The Government ought to defend itself and defend us Plekhanov s paper Yedinstvo Unity See App III Sect four called the attention of the Government to the fact that the Petrograd workers were being armed and demanded stern measures against the Bolsheviki Daily the Government seemed to become more helpless Even the Municipal administration broke down The columns of the morning papers were filled with accounts of the most audacious robberies and murders and the criminals were unmolested On the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night doing battle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they found them On the first of November Colonel Polkovnikov Military Commander of Petrograd issued a proclamation Despite the difficult days through which the country is passing irresponsible appeals to armed demonstrations and massacres are still being spread around Petrograd and from day to day robbery and disorder increase This state of things is disorganising the life of the citizens and hinders the systematic work of the Government and the Municipal Institutions In full consciousness of my responsibility and my duty before my country I command one Every military unit in accordance with special instructions and within the territory of its garrison to afford every assistance to the Municipality to the Commissars and to the militia in the guarding of Government institutions two The organisation of patrols in company operation with the District Commander and the representatives of the city militia and the taking of measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters three The arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to armed demonstrations and massacres and their delivery to the headquarters of the Second Commander of the city four To suppress any armed demonstration or riot at its start with all armed forces at hand five To afford assistance to the Commissars in preventing unwarranted searches in houses and unwarranted arrests six To report immediately all that happens in the district under charge to the Staff of the Petrograd Military District I call upon all Army Committees and organisations to afford their help to the commanders in fulfilment of the duties with which they are charged In the Council of the Republic Kerensky declared that the Government was fully aware of the Bolshevik preparations and had sufficient force to cope with any demonstration See App III Sect five He accused Novaya Rus and Robotchi Put of both doing the same kind of subversive work But owing to the absolute freedom of the press he added the Government is not in a position to combat printed lies eleven Declaring that these were two aspects of the same propaganda which had for its object the counter revolution so ardently desired by the Dark Forces he went on I am a doomed man it doesn t matter what happens to me and I have the audacity to say that the other enigmatic part is that of the unbelievable provocation created in the city by the Bolsheviki eleven This was not quite candid The Provisional Government had suppressed Bolshevik papers before in July and was planning to do so again On November twod only fifteen delegates to the Congress of Soviets had arrived Next day there were a hundred and the morning after that a hundred and seventy five of whom one hundred and three were Bolsheviki Four hundred constituted a quorum and the Congress was only three days off I spent a great deal of time at Smolny It was no longer easy to get in Double rows of sentries guarded the outer gates and once inside the front door there was a long line of people waiting to be let in four at a time to be questioned as to their identity and their business Passes were given out and the pass system was changed every few hours for spies continually sneaked through Graphic page forty nine Russian Pass to Reed translation follows Pass to Smolny Institute issued by the Military Revolutionary Committee giving me the right of entry at any time Translation Military Revolutionary Committee attached to the Petrograd Soviet of W S D Commandant s office sixteenth November nineteen seventeen No nine hundred fifty five Smolny Institute PASS Is given by the present to John Reed correspondent of the American Socialist press until December one the right of free entry into Smolny Institute Commandant Adjutant One day as I came up to the outer gate I saw Trotzky and his wife just ahead of me They were halted by a soldier Trotzky searched through his pockets but could find no pass Never mind he said finally You know me My name is Trotzky You haven t got a pass answered the soldier stubbornly You cannot go in Names don t mean anything to me But I am the president of the Petrograd Soviet Well replied the soldier if you re as important a fellow as that you must at least have one little paper Trotzky was very patient Let me see the Commandant he said The soldier hesitated grumbling something about not wanting to disturb the Commandant for every devil that came along He beckoned finally to the soldier in command of the guard Trotzky explained matters to him My name is Trotzky he repeated Trotzky The other soldier scratched his head I ve heard the name somewhere he said at length I guess it s all right You can go on in comrade In the corridor I met Karakhan member of the Bolshevik Central Committee who explained to me what the new Government would be like A loose organisation sensitive to the popular will as expressed through the Soviets allowing local forces full play At present the Provisional Government obstructs the action of the local democratic will just as the Tsar s Government did The initiative of the new society shall come from below The form of the Government will be modelled on the Constitution of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party The new Tsay ee kah responsible to frequent meetings of the All Russian Congress of Soviets will be the parliament the various Ministries will be headed by collegia committees instead of by Ministers and will be directly responsible to the Soviets On October thirtieth by appointment I went up to a small bare room in the attic of Smolny to talk with Trotzky In the middle of the room he sat on a rough chair at a bare table Few questions from me were necessary he talked rapidly and steadily for more than an hour The substance of his talk in his own words I give here The Provisional Government is absolutely powerless The bourgeoisie is in control but this control is masked by a fictitious coalition with the oborontsi parties Now during the Revolution one sees revolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised land and all over the country in all the toiling classes the same disgust is evident This domination by the bourgeoisie is only possible by means of civil war The Kornilov method is the only way by which the bourgeoisie can control But it is force which the bourgeoisie lacks The Army is with us The conciliators and pacifists Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki have lost all authority because the struggle between the peasants and the landlords between the workers and the employers between the soldiers and the officers has become more bitter more irreconcilable than ever Only by the concerted action of the popular mass only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship can the Revolution be achieved and the people saved The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people perfect in their revolutionary experience in their ideas and objects Based directly upon the army in the trenches the workers in the factories and the peasants in the fields they are the backbone of the Revolution There has been an attempt to create a power without the Soviets and only powerlessness has been created Counter revolutionary schemes of all sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the Council of the Russian Republic The Cadet party represents the counter revolution militant On the other side the Soviets represent the cause of the people Between the two camps there are no groups of serious importance It is the lutte finale The bourgeois counter revolution organises all its forces and waits for the moment to attack us Our answer will be decisive We will complete the work scarcely begun in March and advanced during the Kornilov affair He went on to speak of the new Government s foreign policy Our first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on all fronts and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peace terms The quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlement depends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in Europe If we create here a Government of the Soviets that will be a powerful factor for immediate peace in Europe for this Government will address itself directly and immediately to all peoples over the heads of their Governments proposing an armistice At the moment of the conclusion of peace the pressure of the Russian Revolution will be in the direction of no annexations no indemnities the right of self determination of peoples and a Federated Republic of Europe At the end of this war I see Europe recreated not by the diplomats but by the proletariat The Federated Republic of Europe the United States of Europe that is what must be National autonomy no longer suffices Economic evolution demands the abolition of national frontiers If Europe is to remain split into national groups then Imperialism will recommence its work Only a Federated Republic of Europe can give peace to the world He smiled that fine faintly ironical smile of his But without the action of the European masses these ends cannot be realised now Now while everybody was waiting for the Bolsheviki to appear suddenly on the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with white collars on the real insurrection took its way quite naturally and openly The Provisional Government planned to send the Petrograd garrison to the front The Petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men who had taken a prominent part in the Revolution It was they who had turned the tide in the great days of March created the Soviets of Soldiers Deputies and hurled back Kornilov from the gates of Petrograd Now a large part of them were Bolsheviki When the Provisional Government talked of evacuating the city it was the Petrograd garrison which answered If you are not capable of defending the capital conclude peace if you cannot conclude peace go away and make room for a People s Government which can do both It was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon the attitude of the Petrograd garrison The Government s plan was to replace the garrison regiments with dependable troops Cossacks Death Battalions The Army Committees the moderate Socialists and the Tsay ee kah supported the Government A wide spread agitation was carried on at the Front and in Petrograd emphasizing the fact that for eight months the Petrograd garrison had been leading an easy life in the barracks of the capital while their exhausted comrades in the trenches starved and died Naturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrison regiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort for the hardships of a winter campaign But there were other reasons why they refused to go The Petrograd Soviet feared the Government s intentions and from the Front came hundreds of delegates chosen by the common soldiers crying It is true we need reinforcements but more important we must know that Petrograd and the Revolution are well guarded Do you hold the rear comrades and we will hold the front On October twenty fifth behind closed doors the Central Committee of the Petrograd Soviet discussed the formation of a special Military Committee to decide the whole question The next day a meeting of the Soldiers Section of the Petrograd Soviet elected a Committee which immediately proclaimed a boycott of the bourgeois newspapers and condemned the Tsay ee kah for opposing the Congress of Soviets On the twenty ninth in open session of the Petrograd Soviet Trotzky proposed that the Soviet formally sanction the Military Revolutionary Committee We ought he said to create our special organisation to march to battle and if necessary to die It was decided to send to the front two delegations one from the Soviet and one from the garrison to confer with the Soldiers Committees and the General Staff At Pskov the Soviet delegates were met by General Tcheremissov commander of the Northern Front with the curt declaration that he had ordered the Petrograd garrison to the trenches and that was all The garrison committee was not allowed to leave Petrograd A delegation of the Soldiers Section of the Petrograd Soviet asked that a representative be admitted to the Staff of the Petrograd District Refused The Petrograd Soviet demanded that no orders be issued without the approval of the Soldiers Section Refused The delegates were roughly told We only recognise the Tsay ee kah We do not recognise you if you break any laws we shall arrest you On the thirtieth a meeting of representatives of all the Petrograd regiments passed a resolution The Petrograd garrison no longer recognises the Provisional Government The Petrograd Soviet is our Government We will obey only the orders of the Petrograd Soviet through the Military Revolutionary Committee The local military units were ordered to wait for instructions from the Soldiers Section of the Petrograd Soviet Next day the Tsay ee kah summoned its own meeting composed largely of officers formed a Committee to cooperate with the Staff and detailed Commissars in all quarters of the city A great soldier meeting at Smolny on the threed resolved Saluting the creation of the Military Revolutionary Committee the Petrograd garrison promises it complete support in all its actions to unite more closely the front and the rear in the interests of the Revolution The garrison moreover declares that with the revolutionary proletariat it assures the maintenance of revolutionary order in Petrograd Every attempt at provocation on the part of the Kornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless resistance Now conscious of its power the Military Revolutionary Committee peremptorily summoned the Petrograd Staff to submit to its control To all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals or proclamations without the Committee s authorisation Armed Commissars visited the Kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities of arms and ammunition halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which was being sent to Novotcherkask headquarters of Kaledin Suddenly awake to the danger the Government offered immunity if the Committee would disband Too late At midnight November fifth Kerensky himself sent Malevsky to offer the Petrograd Soviet representation on the Staff The Military Revolutionary Committee accepted An hour later General Manikovsky acting Minister of war countermanded the offer Tuesday morning November sixth the city was thrown into excitement by the appearance of a placard signed Military Revolutionary Committee attached to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies To the Population of Petrograd Citizens Counter revolution has raised its criminal head The Kornilovtsi are mobilising their forces in order to crush the All Russian Congress of Soviets and break the Constituent Assembly At the same time the pogromists may attempt to call upon the people of Petrograd for trouble and bloodshed The Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies takes upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in the city against counter revolutionary and pogrom attempts The Petrograd garrison will not allow any violence or disorders The population is invited to arrest hooligans and Black Hundred agitators and take them to the Soviet Commissars at the nearest barracks At the first attempt of the Dark Forces to make trouble on the streets of Petrograd whether robbery or fighting the criminals will be wiped off the face of the earth Citizens We call upon you to maintain complete quiet and self possession The cause of order and Revolution is in strong hands List of regiments where there are Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee On the third the leaders of the Bolsheviki had another historic meeting behind closed doors Notified by Zalkind I waited in the corridor outside the door and Volodarsky as he came out told me what was going on Lenin spoke November sixth will be too early We must have an all Russian basis for the rising and on the sixth all the delegates to the Congress will not have arrived On the other hand November eighth will be too late By that time the Congress will be organised and it is difficult for a large organised body of people to take swift decisive action We must act on the seventh the day the Congress meets so that we may say to it Here is the power What are you going to do with it In a certain upstairs room sat a thin faced long haired individual once an officer in the armies of the Tsar then revolutionist and exile a certain Avseenko called Antonov mathematician and chess player he was drawing careful plans for the seizure of the capital On its side the Government was preparing Inconspicuously certain of the most loyal regiments from widely separated divisions were ordered to Petrograd The yunker artillery was drawn into the Winter Palace Patrols of Cossacks made their appearance in the streets for the first time since the July days Polkovnikov issued order after order threatening to repress all insubordination with the utmost energy Kishkin Minister of Public Instruction the worst hated member of the Cabinet was appointed Special Commissar to keep order in Petrograd he named as assistants two men no less unpopular Rutenburg and Paltchinsky Petrograd Cronstadt and Finland were declared in a state of siege upon which the bourgeois Novoye Vremya New Times remarked ironically Why the state of siege The Government is no longer a power It has no moral authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus to use force In the most favourable circumstances it can only negotiate with any one who consents to parley Its authority goes no farther Monday morning the fifth I dropped in at the Marinsky Palace to see what was happening in the Council of the Russian Republic Bitter debate on Terestchenko s foreign policy Echoes of the Burtzev Verkhovski affair All the diplomats present except the Italian ambassador who everybody said was prostrated by the Carso disaster As I came in the Left Socialist Revolutionary Karelin was reading aloud an editorial from the London Times which said The remedy for Bolshevism is bullets Turning to the Cadets he cried That s what you think too Voices from the Right Yes Yes Yes I know you think so answered Karelin hotly But you haven t the courage to try it Then Skobeliev looking like a matinee idol with his soft blond beard and wavy yellow hair rather apologetically defending the Soviet nakaz Terestchenko followed assailed from the Left by cries of Resignation Resignation He insisted that the delegates of the Government and of the Tsay ee kah to Paris should have a common point of view his own A few words about the restoration of discipline in the army about war to victory Tumult and over the stubborn opposition of the truculent Left the Council of the Republic passed to the simple order of the day There stretched the rows of Bolshevik seats empty since that first day when they left the Council carrying with them so much life As I went down the stairs it seemed to me that in spite of the bitter wrangling no real voice from the rough world outside could penetrate this high cold hall and that the Provisional Government was wrecked on the same rock of War and Peace that had wrecked the Miliukov Ministry The doorman grumbled as he put on my coat I don t know what is becoming of poor Russia All these Mensheviki and Bolsheviki and Trudoviki This Ukraine and this Finland and the German imperialists and the English imperialists I am forty five years old and in all my life I never heard so many words as in this place In the corridor I met Professor Shatsky a rat faced individual in a dapper frock coat very influential in the councils of the Cadet party I asked him what he thought of the much talked of Bolshevik vystuplennie He shrugged sneering They are cattle canaille he answered They will not dare or if they dare they will soon be sent flying From our point of view it will not be bad for then they will ruin themselves and have no power in the Constituent Assembly But my dear sir allow me to outline to you my plan for a form of Government to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly You see I am chairman of a commission appointed from this body in conjunction with the Provisional Government to work out a constitutional project We will have a legislative assembly of two chambers such as you have in the United States In the lower chamber will be territorial representatives in the upper representatives of the liberal professions zemstvos Cooperatives and Trade Unions Outside a chill damp wind came from the west and the cold mud underfoot soaked through my shoes Two companies of yunkers passed swinging up the Morskaya tramping stiffly in their long coats and singing an oldtime crashing chorus such as the soldiers used to sing under the Tsar At the first cross street I noticed that the City Militiamen were mounted and armed with revolvers in bright new holsters a little group of people stood silently staring at them At the corner of the Nevsky I bought a pamphlet by Lenin Will the Bolsheviki be Able to Hold the Power paying for it with one of the stamps which did duty for small change The usual street cars crawled past citizens and soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to make Theodore P Shonts green with envy Along the sidewalk a row of deserters in uniform sold cigarettes and sunflower seeds Up the Nevsky in the sour twilight crowds were battling for the latest papers and knots of people were trying to make out the multitudes of appeals See App III Sect six and proclamations pasted in every flat place from the Tsay ee kah the Peasants Soviets the moderate Socialist parties the Army Committees threatening cursing beseeching the workers and soldiers to stay home to support the Government An armoured automobile went slowly up and down siren screaming On every corner in every open space thick groups were clustered arguing soldiers and students Night came swiftly down the wide spaced street lights flickered on the tides of people flowed endlessly It is always like that in Petrograd just before trouble The city was nervous starting at every sharp sound But still no sign from the Bolsheviki the soldiers stayed in the barracks the workmen in the factories We went to a moving picture show near the Kazan Cathedral a bloody Italian film of passion and intrigue Down front were some soldiers and sailors staring at the screen in childlike wonder totally unable to comprehend why there should be so much violent running about and so much homicide From there I hurried to Smolny In room ten on the top floor the Military Revolutionary Committee sat in continuous session under the chairmanship of a tow headed eighteen year old boy named Lazimir He stopped as he passed to shake hands rather bashfully Peter Paul Fortress has just come over to us said he with a pleased grin A minute ago we got word from a regiment that was ordered by the Government to come to Petrograd The men were suspicious so they stopped the train at Gatchina and sent a delegation to us What s the matter they asked What have you got to say We have just passed a resolution All Power to the Soviets The Military Revolutionary Committee sent back word Brothers We greet you in the name of the Revolution Stay where you are until further instructions All telephones he said were cut off but communication with the factories and barracks was established by means of military telephonograph apparatus A steady stream of couriers and Commissars came and went Outside the door waited a dozen volunteers ready to carry word to the farthest quarters of the city One of them a gypsy faced man in the uniform of a lieutenant said in French Everything is ready to move at the push of a button There passed Podvoisky the thin bearded civillian whose brain conceived the strategy of insurrection Antonov unshaven his collar filthy drunk with loss of sleep Krylenko the squat wide faced soldier always smiling with his violent gestures and tumbling speech and Dybenko the giant bearded sailor with the placid face These were the men of the hour and of other hours to come Downstairs in the office of the Factory Shop Committees sat Seratov signing orders on the Government Arsenal for arms one hundred and fifty rifles for each factory Delegates waited in line forty of them In the hall I ran into some of the minor Bolshevik leaders One showed me a revolver The game is on he said and his face was pale Whether we move or not the other side knows it must finish us or be finished The Petrograd Soviet was meeting day and night As I came into the great hall Trotzky was just finishing We are asked he said if we intend to have a vystuplennie I can give a clear answer to that question The Petrograd Soviet feels that at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into the hands of the Soviets This transfer of government will be accomplished by the All Russian Congress Whether an armed demonstration is necessary will depend on those who wish to interfere with the All Russian Congress We feel that our Government entrusted to the personnel of the Provisional Cabinet is a pitiful and helpless Government which only awaits the sweep of the broom of History to give way to a really popular Government But we are trying to avoid a conflict even now to day We hope that the All Russian Congress will take into its hands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedom of the people If however the Government wants to utilise the short period it is expected to live twenty four forty eight or seventy two hours to attack us then we shall answer with counter attacks blow for blow steel for iron Amid cheers he announced that the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had agreed to send representatives into the Military Revolutionary Committee As I left Smolny at three o clock in the morning I noticed that two rapid firing guns had been mounted one on each side of the door and that strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near by street corners Bill Shatov twelve came bounding up the steps Well he cried We re off Kerensky sent the yunkers to close down our papers Soldat and Rabotchi Put But our troops went down and smashed the Government seals and now we re sending detachments to seize the bourgeois newspaper offices Exultantly he slapped me on the shoulder and ran in twelve Well known in the American labor movement On the morning of the sixth I had business with the censor whose office was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Everywhere on all the walls hysterical appeals to the people to remain calm Polkovnikov emitted prikaz after prikaz I order all military units and detachments to remain in their barracks until further orders from the Staff of the Military District All officers who act without orders from their superiors will be court martialled for mutiny I forbid absolutely any execution by soldiers of instructions from other organisations The morning papers announced that the Government had suppressed the papers Novaya Rus Zhivoye Slovo Rabotchi Put and Soldat and decreed the arrest of the leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and the members of the Military Revolutionary Committee As I crossed the Palace Square several batteries of yunker artillery came through the Red Arch at a jingling trot and drew up before the Palace The great red building of the General Staff was unusually animated several armoured automobiles ranked before the door and motors full of officers were coming and going The censor was very much excited like a small boy at a circus Kerensky he said had just gone to the Council of the Republic to offer his resignation I hurried down to the Marinsky Palace arriving at the end of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of Kerensky s full of self justification and bitter denunciation of his enemies I will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole series of articles published in Rabotchi Put by Ulianov Lenin a state criminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find This state criminal has invited the proletariat and the Petrograd garrison to repeat the experience of the sixteenth eighteenth of July and insists upon the immediate necessity for an armed rising Moreover other Bolshevik leaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings and also made an appeal to immediate insurrection Particularly should be noticed the activity of the present president of the Petrograd Soviet Bronstein Trotzky I ought to bring to your notice that the expressions and the style of a whole series of articles in Rabotchi Put and Soldat resemble absolutely those of Novaya Rus We have to do not so much with the movement of such and such political party as with the exploitation of the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of the population a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke in Russia cost what it may an inconscient movement of destruction and pillage for given the state of mind of the masses any movement at Petrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres which will cover with eternal shame the name of free Russia By the admission of Ulianov Lenin himself the situation of the extreme left wing of the Social Democrats in Russia is very favourable Here Kerensky read the following quotation from Lenin s article Think of it The German comrades have only one Liebknecht without newspapers without freedom of meeting without a Soviet They are opposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of society and yet the German comrades try to act while we having dozens of newspapers freedom of meeting the majority of the Soviets we the best placed international proletarians of the entire world can we refuse to support the German revolutionists and insurrectionary organisations Kerensky then continued The organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the most perfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtain now in Russia administered by a Provisional Government at the head of which is in the eyes of this party a usurper and a man who has sold himself to the bourgeoisie the Minister President Kerensky The organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of the German proletariat but of the German governing classes and they open the Russian front to the iron fists of Wilhelm and his friends Little matter to the Provisional Government the motives of these people little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously but in any case from this tribune in full consciousness of my responsibility I quality such acts of a Russian political party as acts of treason to Russia I place myself at the point of view of the Right and I propose immediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessary arrests Uproar from the Left Listen to me he cried in a powerful voice At the moment when the state is in danger because of conscious or unconscious treason the Provisional Government and myself among others prefer to be killed rather than betray the life the honour and the independence of Russia At this moment a paper was handed to Kerensky I have just received the proclamation which they are distributing to the regiments Here is the contents Reading The Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies is menaced We order immediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to await new orders All delay or non execution of this order will be considered as an act of treason to the Revolution The Military Revolutionary Committee For the President Podvoisky The Secretary Antonov In reality this is an attempt to raise the populace against the existing order of things to break the Constituent and to open the front to the regiments of the iron fist of Wilhelm I say populace intentionally because the conscious democracy and its Tsay ee kah all the Army organisations all that free Russia glorifies the good sense the honour and the conscience of the great Russian democracy protests against these things I have not come here with a prayer but to state my firm conviction that the Provisional Government which defends at this moment our new liberty that the new Russian state destined to a brilliant future will find unanimous support except among those who have never dared to face the truth The Provisional Government has never violated the liberty of all citizens of the State to use their political rights But now the Provisional Government declares in this moment those elements of the Russian nation those groups and parties who have dared to lift their hands against the free will of the Russian people at the same time threatening to open the front to Germany must be liquidated with decision Let the population of Petrograd understand that it will encounter a firm power and perhaps at the last moment good sense conscience and honour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess them All through this speech the hall rang with deafening clamour When the Minister President had stepped down pale faced and wet with perspiration and strode out with his suite of officers speaker after speaker from the Left and Centre attacked the Right all one angry roaring Even the Socialist Revolutionaries through Gotz The policy of the Bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal in their exploitation of the popular discontent But there is a whole series of popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to now The questions of peace land and the democratization of the army ought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier peasant or worker would have the least doubt that our Government is attempting firmly and infallibly to solve them We Mensheviki do not wish to provoke a Cabinet crisis and we are ready to defend the Provisional Government with all our energy to the last drop of our blood if only the Provisional Government on all these burning questions will speak the clear and precise words awaited by the people with such impatience Then Martov furious The words of the Minister President who allowed himself to speak of populace when it is question of the movement of important sections of the proletariat and the army although led in the wrong direction are nothing but an incitement to civil war The order of the day proposed by the Left was voted It amounted practically to a vote of lack of confidence one The armed demonstration which has been preparing for some days past has for its object a coup d etat threatens to provoke civil war creates conditions favourable to pogroms and counterrevolution the mobilization of counter revolutionary forces such as the Black Hundreds which will inevitably bring about the impossibility of convoking the Constituent will cause a military catastrophe the death of the Revolution paralyse the economic life of the country and destroy Russia two The conditions favourable to this agitation have been created by delay in passing urgent measures as well as objective conditions caused by the war and the general disorder It is necessary before everything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land to the peasants Land Committees and to adopt an energetic course of action abroad in proposing to the Allies to proclaim their peace terms and to begin peace parleys three To cope with Monarchist manifestations and pogromist movements it is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress these movements and for this purpose to create at Petrograd a Committee of Public Safety composed of representatives of the Municipality and the organs of the revolutionary democracy acting in contact with the Provisional Government It is interesting to note that the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries all rallied to this resolution When Kerensky saw it however he summoned Avksentiev to the Winter Palace to explain If it expressed a lack of confidence in the Provisional Government he begged Avksentiev to form a new Cabinet Dan Gotz and Avksentiev the leaders of the compromisers performed their last compromise They explained to Kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism of the Government At the corner of the Morskaya and the Nevsky squads of soldiers with fixed bayonets were stopping all private automobiles turning out the occupants and ordering them toward the Winter Palace A large crowd had gathered to watch them Nobody knew whether the soldiers belonged to the Government or the Military Revolutionary Committee Up in front of the Kazan Cathedral the same thing was happening machines being directed back up the Nevsky Five or six sailors with rifles came along laughing excitedly and fell into conversation with two of the soldiers On the sailors hat bands were Avrora and Zaria Svobody the names of the leading Bolshevik cruisers of the Baltic Fleet One of them said Cronstadt is coming It was as if in seventeen ninety two on the streets of Paris some one had said The Marseillais are coming For at Cronstadt were twenty five thousand sailors convinced Bolsheviki and not afraid to die Rabotchi i Soldat was just out all its front page one huge proclamation SOLDIERS WORKERS CITIZENS The enemies of the people passed last night to the offensive The Kornilovists of the Staff are trying to draw in from the suburbs yunkers and volunteer battalions The Oranienbaum yunkers and the Tsarskoye Selo volunteers refused to come out A stroke of high treason is being contemplated against the Petrograd Soviet The campaign of the counter revolutionists is being directed against the All Russian Congress of Soviets on the eve of its opening against the Constituent Assembly against the people The Petrograd Soviet is guarding the Revolution The Military Revolutionary Committee is directing the repulse of the conspirators attack The entire garrison and proletariat of Petrograd are ready to deal the enemy of the people a crushing blow The Military Revolutionary Committee decrees one All regimental division and battle ship Committees together with the Soviet Commissars and all revolutionary organisations shall meet in continuous session concentrating in their hands all information about the plans of the conspirators two Not one soldier shall leave his division without permission of the Committee three To send to Smolny at once two delegates from each military unit and five from each Ward Soviet four All members of the Petrograd Soviet and all delegates to the All Russian Congress are invited immediately to Smolny for an extraordinary meeting Counter revolution has raised its criminal head A great danger threatens all the conquests and hopes of the soldiers and workers But the forces of the Revolution by far exceed those of its enemies The cause of the People is in strong hands The conspirators will be crushed No hesitation or doubts Firmness steadfastness discipline determination Long live the Revolution The Military Revolutionary Committee The Petrograd Soviet was meeting continuously at Smolny a centre of storm delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again to take part in the debate Trotzky Kameniev Volodarsky speaking six eight twelve hours a day I went down to room eighteen on the first floor where the Bolshevik delegates were holding caucus a harsh voice steadily booming the speaker hidden by the crowd The compromisers say that we are isolated Pay no attention to them Once it begins they must be dragged along with us or else lose their following Here he held up a piece of paper We are dragging them A message has just come from the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries They say that they condemn our action but that if the Government attacks us they will not oppose the cause of the proletariat Exultant shouting As night fell the great hall filled with soldiers and workmen a monstrous dun mass deep humming in a blue haze of smoke The old Tsay ee kah had finally decided to welcome the delegates to that new Congress which would mean its own ruin and perhaps the ruin of the revolutionary order it had built At this meeting however only members of the Tsay ee kah could vote It was after midnight when Gotz took the chair and Dan rose to speak in a tense silence which seemed to me almost menacing The hours in which we live appear in the most tragic colours he said The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd the forces of the democracy are trying to organise to resist him and yet we await bloodshed in the streets of the capital and famine threatens to destroy not only our homogeneous Government but the Revolution itself The masses are sick and exhausted They have no interest in the Revolution If the Bolsheviki start anything that will be the end of the Revolution Cries That s a lie The counter revolutionists are waiting with the Bolsheviki to begin riots and massacres If there is any vystuplennie there will be no Constituent Assembly Cries Lie Shame It is inadmissible that in the zone of military operations the Petrograd garrison shall not submit to the orders of the Staff You must obey the orders of the Staff and of the Tsay ee kah elected by you All Power to the Soviets that means death Robbers and thieves are waiting for the moment to loot and burn When you have such slogans put before you Enter the houses take away the shoes and clothes from the bourgeoisie Tumult Cries No such slogan A lie A lie Well it may start differently but it will end that way The Tsay ee kah has full power to act and must be obeyed We are not afraid of bayonets The Tsay ee kah will defend the Revolution with its body Cries It was a dead body long ago Immense continued uproar in which his voice could be heard screaming as he pounded the desk Those who are urging this are committing a crime Voice You committed a crime long ago when you captured the power and turned it over to the bourgeoisie Gotz ringing the chairman s bell Silence or I ll have you put out Voice Try it Cheers and whistling Now concerning our policy about peace Laughter Unfortunately Russia can no longer support the continuation of the war There is going to be peace but not permanent peace not a democratic peace To day at the Council of the Republic in order to avoid bloodshed we passed an order of the day demanding the surrender of the land to the Land Committees and immediate peace negotiations Laughter and cries Too late Then for the Bolsheviki Trotzky mounted the tribune borne on a wave of roaring applause that burst into cheers and a rising house thunderous His thin pointed face was positively Mephistophelian in its expression of malicious irony Dan s tactics prove that the masses the great dull indifferent masses are absolutely with him Titantic mirth He turned toward the chairman dramatically When we spoke of giving the land to the peasants you were against it We told the peasants If they don t give it to you take it yourselves and the peasants followed our advice And now you advocate what we did six months ago I don t think Kerensky s order to suspend the death penalty in the army was dictated by his ideals I think Kerensky was persuaded by the Petrograd garrison which refused to obey him To day Dan is accused of having made a speech in the Council of the Republic which proves him to be a secret Bolshevik The time may come when Dan will say that the flower of the Revolution participated in the rising of July sixteenth and eighteenth In Dan s resolution to day at the Council of the Republic there was no mention of enforcing discipline in the army although that is urged in the propaganda of his party No The history of the last seven months shows that the masses have left the Mensheviki The Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionaries conquered the Cadets and then when they got the power they gave it to the Cadets Dan tells you that you have no right to make an insurrection Insurrection is the right of all revolutionists When the down trodden masses revolt it is their right Then the long faced cruel tongued Lieber greeted with groans and laughter Engels and Marx said that the proletariat had no right to take power until it was ready for it In a bourgeois revolution like this the seizure of power by the masses means the tragic end of the Revolution Trotzky as a Social Democratic theorist is himself opposed to what he is now advocating Cries Enough Down with him Martov constantly interrupted The Internationalists are not opposed to the transmission of power to the democracy but they disapprove of the methods of the Bolsheviki This is not the moment to seize the power Again Dan took the floor violently protesting against the action of the Military Revolutionary Committee which had sent a Commissar to seize the office of Izviestia and censor the paper The wildest uproar followed Martov tried to speak but could not be heard Delegates of the Army and the Baltic Fleet stood up all over the hall shouting that the Soviet was their Government Amid the wildest confusion Ehrlich offered a resolution appealing to the workers and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond to provocations to demonstrate recognising the necessity of immediately creating a Committee of Public Safety and asking the Provisional Government at once to pass decrees transferring the land to the peasants and beginning peace negotiations Then up leaped Volodarsky shouting harshly that the Tsay ee kah on the eve of the Congress had no right to assume the functions of the Congress The Tsay ee kah was practically dead he said and the resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power As for us Bolsheviki we will not vote on this resolution Whereupon all the Bolsheviki left the hall and the resolution was passed Toward four in the morning I met Zorin in the outer hall a rifle slung from his shoulder We re moving See App III Sect seven said he calmly but with satisfaction We pinched the Assistant Minister of Justice and the Minister of Religions They re down cellar now One regiment is on the march to capture the Telephone Exchange another the Telegraph Agency another the State Bank The Red Guard is out On the steps of Smolny in the chill dark we first saw the Red Guard a huddled group of boys in workmen s clothes carrying guns with bayonets talking nervously together Far over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered rifle fire where the yunkers were trying to open the bridges over the Neva to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the Viborg quarter from joining the Soviet forces in the centre of the city and the Cronstadt sailors were closing them again Behind us great Smolny bright with lights hummed like a gigantic hive

6694_70837_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That I couldn t tell you brother he answered and spat 
6694_70837_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Before the door of the Palace was a crowd of soldiers and sailors 
6694_70837_000026_000001	train-clean-360	A sailor was telling of the end of the Council of the Russian Republic 
6694_70837_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 We walked in there he said and filled all the doors with comrades 
6694_70837_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I went up to the counter revolutionist Kornilovitz who sat in the president s chair 
6694_70837_000026_000004	train-clean-360	 No more Council I says 
none	none	Run along home now 
6694_70837_000027_000000	train-clean-360	There was laughter 
6694_70837_000027_000001	train-clean-360	By waving assorted papers I managed to get around to the door of the press gallery 
6694_70837_000027_000002	train-clean-360	There an enormous smiling sailor stopped me and when I showed my pass just said If you were Saint Michael himself comrade you couldn t pass here Through the glass of the door I made out the distorted face and gesticulating arms of a French correspondent locked in 
6694_70837_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Around in front stood a little grey moustached man in the uniform of a general the centre of a knot of soldiers 
6694_70837_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He was very red in the face 
none	none	I am General Alexeyev he cried
6694_70837_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 As your superior officer and as a member of the Council of the Republic I demand to be allowed to pass 
6694_70837_000029_000002	train-clean-360	The guard scratched his head looking uneasily out of the corner of his eye he beckoned to an approaching officer who grew very agitated when he saw who it was and saluted before he realised what he was doing 
none	none	Vashe Vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo your High Excellency he stammered in the manner of the old regime Access to the Palace is strictly forbidden I have no right 
6694_70837_000031_000000	train-clean-360	An automobile came by and I saw Gotz sitting inside laughing apparently with great amusement 
6694_70837_000031_000001	train-clean-360	A few minutes later another with armed soldiers on the front seat full of arrested members of the Provisional Government 
6694_70837_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Peters Lettish member of the Military Revolutionary Committee came hurrying across the Square 
6694_70837_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you bagged all those gentlemen last night said I pointing to them 
6694_70837_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he answered with the expression of a disappointed small boy The damn fools let most of them go again before we made up our minds 
none	none	Down the Voskressensky Prospect a great mass of sailors were drawn up and behind them came marching soldiers as far as the eye could reach 
6694_70837_000035_000000	train-clean-360	We went toward the Winter Palace by way of the Admiralteisky 
6694_70837_000035_000001	train-clean-360	All the entrances to the Palace Square were closed by sentries and a cordon of troops stretched clear across the western end besieged by an uneasy throng of citizens 
6694_70837_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Except for far away soldiers who seemed to be carrying wood out of the Palace courtyard and piling it in front of the main gateway everything was quiet 
6694_70837_000036_000000	train-clean-360	We couldn t make out whether the sentries were pro Government or pro Soviet 
6694_70837_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Our papers from Smolny had no effect however so we approached another part of the line with an important air and showed our American passports saying Official business and shouldered through 
none	none	At the door of the Palace the same old shveitzari in their brass buttoned blue uniforms with the red and gold collars politely took our coats and hats and we went up stairs 
6694_70837_000036_000003	train-clean-360	In the dark gloomy corridor stripped of its tapestries a few old attendants were lounging about and in front of Kerensky s door a young officer paced up and down gnawing his moustache 
6694_70837_000036_000004	train-clean-360	We asked if we could interview the Minister president 
6694_70837_000036_000005	train-clean-360	He bowed and clicked his heels 
6694_70837_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 No I am sorry he replied in French 
none	none	Alexander Feodorvitch is extremely occupied just now He looked at us for a moment
6694_70837_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 In fact he is not here 
6694_70837_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is he

6694_70837_000039_000002	train-clean-360	We had to send to the English Hospital and borrow some 
none	none	Are the Ministers here
6694_70837_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 They are meeting in some room I don t know where 
6694_70837_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Are the Bolsheviki coming 
none	none	Of course 
6694_70837_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Certainly they are coming 
6694_70837_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I expect a telephone call every minute to say that they are coming 
6694_70837_000043_000003	train-clean-360	But we are ready 
none	none	We have yunkers in the front of the Palace Through that door there
6694_70837_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Can we go in there 
6694_70837_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 No Certainly not 
6694_70837_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It is not permitted Abruptly he shook hands all around and walked away 
6694_70837_000045_000002	train-clean-360	We turned to the forbidden door set in a temporary partition dividing the hall and locked on the outside On the other side were voices and somebody laughing 
6694_70837_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Except for that the vast spaces of the old Palace were silent as the grave 
none	none	An old shveitzar ran up No barin you must not go in there
6694_70837_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Why is the door locked 
6694_70837_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 To keep the soldiers in he answered 
6694_70837_000047_000001	train-clean-360	After a few minutes he said something about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall 
6694_70837_000047_000002	train-clean-360	We unlocked the door 
6694_70837_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Just inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard but they said nothing 
none	none	At the end of the corridor was a large ornate room with gilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres and beyond it several smaller ones wainscoted with dark wood 
6694_70837_000048_000002	train-clean-360	On both sides of the parquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets upon which occasional soldiers were stretched out everywhere was a litter of cigarette butts bits of bread cloth and empty bottles with expensive French labels 
none	none	More and more soldiers with the red shoulder straps of the yunker schools moved about in a stale atmosphere of tobacco smoke and unwashed humanity 
6694_70837_000048_000004	train-clean-360	One had a bottle of white Burgundy evidently filched from the cellars of the Palace They looked at us with astonishment as we marched past through room after room until at last we came out into a series of great state salons fronting their long and dirty windows on the Square The walls were covered with huge canvases in massive gilt frames historical battle scenes 
none	none	twelve October eighteen twelve and six November eighteen twelve and sixteen twenty eight August eighteen thirteen 
6694_70837_000048_000006	train-clean-360	One had a gash across the upper right hand corner 
6694_70837_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The place was all a huge barrack and evidently had been for weeks from the look of the floor and walls 
6694_70837_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Machine guns were mounted on window sills rifles stacked between the mattresses 
none	none	As we were looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed me from the region of my left ear and a voice said in thick but fluent French I see by the way you admire the paintings that you are foreigners He was a short puffy man with a baldish head as he removed his cap Americans 
6694_70837_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Enchanted 
6694_70837_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I am Stabs Capitan Vladimir Artzibashev absolutely at your service 
6694_70837_000051_000003	train-clean-360	It did not seem to occur to him that there was anything unusual in four strangers one a woman wandering through the defences of an army awaiting attack 
6694_70837_000051_000004	train-clean-360	He began to complain of the state of Russia 
6694_70837_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Not only these Bolsheviki he said but the fine traditions of the Russian army are broken down 
6694_70837_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Look around you 
none	none	These are all students in the officers training schools But are they gentlemen Kerensky opened the officers schools to the ranks to any soldier who could pass an examination 
6694_70837_000052_000004	train-clean-360	Naturally there are many many who are contaminated by the Revolution 
6694_70837_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Without consequence he changed the subject 
6694_70837_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 I am very anxious to go away from Russia 
6694_70837_000053_000002	train-clean-360	I have made up my mind to join the American army Will you please go to your Consul and make arrangements 
6694_70837_000053_000003	train-clean-360	I will give you my address In spite of our protestations he wrote it on a piece of paper and seemed to feel better at once 
none	none	I have it still Oranien baumskaya Shkola Praporshtchikov second Staraya Peterhof
6694_70837_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 We had a review this morning early he went on as he guided us through the rooms and explained everything 
6694_70837_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 The Women s Battalion decided to remain loyal to the Government 
6694_70837_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Are the women soldiers in the Palace 
6694_70837_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes they are in the back rooms where they won t be hurt if any trouble comes He sighed 
6694_70837_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 It is a great responsibility said he 
none	none	For a while we stood at the window looking down on the Square before the Palace where three companies of long coated yunkers were drawn up under arms being harangued by a tall energetic looking officer I recognised as Stankievitch chief Military Commissar of the Provisional Government 
6694_70837_000057_000001	train-clean-360	After a few minutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash barked three sharp shouts and went swinging off across the Square disappearing through the Red Arch into the quiet city 
6694_70837_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 They are going to capture the Telephone Exchange said some one Three cadets stood by us and we fell into conversation 
none	none	They said they had entered the schools from the ranks and gave their names Robert Olev Alexei Vasilienko and Erni Sachs an Esthonian But now they didn t want to be officers any more because officers were very unpopular 
6694_70837_000058_000002	train-clean-360	They didn t seem to know what to do as a matter of fact and it was plain that they were not happy 
6694_70837_000059_000000	train-clean-360	But soon they began to boast 
6694_70837_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 If the Bolsheviki come we shall show them how to fight 
6694_70837_000059_000002	train-clean-360	They do not dare to fight they are cowards 
6694_70837_000059_000003	train-clean-360	But if we should be overpowered well every man keeps one bullet for himself 
6694_70837_000060_000000	train-clean-360	At this point there was a burst of rifle fire not far off 
none	none	Out on the Square all the people began to run falling flat on their faces and the izvoshtchiki standing on the corners galloped in every direction 
6694_70837_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Inside all was uproar soldiers running here and there grabbing up guns rifle belts and shouting Here they come 
6694_70837_000060_000003	train-clean-360	Here they come 
none	none	Here they come 
6694_70837_000060_000004	train-clean-360	But in a few minutes it quieted down again 
none	none	The izvoshtchiki came back the people lying down stood up Through the Red Arch appeared the yunkers marching a little out of step one of them supported by two comrades 
6694_70837_000061_000000	train-clean-360	It was getting late when we left the Palace 
6694_70837_000061_000001	train-clean-360	The sentries in the Square had all disappeared 
6694_70837_000061_000002	train-clean-360	The great semi circle of Government buildings seemed deserted 
6694_70837_000061_000003	train-clean-360	We went into the Hotel France for dinner and right in the middle of soup the waiter very pale in the face came up and insisted that we move to the main dining room at the back of the house because they were going to put out the lights in the cafe 
6694_70837_000061_000004	train-clean-360	 There will be much shooting he said 
6694_70837_000062_000000	train-clean-360	When we came out on the Morskaya again it was quite dark except for one flickering street light on the corner of the Nevsky 
6694_70837_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Under this stood a big armored automobile with racing engine and oil smoke pouring out of it 
6694_70837_000062_000002	train-clean-360	A small boy had climbed up the side of the thing and was looking down the barrel of a machine gun 
6694_70837_000062_000003	train-clean-360	Soldiers and sailors stood around evidently waiting for something 
6694_70837_000062_000004	train-clean-360	We walked back up to the Red Arch where a knot of soldiers was gathered staring at the brightly lighted Winter Palace and talking in loud tones 
6694_70837_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 No comrades one was saying 
6694_70837_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 How can we shoot at them 
6694_70837_000063_000002	train-clean-360	The Women s Battalion is in there they will say we have fired on Russian women 
6694_70837_000064_000000	train-clean-360	As we reached the Nevsky again another armoured car came around the corner and a man poked his head out of the turret top 
6694_70837_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Come on he yelled 
6694_70837_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 Let s go on through and attack 
6694_70837_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The driver of the other car came over and shouted so as to be heard above the roaring engine 
6694_70837_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 The Committee says to wait 
6694_70837_000066_000002	train-clean-360	They have got artillery behind the wood piles in there 
6694_70837_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Here the street cars had stopped running few people passed and there were no lights but a few blocks away we could see the trams the crowds the lighted shop windows and the electric signs of the moving picture shows life going on as usual 
6694_70837_000067_000001	train-clean-360	We had tickets to the Ballet at the Marinsky Theatre all theatres were open but it was too exciting out of doors 
none	none	In the darkness we stumbled over lumber piles barricading the Police Bridge and before the Stroganov Palace made out some soldiers wheeling into position a three inch field gun 
6694_70837_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Men in various uniforms were coming and going in an aimless way and doing a great deal of talking 
6694_70837_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Up the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out promenading 
none	none	On every corner immense crowds were massed around a core of hot discussion Pickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at the street crossings red faced old men in rich fur coats shook their fists at them smartly dressed women screamed epithets the soldiers argued feebly with embarrassed grins Armoured cars went up and down the street named after the first Tsars Oleg Rurik Svietoslav and daubed with huge red letters R S D R P Rossiskaya Partia thirteen 
6694_70837_000069_000003	train-clean-360	At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an armful of newspapers and was immediately stormed by frantic people offering a rouble five roubles ten roubles tearing at each other like animals 
none	none	It was Rabotchi i Soldat announcing the victory of the Proletarian Revolution the liberation of the Bolsheviki still in prison calling upon the Army front and rear for support a feverish little sheet of four pages running to enormous type containing no news thirteen Russian Social Democratic Labor Party 
6694_70837_000071_000000	train-clean-360	On the corner of the Sadovaya about two thousand citizens had gathered staring up at the roof of a tall building where a tiny red spark glowed and waned 
6694_70837_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 See said a tall peasant pointing to it 
none	none	It is a provocator Presently he will fire on the people Apparently no one thought of going to investigate 
6694_70837_000073_000000	train-clean-360	The massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove up and from every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes dim in the gloom 
6694_70837_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Automobiles and motorcycles came and went an enormous elephant coloured armoured automobile with two red flags flying from the turret lumbered out with screaming siren 
6694_70837_000073_000002	train-clean-360	It was cold and at the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bon fire 
6694_70837_000073_000003	train-clean-360	At the inner gate too there was a blaze by the light of which the sentries slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down The canvas covers had been taken off the four rapid fire guns on each side of the doorway and the ammunition belts hung snakelike from their breeches 
6694_70837_000073_000004	train-clean-360	A dun herd of armoured cars stood under the trees in the court yard engines going 
6694_70837_000073_000005	train-clean-360	The long bare dimly illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet calling shouting 
6694_70837_000073_000006	train-clean-360	There was an atmosphere of recklessness 
none	none	A crowd came pouring down the staircase workers in black blouses and round black fur hats many of them with guns slung over their shoulders soldiers in rough dirt coloured coats and grey fur shapki pinched flat a leader or so Lunatcharsky Kameniev hurrying along in the centre of a group all talking at once with harassed anxious faces and bulging portfolios under their arms 
6694_70837_000073_000008	train-clean-360	The extraordinary meeting of the Petrograd Soviet was over 
none	none	I stopped Kameniev a quick moving little man with a wide vivacious face set close to his shoulders Without preface he read in rapid French a copy of the resolution just passed 
6694_70837_000074_000000	train-clean-360	The Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies saluting the victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison particularly emphasises the unity organisation discipline and complete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising rarely has less blood been spilled and rarely has an insurrection succeeded so well 
6694_70837_000075_000000	train-clean-360	The Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the Workers and Peasants Government which as the government of the Soviets will be created by the Revolution and which will assure the industrial proletariat of the support of the entire mass of poor peasants will march firmly toward Socialism the only means by which the country can be spared the miseries and unheard of horrors of war

6694_70837_000095_000007	train-clean-360	If the Congress wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy it must not sit with folded hands before the developing civil war the result of which may be a dangerous outburst of counter revolution The possibility of a peaceful outcome lies in the formation of a united democratic authority

6694_70837_000098_000009	train-clean-360	The Army is imperfectly represented in this Congress and furthermore the Army does not consider the Congress of Soviets necessary at this time only three weeks before the opening of the Constituent shouts and stamping always growing more violent

6694_70837_000106_000000	train-clean-360	On behalf of the Mensheviki Khintchuk then announced that the only possibility of a peaceful solution was to begin negotiations with the Provisional Government for the formation of a new Cabinet which would find support in all strata of society 
6694_70837_000106_000001	train-clean-360	He could not proceed for several minutes 
6694_70837_000106_000002	train-clean-360	Raising his voice to a shout he read the Menshevik declaration 
6694_70837_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 Because the Bolsheviki have made a military conspiracy with the aid of the Petrograd Soviet without consulting the other factions and parties we find it impossible to remain in the Congress and therefore withdraw inviting the other groups to follow us and to meet for discussion of the situation

6694_70837_000108_000001	train-clean-360	At intervals in the almost continuous disturbance Hendelman for the Socialist Revolutionaries could be heard protesting against the bombardment of the Winter Palace 
6694_70837_000108_000002	train-clean-360	 We are opposed to this kind of anarchy 
6694_70837_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Scarcely had he stepped down than a young lean faced soldier with flashing eyes leaped to the platform and dramatically lifted his hand 
6694_70837_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Comrades he cried and there was a hush 
none	none	My familia name is Peterson I speak for the Second Lettish Rifles You have heard the statements of two representatives of the Army committees these statements would have some value if their authors had been representatives of the Army Wild applause But they do not represent the soldiers Shaking his fist The Twelfth Army has been insisting for a long time upon the re election of the Great Soviet and the Army Committee but just as your own Tsay ee kah our Committee refused to call a meeting of the representatives of the masses until the end of September so that the reactionaries could elect their own false delegates to this Congress 
6694_70837_000110_000005	train-clean-360	I tell you now the Lettish soldiers have many times said No more resolutions 
6694_70837_000110_000006	train-clean-360	No more talk

6694_70837_000110_000008	train-clean-360	The Army is not with them 
6694_70837_000111_000000	train-clean-360	The hall rocked with cheering 
6694_70837_000111_000001	train-clean-360	In the first moments of the session stunned by the rapidity of events startled by the sound of cannon the delegates had hesitated 
6694_70837_000111_000002	train-clean-360	For an hour hammer blow after hammer blow had fallen from that tribune welding them together but beating them down 
6694_70837_000111_000003	train-clean-360	Did they stand then alone 
6694_70837_000111_000004	train-clean-360	Was Russia rising against them 
none	none	Was it true that the Army was marching on Petrograd Then this clear eyed young soldier had spoken and in a flash they knew it for the truth This was the voice of the soldiers the stirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men like them and their thoughts and feelings were the same More soldiers Gzhelshakh for the Front delegates announcing that they had only decided to leave the Congress by a small majority and that the Bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote as they stood for division according to political parties and not groups Hundreds of delegates from the Front he said are being elected without the participation of the soldiers because the Army Committees are no longer the real representatives of the rank and file Lukianov crying that officers like Kharash and Khintchuk could not represent the Army in this congress but only the high command The real inhabitants of the trenches want with all their hearts the transfer of Power into the hands of the Soviets and they expect very much from it The tide was turning Then came Abramovitch for the Bund the organ of the Jewish Social Democrats his eyes snapping behind thick glasses trembling with rage What is taking place now in Petrograd is a monstrous calamity The Bund group joins with the declaration of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries and will leave the Congress He raised his voice and hand Our duty to the Russian proletariat doesn t permit us to remain here and be responsible for these crimes Because the firing on the Winter Palace doesn t cease the Municipal Duma together with the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries and the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviet has decided to perish with the Provisional Government and we are going with them Unarmed we will expose our breasts to the machine guns of the Terrorists We invite all delegates to this Congress The rest was lost in a storm of hoots menaces and curses which rose to a hellish pitch as fifty delegates got up and pushed their way out Kameniev jangled the bell shouting Keep your seats and we ll go on with our business And Trotzky standing up with a pale cruel face letting out his rich voice in cool contempt All these so called Socialist compromisers these frightened Mensheviki Socialist Revolutionaries Bund let them go They are just so much refuse which will be swept into the garbage heap of history Riazanov for the Bolsheviki stated that at the request of the City Duma the Military Revolutionary Committee had sent a delegation to offer negotiations to the Winter Palace In this way we have done everything possible to avoid blood shed We hurried from the place stopping for a moment at the room where the Military Revolutionary Committee worked at furious speed engulfing and spitting out panting couriers despatching Commissars armed with power of life and death to all the corners of the city amid the buzz of the telephonographs The door opened a blast of stale air and cigarette smoke rushed out we caught a glimpse of dishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a shaded electric light Comrade Josephov Dukhvinski a smiling youth with a mop of pale yellow hair made out passes for us When we came into the chill night all the front of Smolny was one huge park of arriving and departing automobiles above the sound of which could be heard the far off slow beat of the cannon A great motor truck stood there shaking to the roar of its engine Men were tossing bundles into it and others receiving them with guns beside them Where are you going I shouted Down town all over everywhere answered a little workman grinning with a large exultant gesture We showed our passes Come along they invited But there ll probably be shooting We climbed in the clutch slid home with a raking jar the great car jerked forward we all toppled backward on top of those who were climbing in past the huge fire by the gate and then the fire by the outer gate glowing red on the faces of the workmen with rifles who squatted around it and went bumping at top speed down the Suvorovsky Prospect swaying from side to side One man tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls of papers into the air We imitated him plunging down through the dark street with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out behind The late passerby stooped to pick them up the patrols around bonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch them Sometimes armed men loomed up ahead crying Shtoi and raising their guns but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligible and we hurtled on I picked up a copy of the paper and under a fleeting street light read TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA The Provisional Government is deposed The State Power has passed into the hands of the organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies the Military Revolutionary Committee which stands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison The cause for which the

achieved LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS Military Revolutionary Committee Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Graphic page ninety six Proclamation in Russian title follows Proclamation of the Fall of the Provisional Government issued by the Military Revolutionary Committee on the night of November seventh our calendar which we helped to distribute from a motor truck just after the surrender of the Winter Palace A slant eyed Mongolian faced man who sat beside me dressed in a goat skin Caucasian cape snapped Look out Here the provocators always shoot from the windows We turned into Znamensky Square dark and almost deserted careened around Trubetskoy s brutal statue and swung down the wide Nevsky three men standing up with rifles ready peering at the windows Behind us the street was alive with people running and stooping We could no longer hear the cannon and the nearer we drew to the Winter Palace end of the city the quieter and more deserted were the streets The City Duma was all brightly lighted Beyond that we made out a dark mass of people and a line of sailors who yelled furiously at us to stop The machine slowed down and we climbed out It was an astonishing scene Just at the corner of the Ekaterina Canal under an arc light a cordon of armed sailors was drawn across the Nevsky blocking the way to a crowd of people in column of fours There were about three or four hundred of them men in frock coats well dressed women officers all sorts and conditions of people Among them we recognised many of the delegates from the Congress leaders of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries Avksentiev the lean red bearded president of the Peasants Soviets Sarokin Kerensky s spokesman Khintchuk Abramovitch and at the head white bearded old Schreider Mayor of Petrograd and Prokopovitch Minister of Supplies in the Provisional Government arrested that morning and released I caught sight of Malkin reporter for the Russian Daily News Going to die in the Winter Palace he shouted cheerfully The procession stood still but from the front of it came loud argument Schreider and Prokopovitch were bellowing at the big sailor who seemed in command We demand to pass they cried See these comrades come from the Congress of Soviets Look at their tickets We are going to the Winter Palace The sailor was plainly puzzled 
6981_70843_000093_000000	train-clean-360	He scratched his head 
none	none	with an enormous hand frowning I have orders from the Committee not to let anybody go to the Winter Palace he grumbled But I will send a comrade to telephone to Smolny We Insist upon passing We are unarmed We will march on whether you permit us or not cried old Schreider very much excited I have orders repeated the sailor sullenly Shoot us if you want to We will pass Forward came from all sides We are ready to die if you have the heart to fire on Russians and comrades We bare our breasts to your guns No said the sailor looking stubborn I can t allow you to pass What will you do if we go forward Will you shoot No I m not going to shoot people who haven t any guns We won t shoot unarmed Russian people We will go forward What can you do We will do something replied the sailor evidently at a loss We can t let you pass We will do something What will you do What will you do Another sailor came up very much irritated We will spank you he cried energetically And if necessary we will shoot you too Go home now and leave us in peace At this there was a great clamour of anger and resentment Prokopovitch had mounted some sort of box and waving his umbrella he made a speech Comrades and citizens he said Force is being used against us We cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands of these ignorant men It is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in the street by switchmen What he meant by switchmen I never discovered Let us return to the Duma and discuss the best means of saving the country and the Revolution Whereupon in dignified silence the procession marched around and back up the Nevsky always in column of fours And taking advantage of the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in the direction of the Winter Palace Here it was absolutely dark and nothing moved but pickets of soldiers and Red Guards grimly intent In front of the Kazan Cathedral a three inch field gun lay in the middle of the street slewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofs Soldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones and peering down toward the Police Bridge I heard one voice saying It is possible that we have done wrong At the corners patrols stopped all passersby and the composition of these patrols was interesting for in command of the regular troops was invariably a Red Guard The shooting had ceased Just as we came to the Morskaya somebody was shouting The yunkers have sent word they want us to go and get them out Voices began to give commands and in the thick gloom we made out a dark mass moving forward silent but for the shuffle of feet and the clinking of arms We fell in with the first ranks Like a black river filling all the street without song or cheer we poured through the Red Arch where the man just ahead of me said in a low voice Look out comrades Don t trust them They will fire surely In the open we began to run stooping low and bunching together and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of the Alexander Column How many of you did they kill I asked I don t know About ten After a few minutes huddling there some hundreds of men the army seemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flow forward By this time in the light that streamed out of all the Winter Palace windows I could see that the first two or three hundred men were Red Guards with only a few scattered soldiers Over the barricade of firewood we clambered and leaping down inside gave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles thrown down by the yunkers who had stood there On both sides of the main gateway the doors stood wide open light streamed out and from the huge pile came not the slightest sound Carried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the right hand entrance opening into a great bare vaulted room the cellar of the East wing from which issued a maze of corridors and stair cases A number of huge packing cases stood about and upon these the Red Guards and soldiers fell furiously battering them open with the butts of their rifles and pulling out carpets curtains linen porcelain plates glassware One man went strutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulder another found a plume of ostrich feathers which he stuck in his hat The looting was just beginning when somebody cried Comrades Don t touch anything Don t take anything This is the property of the People Immediately twenty voices were crying Stop Put everything back Don t take anything Property of the People Many hands dragged the spoilers down Damask and tapestry were snatched from the arms of those who had them two men took away the bronze clock Roughly and hastily the things were crammed back in their cases and self appointed sentinels stood guard It was all utterly spontaneous Through corridors and up stair cases the cry could be heard growing fainter and fainter in the distance Revolutionary discipline Property of the People We crossed back over to the left entrance in the West wing There order was also being established Clear the Palace bawled a Red Guard sticking his head through an inner door Come comrades let s show that we re not thieves and bandits Everybody out of the Palace except the Commissars until we get sentries posted Two Red Guards a soldier and an officer stood with revolvers in their hands Another soldier sat at a table behind them with pen and paper Shouts of All out All out were heard far and near within and the Army began to pour through the door jostling expostulating arguing As each man appeared he was seized by the self appointed committee who went through his pockets and looked under his coat Everything that was plainly not his property was taken away the man at the table noted it on his paper and it was carried into a little room The most amazing assortment of objects were thus confiscated statuettes bottles of ink bed spreads worked with the Imperial monogram candles a small oil painting desk blotters gold handled swords cakes of soap clothes of every description blankets One Red Guard carried three rifles two of which he had taken away from yunkers another had four portfolios bulging with written documents The culprits either sullenly surrendered or pleaded like children All talking at once the committee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people s champions often those who had been caught turned around and began to help go through the rest of the comrades See App IV Sect three Yunkers came out in bunches of three or four The committee seized upon them with an excess of zeal accompanying the search with remarks like Ah Provocators Kornilovists Counter revolutionists Murderers of the People But there was no violence done although the yunkers were terrified They too had their pockets full of small plunder It was carefully noted down by the scribe and piled in the little room The yunkers were disarmed Now will you take up arms against the People any more demanded clamouring voices No answered the yunkers one by one Whereupon they were allowed to go free We asked if we might go inside The committee was doubtful but the big Red Guard answered firmly that it was forbidden Who are you anyway he asked How do I know that you are not all Kerenskys There were five of us two women Pazhal saint touarishtchi Way Comrades A soldier and a Red Guard appeared in the door waving the crowd aside and other guards with fixed bayonets After them followed single file half a dozen men in civilian dress the members of the Provisional Government First came Kishkin his face drawn and pale then Rutenberg looking sullenly at the floor Terestchenko was next glancing sharply around he stared at us with cold fixity They passed in silence the victorious insurrectionists crowded to see but there were only a few angry mutterings It was only later that we learned how the people in the street wanted to lynch them and shots were fired but the sailors brought them safely to Peter Paul In the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the Palace There was still a great deal of coming and going of exploring new found apartments in the vast edifice of searching for hidden garrisons of yunkers which did not exist We went upstairs and wandered through room after room This part of the Palace had been entered also by other detachments from the side of the Neva The paintings statues tapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed in the offices however every desk and cabinet had been ransacked the papers scattered over the floor and in the living rooms beds had been stripped of their coverings and ward robes wrenched open The most highly prized loot was clothing which the working people needed In a room where furniture was stored we came upon two soldiers ripping the elaborate Spanish leather upholstery from chairs They explained it was to make boots with The old Palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniforms stood nervously about from force of habit repeating You can t go in there barin It is forbidden We penetrated at length to the gold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where the Ministers had been in session all that day and night and where the shveitzari had betrayed them to the Red Guards The long table covered with green baize was just as they had left it under arrest Before each empty seat was pen and ink and paper the papers were scribbled over with beginnings of plans of action rough drafts of proclamations and manifestos Most of these were scratched out as their futility became evident and the rest of the sheet covered with absent minded geometrical designs as the writers sat despondently listening while Minister after Minister proposed chimerical schemes I took one of these scribbled pages in the hand writing of Konovalov which read The Provisional Government appeals to all classes to support the Provisional Government All this time it must be remembered although the Winter Palace was surrounded the Government was in constant communication with the Front and with provincial Russia The Bolsheviki had captured the Ministry of War early in the morning but they did not know of the military telegraph office in the attic nor of the private telephone line connecting it with the Winter Palace In that attic a young officer sat all day pouring out over the country a flood of appeals and proclamations and when he heard that the Palace had fallen put on his hat and walked calmly out of the building Interested as we were for a considerable time we didn t notice a change in the attitude of the soldiers and Red Guards around us As we strolled from room to room a small group followed us until by the time we reached the great picture gallery where we had spent the afternoon with the yunkers about a hundred men surged in after us One giant of a soldier stood in our path his face dark with sullen suspicion Graphic page one hundred four Doodling by Konavalov title follows Facsimile of the beginning of a proclamation written in pencil by A I Konovalov Minister of Commerce and Industry in he Provisional Government and then scratched out as the hopelessness of the situation became more and more evident The geometrical figure beneath was probably idly drawn while the Ministers were waiting for the end Who are you he growled What are you doing here The others massed slowly around staring and beginning to mutter Provocatori I heard somebody say Looters I produced our passes from the Military Revolutionary Committee The soldier took them gingerly turned them upside down and looked at them without comprehension Evidently he could not read He handed them back and spat on the floor Bumagi Papers said he with contempt The mass slowly began to close in like wild cattle around a cowpuncher on foot Over their heads I caught sight of an officer looking helpless and shouted to him He made for us shouldering his way through I m the Commissar he said to me Who are you What is it The others held back waiting I produced the papers You are foreigners he rapidly asked in Franch It is very dangerous Then he turned to the mob holding up our documents Comrades he cried These people are foreign comrades from America They have come here to be able to tell their countrymen about the bravery and the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army How do you know that replied the big soldier I tell you they are provocators They say they came here to observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletarian army but they have been wandering freely through the Palace and how do we know they haven t got their pockets full of loot Pravilno snarled the others pressing forward Comrades Comrades appealed the officer sweat standing out on his forehead I am Commissar of the Military Revolutionary Committee Do you trust me Well I tell you that these passes are signed with the same names that are signed to my pass He led us down through the Palace and out through a door opening onto the Neva quay before which stood the usual committee going through pockets You have narrowly escaped he kept muttering wiping his face What happened to the Women s Battalion we asked Oh the women He laughed They were all huddled up in a back room We had a terrible time deciding what to do with them many were in hysterics and so on So finally we marched them up to the Finland Station and put them on a train for Levashovo where they have a camp See App IV Sect four We came out into the cold nervous night murmurous with obscure armies on the move electric with patrols From across the river where loomed the darker mass of Peter Paul came a hoarse shout Underfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco from the cornice of the Palace where two shells from the battleship Avrora had struck that was the only damage done by the bombardment It was now after three in the morning On the Nevsky all the street lights were again shining the cannon gone and the only signs of war were Red Guards and soldiers squatting around fires The city was quiet probably never so quiet in its history on that night not a single hold up occurred not a single robbery But the City Duma Building was all illuminated We mounted to the galleried Alexander Hall hung with its great gold framed red shrouded Imperial portraits About a hundred people were grouped around the platform where Skobeliev was speaking He urged that the Committee of Public Safety be expanded so as to unite all the anti Bolshevik elements in one huge organisation to be called the Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution And as we looked on the Committee for Salvation was formed that Committee which was to develop into the most powerful enemy of the Bolsheviki appearing in the next week sometimes under its own partisan name and sometimes as the strictly non partisan Committee of Public Safety Dan Gotz Avkesntiev were there some of the insurgent Soviet delegates members of the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets old Prokopovitch and even members of the Council of the Republic among whom Vinaver and other Cadets Lieber cried that the convention of Soviets was not a legal convention that the old Tsay ee kah was still in office An appeal to the country was drafted We hailed a cab Where to But when we said Smolny the izvoshtchik shook his head Niet said he there are devils It was only after weary wandering that we found a driver willing to take us and he wanted thirty rubles and stopped two blocks away The windows of Smolny were still ablaze motors came and went and around the still leaping fires the sentries huddled close eagerly asking everybody the latest news The corridors were full of hurrying men hollow eyed and dirty In some of the committee rooms people lay sleeping on the floor their guns beside them In spite of the seceding delegates the hall of meetings was crowded with people roaring like the sea As we came in Kameniev was reading the list of arrested Ministers The name of Terestchenko was greeted with thunderous applause shouts of satisfaction laughter Rutenburg came in for less and at the mention of Paltchinsky a storm of hoots angry cries cheers burst forth It was announced that Tchudnovsky had been appointed Commissar of the Winter Palace Now occurred a dramatic interruption A big peasant his bearded face convulsed with rage mounted the platform and pounded with his fist on the presidium table We Socialist Revolutionaries insist upon the immediate release of the Socialist Ministers arrested in the Winter Palace Comrades Do you know that four comrades who risked their lives and their freedom fighting against tyranny of the Tsar have been flung into Peter Paul prison the historical tomb of Liberty In the uproar he pounded and yelled Another delegate climbed up beside him and pointed at the presidium Are the representatives of the revolutionary masses going to sit quietly here while the Okhrana of the Bolsheviki tortures their leaders Trotzky was gesturing for silence These comrades who are now caught plotting the crushing of the Soviets with the adventurer Kerensky is there any reason to handle them with gloves After July sixteenth and eighteenth they didn t use much ceremony with us With a triumphant ring in his voice he cried Now that the oborontsi and the faint hearted have gone and the whole task of defending and saving the Revolution rests on our shoulders it is particularly necessary to work work work We have decided to die rather than give up Followed him a Commissar from Tsarskoye Selo panting and covered with the mud of his ride The garrison of Tsarskoye Selo is on guard at the gates of Petrograd ready to defend the Soviets and the Military Revolutionary Committee Wild cheers The Cycle Corps sent from the front has arrived at Tsarskoye and the soldiers are now with us they recognise the power of the Soviets the necessity of immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial control to the workers The Fifth Battalion of Cyclists stationed at Tsarskoye is ours Then the delegate of the Third Cycle Battalion In the midst of delirious enthusiasm he told how the cycle corps had been ordered three days before from the South west front to the defence of Petrograd They suspected however the meaning of the order and at the station of Peredolsk were met by representatives of the Fifth Battalion from Tsarskoye A joint meeting was held and it was discovered that among the cyclists not a single man was found willing to shed the blood of his brothers or to support a Government of bourgeois and land owners Kapelinski for the Mensheviki Internationalists proposed to elect a special committee to find a peaceful solution to the civil war There isn t any peaceful solution bellowed the crowed Victory is the only solution The vote was overwhelmingly against and the Mensheviki Internationalists left the Congress in a Whirlwind of Jocular insults There was no longer any panic fear Kameniev from the platform shouted after them The Mensheviki Internationalists claimed emergency for the question of a peaceful solution but they always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favour of declarations of factions which wanted to leave the Congress It is evident finished Kameniev that the withdrawal of all these renegades was decided upon beforehand The assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal of the factions and proceed to the appeal to the workers soldiers and peasants of all Russia TO WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS The Second All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies has opened It represents the great majority of the Soviets There are also a number of Peasant deputies Based upon the will of the great majority of the workers soldiers and peasants based upon the triumphant uprising of the Petrograd workmen and soldiers the Congress assumes the Power The Provisional Government is deposed Most of the members of the Provisional Government are already arrested The Soviet authority will at once propose an immediate democratic peace to all nations and an immediate truce on all fronts It will assure the free transfer of landlord crown and monastery lands to the Land Committees defend the soldiers rights enforcing a complete democratisation of the Army establish workers control over production ensure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the proper date take means to supply bread to the cities and articles of first necessity to the villages and secure to all nationalities living in Russia a real right to independent existence The Congress resolves that all local power shall be transferred to the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies which must enforce revolutionary order The Congress calls upon the soldiers in the trenches to be watchful and steadfast The Congress of Soviets is sure that the revolutionary Army will know how to defend the Revolution against all attacks of Imperialism until the new Government shall have brought about the conclusion of the democratic peace which it will directly propose to all nations The new Government will take all necessary steps to secure everything needful to the revolutionary Army by means of a determined policy of requisition and taxation of the propertied classes and also to improve the situation of soldiers families The Kornilovitz Kerensky Kaledin and others are endeavouring to lead troops against Petrograd Several regiments deceived by Kerensky have sided with the insurgent People Soldiers Make active resistance to the Kornilovitz Kerensky Be on guard Railway men Stop all troop trains being sent by Kerensky against Petrograd Soldiers Workers Clerical employees The destiny of the Revolution and democratic peace is in your hands Long live the Revolution The All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Delegates from the Peasants Soviets It was exactly five seventeen A M when Krylenko staggering with fatigue climbed to the tribune with a telegram in his hand Comrades From the Northern Front The Twelfth Army sends greetings to the Congress of Soviets announcing the formation of a Military Revolutionary Committee which has taken over the command of the Northern Front Pandemonium men weeping embracing each other General Tchermissov has recognised the Committee Commissar of the Provisional Government Voitinsky has resigned So Lenin and the Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection the Petrograd Soviet had overthrown the Provisional Government and thrust the coup d etat upon the Congress of Soviets Now there was all great Russia to win and then the world Would Russia follow and rise And the world what of it Would the peoples answer and rise a red world tide Although it was six in the morning night was yet heavy and chill There was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the silent streets dimming the watch fires the shadow of a terrible dawn grey rising over Russia Chapter V Plunging Ahead Thursday November eighth Day broke on a city in the wildest excitement and confusion a whole nation having up in long hissing swells of storm Superficially all was quiet hundreds of thousands of people retired at a prudent hour got up early and went to work In Petrograd the street cars were running the stores and restaurants open theatres going an exhibition of paintings advertised All the complex routine of common life humdrum even in war time proceeded as usual Nothing is so astounding as the vitality of the social organism how it persists feeding itself clothing itself amusing itself in the face of the worst calamities The air was full of rumours about Kerensky who was said to have raised the Front and to be leading a great army against the capital Volia Naroda published a prikaz launched by him at Pskov The disorders caused by the insane attempt of the Bolsheviki place the country on the verge of a precipice and demand the effort of our entire will our courage and the devotion of every one of us to win through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing Until the declaration of the composition of the new Government if one is formed every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil his duty toward bleeding Russia It must be remembered that the least interference with existing Army organisations can bring on irreparable misfortunes by opening the Front to the enemy Therefore it is indispensable to preserve at any price the morale of the troops by assuring complete order and the preservation of the Army from new shocks and by maintaining absolute confidence between officers and their subordinates I order all the chiefs and Commissars in the name of the safety of the country to stay at their posts as I myself retain the post of Supreme Commander until the Provisional Government of the Republic shall declare its will In answer this placard on all the walls FROM THE ALL RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS The ex Ministers Konovalov Kishkin Terestchenko Maliantovitch Nikitin and others have been arrested by the Military Revolutionary Committee Kerensky has fled All Army organisations are ordered to take every measure for the immediate arrest of Kerensky and his conveyance to Petrograd All assistance given to Kerensky will be punished as a serious crime against the state With brakes released the Military Revolutionary Committee whirled throwing off orders appeals decrees like sparks See App V Sect one Kornilov was ordered brought to Petrograd Members of the Peasant Land Committees imprisoned by the Provisional Government were declared free Capital punishment in the army was abolished Government employees were ordered to continue their work and threatened with severe penalties if they refused All pillage disorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of death Temporary Commissars were appointed to the various Ministries Foreign Affairs Vuritsky and Trotzky Interior and Justice Rykov Labor Shliapnikov Finance Menzhinsky Public Welfare Madame Kollontai Commerce Ways and Communications Riazanov Navy the sailor Korbir Posts and Telegraphs Spiro Theatres Muraviov State Printing Office Gherbychev for the City of Petrograd Lieutenant Nesterov for the Northern Front Pozern To the Army appeal to set up Military Revolutionary Committees To the railway workers to maintain order especially not to delay the transport of food to the cities and the front In return they were promised representation in the Ministry of Ways and Communications Cossack brothers said one proclamation You are being led against Petrograd They want to force you into battle with the revolutionary workers and soldiers of the capital Do not believe a word that is said by our common enemies the land owners and the capitalists At our Congress are represented all the conscious organisations of workers soldiers and peasants of Russia The Congress wishes also to welcome into its midst the worker Cossacks The Generals of the Black Band henchmen of the land owners of Nicolai the Cruel are our enemies They tell you that the Soviets wish to confiscate the lands of the Cossacks This is a lie It is only from the great Cossack landlords that the Revolution will confiscate the land to give it to the people Organise Soviets of Cossacks Deputies Join with the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Show the Black Band that you are not traitors to the People and that you do not wish to be cursed by the whole of revolutionary Russia Cossack brothers execute no orders of the enemies of the people Send your delegates to Petrograd to talk it over with us The Cossacks of the Petrograd garrison to their honour have not justified the hope of the People s enemies Cossack brothers The All Russian Congress of Soviets extends to you a fraternal hand Long live the brotherhood of the Cossacks with the soldiers workers and peasants of all Russia On the other side what a storm of proclamations posted up hand bills scattered everywhere newspapers screaming and cursing and prophesying evil Now raged the battle of the printing press all other weapons being in the hands of the Soviets First the appeal of the Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution flung broadcast over Russia and Europe TO THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC Contrary to the will of the revolutionary masses on November seventh the Bolsheviki of Petrograd criminally arrested part of the Provisional Government dispersed the Council of the Republic and proclaimed an illegal power Such violence committed against the Government of revolutionary Russia at the moment of its greatest external danger is an indescribable crime against the fatherland The insurrection of the Bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to the cause of national defence and postpones immeasurably the moment of peace so greatly desired Civil war begun by the Bolsheviki threatens to deliver the country to the horrors of anarchy and counter revolution and cause the failure of the Constituent Assembly which must affirm the republican regime and transmit to the People forever their right to the land Preserving the continuity of the only legal Governmental power the Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution established on the night of November seventh takes the initiative in forming a new Provisional Government which basing itself on the forces of democracy will conduct the country to the Constituent Assembly and save it from anarchy and counter revolution The Committee for Salvation summons you citizens to refuse to recognise the power of violence Do not obey its orders Rise for the defence of the country and Revolution Support the Committee for Salvation Signed by the Council of the Russian Republic the Municipal Duma of Petrograd the Tsay ee kah First Congress the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets and from the Congress itself the Front group the factions of Socialist Revolutionaries Mensheviki Populist Socialists Unified Social Democrats and the group Yedinstvo Then posters from the Socialist Revolutionary party the Mensheviki oborontsi Peasants Soviets again from the Central Army Committee the Tsentroflot Famine will crush Petrograd they cried The German armies will trample on our liberty Black Hundred pogroms will spread over Russia if we all conscious workers soldiers citizens do not unite Do not trust the promises of the Bolsheviki The promise of immediate peace is a lie The promise of bread a hoax The promise of land a fairy tale They were all in this manner Comrades You have been basely and cruelly deceived The seizure of power has been accomplished by the Bolsheviki alone They concealed their plot from the other Socialist parties composing the Soviet You have been promised land and freedom but the counter revolution will profit by the anarchy called forth by the Bolsheviki and will deprive you of land and freedom The newspapers were as violent Our duty said the Dielo Naroda is to unmask these traitors to the working class Our duty is to mobilise all our forces and mount guard over the cause of the Revolution Izviestia for the last time speaking in the name of the old Tsay ee kah threatened awful retribution As for the Congress of Soviets we affirm that there has been no Congress of Soviets We affirm that it was merely a private conference of the Bolshevik faction And in that case they have no right to cancel the powers of the Tsay ee kah Novaya Zhizn while pleading for a new Government that should unite all the Socialist parties criticised severely the action of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviki in quitting the Congress and pointed out that the Bolshevik insurrection meant one thing very clearly that all illusions about coalition with the bourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain Rabotchi Put blossomed out as Pravda Lenin s newspaper which had been suppressed in July It crowed bristling Workers soldiers peasants In March you struck down the tyranny of the clique of nobles Yesterday you struck down the tyranny of the bourgeois gang The first task now is to guard the approaches to Petrograd The second is definitely to disarm the counter revolutionary elements of Petrograd The third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power and assure the realisation of the popular programme What few Cadet organs appeared and the bourgeoisie generally adopted a detached ironical attitude toward the whole business a sort of contemptuous I told you so to the other parties Influential Cadets were to be seen hovering around the Municipal Duma and on the outskirts of the Committee for Salvation Other than that the bourgeoisie lay low biding its hour which could not far off That the Bolsheviki would remain in power longer than three days never occurred to anybody except perhaps to Lenin Trotzky the Petrograd workers and the simpler soldiers In the high amphitheatrical Nicolai Hall that afternoon I saw the Duma sitting in permanence tempestuous grouping around it all the forces of opposition The old Mayer Schreider majestic with his white hair and beard was describing his visit to Smolny the night before to protest in the name of the Municipal Self Government The Duma being the only existing legal Government in the city elected by equal direct and secret suffrage would not recognise the new power he had told Trotzky And Trotzky had answered There is a constitutional remedy for that The Duma can be dissolved and re elected At this report there was a furious outcry If one recognises a Government by bayonet continued the old man addressing the Duma well we have one but I consider legitimate only a Government recognised by the majority and not one created by the usurpation of a minority Wild applause on all benches except those of the Bolsheviki Amid renewed tumult the Mayor announced that the Bolsheviki already were violating Municipal autonomy by appointing Commissars in many departments The Bolshevik speaker shouted trying to make himself heard that the decision of the Congress of Soviets meant that all Russia backed up the action of the Bolsheviki You he cried You are not the real representative of the people of Petrograd Shrieks of Insult Insult The old Mayor with dignity reminded him that the Duma was elected by the freest possible popular vote Yes he answered but that was a long time ago like the Tsay ee kah like the Army Committee There has been no new Congress of Soviets they yelled at him The Bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in this nest of counter revolution Uproar and we demand a re election of the Duma Whereupon the Bolsheviki left the chamber followed by cries of German agents Down with the traitors Shingariov Cadet then demanded that all Municipal functionaries who had consented to be Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee be discharged from their position and indicted Schreider was on his feet putting a motion to the effect that the Duma protested against the menace of the Bolsheviki to dissolve it and as the legal representative of the population it would refuse to leave its post Outside the Alexander Hall was crowded for the meeting of the Committee for Salvation and Skobeliev was again speaking Never yet he said was the fate of the Revolution so acute never yet did the question of the existence of the Russian state excite so much anxiety never yet did history put so harshly and categorically the question is Russia to be or not to be The great hour for the salvation of the Revolution has arrived and in consciousness thereof we observe the close union of the live forces of the revolutionary democracy by whose organised will a centre for the salvation of the country and the Revolution has already been created And much of the same sort We shall die sooner than surrender our post Amid violent applause it was announced that the Union of Railway Workers had joined the Committee for Salvation A few moments later the Post and Telegraph Employees came in then some Mensheviki Internationalists entered the hall to cheers The Railway men said they did not recognise the Bolsheviki and had taken the entire railroad apparatus into their own hands refusing to entrust it to any usurpatory power The Telegraphers delegate declared that the operators had flatly refused to work their instruments as long as the Bolshevik Commissar was in the office The Postmen would not deliver or accept mail at Smolny All the Smolny telephones were cut off With great glee it was reported how Uritzky had gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand the secret treaties and how Neratov had put him out The Government employees were all stopping work It was war war deliberately planned Russian fashion war by strike and sabotage As we sat there the chairman read a list of names and assignments so and so was to make the round of the Ministries another was to visit the banks some ten or twelve were to work the barracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral Russian soldiers do not shed the blood of your brothers a committee was to go and confer with Kerensky still others were despatched to provincial cities to form branches of the Committee for Salvation and link together the anti Bolshevik elements The crowd was in high spirits These Bolsheviki will try to dictate to the intelligentzia We ll show them Nothing could be more striking than the contrast between this assemblage and the Congress of Soviets There great masses of shabby soldiers grimy workmen peasants poor men bent and scarred in the brute struggle for existence here the Menshevik and Social Revolutionary leaders Avksentievs Dans Liebers the former Socialist Ministers Skobelievs Tchernovs rubbed shoulders with Cadets like oily Shatsky sleek Vinaver with journalists students intellectuals of almost all camps This Duma crowd was well fed well dressed I did not see more than three proletarians among them all News came Kornilov s faithful Tekhintsi fourteen had slaughtered his guards at Bykhov and he had escaped Kaledin was marching north The Soviet of Moscow had set up a Military Revolutionary Committee and was negotiating with the commandant of the city for possession of the arsenal so that the workers might be armed fourteen See Notes and Explanations With these facts was mixed an astounding jumble of rumours distortions and plain lies For instance an intelligent young Cadet formerly private secretary to Miliukov and then to Terestchenko drew us aside and told us all about the taking of the Winter Palace The Bolsheviki were led by German and Austrian officers he affirmed Is that so we replied politely How do you know A friend of mine was there and saw them How could he tell they were German officers Oh because they wore German uniforms There were hundreds of such 
6981_70843_000083_000007	train-clean-360	absurd 
none	none	tales and they were not only solemnly published by the anti Bolshevik press but believed by the most unlikely persons Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki who had always been distinguished by their sober devotion to facts But more serious were the stories of Bolshevik violence and terrorism For example it was said printed that the Red Guards had not only thoroughly looted the Winter Palace but that they had massacred the yunkers after disarming them had killed some of the Ministers in cold blood and as for the woman soldiers most of them had been violated and many had committed suicide because of the tortures they had gone through All these stories were swallowed whole by the crowd in the Duma And worse still the mothers and fathers of the students and of the women read these frightful details often accompanied by lists of names and toward nightfall the Duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens A typical case is that of Prince Tumanov whose body it was announced in many newspapers had been found floating in the Moika Canal A few hours later this was denied by the Prince s family who added that the Prince was under arrest so the press identified the dead man as General Demissov The General having also come to life we investigated and could find no trace of any body found whatever As we left the Duma building two boy scouts were distributing hand bills See App V Sect two to the enormous crowd which blocked the Nevsky in front of the door a crowd composed almost entirely of business men shop keepers tchinouniki clerks One read FROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMA The Municipal Duma in its meeting of October twenty sixth in view of the events of the day decrees To announce the inviolability of private dwellings Through the House Committees it calls upon the population of the town of Petrograd to meet with decisive repulse all attempts to enter by force private apartments not stopping at the use of arms in the interests of the self defence of citizens Up on the corner of the Liteiny five or six Red Guards and a couple of sailors had surrounded a news dealer and were demanding that he hand over his copies of the Menshevik Rabot chaya Gazeta Workers Gazette Angrily he shouted at them shaking his fist as one of the sailors tore the papers from his stand An ugly crowd had gathered around abusing the patrol One little workman kept explaining doggedly to the people and the news dealer over and over again It has Kerensky s proclamation in it It says we killed Russian people It will make bloodshed Smolny was tenser than ever if that were possible The same running men in the dark corridors squads of workers with rifles leaders with bulging portfolios arguing explaining giving orders as they hurried anxiously along surrounded by friends and lieutenants Men literally out of themselves living prodigies of sleeplessness and work men unshaven filthy with burning eyes who drove upon their fixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation So much they had to do so much Take over the Government organise the City keep the garrison loyal fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation keep out the Germans prepare to do battle with Kerensky inform the provinces what had happened Propagandise from Archangel to Vladivostok Government and Municipal employees refusing to obey their Commissars post and telegraph refusing them communication railroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals for trains Kerensky coming the garrison not altogether to be trusted the Cossacks waiting to come out Against them not only the organised bourgeoisie but all the other Socialist parties except the Left Socialist Revolutionaries a few Mensheviki Internationalists and the Social Democrat Internationalists and even they undecided whether to stand by or not With them it is true the workers and the soldier masses the peasants an unknown quantity but after all the Bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained and educated men Riazanov was coming up the front steps explaining in a sort of humorous panic that he Commissar of Commerce knew nothing whatever of business In the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself in the corner in a goat skin cape and clothes which had been I was going to say slept in but of course he hadn t slept and a three days growth of beard He was anxiously figuring on a dirty envelope and biting his pencil meanwhile This was Menzhinsky Commissar of Finance whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk in a French bank And these four half running down the hall from the office of the Military Revolutionary Committee and scribbling on bits of paper as they run these were Commissars despatched to the four corners of Russia to carry the news argue or fight with whatever arguments or weapons came to hand The Congress was to meet at one o clock and long since the great meeting hall had filled but by seven there was yet no sign of the presidium The Bolshevik and Left Social Revolutionary factions were in session in their own rooms All the livelong afternoon Lenin and Trotzky had fought against compromise A considerable part of the Bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create a joint all Socialist government We can t hold on they cried Too much is against us We haven t got the men We will be isolated and the whole thing will fall So Kameniev Riazanov and others But Lenin with Trotzky beside him stood firm as a rock Let the compromisers accept our programme and they can come in We won t give way an inch If there are comrades here who haven t the courage and the will to dare what we dare let them leave with the rest of the cowards and conciliators Backed by the workers and soldiers we shall go on At five minutes past seven came word from the left Socialist Revolutionaries to say that they would remain in the Military Revolutionary Committee See said Lenin They are following A little later as we sat at the press table in the big hall an Anarchist who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to me that we go and find out what had become of the presidium There was nobody in the Tsay ee kah office nor in the bureau of the Petrograd Soviet From room to room we wandered through vast Smolny Nobody seemed to have the slightest idea where to find the governing body of the Congress As we went my companion described his ancient revolutionary activities his long and pleasant exile in France As for the Bolsheviki he confided to me that they were common rude ignorant persons without aesthetic sensibilities He was a real specimen of the Russian intelligentzia So he came at last to Room seventeen office of the Military Revolutionary Committee and stood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going The door opened and out shot a squat flat faced man in a uniform without insignia who seemed to be smiling which smile after a minute one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue It was Krylenko My friend who was a dapper civilized looking young man gave a cry of pleasure and stepped forward Nicolai Vasilievitch he said holding out his hand Don t you remember me comrade We were in prison together Krylenko made an effort and concentrated his mind and sight Why yes he answered finally looking the other up and down with an expression of great friendliness You are S Zdra stvuitye They kissed What are you doing in all this He waved his arm around Oh I am just looking on You seem very successful Yes replied Krylenko with a sort of doggedness The proletarian Revolution is a great success He laughed Perhaps perhaps however we ll meet in prison again When we got out into the corridor again my friend went on with his explanations You see I m a follower of Kropotkin To us the Revolution is a great failure it has not aroused the patriotism of the masses Of course that only proves that the people are not ready for Revolution It was just eight point forty when a thundering wave of cheers announced the entrance of the presidium with Lenin great Lenin among them A short stocky figure with a big head set down in his shoulders bald and bulging Little eyes a snubbish nose wide generous mouth and heavy chin clean shaven now but already beginning to bristle with the well known beard of his past and future Dressed in shabby clothes his trousers much too long for him Unimpressive to be the idol of a mob loved and revered as perhaps few leaders in history have been A strange popular leader a leader purely by virtue of intellect colourless humourless uncompromising and detached without picturesque idiosyncrasies but with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms of analysing a concrete situation And combined with shrewdness the greatest intellectual audacity Kameniev was reading the report of the actions of the Military Revolutionary Committee abolition of capital punishment in the Army restoration of the free right of propaganda release of officers and soldiers arrested for political crimes orders to arrest Kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in private store houses Tremendous applause Again the representative of the Bund The uncompromising attitude of the Bolsheviki would mean the crushing of the Revolution therefore the Bund delegates must refuse any longer to sit in the Congress Cries from the audience We thought you walked out last night How many times are you going to walk out Then the representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists Shouts What You here still The speaker explained that only part of the Mensheviki Internationalists left the Congress the rest were going to stay We consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the Revolution to transfer the power to the Soviets Interruptions but we feel it our duty to remain in the Congress and vote against the transfer here Other speakers followed apparently without any order A delegate of the coal miners of the Don Basin called upon the Congress to take measures against Kaledin who might cut off coal and food from the capital Several soldiers just arrived from the Front brought the enthusiastic greetings of their regiments Now Lenin gripping the edge of the reading stand letting his little winking eyes travel over the crowd as he stood there waiting apparently oblivious to the long rolling ovation which lasted several minutes When it finished he said simply We shall now proceed to construct the Socialist order Again that overwhelming human roar The first thing is the adoption of practical measures to realise peace We shall offer peace to the peoples of all the belligerent countries upon the basis of the Soviet terms no annexations no indemnities and the right of self determination of peoples At the same time according to our promise we shall publish and repudiate the secret treaties The question of War and Peace is so clear that I think that I may without preamble read the project of a Proclamation to the Peoples of All the Belligerent Countries His great mouth seeming to smile opened wide as he spoke his voice was hoarse not unpleasantly so but as if it had hardened that way after years and years of speaking and went on monotonously with the effect of being able to go on forever For emphasis he bent forward slightly No gestures And before him a thousand simple faces looking up in intent adoration PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT NATIONS The Workers and Peasants Government created by the revolution of November sixth and seventh and based on the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies proposes to all the belligerent peoples and to their Governments to begin immediately negotiations for a just and democratic peace The Government means by a just and democratic peace which is desired by the immense majority of the workers and the labouring classes exhausted and depleted by the war that peace which the Russian workers and peasants after having struck down the Tsarist monarchy have not ceased to demand categorically immediate peace without annexations that is to say without conquest of foreign territory without forcible annexation of other nationalities and without indemnities The Government of Russia Proposes to all the belligerent peoples immediately to conclude such a peace by showing themselves willing to enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming at such a peace at once without the slightest delay before the definitive ratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the authorised assemblies of the people of all countries and of all nationalities By annexation or conquest of foreign territory the Government means conformably to the conception of democratic rights in general and the rights of the working class in particular all union to a great and strong State of a small or weak nationality without the voluntary clear and precise expression of its consent and desire whatever be the moment when such an annexation by force was accomplished whatever be the degree civilisation of the nation annexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of another State no matter if that nation be in Europe or in the far countries across the sea If any nation is retained by force within the limits of another State if in spite of the desire expressed by it it matters little if that desire be expressed by the press by popular meetings decisions of political parties or by disorders and riots against national oppression that nation is not given the right of deciding by free vote without the slightest constraint after the complete departure of the armed forces of the nation which has annexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general the form of its national and political organisation such a union constitutes an annexation that is to say conquest and an act of violence To continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich nations to divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities is considered by the Government the greatest possible crime against humanity and the Government solemnly proclaims its decision to sign a treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the above conditions equally fair for all nationalities without exception The Government abolishes secret diplomacy expressing before the whole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations in the light of day before the people and will proceed immediately to the full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concluded by the Government of land owners and capitalists from March until November seventh nineteen seventeen All the clauses of the secret treaties which as occur in a majority of cases have for their object to procure advantages and privileges for Russian capitalists to maintain or augment the annexations of the Russian imperialists are denounced by the Government immediately and without discussion In proposing to all Governments and all peoples to engage in public negotiations for peace the Government declares itself ready to carry on these negotiations by telegraph by post or by pourparlers between the representatives of the different countries or at a conference of these representatives To facilitate these pourparlers the Government appoints its authorised representatives in the neutral countries The Government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice at the same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last three months during which time it is perfectly possible not only to hold the necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all the nations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war or forced to take part in it but also to convoke authorised assemblies of representatives of the people of all countries for the purpose of the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace In addressing this offer of peace to the Governments and to the peoples of all the belligerent countries the Provisional Workers and Peasants Government of Russia addresses equally and in particular the conscious workers of the three nations most devoted to humanity and the three most important nations among those taking part in the present war England France and Germany The workers of these countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause of progress and of Socialism The splendid examples of the Chartist movement in England the series of revolutions of world wide historical significance accomplished by the French proletariat and finally in Germany the historic struggle against the Laws of Exception an example for the workers of the whole world of prolonged and stubborn action and the creation of the formidable organisations of German proletarians all these models of proletarian heroism these monuments of history are for us a sure guarantee that the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposed upon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences of war and that these workers by decisive energetic and continued action will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the cause of peace and at the same time the cause of the liberation of the exploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitation When the grave thunder of applause had died away Lenin spoke again We propose to the Congress to ratify this declaration We address ourselves to the Governments as well as to the peoples for a declaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of the belligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace The conditions of peace drawn up during the armistice will be ratified by the Constituent Assembly In fixing the duration of the armistice at three months we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest as possible after this bloody extermination and ample time for them to elect their representatives This proposal of peace will meet with resistance on the part of the imperialist governments we don t fool ourselves on that score But we hope that revolution will soon break out in all the belligerent countries that is why we address ourselves especially to the workers of France England and Germany The revolution of November sixth and seventh he ended has opened the era of the Social Revolution The labour movement in the name of peace and Socialism shall win and fulfil its destiny There was something quiet and powerful in all this which stirred the souls of men It was understandable why people believed when Lenin spoke By crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives of political factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and that speakers should be limited to fifteen minutes First Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries Our faction had no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of the proclamation it is a private document of the Bolsheviki But we will vote for it because we agree with its spirit For the Social Democrats Internationalists Kramarov long stoop shouldered and near sighted destined to achieve some notoriety as the Clown of the Opposition Only a Government composed of all the Socialist parties he said could possess the authority to take such important action If a Socialist coalition were formed his faction would support the entire programme if not only part of it As for the proclamation the Internationalists were in thorough accord with its main points Then one after another amid rising enthusiasm Ukrainean Social Democracy support Lithuanian Social Democracy support Populist Socialists support Polish Social Democracy support Polish Socialists support but would prefer a Socialist coalition Lettish Social Democracy support Something was kindled in these men One spoke of the coming World Revolution of which we are the advance guard another of the new age of brotherhood when all the peoples will become one great family An individual member claimed the floor There is contradiction here he said First you offer peace without annexations and indemnities and then you say you will consider all peace offers To consider means to accept Lenin was on his feet We want a just peace but we are not afraid of a revolutionary war Probably the imperialist Governments will not answer our appeal but we shall not issue an ultimatum to which it will be easy to say no If the German proletariat realises that we are ready to consider all offers of peace that will perhaps be the last drop which overflows the bowl revolution will break out in Germany We consent to examine all conditions of peace but that doesn t mean that we shall accept them For some of our terms we shall fight to the end but possibly for others will find it impossible to continue the war Above all we want to finish the war It was exactly ten thirty five when Kameniev asked all in favour of the proclamation to hold up their cards One delegate dared to raise his hand against but the sudden sharp outburst around him brought it swiftly down Unanimous Suddenly by common impulse we found ourselves on our feet mumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of the Internationale A grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a child Alexandra Kollontai rapidly winked the tears back The immense sound rolled through the hall burst windows and doors and seared into the quiet sky The war is ended The war is ended said a young workman near me his face shining And when it was over as we stood there in a kind of awkward hush some one in the back of the room shouted Comrades Let us remember those who have died for liberty So we began to sing the Funeral March that slow melancholy and yet triumphant chant so Russian and so moving The Internationale is an alien air after all The Funeral March seemed the very soul of those dark masses whose delegates sat in this hall building from their obscure visions a new Russia and perhaps more You fell in the fatal fight For the liberty of the people for the honour of the people You gave up your lives and everything dear to you You suffered in horrible prisons You went to exile in chains Without a word you carried your chains because you could not ignore your suffering brothers Because you believed that justice is stronger than the sword The time will come when your surrendered life will count That time is near when tyranny falls the people will rise great and free Farewell brothers you chose a noble path You are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and to suffer Farewell brothers you chose a noble path At your grave we swear to fight to work for freedom and the people s happiness For this did they lie there the martyrs of March in their cold Brotherhood Grave on Mars Field for this thousands and tens of thousands had died in the prisons in exile in Siberian mines It had not come as they expected it would come nor as the intelligentzia desired it but it had come rough strong impatient of formulas contemptuous of sentimentalism real Lenin was reading the Decree on Land one All private ownership of land is abolished immediately without compensation two All land owners estates and all lands belonging to the Crown to monasteries church lands with all their live stock and inventoried property buildings and all appurtenances are transferred to the disposition of the township Land Committees and the district Soviets of Peasants Deputies until the Constituent Assembly meets three Any damage whatever done to the confiscated property which from now on belongs to the whole People is regarded as a serious crime punishable by the revolutionary tribunals The district Soviets of Peasants Deputies shall take all necessary measures for the observance of the strictest order during the taking over of the land owners estates for the determination of the dimensions of the plots of land and which of them are subject to confiscation for the drawing up of an inventory of the entire confiscated property and for the strictest revolutionary protection of all the farming property on the land with all buildings implements cattle supplies of products et cetera passing into the hands of the People four For guidance during the realisation of the great land reforms until their final resolution by the Constituent Assembly shall serve the following peasant nakaz See App V Sect three instructions drawn up on the basis of two hundred forty two local peasant nakazi by the editorial board of the Izviestia of the All Russian Soviet of Peasants Deputies and published in No eighty eight of said Izviestia Petrograd No eighty eight August nineteenth nineteen seventeen The lands of peasants and of Cossacks serving in the Army shall not be confiscated This is not explained Lenin the project of former Minister Tchernov who spoke of erecting a frame work and tried to realise reforms from above From below on the spot will be decided the questions of division of the land The amount of land received by each peasant will vary according to the locality Under the Provisional Government the pomieshtchiki flatly refused to obey the orders of the Land Committees those Land Committees projected by Lvov brought into existence by Shingariov and administered by Kerensky Before the debates could begin a man forced his way violently through the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform It was Pianikh member of the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets and he was mad clean through The Executive Committee of the All Russian Soviets of Peasants Deputies protests against the arrest of our comrades the Ministers Salazkin and Mazlov he flung harshly in the faces of the crowd We demand their instant release They are now in Peter Paul fortress We must have immediate action There is not a moment to lose Another followed him a soldier with disordered beard and flaming eyes You sit here and talk about giving the land to the peasants and you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the peasants chosen representatives I tell you he raised his fist If one hair of their heads is harmed you ll have a revolt on your hands The crowd stirred confusedly Then up rose Trotzky calm and venomous conscious of power greeted with a roar Yesterday the Military Revolutionary Committee decided to release the Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik Ministers Mazlov Salazkin Gvozdov and Maliantovitch on principle That they are still in Peter Paul is only because we have had so much to do They will however be detained at their homes under arrest until we have investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts of Kerensky during the Kornilov affair Never shouted Pianikh in any revolution have such things been seen as go on here You are mistaken responded Trotzky Such things have been seen even in this revolution Hundreds of our comrades were arrested in the July days When Comrade Kollontai was released from prison by the doctor s orders Avksentiev placed at her door two former agents of the Tsar s secret police The peasants withdrew muttering followed by ironical hoots The representative of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries spoke on the Land Decree While agreeing in principle his faction could not vote on the question until after discussion The Peasants Soviets should be consulted The Mensheviki Internationalists too insisted on a party caucus Then the leader of the Maximalists the Anarchist wing of the peasants We must do honour to a political party which puts such an act into effect the first day without jawing about it A typical peasant was in the tribune long hair boots and sheep skin coat bowing to all corners of the hall I wish you well comrades and citizens he said There are some Cadets walking around outside You arrested our Socialist peasants why not arrest them This was the signal for a debate of excited peasants It was precisely like the debate of soldiers of the night before Here were the real proletarians of the land Those members of our Executive Committee Avksentiev and the rest whom we thought were the peasants protectors they are only Cadets too Arrest them Arrest them Another Who are these Pianikhs these Avksentievs They are not peasants at all They only wag their tails How the crowd rose to them recognising brothers The Left Socialist Revolutionaries proposed a half hour intermission As the delegates streamed out Lenin stood up in his place We must not lose time comrades News all important to Russia must be on the press to morrow morning No delay And above the hot discussion argument shuffling of feet could be heard the voice of an emissary of the Military Revolutionary Committee crying Fifteen agitators wanted in room seventeen at once To go to the Front It was almost two hours and a half later that the delegates came straggling back the presidium mounted the platform and the session recommenced by the reading of telegrams from regiment after regiment announcing their adhesion to the Military Revolutionary Committee In leisurely manner the meeting gathered momentum A delegate from the Russian troops on the Macedonian front spoke bitterly of their situation We suffer there more from the friendship of our Allies than from the enemy he said Representatives of the Tenth and Twelfth Armies just arrived in hot haste reported We support you with all our strength A peasant soldier protested against the release of the traitor Socialists Mazlov and Salazkin as for the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets it should be arrested en masse Here was real revolutionary talk A deputy from the Russian Army in Persia declared he was instructed to demand all power to the Soviets A Ukrainean officer speaking in his native tongue There is no nationalism in this crisis Da zdravstvuyet the proletarian dictatorship of all lands Such a deluge of high and hot thoughts that surely Russia would never again be dumb Kameniev remarked that the anti Bolshevik forces were trying to stir up disorders everywhere and read an appeal of the Congress to all the Soviets of Russia The All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies including some Peasants Deputies calls upon the local Soviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose all counter revolutionary anti Jewish action and all pogroms whatever they may be The honour of the Workers Peasants and Soldiers Revolution demands that no pogrom be tolerated The Red Guard of Petrograd the revolutionary garrison and the sailors have maintained complete order in the capital Workers soldiers and peasants you should follow everywhere the example of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd Comrade soldiers and Cossacks on us falls the duty of assuring real revolutionary order All revolutionary Russia and the entire world have their eyes on us At two o clock the Land Decree was put to vote with only one against and the peasant delegates wild with joy So plunged the Bolsheviki ahead irresistible over riding hesitation and opposition the only people in Russia who had a definite programme of action while the others talked for eight long months Now arose a soldier gaunt ragged and eloquent to protest against the clause of the nakaz tending to deprive military deserters from a share in village land allotments Bawled at and hissed at first his simple moving speech finally made silence Forced against his will into the butchery of the trenches he cried which you yourselves in the Peace decree have voted senseless as well as horrible he greeted the Revolution with hope of peace and freedom Peace The Government of Kerensky forced him again to go forward into Galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered to his pleas for peace Terestchenko simply laughed Freedom Under Kerensky he found his Committees suppressed his newspapers cut off his party speakers put in prison At home in his village the landlords were defying his Land Committees jailing his comrades In Petrograd the bourgeoisie in alliance with the Germans were sabotaging the food and ammunition for the Army He was without boots or clothes Who forced him to desert The Government of Kerensky which you have overthrown At the end there was applause But another soldier hotly denounced it The Government of Kerensky is not a screen behind which can be hidden dirty work like desertion Deserters are scoundrels who run away home and leave their comrades to die in the trenches alone Every deserter is a traitor and should be punished Uproar shouts of Do volno Teesche Kameniev hastily proposed to leave the matter to the Government for decision See App V Sect four At two point thirty A M fell a tense hush Kameniev was reading the decree of the Constitution of Power Until the meeting of the Constituent Assembly a provisional Workers and Peasants Government is formed which shall be named the Council of People s Commissars See App V Sect five The administration of the different branches of state activity shall be intrusted to commissions whose composition shall be regulated to ensure the carrying out of the programme of the Congress in close union with the mass organisations of working men working women sailors soldiers peasants and clerical employees The governmental power is vested in a collegium made up of the chairmen of these commissions that is to say the Council of People s Commissars Control over the activities of the People s Commissars and the right to replace them shall belong to the All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers Peasants and Soldiers Deputies and its Central Executive Committee Still silence as he read the list of Commissars bursts of applause after each name Lenin s and Trotzky s especially President of the Council Vladimir Ulianov Lenin Interior

Nationalities I V Djougashvili Stalin Railroads To be filled later There were bayonets at the edges of the room bayonets pricking up among the delegates the Military Revolutionary Committee was arming everybody Bolshevism was arming for the decisive battle with Kerensky the sound of whose trumpets came up the south west wind In the meanwhile nobody went home on the contrary hundreds of newcomers filtered in filling the great room solid with stern faced soldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours indefatigably intent The air was thick with cigarette smoke and human breathing and the smell of coarse clothes and sweat Avilov of the staff of Novaya Zhizn was speaking in the name of the Social Democrat Internationalists and the remnant of the Mensheviki Internationalists Avilov with his young intelligent face looking out of place in his smart frock coat We must ask ourselves where we are going The ease with which the Coalition Government was upset cannot be explained by the strength of the left wing of the democracy but only by the incapacity of the Government to give the people peace and bread And the left wing cannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questions Can it give bread to the people Grain is scarce The majority of the peasants will not be with you for you cannot give them the machinery they need Fuel and other primary necessities are almost impossible to procure As for peace that will be even more difficult The allies refused to talk with Skobeliev They will never accept the proposition of a peace conference from you You will not be recognised either in London and Paris or in Berlin You cannot count on the effective help of the proletariat of the Allied countries because in most countries it is very far from the revolutionary struggle remember the Allied democracy was unable even to convoke the Stockholm Conference Concerning the German Social Democrats I have just talked with Comrade Goldenberg one of our delegates to Stockholm he was told by the representatives of the Extreme Left that revolution in Germany was impossible during the war Here interruptions began to come thick and fast but Avilov kept on The isolation of Russia will fatally result either in the defeat of the Russian Army by the Germans and the patching up of a peace between the Austro German coalition and the Franco British coalition at the expense of Russia or in a separate peace with Germany I have just learned that the Allied ambassadors are preparing to leave and that Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution are forming in all the cities of Russia No one party can conquer these enormous difficulties The majority of the people supporting a government of Socialist coalition can alone accomplish the Revolution He then read the resolution of the two factions Recognising that for the salvation of the conquests of the Revolution it is indispensable immediately to constitute a government based on the revolutionary democracy organised in the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies recognising moreover that the task of this government is the quickest possible attainment of peace the transfer of the land into the hands of the agrarian committees the organisation of control over industrial production and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on the date decided the Congress appoints an executive committee to constitute such a government after an agreement with the groups of the democracy which are taking part in the Congress In spite of the revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd Avilov s cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them Toward the end the cries and hisses died away and when he finished there was even some clapping Karelin followed him also young fearless whose sincerity no one doubted for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries the party of Maria Spiridonova the party which almost alone followed the Bolsheviki and which represented the revolutionary peasants Our party has refused to enter the Council of People s Commissars because we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the part of the revolutionary army which left the Congress a separation which would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediaries between the Bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy And that is our principal duty at this moment We cannot sustain any government except a government of Socialist coalition We protest moreover against the tyrannical conduct of the Bolsheviki Our Commissars have been driven from their posts Our only organ Znamia Truda Banner of Labour was forbidden to appear yesterday The Central Duma is forming a powerful Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution to fight you Already you are isolated and your Government is without the support of a single other democratic group And now Trotzky stood upon the raised tribune confident and dominating with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which was almost a sneer He spoke in a ringing voice and the great crowd rose to him These considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party are not new On the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was also predicted Everybody was against us only a faction of the Socialist Revolutionaries of the left was with us in the Military Revolutionary Committee How is it that we were able to overturn the Government almost without bloodshed That fact is the most striking proof that we were not isolated In reality the Provisional Government was isolated the democratic parties which march against us were isolated are isolated and forever cut off from the proletariat They speak of the necessity for a coalition There is only one coalition possible the coalition of the workers soldiers and poorest peasants and it is our party s honour to have realised that coalition What sort of coalition did Avilov mean A coalition with those who supported the Government of Treason to the People Coalition doesn t always add to strength For example could we have organised the insurrection with Dan and Avksentiev in our ranks Roars of laughter Avksentiev gave little bread Will a coalition with the oborontsi furnish more Between the peasants and Avksentiev who ordered the arrest of the Land Committees we choose the peasants Our Revolution will remain the classic revolution of history They accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democratic parties But is it we who are to blame Or must we as Karelin put it blame it on a misunderstanding No comrades When a party in full tide of revolution still wreathed in powder smoke comes to say Here is the Power take it and when those to whom it is offered go over to the enemy that is not a misunderstanding that is a declaration of pitiless war And it isn t we who have declared war Avilov menaces us with failure of our peace efforts if we remain isolated I repeat I don t see how a coalition with Skobeliev or even Terestchenko can help us to get peace Avilov tries to frighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense And I answer that in any case if Europe continues to be ruled by the imperialist bourgeoisie revolutionary Russia will inevitably be lost There are only two alternatives either the Russian Revolution will create a revolutionary movement in Europe or the European powers will destroy the Russian Revolution They greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim kindling to the daring of it with the thought of championing mankind And from that moment there was something conscious and decided about the insurrectionary masses in all their actions which never left them But on the other side too battle was taking form Kameniev recognised a delegate from the Union of Railway Workers a hardfaced stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility He threw a bombshell In the name of the strongest organisation in Russia I demand the right to speak and I say to you the Vikzhel charges me to make known the decision of the Union concerning the constitution of Power The Central Committee refuses absolutely to support the Bolsheviki if they persist in isolating themselves from the whole democracy of Russia Immense tumult all over the hall In nineteen oh five and in the Kornilov days the Railway Workers were the best defenders of the Revolution But you did not invite us to your Congress Cries It was the old Tsay ee kah which did not invite you The orator paid no attention We do not recognise the legality of this Congress since the departure of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum The Union supports the old Tsay ee Kah and declares that the Congress has no right to elect a new Committee The Power should be a Socialist and revolutionary Power responsible before the authorised organs of the entire revolutionary democracy Until the constitution of such a power the Union of Railway Workers which refuses to transport counter revolutionary troops to Petrograd at the same time forbids the execution of any order whatever without the consent of the Vikzhel The Vikzhel also takes into its hands the entire administration of the railroads of Russia At the end he could hardly be heard for the furious storm of abuse which beat upon him But it was a heavy blow that could be seen in the concern on the faces of the presidium Kameniev however merely answered that there could be no doubt of the legality of the Congress as even the quorum established by the old Tsay ee Kah was exceeded in spite of the secession of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolution arises Then came the vote on the Constitution of Power which carried the Council of People s Commissars into office by an enormous majority The election of the new Tsay ee kah the new parliament of the Russian Republic took barely fifteen minutes Trotzky announced its composition one hundred members of which seventy Bolsheviki As for the peasants and the seceding factions places were to be reserved for them We welcome into the Government all parties and groups which will adopt our programme ended Trotzky And thereupon the Second All Russian Congress of Soviets was dissolved so that the members might hurry to their homes in the four corners of Russia and tell of the great happenings It was almost seven when we woke the sleeping conductors and motor men of the street cars which the Street Railway Workers Union always kept waiting at Smolny to take the Soviet delegates to their homes In the crowded car there was less happy hilarity than the night before I thought Many looked anxious perhaps they were saying to themselves Now we are masters how can we do our will At our apartment house we were held up in the dark by an armed patrol of citizens and carefully examined The Duma s proclamation was doing its work The landlady heard us come in and stumbled out in a pink silk wrapper The House Committee has again asked that you take your turn on guard duty with the rest of the men she said What s the reason for this guard duty To protect the house and the women and children Who from Robbers and murderers But suppose there came a Commissar from the Military Revolutionary Committee to search for arms Oh that s what they ll say they are And besides what s the difference I solemnly affirmed that the Consul had forbidden all American citizens to carry arms especially in the neighbourhood of the Russian intelligentzia Chapter VI The Committee for Salvation Friday November ninth Novotcherkask November eighth In view of the revolt of the Bolsheviki and their attempt to depose the Provisional Government and to seize the power in Petrograd the Cossack Government declares that it considers these acts criminal and absolutely inadmissible In consequence the Cossacks will lend all their support to the Provisional Government which is a government of coalition Because of these circumstances and until the return of the Provisional Government to power and the restoration of order in Russia I take upon myself beginning November seventh all the power in that which concerns the region of the Don Signed ATAMAN KALEDIN President of the Government of the Cossack Troops Prikaz of the Minister President Kerensky dated at Gatchina I Minister President of the Provisional Government and Supreme Commander of all the armed forces of the Russian Republic declare that I am at the head of regiments from the Front who have remained faithful to the fatherland I order all the troops of the Military District of Petrograd who through mistake or folly have answered the appeal of the traitors to the country and the Revolution to return to their duty without delay This order shall be read in all regiments battalions and squadrons Signed Minister President of the Provisional Government and Supreme Commander A F KERENSKY Telegram from Kerensky to the General in Command of the Northern Front The town of Gatchina has been taken by the loyal regiments without bloodshed Detachments of Cronstadt sailors and of the Semionovsky and Ismailovsky regiments gave up their arms without resistance and joined the Government troops I order all the designated units to advance as quickly as possible The Military Revolutionary Committee has ordered its troops to retreat Gatchina about thirty kilometers south west had fallen during the night Detachments of the two regiments mentioned not the sailors while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood had indeed been surrounded by Cossacks and given up their arms but it was not true that they had joined the Government troops At this very moment crowds of them bewildered and ashamed were up at Smolny trying to explain They did not think the Cossacks were so near They had tried to argue with the Cossacks Apparently the greatest confusion prevailed along the revolutionary front The garrisons of all the little towns southward had split hopelessly bitterly into two factions or three the high command being on the side of Kerensky in default of anything stronger the majority of the rank and file with the Soviets and the rest unhappily wavering Hastily the Military Revolutionary Committee appointed to command the defence of Petrograd an ambitious regular Army Captain Muraviov the same Muraviov who had organised the Death Battalions during the summer and had once been heard to advise the Government that it was too lenient with the Bolsheviki they must be wiped out A man of military mind who admired power and audacity perhaps sincerely Beside my door when I came down in the morning were posted two new orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee directing that all shops and stores should open as usual and that all empty rooms and apartments should be put at the disposal of the Committee For thirty six hours now the Bolsheviki had been cut off from provincial Russia and the outside world The railway men and telegraphers refused to transmit their despatches the postmen would not handle their mail Only the Government wireless at Tsarskoye Selo launched half hourly bulletins and manifestoes to the four corners of heaven the Commissars of Smolny raced the Commissars of the City Duma on speeding trains half across the earth and two aeroplanes laden with propaganda fled high up toward the Front But the eddies of insurrection were spreading through Russia with a swiftness surpassing any human agency Helsingfors Soviet passed resolutions of support Kiev Bolsheviki captured the arsenal and the telegraph station only to be driven out by delegates to the Congress of Cossacks which happened to be meeting there in Kazan a Military Revolutionary Committee arrested the local garrison staff and the Commissar of the Provisional Government from far Krasnoyarsk in Siberia came news that the Soviets were in control of the Municipal institutions at Moscow where the situation was aggravated by a great strike of leather workers on one side and a threat of general lock out on the other the Soviets had voted overwhelmingly to support the action of the Bolsheviki in Petrograd Already a Military Revolutionary Committee was functioning Everywhere the same thing happened The common soldiers and the industrial workers supported the Soviets by a vast majority the officers yunkers and middle class generally were on the side of the Government as were the bourgeois Cadets and the moderate Socialist parties In all these towns sprang up Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution arming for civil war Vast Russia was in a state of solution As long ago as nineteen oh five the process had begun the March Revolution had merely hastened it and giving birth to a sort of forecast of the new order had ended by merely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old regime Now however the Bolsheviki in one night had dissipated it as one blows away smoke Old Russia was no more human society flowed molten in primal heat and from the tossing sea of flame was emerging the class struggle stark and pitiless and the fragile slowly cooling crust of new planets In Petrograd sixteen Ministries were on strike led by the Ministries of Labour and of Supplies the only two created by the all Socialist Government of August If ever men stood alone the handful of Bolsheviki apparently stood alone that grey chill morning with all storms towering over them See App VI Sect one Back against the wall the Military Revolutionary Committee struck for its life De l audace encore de l audace et toujours de l audace At five in the morning the Red Guards entered the printing office of the City Government confiscated thousands of copies of the Appeal Protest of the Duma and suppressed the official Municipal organ the Viestnik Gorodskovo Samoupravleniya Bulletin of the Municipal Self Government All the bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses even the Golos Soldata journal of the old Tsay ee kah which however changing its name to Soldatski Golos appeared in an edition of a hundred thousand copies bellowing rage and defiance The men who began their stroke of treachery in the night who have suppressed the newspapers will not keep the country in ignorance long The country will know the truth It will appreciate you Messrs the Bolsheviki We shall see As we came down the Nevsky a little after midday the whole street before the Duma building was crowded with people Here and there stood Red Guards and sailors with bayonetted rifles each one surrounded by about a hundred men and women clerks students shopkeepers tchinovniki shaking their fists and bawling insults and menaces On the steps stood boy scouts and officers distributing copies of the Soldatski Golos A workman with a red band around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling with rage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the foot of the stairs demanding the surrender of the papers Nothing like this I imagine ever occurred in history On one side a handful of workmen and common soldiers with arms in their hands representing a victorious insurrection and perfectly miserable on the other a frantic mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalks of Fifth Avenue at noon time sneering abusing shouting Traitors Provocators Opritchniki fifteen fifteen Savage body guards if Ivan the Terrible seventeenth century The doors were guarded by students and officers with white arm bands lettered in red Militia of the Committee of Public Safety and half a dozen boy scouts came and went Upstairs the place was all commotion Captain Gomberg was coming down the stairs They re going to dissolve the Duma he said The Bolshevik Commissar is with the Mayor now As we reached the top Riazanov came hurrying out He had been to demand that the Duma recognise the Council of peoples Commissars and the Mayor had given him a flat refusal In the offices a great babbling crowd hurrying shouting gesticulating Government officials intellectuals journalists foreign correspondents French and British officers The City Engineer pointed to them triumphantly The Embassies recognise the Duma as the only power now he explained For these Bolshevik murderers and robbers it is only a question of hours All Russia is rallying to us In the Alexander Hall a monster meeting of the Committee for Salvation Fillipovsky in the chair and Skobeliev again in the tribune reporting to immense applause new adhesions to the Committee Executive Committee of Peasants Soviets old Tsay ee kah Central Army Committee Tsentroflot Menshevik Socialist Revolutionary and Front group delegates from the Congress of Soviets Central Committees of the Menshevik Socialist Revolutionary Populist Socialist parties Yedinstvo group Peasants Union Cooperatives Zemstvos Municipalities Post and Telegraph Unions Vikzhel Council of the Russian Republic Union of Unions sixteen Merchants and Manufacturers Association sixteen See Notes and Explanations The power of the Soviets is not democratic power but a dictatorship and not the dictatorship of the proletariat but against the proletariat All those who have felt or know how to feel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of the Revolution The problem of the day is not only to render harmless irresponsible demagogues but to fight against the counter revolution If rumours are true that certain generals in the provinces are attempting to profit by events in order to march on Petrograd with other designs it is only one more proof that we must establish a solid base of democratic government Otherwise troubles with the Right will follow troubles from the Left The garrison of Petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizens buying the Golos Soldata and newsboys selling the Rabotchaya Gazeta are arrested in the streets The hour of resolutions has passed Let those who have no longer faith in the Revolution retire To establish a united power we must again restore the prestige of the Revolution Let us swear that either the Revolution shall be saved or we shall perish The hall rose cheering with kindling eyes There was not a single proletarian anywhere in sight Then Weinstein We must remain calm and not act until public opinion is firmly grouped in support of the Committee for Salvation then we can pass from the defensive to action The Vikzhel representative announced that his organisation was taking the initiative in forming the new Government and its delegates were now discussing the matter with Smolny Followed a hot discussion were the Bolsheviki to be admitted to the new Government Martov pleaded for their admission after all he said they represented an important political party Opinions were very much divided upon this the right wing Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries as well as the Populist Socialists the Cooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly against They have betrayed Russia one speaker said They have started civil war and opened the front to the Germans The Bolsheviki must be mercilessly crushed Skobeliev was in favor of excluding both the Bolsheviki and the Cadets We got into conversation with a young Socialist Revolutionary who had walked out of the Democratic Conference to gether with the Bolsheviki that night when Tseretelli and the compromisers forced Coalition upon the democracy of Russia You here I asked him His eyes flashed fire Yes he cried I left the Congress with my party Wednesday night I have not risked my life for twenty years and more to submit now to the tyranny of the Dark People Their methods are intolerable But they have not counted on the peasants When the peasants begin to act then it is a question of minutes before they are done for But the peasants will they act Doesn t the Land decree settle the peasants What more do they want Ah the Land decree he said furiously Yes do you know what that Land decree is It is our decree it is the Socialist Revolutionary programme intact My party framed that policy after the most careful compilation of the wishes of the peasants themselves It is an outrage But if it is your own policy why do you object If it is the peasants wishes why will they oppose it You don t understand Don t you see that the peasants will immediately realise that it is all a trick that these usurpers have stolen the Socialist Revolutionary programme I asked if it were true that Kaledin was marching north He nodded and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter satisfaction Yes Now you see what these Bolsheviki have done They have raised the counter revolution against us The Revolution is lost The Revolution is lost But won t you defend the Revolution Of course we will defend it to the last drop of our blood But we won t cooperate with the Bolsheviki in any way But if Kaledin comes to Petrograd and the Bolsheviki defend the city Won t you join with them Of course not We will defend the city also but we won t support the Bolsheviki Kaledin is the enemy of the Revolution but the Bolsheviki are equally enemies of the Revolution Which do you prefer Kaledin or the Bolsheviki It is not a question to be discussed he burst out impatiently I tell you the Revolution is lost And it is the Bolsheviki who are to blame But listen why should we talk of such things Kerensky is coming Day after to morrow we shall pass to the offensive Already Smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a new Government But we have them now they are absolutely impotent We shall not cooperate Outside there was a shot We ran to the windows A Red Guard finally exasperated by the taunts of the crowd had shot into it wounding a young girl in the arm We could see her being lifted into a cab surrounded by an excited throng the clamour of whose voices floated up to us As we looked suddenly an armoured automobile appeared around the corner of the Mikhailovsky its guns sluing this way and that Immediately the crowd began to run as Petrograd crowds do falling down and lying still in the street piled in the gutters heaped up behind telephone poles The car lumbered up to the steps of the Duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret demanding the surrender of the Soldatski Golos The boy scouts jeered and scuttled into the building After a moment the automobile wheeled undecidedly around and went off up the Nevsky while some hundreds of men and women picked themselves up and began to dust their clothes Inside was a prodigious running about of people with armfuls of Soldatski Golos looking for places to hide them A journalist came running into the room waving a paper Here s a proclamation from Krasnov he cried Everybody crowded around Get it printed get it printed quick and around to the barracks By the order of the Supreme Commander I am appointed commandant of the troops concentrated under Petrograd Citizens soldiers valorous Cossacks of the Don of the Kuban of the Transbaikal of the Amur of the Yenissei to all you who have remained faithful to your oath I appeal to you who have sworn to guard inviolable your oath of Cossack I call upon you to save Petrograd from anarchy from famine from tyranny and to save Russia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant men bought by the gold of Wilhelm are trying to submit her The Provisional Government to which you swore fidelity in the great days of March is not overthrown but by violence expelled from the edifice in which it held its meetings However the Government with the help of the Front armies faithful to their duty with the help of the Council of Cossacks which has united under its command all the Cossacks and which strong with the morale which reigns in its ranks and acting in accordance with the will of the Russian people has sworn to serve the country as its ancestors served it in the Troublous Times of sixteen twelve when the Cossacks of the Don delivered Moscow menaced by the Swedes the Poles and the Lithuanians Your Government still exists The active army considers these criminals with horror and contempt Their acts of vandalism and pillage their crimes the German mentality with which they regard Russia stricken down but not yet surrendered have alienated from them the entire people Citizens soldiers valorous Cossacks of the garrison of Petrograd send me your delegates so that I may know who are traitors to their country and who are not that there may be avoided an effusion of innocent blood Almost the same moment word ran from group to group that the building was surrounded by Red Guards An officer strode in a red band around his arm demanding the Mayor A few minutes later he left and old Schreider came out of his office red and pale by turns A special meeting of the Duma he cried Immediately In the big hall proceedings were halted All members of the Duma for a special meeting What s the matter I don t know going to arrest us going to dissolve the Duma arresting members at the door so ran the excited comments In the Nicolai Hall there was barely room to stand The Mayor announced that troops were stationed at all the doors prohibiting all exit and entrance and that a Commissar had threatened arrest and the dispersal of the Municipal Duma A flood of impassioned speeches from members and even from the galleries responded The freely elected City Government could not be dissolved by any power the Mayor s person and that of all the members were inviolable the tyrants the provocators the German agents should never be recognised as for these threats to dissolve us let them try only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber where like the Roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming of the Goths Resolution to inform the Dumas and Zemstvos of all Russia by telegraph Resolution that it was impossible for the Mayor or the Chairman of the Duma to enter into any relations whatever with representatives of the Military Revolutionary Committee or with the so called Council of People s Commissars Resolution to address another appeal to the population of Petrograd to stand up for the defence of their elected town government Resolution to remain in permanent session In the meanwhile one member arrived with the information that he had telephoned to Smolny and that the Military Revolutionary Committee said that no orders had been given to surround the Duma that the troops would be withdrawn As we went downstairs Riazanov burst in through the front door very agitated Are you going to dissolve the Duma I asked My God no he answered It is all a mistake I told the Mayor this morning that the Duma would be left alone Out on the Nevsky in the deepening dusk a long double file of cyclists came riding guns slung on their shoulders They halted and the crowd pressed in and deluged them with questions Who are you Where do you come from asked a fat old man with a cigar in his mouth Twelfth Army From the front We came to support the Soviets against the damn bourgeoisie Ah were furious cries Bolshevik gendarmes Bolshevik Cossacks A little officer in a leather coat came running down the steps The garrison is turning he muttered in my ear It s the beginning of the end of the Bolsheviki Do you want to see the turn of the tide Come on He started at a half trot up the Mikhailovsky and we followed What regiment is it The brunnoviki Here was indeed serious trouble The brunnoviki were the Armoured Car troops the key to the situation whoever controlled the brunnoviki controlled the city The Commissars of the Committee for Salvation and the Duma have been talking to them There s a meeting on to decide Decide what Which side they ll fight on Oh no That s not the way to do it They ll never fight against the Bolsheviki They will vote to remain neutral and then the yunkers and Cossacks The door of the great Mikhailovsky Riding School yawned blackly Two sentinels tried to stop us but we brushed by hurriedly deaf to their indignant expostulations Inside only a single arc light burned dimly high up near the roof of the enormous hall whose lofty pilasters and rows of windows vanished in the gloom Around dimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the armoured cars One stood alone in the centre of the place under the light and round it were gathered some two thousand dun colored soldiers almost lost in the immensity of that imperial building A dozen men officers chairmen of the Soldiers Committees and speakers were perched on top of the car and from the central turret a soldier was speaking This was Khanjunov who had been president of last summer s all Russian Congress of Brunnoviki A lithe handsome figure in his leather coat with lieutenant s shoulder straps he stood pleading eloquently for neutrality It is an awful thing he said for Russians to kill their Russian brothers There must not be civil war between soldiers who stood shoulder to shoulder against the Tsar and conquered the foreign enemy in battles which will go down in history What have we soldiers got to do with these squabbles of political parties I will not say to you that the Provisional Government was a democratic Government we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie no But we must have a Government of the united democracy or Russia is lost With such a Government there will be no need for civil war and the killing of brother by brother This sounded reasonable the great hall echoed to the crash of hands and voices A soldier climbed up his face white and strained Comrades he cried I came from the Rumanian front to urgently tell you all there must be peace Peace at once Whoever can give us peace whether it be the Bolsheviki or this new Government we will follow Peace We at the front cannot fight any longer We cannot fight either Germans or Russians With that he leaped down and a sort of confused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass which burst into something like anger when the next speaker a Menshevik oboronetz tried to say that the war must go on until the Allies were victorious You talk like Kerensky shouted a rough voice A Duma delegate pleading for neutrality Him they listened to muttering uneasily feeling him not one of them Never have I seen men trying so hard to understand to decide They never moved stood staring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker their brows wrinkled with the effort of thought sweat standing out on their foreheads great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes of children and the faces of epic warriors Now a Bolshevik was speaking one of their own men violently full of hate They liked him no more than the other It was not their mood For the moment they were lifted out of the ordinary run of common thoughts thinking in terms of Russia of Socialism the world as if it depended on them whether the Revolution were to live or die Speaker succeeded speaker debating amid tense silence roars of approval or anger should we come out or not Khanjunov returned persuasive and sympathetic But wasn t he an officer and an oboronotz however much he talked of peace Then a workman from Vasili Ostrov but him they greeted with And are you going to give us peace working man Near us some men many of them officers formed a sort of claque to cheer the advocates of Neutrality They kept shouting Khanjunov Khanjunov and whistled insultingly when the Bolsheviki tried to speak Suddenly the committeemen and officers on top of the automobile began to discuss something with great heat and much gesticulation The audience shouted to know what was the matter and all the great mass tossed and stirred A soldier held back by one of the officers wrenched himself loose and held up his hand Comrades he cried Comrade Krylenko is here and wants to speak to us An outburst of cheers whistlings yells of Prosim Prosim Dolby Go ahead Go ahead Down with him in the midst of which the People s Commissar for Military Affairs clambered up the side of the car helped by hands before and behind pushed and pulled from below and above Rising he stood for a moment and then walked out on the radiator put his hands on his hips and looked around smiling a squat short legged figure bare headed without insignia on his uniform The claque near me kept up a fearful shouting Khanjunov We want Khanjunov Down with him Shut up Down with the traitor The whole place seethed and roared Then it began to move like an avalanche bearing down upon us great black browed men forcing their way through Who is breaking up our meeting they shouted Who is whistling here The claque rudely burst asunder went flying nor did it gather again Comrade soliders began Krylenko in a voice husky with fatigue I cannot speak well to you I am sorry but I have not had any sleep for four nights I don t need to tell you that I am a soldier I don t need to tell you that I want peace What I must say is that the Bolshevik party successful in the Workers and Soldiers Revolution by the help of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have of you and of all the rest of the brave comrades who have hurled down forever the power of the blood thirsty bourgeoisie promised to offer peace to all the peoples and that has already been done to day Tumultuous applause You are asked to remain neutral to remain neutral while the yunkers and the Death Battalions who are never neutral shoot us down in the streets and bring back to Petrograd Kerensky or perhaps some other of the gang Kaledin is marching from the Don Kerensky is coming from the front Kornilov is raising the Tekhintsi to repeat his attempt of August All these Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civil war how have they retained the power except by civil war that civil war which has endured ever since last July and in which they constantly stood on the side of the bourgeoisie as they do now How can I persuade you if you have made up your minds The question is very plain On one side are Kerensky Kaledin Kornilov the Mensheviki Socialist Revolutionaries Cadets Dumas officers They tell us that their objects are good On the other side are the workers the soldiers and sailors the poorest peasants The Government is in your hands You are the masters Great Russia belongs to you Will you give it back While he spoke he kept himself up by sheer evident effort of will and as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of his words broke through the tired voice At the end he totered almost falling a hundred hands reached up to help him down and the great dim spaces of the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon him Khanjunov tried to speak again but Vote Vote Vote they cried At length giving in he read the resolution that the brunnoviki withdraw their representative from the Military Revolutionary Committee and declare their neutrality in the present civil war All those in favour should go to the right those opposed to the left There was a moment of hesitation a still expectancy and then the crowd began to surge faster and faster stumbling over one another to the left hundreds of big soldiers in a solid mass rushing across the dirt floor in the faint light Near us about fifty men were left stranded stubbornly in favour and even as the high roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring they turned and rapidly walked out of the building and some of them out of the Revolution Imagine this struggle being repeated in every barracks of the city the district the whole front all Russia Imagine the sleepless Krylenkos watching the regiments hurrying from place to place arguing threatening entreating And then imaging the same in all the locals of every labour union in the factories the villages on the battle ships of the far flung Russian fleets think of the hundreds of thousands of Russian men staring up at speakers all over the vast country workmen peasants soldiers sailors trying so hard to understand and to choose thinking so intensely and deciding so unanimously at the end So was the Russian Revolution Up at Smolny the new Council of People s Commissars was not idle Already the first decree was on the presses to be circulated in thousands through the city streets that night and shipped in bales by every train southward and east In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic chosen by the All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies with participation of peasant deputies the Council of People s Commissars decrees one The elections for the Constituent Assembly shall take place at the date determined upon November twelve two All electoral commissions organs of local self government Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies and soldiers organisations on the front should make every effort to assure free and regular elections at the date determined upon In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic The President of the Council of People s Commissars VLADIMIR ULIANOV LENIN In the Municipal building the Duma was in full blast A member of the Council of the Republic was talking as we came in The Council he said did not consider itself dissolved at all but merely unable to continue its labours until it secured a new meeting place In the meanwhile its Committee of Elders had determined to enter en masse the Committee for Salvation This I may remark parenthetically is the last time history mentions the Council of the Russian Republic Then followed the customary string of delegates from the Ministries the Vikzhel the Union of Posts and Telegraphs for the hundredth time reiterating their determination not to work for the Bolshevik usurpers A yunker who had been in the Winter Palace told a highly coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades and disgraceful conduct of the Red Guards all of which was devoutly believed Somebody read aloud an account in the Socialist Revolutionary paper Narod which stated that five hundred million rubles worth of damage had been done in the Winter Palace and describing in great detail the loot and breakage From time to time couriers came from the telephone with news The four Socialist Ministers had been released from prison Krylenko had gone to Peter Paul to tell Admiral Verderevsky that the Ministry of Marine was deserted and to beg him for the sake of Russia to take charge under the authority of the Council of People s Commissars and the old seaman had consented Kerensky was advancing north from Gatchina the Bolshevik garrisons falling back before him Smolny had issued another decree enlarging the powers of the City Dumas to deal with food supplies This last piece of insolence caused an outburst of fury He Lenin the usurper the tyrant whose Commissars had seized the Municipal garage entered the Municipal ware houses were interfering with the Supply Committees and the distribution of food he presumed to define the limits of power of the free independent autonomous City Government One member shaking his fist moved to cut off the food of the city if the Bolsheviki dared to interfere with the Supply Committees Another representative of the Special Supply Committee reported that the food situation was very grave and asked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food trains Diedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was wavering The Semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the orders of the Socialist Revolutionary party the crews of the torpedo boats on the Neva were shaky Seven members were at once appointed to continue the propaganda Then the old Mayor stepped into the tribune Comrades and citizens I have just learned that the prisoners in Peter Paul are in danger Fourteen yunkers of the Pavlovsk school have been stripped and tortured by the Bolshevik guards One has gone mad They are threatening to lynch the Ministers There was a whirlwind of indignation and horror which only grew more violent when a stocky little woman dressed in grey demanded the floor and lifted up her hard metallic voice This was Vera Slutskaya veteran revolutionist and Bolshevik member of the Duma That is a lie and a provocation she said unmoved at the torrent of abuse The Workers and Peasants Government which has abolished the death penalty cannot permit such deeds We demand that this story be investigated at once if there is any truth in it the Government will take energetic measures A commission composed of members of all parties was immediately appointed and with the Mayor sent to Peter Paul to investigate As we followed them out the Duma was appointing another commission to meet Kerensky to try and avoid bloodshed when he entered the capital It was midnight when we bluffed our past the guards at the gate of the fortress and went forward under the faint glimmer of rare electric lights along the side of the church where lie the tombs of the Tsars beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes which for months continued to play Bozhe Tsaria Khrani seventeen every day at noon The place was deserted in most of the windows there were not even lights Occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumbling along in the dark who answered questions with the usual Ya nieznayu seventeen God Save the Tsar Graphic page one hundred sixty six Pass to Reed from Department of Prisons translation follows Pass from the Department of Prisons of the Soviet Government to visit freely all prisons of Petrograd and Cronstadt Translation Commissar Chief Bureau of Prisons sixth of November nineteen seventeen No two hundred thirteen Petrograd Smolny Institute room No fifty six PASS To the representative of the American Socialist press JOHN REED to visit all places of confinement in the cities of Petrograd and Cronstadt for the purpose of generally investigating the condition of the prisoners and for thorough social information for the purpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against demorcracy Chief Commissar Secretary On the left loomed the low dark outline of Trubetskoi Bastion that living grave in which so many martyrs of liberty had lost their lives or their reason in the days of the Tsar where the Provisional Government had in turn shut up the Ministers of the Tsar and now the Bolsheviki had shut up the Ministers of the Provisional Government A friendly sailor led us to the office of the commandant in a little house near the Mint Half a dozen Red Guards sailors and soldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke in which a samovar steamed cheerfully They welcomed us with great cordiality offering tea The commandant was not in he was escorting a commission of sabotazhniki sabotageurs from the City Duma who insisted that the yunkers were all being murdered This seemed to amuse them very much At one side of the room sat a bald headed dissipated looking little man in a frock coat and a rich fur coat biting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat He had just been arrested Somebody said glancing carelessly at him that he was a Minister or something The little man didn t seem to hear it he was evidently terrified although the occupants of the room showed no animosity whatever toward him I went across and spoke to him in French Count Tolstoy he answered bowing stiffly I do not understand why I was arrested I was crossing the Troitsky Bridge on my way home when two of these of these persons held me up I was a Commissar of the Provisional Government attached to the General Staff but in no sense a member of the Government Let him go said a sailor He s harmless No responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner We must ask the commandant Oh the commandant sneered the sailor What did you make a revolution for To go on obeying officers A praporshtchik of the Pavlovsky regiment was telling us how the insurrection started The polk regiment was on duty at the General Staff the night of the sixth Some of my comrades and I were standing guard Ivan Pavlovitch and another man I don t remember his name well they hid behind the window curtains in the room where the Staff was having a meeting and they heard a great many things For example they heard orders to bring the Gatchina yunkers to Petrograd by night and an order for the Cossacks to be ready to march in the morning The principal points in the city were to be occupied before dawn Then there was the business of opening the bridges But when they began to talk about surrounding Smolny then Ivan Pavlovitch couldn t stand it any longer That minute there was a good deal of coming and going so he slipped out and came down to the guard room leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could I was already suspicious that something was going on Automobiles full of officers kept coming and all the Ministers were there Ivan Pavlovitch told me what he had heard It was half past two in the morning The secretary of the regimental Committee was there so we told him and asked what to do Arrest everybody coming and going he says So we began to do it In an hour we had some officers and a couple of Ministers whom we sent up to Smolny right away But the Military Revolutionary Committee wasn t ready they didn t know what to do and pretty soon back came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody else Well we ran all the way to Smolny and I guess we talked for an hour before they finally saw that it was war It was five o clock when we got back to the Staff and by that time most of them were gone But we got a few and the garrison was all on the march A Red Guard from Vasili Ostrov described in great detail what had happened in his district on the great day of the rising We didn t have any machine guns over there he said laughing and we couldn t get any from Smolny Comrade Zalking who was a member of the Uprava Central Bureau of the Ward Duma remembered all at once that there was lying in the meeting room of the Uprava a machinegun which had been captured from the Germans So he and I and another comrade went there The Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries were having a meeting Well we opened the door and walked right in on them as they sat around the table twelve or fifteen of them three of us When they saw us they stopped talking and just stared We walked right across the room uncoupled the machine gun Comrade Zalkind picked up one part I the other we put them on our shoulders and walked out and not a single man said a word Do you know how the Winter Palace was captured asked a third man a sailor Along about eleven o clock we found out there weren t any more yunkers on the Neva side So we broke in the doors and filtered up the different stairways one by one or in little bunches When we got to the top of the stairs the yunkers held us up and took away our guns Still our fellows kept coming up little by little until we had a majority Then we turned around and took away the yunkers guns Just then the commandant entered a merry looking young non commissioned officer with his arm in a sling and deep circles of sleeplessness under his eyes His eye fell first on the prisoner who at once began to explain Oh yes interrupted the other You were one of the committee who refused to surrender the Staff Wednesday afternoon However we don t want you citizen Apologies He opened the door and waved his arm for Count Tolstoy to leave Several of the others especially the Red Guards grumbled protests and the sailor remarked triumphantly Vot There Didn t I say so Two soldiers now engaged his attention They had been elected a committee of the fortress garrison to protest The prisoners they said were getting the same food as the guards when there wasn t even enough to keep a man from being hungry Why should the counter revolutionists be treated so well We are revolutionists comrades not bandits answered the commandant He turned to us We explained that rumours were going about that the yunkers were being tortured and the lives of the Ministers threatened Could we perhaps see the prisoners so as to be able to prove to the world No said the young soldier irritably I am not going to disturb the prisoners again I have just been compelled to wake them up they were sure we were going to massacre them Most of the yunkers have been released anyway and the rest will go out to morrow He turned abruptly away Could we talk to the Duma commission then The Commandant who was pouring himself a glass of tea nodded They are still out in the hall he said carelessly Indeed they stood there just outside the door in the feeble light of an oil lamp grouped around the Mayor and talking excitedly mister Mayor I said we are American correspondents Will you please tell us officially the result of your investigations He turned to us his face of venerable dignity There is no truth in the reports he said slowly Except for the incidents which occurred as the Ministers were being brought here they have been treated with every consideration As for the yunkers not one has received the slightest injury Up the Nevsky in the empty after midnight gloom an interminable column of soldiers shuffled in silence to battle with Kerensky In dim back streets automobiles without lights flitted to and fro and there was furtive activity in Fontanka six headquarters of the Peasants Soviet in a certain apartment of a huge building on the Nevsky and in the Injinierny Zamok School of Engineers the Duma was illuminated In Smolny Institute the Military Revolutionary Committee flashed baleful fire pounding like an over loaded dynamo Chapter VII The Revolutionary Front Saturday November tenth Citizens The Military Revolutionary Committee declares that it will not tolerate any violation of revolutionary order Theft brigandage assaults and attempts at massacre will be severely punished Following the example of the Paris Commune the Committee will destroy without mercy any looter or instigator of disorder Quiet lay the city Not a hold up not a robbery not even a drunken fight By night armed patrols went through the silent streets and on the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little fires laughing and singing In the daytime great crowds gathered on the sidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students and soldiers business men and workmen Citizens stopped each other on the street The Cossacks are coming No What s the latest I don t know anything Where s Kerensky They say only eight versts from Petrograd Is it true that the Bolsheviki have fled to the battleship Avrora They say so Only the walls screamed and the few newspapers denunciation appeal decree An enormous poster carried the hysterical manifesto of the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets They the Bolsheviki dare to say that they are supported by the Soviets of Peasants Deputies and that they are speaking on behalf of the Soviets of Peasants Deputies Let all working class Russia know that this is a LIE AND THAT ALL THE WORKING PEASANTS in the person of the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES refutes with indignation all participation of the organised peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working classes From the Soldier Section of the Socialist Revolutionary party The insane attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of collapse The garrison is divided The Ministries are on strike and bread is getting scarcer All factions except the few Bolsheviki have left the Congress The Bolsheviki are alone We call upon all sane elements to group themselves around the Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution and to prepare themselves seriously to be ready at the first call of the Central Committee In a hand bill the Council of the Republic recited its wrongs Ceding to the force of bayonets the Council of the Republic has been obliged to separate and temporarily to interrupt its meetings The usurpers with the words Liberty and Socialism on their lips have set up a rule of arbitrary violence They have arrested the members of the Provisional Government closed the newspapers seized the printing shops This power must be considered the enemy of the people and the Revolution it is necessary to do battle with it and to pull it down The Council of the Republic until the resumption of its labours invites the citizens of the Russian Republic to group themselves around the local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution which are organising the overthrow of the Bolsheviki and the creation of a Government capable of leading the country to the Constituent Assembly Dielo Naroda said A revolution is a rising of all the people But here what have we Nothing but a handful of poor fools deceived by Lenin and Trotzky Their decrees and their appeals will simply add to the museum of historical curiosities And Narodnoye Slovo People s Word Populist Socialist Workers and Peasants Government That is only a pipedream nobody either in Russia or in the countries of our Allies will recognise this Government or even in the enemy countries The bourgeois press had temporarily disappeared Pravada had an account of the first meeting of the new Tsay ee kah now the parliament of the Russian Soviet Republic Miliutin Commissar of Agriculture remarked that the Peasants Executive Committee had called an All Russian Peasant Congress for December thirteenth But we cannot wait he said We must have the backing of the peasants I propose that we call the Congress of Peasants and do it immediately The Left Socialist Revolutionaries agreed An Appeal to the Peasants of Russia was hastily drafted and a committee of five elected to carry out the project The question of detailed plans for distributing the land and the question of Workers Control of Industry were postponed until the experts working on them should submit a report Three decrees See App VII Sect one were read and approved first Lenin s General Rules For the Press ordering the suppression of all newspapers inciting to resistance and disobedience to the new Government inciting to criminal acts or deliberately perverting the news the Decree of Moratorium for House rents and the Decree Establishing a Workers Militia Also orders one giving the Municipal Duma power to requisition empty apartments and houses the other directing the unloading of freight cars in the railroad terminals to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free the badly needed rolling stock Two hours later the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets was sending broadcast over Russia the following telegram The arbitrary organisation of the Bolsheviki which is called Bureau of Organisation for the National Congress of Peasants is inviting all the Peasants Soviets to send delegates to the Congress at Petrograd The Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants Deputies declares that it considers now as well as before that it would be dangerous to take away from the provinces at this moment the forces necessary to prepare for elections to the Constituent Assembly which is the only salvation of the working class and the country We confirm the date of the Congress of Peasants December thirteenth At the Duma all was excitement officers coming and going the Mayor in conference with the leaders of the Committee for Salvation A Councillor ran in with a copy of Kerensky s proclamation dropped by hundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the Nevsky which threatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit and ordered soldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in Mars Field The Minister President had taken Tsarskoye Selo we were told and was already in the Petrograd campagna five miles away He would enter the city to morrow in a few hours The Soviet troops in contact with his Cossacks were said to be going over to the Provisional Government Tchernov was somewhere in between trying to organise the neutral troops into a force to halt the civil war In the city the garrison regiments were leaving the Bolsheviki they said Smolny was already abandoned All the Governmental machinery had stopped functioning The employees of the State Bank had refused to work under Commissars from Smolny refused to pay out money to them All the private banks were closed The Ministries were on strike Even now a committee from the Duma was making the rounds of business houses collecting a fund to pay the salaries of the strikers Trotzky had gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ordered the clerks to translate the Decree on Peace into foreign languages six hundred functionaries had hurled their resignations in his face Shliapnikov Commissar of Labour had commanded all the employees of his Ministry to return to their places within twenty four hours or lose their places and their pension rights only the door servants had responded Some of the branches of the Special Food Supply Committee had suspended work rather than submit to the Bolsheviki In spite of lavish promises of high wages and better conditions the operators at the Telephone Exchange would not connect Soviet headquarters The Socialist Revolutionary Party had voted to expel all members who had remained in the Congress of Soviets and all who were taking part in the insurrection News from the provinces Moghilev had declared against the Bolsheviki At Kiev the Cossacks had overthrown the Soviets and arrested all the insurrectionary leaders The Soviet and garrison of Luga thirty thousand strong affirmed its loyalty to the Provisional Government and appealed to all Russia to rally around it Kaledin had dispersed all Soviets and Unions in the Don Basin and his forces were moving north Said a representative of the Railway Workers Yesterday we sent a telegram all over Russia demanding that war between the political parties cease at once and insisting on the formation of a coalition Socialist Government Otherwise we shall call a strike to morrow night In the morning there will be a meeting of all factions to consider the question The Bolsheviki seem anxious for an agreement If they last that long laughed the City Engineer a stout ruddy man As we came up to Smolny not abandoned but busier than ever throngs of workers and soldiers running in and out and doubled guards everywhere we met the reporters for the bourgeois and moderate Socialist papers Threw us out cried one from Volia Naroda Bonch Bruevitch came down to the Press Bureau and told us to leave Said we were spies They all began to talk at once Insult Outrage Freedom of the press In the lobby were great tables heaped with stacks of appeals proclamations and orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee Workmen and soldiers staggered past carrying them to waiting automobiles One began TO THE PILLORY In this tragic moment through which the Russian masses are living the Mensheviki and their followers and the Right Socialist Revolutionaries have betrayed the working class They have enlisted on the side of Kornilov Kerensky and Savinkov They are printing orders of the traitor Kerensky and creating a panic in the city spreading the most ridiculous rumours of mythical victories by that renegade Citizens Don t believe these false rumours No power can defeat the People s Revolution Premier Kerensky and his followers await speedy and well deserved punishment We are putting them in the Pillory We are abandoning them to the enmity of all workers soldiers sailors and peasants on whom they are trying to rivet the ancient chains They will never be able to wash from their bodies the stain of the people s hatred and contempt Shame and curses to the traitors of the People The Military Revolutionary Committee had moved into larger quarters room seventeen on the top floor Red Guards were at the door Inside the narrow space in front of the railing was crowded with well dressed persons outwardly respectful but inwardly full of murder bourgeois who wanted permits for their automobiles or passports to leave the city among them many foreigners Bill Shatov and Peters were on duty They suspended all other business to read us the latest bulletins The One Hundred Seventy ninth Reserve Regiment offers its unanimous support Five thousand stevedores at the Putilov wharves greet the new Government Central Committee of the Trade Unions enthusiastic support The garrison and squadron at Reval elect Military Revolutionary Committees to cooperate and despatch troops Military Revolutionary Committees control in Pskov and Minsk Greetings from the Soviets of Tsaritzin Rovensky on Don Tchernogorsk Sevastopol The Finland Division the new Committees of the Fifth and Twelfth Armies offer allegiance From Moscow the news is uncertain Troops of the Military Revolutionary Committee occupy the strategic points of the city two companies on duty in the Kremlin have gone over to the Soviets but the Arsenal is in the hands of Colonel Diabtsev and his yunkers The Revolutionary Committee demanded arms for the workers and Riabtsev parleyed with them until this morning when suddenly he sent an ultimatum to the Committee ordering Soviet troops to surrender and the Committee to disband Fighting has begun In Petrograd the Staff submitted to Smolny s Commissars at once The Tsentroflot refusing was stormed by Dybenko and a company of Cronstadt sailors and a new Tsentroflot set up supported by the Baltic and the Black Sea battleships But beneath all the breezy assurance there was a chill premonition a feeling of uneasiness in the air Kerensky s Cossacks were coming fast they had artillery Skripnik Secretary of the Factory Shop Committees his face drawn and yellow assured me that there was a whole army corps of them but he added fiercely They ll never take us alive Petrovsky laughed weariedly To morrow maybe we ll get a sleep a long one Lozovsky with his emaciated red bearded face said What chance have we All alone A mob against trained soldiers South and south west the Soviets had fled before Kerensky and the garrisons of Gatchina Pavlovsk Tsarskoye Selo were divided half voting to remain neutral the rest without officers falling back on the capital in the wildest disorder In the halls they were pasting up bulletins FROM KRASNOYE SELO NOVEMBER tenTH eight A M To be communicated to all Commanders of Staffs Commanders in Chief Commanders everywhere and to all all all The ex Minister Kerensky has sent a deliberately false telegram to every one everywhere to the effect that the troops of revolutionary Petrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined the armies of the former Government the Government of Treason and that the soldiers have been ordered by the Military Revolutionary Committee to retreat The troops of a free people do not retreat nor do they surrender Our troops have left Gatchina in order to avoid bloodshed between themselves and their mistaken brother Cossacks and in order to take a more convenient position which is at present so strong that if Kerensky and his companions in arms should even increase their forces ten times still there would be no cause for anxiety The spirit of our troops is excellent In Petrograd all is quiet Chief of the Defence of Petrograd and the Petrograd District Lieutenant Colonel Muraviov As we left the Military Revolutionary Committee Antonov entered a paper in his hand looking like a corpse Send this said he TO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS DEPUTIES AND FACTORYSHOP COMMITTEES The Kornilovist bands of Kerensky are threatening the approaches to the capital All the necessary orders have been given to crush mercilessly the counter revolutionary attempt against the people and its conquests The Army and the Red Guard of the Revolution are in need of the immediate support of the workers WE ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY SHOP COMMITTEES one To move out the greatest possible number of workers for the digging of trenches the erection of barricades and reinforcing of wire entanglements two Wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work at the factories this shall be done immediately three All common and barbed wire available must be assembled and also all implements for the digging of trenches and the erection of barricades four All available arms must be taken five THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED AND EVERY ONE MUST BE READY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet of Worker s and Soldiers Deputies People s Commissar LEON TROTZKY Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee Commander in Chief PODVOISKY As we came out into the dark and gloomy day all around the grey horizon factory whistles were blowing a hoarse and nervous sound full of foreboding By tens of thousands the working people poured out men and women by tens of thousands the humming slums belched out their dun and miserable hordes Red Petrograd was in danger Cossacks South and southwest they poured through the shabby streets toward the Moskovsky Gate men women and children with rifles picks spades rolls of wire cartridge belts over their working clothes Such an immense spontaneous outpouring of a city never was seen They rolled along torrent like companies of soldiers borne with them guns motor trucks wagons the revolutionary proletariat defending with its breast the capital of the Workers and Peasants Republic Before the door of Smolny was an automobile A slight man with thick glasses magnifying his red rimmed eyes his speech a painful effort stood leaning against a mud guard with his hands in the pockets of a shabby raglan A great bearded sailor with the clear eyes of youth prowled restlessly about absently toying with an enormous blue steel revolver which never left his hand These were Antonov and Dybenko Some soldiers were trying to fasten two military bicycles on the running board The chauffeur violently protested the enamel would get scratched he said True he was a Bolshevik and the automobile was commandeered from a bourgeois true the bicycles were for the use of orderlies But the chauffeur s professional pride was revolted So the bicycles were abandoned The People s Commissars for War and Marine were going to inspect the revolutionary front wherever that was Could we go with them Certainly not The automobile only held five the two Commissars two orderlies and the chauffeur However a Russian acquaintance of mine whom I will call Trusishka calmly got in and sat down nor could any argument dislodge him I see no reason to doubt Trusishka s story of the journey As they went down the Suvorovsky Prospect some one mentioned food They might be out three or four days in a country indifferently well provisioned They stopped the car Money The Commissar of War looked through his pockets he hadn t a kopek The Commissar of Marine was broke So was the chauffeur Trusishka bought the provisions Just as they turned into the Nevsky a tire blew out What shall we do asked Antonov Commandeer another machine suggested Dybenko waving his revolver Antonov stood in the middle of the street and signalled a passing machine driven by a soldier I want that machine said Antonov You won t get it responded the soldier Do you know who I am Antonov produced a paper upon which was written that he had been appointed Commander in Chief of all the armies of the Russian Republic and that every one should obey him without question I don t care if you re the devil himself said the soldier hotly This machine belongs to the First Machine Gun Regiment and we re carrying ammunition in it and you can t have it The difficulty however was solved by the appearance of an old battered taxi cab flying the Italian flag In time of trouble private cars were registered in the name of foreign consulates so as to be safe from requisition From the interior of this was dislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat and the party continued on its way Arrived at Narvskaya Zastava about ten miles out Antonov called for the commandant of the Red Guard He was led to the edge of the town where some few hundred workmen had dug trenches and were waiting for the Cossacks Everything all right here comrade asked Antonov Everything perfect comrade answered the commandant The troops are in excellent spirits Only one thing we have no ammunition In Smolny there are two billion rounds Antonov told him I will give you an order He felt in his pockets Has any one a piece of paper Dybenko had none nor the couriers Trusishka had to offer his note book Devil I have no pencil cried Antonov Who s got a pencil Needless to say Trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd We who were left behind made for the Tsarskoye Selo station Up the Nevsky as we passed Red Guards were marching all armed some with bayonets and some without The early twilight of winter was falling Heads up they tramped in the chill mud irregular lines of four without music without drums A red flag crudely lettered in gold Peace Land floated over them They were very young The expression on their faces was that of who know they are going to die Half fearful half contemptuous the crowds on the sidewalk watched them pass in hateful silence Graphic page one hundred eighty four Pass to the Northern Front This pass was issued upon the recommendation of Trotzky three days after the Bolshevik Revolution It gives me the right of free travel to the Northern front and an added note on the back extends the permission to all fronts It will be noticed that the speaks of the Petersburg instead of the Petrograd Soviet it was the fashion among thorough going internationalists to abolish all names which smacked of patriotism but at the same time it would not do to restore the Saint Translation Executive Committee Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Military Section twenty eighth October nineteen seventeen No fourteen thirty five CERTIFICATE The present certificate is given to the representative of the American Social Democracy the internationalist comrade JOHN REED The Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petersburg Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies gives him the right of free travel through the entire Northern front for the purpose of reporting to our American comrades internationalists concerning events in Russia For the President For the Secretary At the railroad station nobody knew just where Kerensky was or where the front lay Trains went no further however than Tsarskoye Our car was full of commuters and country people going home laden with bundles and evening papers The talk was all of the Bolshevik rising Outside of that however one would never have realised that civil war was rending mighty Russia in two and that the train was headed into the zone of battle Through the window we could see in the swiftly deepening darkness masses of soldiers going along the muddy road toward the city flinging out their arms in argument A freight train swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires was halted on a siding That was all Back along the flat horizon the glow of the city s lights faded down the night A street car crawled distantly along a far flung suburb Tsarskoye Selo station was quiet but knots of soldiers stood here and there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the empty track in the direction of Gatchina I asked some of them which side they were on Well said one we don t exactly know the rights of the matter There is no doubt that Kerensky is a provocator but we do not consider it right for Russian men to be shooting Russian men In the station commandant s office was a big jovial bearded common soldier wearing the red arm band of a regimental committee Our credentials from Smolny commanded immediate respect He was plainly for the Soviets but bewildered The Red Guards were here two hours ago but they went away again A Commissar came this morning but he returned to Petrograd when the Cossacks arrived The Cossacks are here then He nodded gloomily There has been a battle The Cossacks came early in the morning They captured two or three hundred of our men and killed about twenty five Where are the Cossacks Well they didn t get this far I don t know just where they are Off that way He waved his arm vaguely westward We had dinner an excellent dinner better and cheaper than could be got in Petrograd in the station restaurant Nearby sat a French officer who had just come on foot from Gatchina All was quiet there he said Kerensky held the town Ah these Russians he went on they are original What a civil war Everything except the fighting We sallied out into the town Just at the door of the station stood two soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed They were surrounded by about a hundred business men Government officials and students who attacked them with passionate argument and epithet The soldiers were uncomfortable and hurt like children unjustly scolded A tall young man with a supercilious expression dressed in the uniform of a student was leading the attack You realise I presume he said insolently that by taking up arms against your brothers you are making yourselves the tools of murderers and traitors Now brother answered the soldier earnestly you don t understand There are two classes don t you see the proletariat and the bourgeoisie We Oh I know that silly talk broke in the student rudely A bunch of ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a few catch words You don t understand what they mean You just echo them like a lot of parrots The crowd laughed I m a Marxian student And I tell you that this isn t Socialism you are fighting for It s just plain pro German anarchy Oh yes I know answered the soldier with sweat dripping from his brow You are an educated man that is easy to see and I am only a simple man But it seems to me I suppose interrupted the other contemptuously that you believe Lenin is a real friend of the proletariat Yes I do answered the soldier suffering Well my friend do you know that Lenin was sent through Germany in a closed car Do you know that Lenin took money from the Germans Well I don t know much about that answered the soldier stubbornly but it seems to me that what he says is what I want to hear and all the simple men like me Now there are two classes the bourgeoisie and the proletariat You are a fool Why my friend I spent two years in Schluesselburg for revolutionary activity when you were still shooting down revolutionists and singing God Save the Tsar My name is Vasili Georgevitch Panyin Didn t you ever hear of me I m sorry to say I never did answered the soldier with humility But then I am not an educated man You are probably a great hero I am said the student with conviction And I am opposed to the Bolsheviki who are destroying our Russia our free Revolution Now how do you account for that The soldier scratched his head I can t account for it at all he said grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes To me it seems perfectly simple but then I m not well educated It seems like there are only two classes the proletariat and the bourgeoisie There you go again with your silly formula cried the student only two classes went on the soldier doggedly And whoever isn t on one side is on the other We wandered on up the street where the lights were few and far between and where people rarely passed A threatening silence hung over the place as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell a political No Man s Land Only the barber shops were all brilliantly lighted and crowded and a line formed at the doors of the public bath for it was Saturday night when all Russia bathes and perfumes itself I haven t the slightest doubt that Soviet troops and Cossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performed The nearer we came to the Imperial Park the more deserted were the streets A frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of the Soviet and hurried on It was in the wing of one of the Grand Ducal palaces fronting the Park The windows were dark the door locked A soldier lounging about with his hands in the top of his trousers looked us up and down with gloomy suspicion The Soviet went away two days ago said he Where A shrug Nie znayu I don t know A little further along was a large building brightly illuminated From within came a sound of hammering While we were hesitating a soldier and a sailor came down the street hand in hand I showed them my pass from Smolny Are you for the Soviets I asked They did not answer but looked at each other in a frightened way What is going on in there asked the sailor pointing to the building I don t know Timidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crack Inside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens rows of chairs a stage being built A stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tacks came out What do you want she asked Is there a performance to night said the sailor nervously There will be private theatricals Sunday night she answered severely Go away We tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation but they seemed frightened and unhappy and drew off into the darkness We strolled toward the Imperial Palaces along the edge of the vast dark gardens their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridges looming uncertainly in the night and soft water splashing from the fountains At one place where a ridiculous iron swan spat unceasingly from an artificial grotto we were suddenly aware of observation and looked up to encounter the sullen suspicious gaze of half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers who stared moodily down from a grassy terrace I climbed up to them Who are you I asked We are the guard answered one They all looked very depressed as undoubtedly they were from weeks and weeks of all day all night argument and debate Are you Kerensky s troops or the Soviets There was silence for a moment as they looked uneasily at each other Then We are neutral said he We went on through the arch of the huge Ekaterina Palace into the Palace enclosure itself asking for headquarters A sentry outside a door in a curving white wing of the Palace said that the commandant was inside In a graceful white Georgian room divided into unequal parts by a two sided fire place a group of officers stood anxiously talking They were pale and distracted and evidently hadn t slept To one an oldish man with a white beard his uniform studded with decorations who was pointed out as the Colonel we showed our Bolshevik papers He seemed surprised How did you get here without being killed he asked politely It is very dangerous in the streets just now Political passion is running very high in Tsarskoye Selo There was a battle this morning and there will be another to morrow morning Kerensky is to enter the town at eight o clock Where are the Cossacks About a mile over that way He waved his arm And you will defend the city against them Oh dear no He smiled We are holding the city for Kerensky Our hearts sank for our passes stated that we were revolutionary to the core The Colonel cleared his throat About those passes of yours he went on Your lives will be in danger if you are captured Therefore if you want to see the battle I will give you an order for rooms in the officers hotel and if you will come back here at seven o clock in the morning I will give you new passes So you are for Kerensky we said Well not exactly for Kerensky The Colonel hesitated You see most of the soldiers in the garrison are Bolsheviki and to day after the battle they all went away in the direction of Petrograd taking the artillery with them You might say that none of the soldiers are for Kerensky but some of them just don t want to fight at all The officers have almost all gone over to Kerensky s forces or simply gone away We are ahem in a most difficult position as you see We did not believe that there would be any battle The Colonel courteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad station He was from the South born of French immigrant parents in Bessarabia Ah he kept saying it is not the danger or the hardships I mind but being so long three years away from my mother Looking out of the window of the train as we sped through the cold dark toward Petrograd I caught glimpses of clumps of soldiers gesticulating in the light of fires and of clusters of armoured cars halted together at cross roads the chauffeurs hanging out of the turrets and shouting to each other All the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands of soldiers and Red Guards wandered clashing and confused and the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee hurried from one group to another trying to organise a defence Back in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and down the Nevsky Something was in the air From the Warsaw Railway station could be heard far off cannonade In the yunker schools there was feverish activity Duma members went from barracks to barracks arguing and pleading narrating fearful stories of Bolshevik violence massacre of the yunkers in the Winter Palace rape of the women soldiers the shooting of the girl before the Duma the murder of Prince Tumanov In the Alexander Hall of the Duma building the Committee for Salvation was in special session Commissars came and went running All the journalists expelled from Smolny were there in high spirits They did not believe our report of conditions in Tsarskoye Why everybody knew that Tsarskoye was in Kerensky s hands and that the Cossacks were now at

6981_70843_000049_000002	train-clean-360	The centre of gravity however lay not in composition of such a Government but in its acceptance of the programme of the Congress of Soviets

6981_70843_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile all was not well on the revolutionary front 
none	none	The enemy had brought up armoured trains mounted with cannon The Soviet forces mostly raw Red Guards were without officers and without a definite plan Only five thousand regular soldiers had joined them the rest of the garrison was either busy suppressing the yunker revolt guarding the city or undecided what to do At ten in the evening Lenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments who voted overwhelmingly to fight 
6981_70843_000067_000005	train-clean-360	A Committee of five soldiers was elected to serve as General Staff and in the small hours of the morning the regiments left their barracks in full battle array Going home I saw them pass swinging along with the regular tread of veterans bayonets in perfect alignment through the deserted streets of the conquered city 
none	none	At the same time in the headquarters of the Vikzhel down on the Sadovaya the conference of all the Socialist parties to form a new Government was under way 
6981_70843_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Abramovitch for the centre Mensheviki said that there should be neither conquerors nor conquered that bygones should be bygones In this were agreed all the left wing parties

6981_70843_000069_000000	train-clean-360	All that night the commission wrangled and all the next day and the next night 
none	none	Once before on the ninth of November there had been a similar effort at conciliation led by Martov and Gorky but at the approach of Kerensky and the activity of the Committee for Salvation the right wing of the Mensheviki Socialist Revolutionaries and Populist Socialists suddenly withdrew Now they were awed by the crushing of the yunker rebellion Monday the twelfth was a day of suspense The eyes of all Russia were fixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of Petrograd where all the available strength of the old order faced the unorganised power of the new the unknown 
6981_70843_000070_000002	train-clean-360	In Moscow a truce had been declared both sides parleyed awaiting the result in the capital 
none	none	Now the delegates to the Congress of Soviets hurrying on speeding trains to the farthest reaches of Asia were coming to their homes carrying the fiery cross In wide spreading ripples news of the miracle spread over the face of the land and in its wake towns cities and far villages stirred and broke Soviets and Military Revolutionary Committees against Dumas Zemstvos and Government Commissars Red Guards against White street fighting and passionate speech 
6981_70843_000070_000005	train-clean-360	The result waited on the word from Petrograd 
6981_70843_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Smolny was almost empty but the Duma was thronged and noisy 
none	none	The old Mayor in his dignified way was protesting against the Appeal of the Bolshevik Councillors The Duma is not a centre of counter revolution he said warmly The Duma takes no part in the present struggle between the parties But at a time when there is no legal power in the land the only centre of order is the Municipal Self Government 
6981_70843_000072_000001	train-clean-360	The peaceful population recognises this fact the foreign Embassies recognise only such documents as are signed by the Mayor of the town 
none	none	The mind of a European does not admit of any other situation as the Municipal self government is the only organ which is capable of protecting the interests of the citizens The City is bound to show hospitality to all organisations which desire to profit by such hospitality and therefore the Duma cannot prevent the distribution of any newspapers whatever within the Duma building The sphere of our work is increasing and we must be given full liberty of action and our rights must be respected by both parties
6981_70843_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 We are perfectly neutral 
none	none	When the Telephone Exchange was occupied by the yunkers Colonel Polkovnikov ordered the telephones to Smolny disconnected but I protested and the telephones were kept going 
6981_70843_000074_000000	train-clean-360	At this there was ironic laughter from the Bolshevik benches and imprecations from the right 
none	none	And yet went on Schreider they look upon us as counter revolutionaries and report us to the population They deprive us of our means of transport by taking away our last motor cars It will not be our fault if there is famine in the town Protests are of no use Kobozev Bolshevik member of the Town Board was doubtful whether the Military Revolutionary Committee had requisitioned the Municipal automobiles Even granting the fact it was probably done by some unauthorised individual in the emergency
6981_70843_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 The Mayor he continued tells us that we must not make political meetings out of the Duma 
none	none	But every Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda and at the door they distribute their illegal newspapers Iskri Sparks Soldatski Golos and Rabotchaya Gazeta inciting to insurrection What if we Bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papers here 
6981_70843_000077_000002	train-clean-360	But this shall not be for we respect the Duma 
none	none	We have not attacked the Municipal Self Government and we shall not do so But you have addressed an Appeal to the population and we are entitled also to do so 
6981_70843_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Followed him Shingariov Cadet who said that there could be no common language with those who were liable to be brought before the Attorney General for indictment and who must be tried on the charge of treason 
6981_70843_000078_000001	train-clean-360	He proposed again that all Bolshevik members should be expelled from the Duma 
6981_70843_000078_000002	train-clean-360	This was tabled however for there were no personal charges against the members and they were active in the Municipal administration

6981_70843_000079_000002	train-clean-360	The Bolsheviki are depending upon the passions of the unbridled masses we have nothing but moral force We will protest against massacres and violence from both sides as our task is to find a peaceful issue 
6981_70843_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 The notice posted in the streets under the heading To the Pillory which calls upon the people to destroy the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries said Nazariev is a crime which you Bolsheviki will not be able to wash away 
none	none	Yesterday s horrors are but a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation 
6981_70843_000080_000002	train-clean-360	I have always tried to reconcile you with the other parties but at present I feel for you nothing but contempt 
none	none	The Bolshevik Councillors were on their feet shouting angrily assailed by hoarse hateful voices and waving arms Outside the hall I ran into the City Engineer the Menshevik Gomberg and three or four reporters They were all in high spirits
6981_70843_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 See they said

6981_70843_000083_000002	train-clean-360	They don t dare arrest the Duma 
none	none	Their Military Revolutionary Committee doesn t dare to send a Commissar into this building Why on the corner of the Sadovaya to day I saw a Red Guard try to stop a boy selling Soldatski Golos The boy just laughed at him and a crowd of people wanted to lynch the bandit 
6981_70843_000083_000006	train-clean-360	It s only a few hours more now Even if Kerensky wouldn t come they haven t the men to run a Government

6981_70843_000085_000000	train-clean-360	By this time it was dusk 
6981_70843_000085_000001	train-clean-360	The city had again settled down to normal shop shutters up lights shining and on the streets great crowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing 
none	none	At Number eighty six Nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyard surrounded by tall apartment buildings At the door of apartment two hundred twenty nine my friend knocked in a peculiar way 
6981_70843_000086_000002	train-clean-360	There was a sound of scuffling an inside door slammed then the front door opened a crack and a woman s face appeared 
none	none	After a minute s observation she led us in a placid looking middle aged lady who at once cried Kyril it s all right In the dining room where a samovar steamed on the table and there were plates full of bread and raw fish a man in uniform emerged from behind the window curtains and another dressed like a workman from a closet 
6981_70843_000086_000004	train-clean-360	They were delighted to meet an American reporter 
none	none	With a certain amount of gusto both said that they would certainly be shot if the Bolsheviki caught them 
6981_70843_000086_000006	train-clean-360	They would not give me their names but both were Socialist Revolutionaries 
6981_70843_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I asked do you publish such lies in your newspapers 
6981_70843_000088_000000	train-clean-360	Without taking offence the officer replied Yes I know but what can we do He shrugged 
none	none	You must admit that it is necessary for us to create a certain frame of mind in the people 
6981_70843_000089_000000	train-clean-360	The other man interrupted 
6981_70843_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 This is merely an adventure on the part of the Bolsheviki 
6981_70843_000089_000002	train-clean-360	They have no intellectuals 
6981_70843_000089_000003	train-clean-360	The Ministries won t work 
6981_70843_000089_000004	train-clean-360	Russia is not a city but a whole country 
6981_70843_000089_000005	train-clean-360	Realising that they can only last a few days we have decided to come to the aid of the strongest force opposed to them Kerensky and help to restore order 
6981_70843_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 That is all very well I said 
6981_70843_000090_000001	train-clean-360	 But why do you combine with the Cadets 
6981_70843_000091_000000	train-clean-360	The pseudo workman smiled frankly 
none	none	To tell you the truth at this moment the masses of the people are following the Bolsheviki 
6981_70843_000091_000002	train-clean-360	We have no following now 
none	none	We can t mobilise a handful of soldiers There are no arms available The Bolsheviki are right to a certain extent there are at this moment in Russia only two parties with any force the Bolsheviki and the reactionaries who are all hiding under the coat tails of the Cadets 
6981_70843_000091_000005	train-clean-360	The Cadets think they are using us but it is really we who are using the Cadets 
none	none	When we smash the Bolsheviki we shall turn against the Cadets Will the Bolsheviki be admitted into the new Government He scratched his head
6981_70843_000093_000001	train-clean-360	 That s a problem he admitted 
none	none	Of course if they are not admitted they ll probably do this all over again At any rate they will have a chance to hold the balance of power in the Constituent that is if there is a Constituent
6981_70843_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 And then too said the officer that brings up the question of admitting the Cadets into the new Government and for the same reasons 
6981_70843_000094_000001	train-clean-360	You know the Cadets do not really want the Constituent Assembly not if the Bolsheviki can be destroyed now He shook his head 
none	none	It is not easy for us Russians politics 
6981_70843_000094_000003	train-clean-360	You Americans are born politicians you have had politics all your lives 
none	none	But for us well it has only been a year you know
6981_70843_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think of Kerensky I asked 
6981_70843_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Kerensky is guilty of the sins of the Provisional Government answered the other man 
none	none	Kerensky himself forced us to accept coalition with the bourgeoisie If he had resigned as he threatened it would have meant a new Cabinet crisis only sixteen weeks before the Constituent Assembly and that we wanted to avoid
6981_70843_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 But didn t it amount to that anyway 
6981_70843_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but how were we to know 
none	none	They tricked us the Kerenskys and Avksentievs Gotz is a little more radical I stand with Tchernov who is a real revolutionist Why only to day Lenin sent word that he would not object to Tchernov entering the Government We wanted to get rid of the Kerensky Government too but we thought it better to wait for the Constituent At the beginning of this affair I was with the Bolsheviki but the Central Committee of my party voted unanimously against it and what could I do It was a matter of party discipline
6981_70843_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 In a week the Bolshevik Government will go to pieces if the Socialist Revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait the Government would fall into their hands 
none	none	But if we wait a week the country will be so disorganised that the German imperialists will be victorious That is why we began our revolt with only two regiments of soldiers promising to support us and they turned against us That left only the yunkers
6981_70843_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 How about the Cossacks 
6981_70843_000102_000000	train-clean-360	The officer sighed 
6981_70843_000102_000001	train-clean-360	 They did not move 
none	none	At first they said they would come out if they had infantry support 
6981_70843_000102_000003	train-clean-360	They said moreover that they had their men with Kerensky and that they were doing their part 
none	none	Then too they said that the Cossacks were always accused of being the hereditary enemies of democracy And finally The Bolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land 
6981_70843_000102_000006	train-clean-360	There is no danger to us 
6981_70843_000102_000007	train-clean-360	We remain neutral 
6981_70843_000103_000000	train-clean-360	During this talk people were constantly entering and leaving most of them officers their shoulder straps torn off 
none	none	We could see them in the hall and hear their low vehement voices Occasionally through the half drawn portieres we caught a glimpse of a door opening into a bath room where a heavily built officer in a colonel s uniform sat on the toilet writing something on a pad held in his lap 
6981_70843_000103_000003	train-clean-360	I recognised Colonel Polkovnikov former commandant of Petrograd for whose arrest the Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid a fortune 
6981_70843_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Our programme said the officer 
6981_70843_000104_000001	train-clean-360	 This is it 
6981_70843_000104_000002	train-clean-360	Land to be turned over to the Land Committees 
none	none	Workmen to have full representation in the control of industry An energetic peace programme but not an ultimatum to the world such as the Bolsheviki issued 
6981_70843_000104_000005	train-clean-360	The Bolsheviki cannot keep their promises to the masses even in the country itself 
6981_70843_000104_000006	train-clean-360	We won t let them 
none	none	They stole our land programme in order to get the support of the peasants 
6981_70843_000104_000008	train-clean-360	That is dishonest 
6981_70843_000104_000009	train-clean-360	If they had waited for the Constituent Assembly 
none	none	It doesn t matter about the Constituent Assembly broke in the officer If the Bolsheviki want to establish a Socialist state here we cannot work with them in any event 
6981_70843_000105_000002	train-clean-360	Kerensky made the great mistake 
none	none	He let the Bolsheviki know what he was going to do by announcing in the Council of the Republic that he had ordered their arrest But what I said do you intend to do now 
6981_70843_000107_000000	train-clean-360	The two men looked at one another 
6981_70843_000107_000001	train-clean-360	 You will see in a few days 
none	none	If there are enough troops from the front on our side we shall not compromise with the Bolsheviki 
6981_70843_000107_000003	train-clean-360	If not perhaps we shall be forced to 
none	none	Out again on the Nevsky we swung on the step of a streetcar bulging with people its platforms bent down from the weight and scraping along the ground which crawled with agonising slowness the long miles to Smolny 
6981_70843_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Meshkovsky a neat frail little man was coming down the hall looking worried 
none	none	The strikes in the Ministries he told us were having their effect 
6981_70843_000109_000002	train-clean-360	For instance the Council of People s Commissars had promised to publish the Secret Treaties but Neratov the functionary in charge had disappeared taking the documents with him 
none	none	They were supposed to be hidden in the British Embassy 
6981_70843_000110_000000	train-clean-360	Worst of all however was the strike in the banks 
6981_70843_000110_000001	train-clean-360	 Without money said Menzhinsky we are helpless 
none	none	The wages of the railroad men of the postal and telegraph employees must be paid The banks are closed and the key to the situation the State Bank is also shut All the bank clerks in Russia have been bribed to stop work
6981_70843_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 But Lenin has issued an order to dynamite the State Bank vaults and there is a Decree just out ordering the private banks to open to morrow or we will open them ourselves 
none	none	The Petrograd Soviet was in full swing thronged with armed men Trotzky reporting The Cossacks are falling back from Krasnoye Selo Sharp exultant cheering But the battle is only beginning At Pulkovo heavy fighting is going on 
6981_70843_000113_000002	train-clean-360	All available forces must be hurried there 
6981_70843_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 From Moscow bad news 
none	none	The Kremlin is in the hands of the yunkers and the workers have only a few arms 
6981_70843_000114_000002	train-clean-360	The result depends upon Petrograd 
none	none	At the front the decrees on Peace and Land are provoking great enthusiasm 
6981_70843_000115_000001	train-clean-360	Kerensky is flooding the trenches with tales of Petrograd burning and bloody of women and children massacred by the Bolsheviki 
none	none	But no one believes him The cruisers Oleg Avrora and Respublica are anchored in the Neva their guns trained on the approaches to the city Why aren t you out there with the Red Guards shouted a rough voice
6981_70843_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 I m going now answered Trotzky and left the platform 
none	none	His face a little paler than usual he passed down the side of the room surrounded by eager friends and hurried out to the waiting automobile 
6981_70843_000119_000000	train-clean-360	Kameniev now spoke describing the proceedings of the reconciliation conference 
6981_70843_000119_000001	train-clean-360	The armistice conditions proposed by the Mensheviki he said had been contemptuously rejected 
none	none	Even the branches of the Railwaymen s Union had voted against such a proposition
6981_70843_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 Now that we ve won the power and are sweeping all Russia he declared all they ask of us are three little things one 
6981_70843_000120_000001	train-clean-360	To surrender the power 
none	none	two 
6981_70843_000120_000003	train-clean-360	To make the soldiers continue the war 
none	none	three 
6981_70843_000120_000005	train-clean-360	To make the peasants forget about the land 
none	none	Lenin appeared for a moment to answer the accusations of the Socialist Revolutionaries They charge us with stealing their land programme If that is so we bow to them 
6981_70843_000122_000002	train-clean-360	It is good enough for us 
6981_70843_000123_000000	train-clean-360	So the meeting roared on leader after leader explaining exhorting arguing soldier after soldier workman after workman standing up to speak his mind and his heart 
6981_70843_000123_000001	train-clean-360	The audience flowed changing and renewed continually 
6981_70843_000123_000002	train-clean-360	From time to time men came in yelling for the members of such and such a detachment to go to the front others relieved wounded or coming to Smolny for arms and equipment poured in 
none	none	It was almost three o clock in the morning when as we left the hall Holtzman of the Military Revolutionary Committee came running down the hall with a transfigured face
6981_70843_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 It s all right he shouted grabbing my hands 
6981_70843_000125_000001	train-clean-360	 Telegram from the front 
6981_70843_000125_000002	train-clean-360	Kerensky is smashed 
6981_70843_000125_000003	train-clean-360	Look at this 
none	none	He held out a sheet of paper scribbled hurriedly in pencil and then seeing we couldn t read it he declaimed aloud Pulkovo Staff two point ten A M The night of October thirtieth to thirty first will go down in history 
6981_70843_000128_000001	train-clean-360	The attempt of Kerensky to move counter revolutionary troops against the capital of the Revolution has been decisively repulsed 
6981_70843_000128_000002	train-clean-360	Kerensky is retreating we are advancing 
none	none	The soldiers sailors and workers of Petrograd have shown that they can and will with arms in their hands enforce the will and authority of the democracy 
6981_70843_000128_000004	train-clean-360	The bourgeoisie tried to isolate the revolutionary army 
6981_70843_000128_000005	train-clean-360	Kerensky attempted to break it by the force of the Cossacks 
6981_70843_000128_000006	train-clean-360	Both plans met a pitiful defeat 
none	none	The grand idea of the domination of the worker and peasant democracy closed the ranks of the army and hardened its will All the country from now on will be convinced that the Power of the Soviets is no ephemeral thing but an invincible fact The repulse of Kerensky is the repulse of the land owners the bourgeoisie and the Kornilovists in general The repulse of Kerensky is the confirmation of the right of the people to a peaceful free life to land bread and power 
6981_70843_000129_000004	train-clean-360	The Pulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the cause of the Workers and Peasants s Revolution 
6981_70843_000129_000005	train-clean-360	There is no return to the past 
6981_70843_000129_000006	train-clean-360	Before us are struggles obstacles and sacrifices 
none	none	But the road is clear and victory is certain Revolutionary Russia and the Soviet Power can be proud of their Pulkovo detachment acting under the command of Colonel Walden Eternal memory to those who fell Glory to the warriors of the Revolution the soldiers and the officers who were faithful to the People Long live revolutionary popular Socialist Russia In the name of the Council L TROTZKY People s Commissar Driving home across Znamensky Square we made out an unusual crowd in front of the Nicolai Railway Station Several thousand sailors were massed there bristling with rifles Standing on the steps a member of the Vikzhel was pleading with them Comrades we cannot carry you to Moscow We are neutral We do not carry troops for either side We cannot take you to Moscow where already there is terrible civil war All the seething Square roared at him the sailors began to surge forward Suddenly another door was flung wide in it stood two or three brakeman a fireman or so This way comrades cried one We will take you to Moscow or Vladivostok if you like Long live the Revolution Chapter IX Victory Order Number I To the Troops of the Pulkovo Detachment November thirteen nineteen seventeen thirty eight minutes past nine a m After a cruel fight the troops of the Pulkovo detachment completely routed the counter revolutionary forces who retreated from their positions in disorder and under cover of Tsarskoye Selo fell back toward Pavlovsk II and Gatchina Our advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of Tsarskoye Selo and the station Alexandrovskaya The Colpinno detachment was on our left the Krasnoye Selo detachment to our right I ordered the Pulkovo forces to occupy Tsarskoye Selo to fortify its approaches especially on the side of Gatchina Also to pass and occupy Pavlovskoye fortifying its southern side and to take up the railroad as far as Dno The troops must take all measures to strengthen the positions occupied by them arranging trenches and other defensive works They must enter into close liaison with the detachments of Colpinno and Krasnoye Selo and also with the Staff of the Commander in Chief for the Defence of Petrograd Signed Commander in Chief aver all Forces acting against the Counter revolutionary Troops of Kerensky Lieutenant Colonel MURAVIOV Tuesday morning But how is this Only two days ago the Petrograd campagna was full of leaderless bands wandering aimlessly without food without artillery without a plan What had fused that disorganised mass of undisciplined Red Guards and soldiers without officers into an army obedient to its own elected high command tempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and Cossack cavalry See App IX Sect one People in revolt have a way of defying military precedent The ragged armies of the French Revolution are not forgotten Valmy and the Lines of Weissembourg Massed against the Soviet forces were yunkers Cossacks land owners nobility Black Hundreds the Tsar come again Okhrana and Siberian chains and the vast and terrible menace of the Germans Victory in the words of Carlyle meant Apotheosis and Millennium without end Sunday night the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee returning desperately from the field the garrison of Petrograd elected its Committee of Five its Battle Staff three soldiers and two officers all certified free from counter revolutionary taint Colonel Muraviov ex patriot was in command an efficient man but to be carefully watched At Colpinno at Obukhovo at Pulkovo and Krasnoye Selo were formed provisional detachments increased in size as the stragglers came in from the surrounding country mixed soldiers sailors and Red Guards parts of regiments infantry cavalry and artillery all together and a few armoured cars Day broke and the pickets of Kerensky s Cossacks came in touch Scattered rifle fire summons to surrender Over the bleak plain on the cold quiet air spread the sound of battle falling upon the ears of roving bands as they gathered about their little fires waiting So it was beginning They made toward the battle and the worker hordes pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace Thus upon all the points of attack automatically converged angry human swarms to be met by Commissars and assigned positions or work to do This was their battle for their world the officers in command were elected by them For the moment that incoherent multiple will was one will Those who participated in the fighting described to me how the sailors fought until they ran out of cartridges and then stormed how the untrained workmen rushed the charging Cossacks and tore them from their horses how the anonymous hordes of the people gathering in the darkness around the battle rose like a tide and poured over the enemy Before midnight of Monday the Cossacks broke and were fleeing leaving their artillery behind them and the army of the proletariat on a long ragged front moved forward and rolled into Tsarskoye before the enemy had a chance to destroy the great Government wireless station from which now the Commissars of Smolny were hurling out to the world paeans of triumph TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES The twelfth of November in a bloody combat near Tsarskoye Selo the revolutionary army defeated the counter revolutionary troops of Kerensky and Kornilov In the name of the Revolutionary Government I order all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of the revolutionary democracy and to take all measures to arrest Kerensky and also to oppose any adventure which might menace the conquests of the Revolution and the victory of the proletariat Long live the Revolutionary Army MURAVIOV News from the provinces At Sevastopol the local Soviet had assumed the power a huge meeting of the sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced their officers to line up and swear allegiance to the new Government At Nizhni Novgorod the Soviet was in control From Kazan came reports of a battle in the streets yunkers and a brigade of artillery against the Bolshevik garrison Desperate fighting had broken out again in Moscow The yunkers and White Guards held the Kremlin and the centre of the town beaten upon from all sides by the troops of the Military Revolutionary Committee The Soviet artillery was stationed in Skobeliev Square bombarding the City Duma building the Prefecture and the Hotel Metropole The cobblestones of the Tverskaya and Nikitskaya had been torn up for trenches and barricades A hail of machine gun fire swept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses There were no lights no telephones the bourgeois population lived in the cellars The last bulletin said that the Military Revolutionary Committee had delivered an ultimatum to the Committee of Public Safety demanding the immediate surrender of the Kremlin or bombardment would follow Bombard the Kremlin cried the ordinary citizen They dare not From Vologda to Chita in far Siberia from Pskov to Sevastopol on the Black Sea in great cities and little villages civil war burst into flame From thousands of factories peasant communes regiments and armies ships on the wide sea greetings poured into Petrograd greetings to the Government of the People The Cossack Government at Novotcherkask telegraphed to Kerensky The Government of the Cossack troops invites the Provisional Government and the members of the Council of the Republic to come if possible to Novotcherkask where we can organise in common the struggle against the Bolsheviki In Finland also things were stirring The Soviet of Helsingfors and the Tsentrobalt Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet jointly proclaimed a state of siege and declared that all attempts to interfere with the Bolshevik forces and all armed resistance to its orders would be severely repressed At the same time the Finnish Railway Union called a countrywide general strike to put into operation the laws passed by the Socialist Diet of June nineteen seventeen dissolved by Kerensky Early in the morning I went out to Smolny Going up the long wooden sidewalk from the outer gate I saw the first thin hesitating snow flakes fluttering down from the grey windless sky Snow cried the soldier at the door grinning with delight Good for the health Inside the long gloomy halls and bleak rooms seemed deserted No one moved in all the enormous pile A deep uneasy sound came to my ears and looking around I noticed that everywhere on the floor along the walls men were sleeping Rough dirty men workers and soldiers spattered and caked with mud sprawled alone or in heaps in the careless attitudes of death Some wore ragged bandages marked with blood Guns and cartridge belts were scattered about The victorious proletarian army In the upstairs buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk The air was foul Through the clouded windows a pale light streamed A battered samovar cold stood on the counter and many glasses holding dregs of tea Beside them lay a copy of the Military Revolutionary Committee s last bulletin upside down scrawled with painful hand writing It was a memorial written by some soldier to his comrades fallen in the fight against Kerensky just as he had set it down before falling on the floor to sleep The writing was blurred with what looked like tears Alexei Vinogradov D Maskvin S Stolbikov A Voskressensky D Leonsky D Preobrazhensky V Laidansky M Berchikov These men were drafted into the Army on November fifteenth nineteen sixteen Only three are left of the above Mikhail Berchikov Alexei Voskressensky Dmitri Leonsky Sleep Warrior eagles sleep with peaceful soul You have deserved our own ones happiness and Eternal peace Under the earth of the grave You have straitly closed your ranks Sleep Citizens Only the Military Revolutionary Committee still functioned unsleeping Skripnik emerging from the inner room said that Gotz had been arrested but had flatly denied signing the proclamation of the Committee for Salvation as had Avksentiev and the Committee for Salvation itself had repudiated the Appeal to the garrison There was still disafiection among the city regiments Skripnik reported the Volhynsky Regiment had refused to fight against Kerensky Several detachments of neutral troops with Tchernov at their head were at Gatchina trying to persuade Kerensky to halt his attack on Petrograd Skripnik laughed There can be no neutrals now he said We ve won His sharp bearded face glowed with an almost religious exaltation More than sixty delegates have arrived from the Front with assurances of support by all the armies except the troops on the Rumanian front who have not been heard from The Army Committees have suppressed all news from Petrograd but we now have a regular system of couriers Graphic page two hundred twenty four Certificate approving telegram transmission Order given me at Staff headquarters by command of the Council of People s Commissars to transmit the first despatch out of Perograd after the November Revolution over the Government wires to America Translation STAFF Military Revolutionary Commitee Sov W S D two November nineteen seventeen No eighteen sixty CERTIFICATE Is given by the present to the journalist of the New York Socialist press JOHN REED that the text of the telegram herewith has been examined by the Government of People s Commissars and there is no objection to its transmission and also it is recommended that all cooperate in every way to transmit same to its destination For the Commander in Chief ANTONOV Chief of Staff VLAD BONCH BRUEVITCH Down in the front hall Kameniev was just entering worn out by the all night session of the Conference to Form a New Government but happy Already the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined to admit us into the new Government he told me The right wing groups are frightened by the Revolutionary Tribunals they demand in a sort of panic that we dissolve them before going any further We have accepted the proposition of the Vikzhel to form a homogeneous Socialist Ministry and they re working on that now You see it all springs from our victory When we were down they would t have us at any price not everybody s in favour of some agreement with the Soivets What we need is a really decisive victory Kerensky wants an armistice but he ll have to surrender See App IX Sect two That was the temper of the Bolshevik leaders To a foreign journalist who asked Trotzky what statement he had to make to the world Trotzky replied At this moment the only statement possible is the one we are making through the mouths of our cannon But there was an undercurrent of real anxiety in the tide of victory the question of finances Instead of opening the banks as had been ordered by the Military Revolutionary Committee the Union of Bank Employees had held a meeting and declared a formal strike Smolny had demanded some thirty five millions of rubles from the State Bank and the cashier had locked the vaults only paying out money to the representatives of the Provisional Government The reactionaries were using the State Bank as a political weapon for instance when the Vikzhel demanded money to pay the salaries of the employees of the Government railroads it was told to apply to Smolny I went to the State Bank to see the new Commissar a redhaired Ukrainean Bolshevik named Petrovitch He was trying to bring order out of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the striking clerks In all the offices of the huge place perspiring volunteer workers soldiers and sailors their tongues sticking out of their mouths in the intensity of their effort were poring over the great ledgers with a bewildered air The Duma building was crowded There were still isolated cases of defiance toward the new Government but they were rare The Central Land Committee had appealed to the Peasants ordering them not to recognise the Land Decree passed by the Congress of the Soviets because it would cause confusion and civil war Mayor Schreider announced that because of the Bolshevik insurrection the elections to the Constituent Assembly would have to be indefinitely postponed Two questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds shocked by the ferocity of the civil war first a truce to the bloodshed See App IX Sect three second the creation of a new Government There was no longer any talk of destroying the Bolsheviki and very little about excluding them from the Government except from the Populist Socialists and the Peasants Soviets Even the Central Army Committee at the Stavka the most determined enemy of Smolny telephoned from Moghilev If to constitute the new Ministry it is necessary to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviki we agree to admit them in a minority to the Cabinet Pravda ironically calling attention to Kerensky s humanitarian sentiments published his despatch to the Committee for Salvation In accord with the proposals of the Committee for Salvation and all the democratic organisations united around it I have halted all military action against the rebels A delegate of the Committee has been sent to enter into negotiations Take all measures to stop the useless shedding of blood The Vikzhel sent a telegram to all Russia The Conference of the Union of Railway Workers with the representatives of both the belligerent parties who admit the necessity of an agreement protest energetically against the use of political terrorism in the civil war especially when it is carried on between different factions of the revolutionary democracy and declare that political terrorism in whatever form is in contradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a new Government Graphic page two hundred twenty seven Leaflet Popular leaflet sold in the streets just after the Bolshevik insurrection containing rhymes and jokes about the defeated bourgeoisie and the moderate Socialist leaders Called How THE BOORZHUI BOURGEOISIE LOST THE POWER Delegations from the Conference were sent to the Front to Gatchina In the Conference itself everything seemed on the point of final settlement It had even been decided to elect a Provisional People s Council composed of about four hundred members seventy five representing Smolny seventy five the old Tsay ee kah and the rest split up among the Town Dumas the Trade Unions Land Committees and political parties Tchernov was mentioned as the new Premier Lenin and Trotzky rumour said were to be excluded About noon I was again in front of Smolny talking with the driver of an ambulance bound for the revolutionary front Could I go with him Certainly He was a volunteer a University student and as we rolled down the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases of execrable German Also gut Wir nach die Kasernen zu essen gehen I made out that there would be lunch at some barracks On the Kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard surrounded by military buildings and mounted a dark stairway to a low room lit by one window At a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers eating shtchi cabbage soup from a great tin wash tub with wooden spoons and talking loudly with much laughter Welcome to the Battalion Committee of the Sixth Reserve Engineers Battalion cried my friend and introduced me as an American Socialist Whereat every one rose to shake my hand and one old soldier put his arms around me and gave me a hearty kiss A wooden spoon was produced and I took my place at the table Another tub full of kasha was brought in a huge loaf of black bread and of course the inevitable tea pots At once every one began asking me questions about America Was it true that people in a free country sold their votes for money If so how did they get what they wanted How about this Tammany Was it true that in a free country a little group of people could control a whole city and exploited it for their personal benefit Why did the people stand it Even under the Tsar such things could not happen in Russia true here there was always graft but to buy and sell a whole city full of people And in a free country Had the people no revolutionary feeling I tried to explain that in my country people tried to change things by law Of course nodded a young sergeant named Baklanov who spoke French But you have a highly developed capitalist class Then the capitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts How then can the people change things I am open to conviction for I do not know your country but to me it is incredible I said that I was going to Tsarskoye Selo I too said Baklanov suddenly And I and I The whole roomful decided on the spot to go to Tsarskoye Selo Just then came a knock on the door It opened and in it stood the figure of the Colonel No one rose but all shouted a greeting May I come in asked the Colonel Prosim Prosim they answered heartily He entered smiling a tall distinguished figure in a goat skin cape embroidered with gold I think I heard you say that you were going to Tsarskoye Selo comrades he said Could I go with you Baklanov considered I do not think there is anything to be done here to day he answered Yes comrade we shall be very glad to have you The Colonel thanked him and sat down filling a glass of tea In a low voice for fear of wounding the Colonel s pride Baklanov explained to me You see I am the chairman of the Committee We control the Battalion absolutely except in action when the Colonel is delegated by us to command In action his orders must be obeyed but he is strictly responsible to us In barracks he must ask our permission before taking any action You might call him our Executive Officer Arms were distributed to us revolvers and rifles we might meet some Cossacks you know and we all piled into the ambulance together with three great bundles of newspapers for the front Straight down the Liteiny we rattled and along the Zagorodny Prospekt Next to me sat a youth with the shoulder straps of a Lieutenant who seemed to speak all European languages with equal fluency He was a member of the Battalion Committee I am not a Bolshevik he assured me emphatically My family is a very ancient and noble one I myself am you might say a Cadet But how I began bewildered Oh yes I am a member of the Committee I make no secret of my political opinions but the others do not mind because they know I do not believe in opposing the will of the majority I have refused to take any action in the present civil war however for I do not believe in taking up arms against my brother Russians Provocator Kornilovitz the others cried at him gaily slapping him on the shoulder Passing under the huge grey stone archway of the Moskovsky Gate covered with golden hieroglyphics ponderous Imperial eagles and the names of Tsars we sped out on the wide straight highway grey with the first light fall of snow It was thronged with Red Guards stumbling along on foot toward the revolutionary front shouting and singing and others greyfaced and muddy coming back Most of them seemed to be mere boys Women with spades some with rifles and bandoleers others wearing the Red Cross on their arm bands the bowed toil worn women of the slums Squads of soldiers marching out of step with an affectionate jeer for the Red Guards sailors grim looking children with bundles of food for their fathers and mothers all these coming and going trudged through the whitened mud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep We passed cannon jingling southward with their caissons trucks bound both ways bristling with armed men ambulances full of wounded from the direction of the battle and once a peasant cart creaking slowly along in which sat a white faced boy bent over his shattered stomach and screaming monotonously In the fields on either side women and old men were digging trenches and stringing barbed wire entanglements Back northward the clouds rolled away dramatically and the pale sun came out Across the flat marshy plain Petrograd glittered To the right white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles to the left tall chimneys some pouring out black smoke and beyond a lowering sky over Finland On each side of us were churches monasteries Occasionally a monk was visible silently watching the pulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road At Pulkovo the road divided and there we halted in the midst of a great crowd where the human streams poured from three directions friends meeting excited and congratulatory describing the battle to one another A row of houses facing the cross roads was marked with bullets and the earth was trampled into mud half a mile around The fighting had been furious here In the near distance riderless Cossack horses circled hungrily for the grass of the plain had died long ago Right in front of us an awkward Red Guard was trying to ride one falling off again and again to the childlike delight of a thousand rough men The left road along which the remnants of the Cossacks had retreated led up a little hill to a hamlet where there was a glorious view of the immense plain grey as a windless sea tumultuous clouds towering over and the imperial city disgorging its thousands along all the roads Far over to the left lay the little hill of Kranoye Selo the parade ground of the Imperial Guards summer camp and the Imperial Dairy In the middle distance nothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled monasteries and convents some isolated factories and several large buildings with unkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages Here said the driver as we went on over a barren hill here was where Vera Slutskaya died Yes the Bolshevik member of the Duma It happened early this morning She was in an automobile with Zalkind and another man There was a truce and they started for the front trenches They were talking and laughing when all of a sudden from the armoured train in which Kerensky himself was riding somebody saw the automobile and fired a cannon The shell struck Vera Slutskaya and killed her And so we came into Tsarskoye all bustling with the swaggering heroes of the proletarian horde Now the palace where the Soviet had met was a busy place Red Guards and sailors filled the court yard sentries stood at the doors and a stream of couriers and Commissars pushed in and out In the Soviet room a samovar had been set up and fifty or more workers soldiers sailors and officers stood around drinking tea and talking at the top of their voices In one corner two clumsy handed workingmen were trying to make a multigraphing machine go At the centre table the huge Dybenko bent over a map marking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils In his free hand he carried as always the enormous bluesteel revolver Anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded away with one finger every little while he would pause pick up the revolver and lovingly spin the chamber A couch lay along the wall and on this was stretched a young workman Two Red Guards were bending over him but the rest of the company did not pay any attention In his breast was a hole through his clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart beat His eyes were closed and his young bearded face was greenish white Faintly and slowly he still breathed with every breath sighing Mir boudit Mir boudit Peace is coming Peace is coming Dybenko looked up as we came in Ah he said to Baklanov Comrade will you go up to the Commandant s headquarters and take charge Wait I will write you credentials He went to the typewriter and slowly picked out the letters The new Commandant of Tsarskoye Selo and I went toward the Ekaterina Palace Baklanov very excited and important In the same ornate white room some Red Guards were rummaging curiously around while my old friend the Colonel stood by the window biting his moustache He greeted me like a long lost brother At a table near the door sat the French Bessarabian The Bolsheviki had ordered him to remain and continue his work What could I do he muttered People like myself cannot fight on either side in such a war as this no matter how much we may instinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob I only regret that I am so far from my mother in Bessarabia Baklanov was formally taking over the office from the Commandant Here said the Colonel nervously are the keys to the desk A Red Guard interrupted Where s the money he asked rudely The Colonel seemed surprised Money Money Ah you mean the chest There it is said the Colonel just as I found it when I took possession three days ago Keys The Colonel shrugged I have no keys The Red Guard sneered knowingly Very convenient he said Let us open the chest said Baklanov Bring an axe Here is an American comrade Let him smash the chest open and write down what he finds there I swung the axe The wooden chest was empty Let s arrest him said the Red Guard venomously He is Kerensky s man He has stolen the money and given it to Kerensky Baklanov did not want to Oh no he said It was the Kornilovitz before him He is not to blame The devil cried the Red Guard He is Kerensky s man I tell you If you won t arrest him then we will and we ll take him to Petrograd and put him in Peter Paul where he belongs At this the other Red Guards growled assent With a piteous glance at us the Colonel was led away Down in front of the Soviet palace an auto truck was going to the front Half a dozen Red Guards some sailors and a soldier or two under command of a huge workman clambered in and shouted to me to come along Red Guards issued from headquarters each of them staggering under an arm load of small corrugated iron bombs filled with grubit which they say is ten times as strong and five times as sensitive as dynamite these they threw into the truck A three inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the tail of the truck with bits of rope and wire We started with a shout at top speed of course the heavy truck swaying from side to side The cannon leaped from one wheel to the other and the grubit bombs went rolling back and forth over our feet fetching up against the sides of the car with a crash The big Red Guard whose name was Vladimir Nicolaievitch plied me with questions about America Why did America come into the war Are the American workers ready to throw over the capitalists What is the situation in the Mooney case now Will they extradite Berkman to San Francisco and other very difficult to answer all delivered in a shout above the roaring of the truck while we held on to each other and danced amid the caroming bombs Occasionally a patrol tried to stop us Soldiers ran out into the road before us shouted Shtoi and threw up their guns We paid no attention The devil take you cried the Red Guards We don t stop for anybody We re Red Guards And we thundered imperiously on while Vladimir Nicolaievitch bellowed to me about the internationalisation of the Panama Canal and such matters About five miles out we saw a squad of sailors marching back and slowed down Where s the front brothers The foremost sailor halted and scratched his head This morning he said it was about half a kilometer down the road But the damn thing isn t anywhere now We walked and walked and walked but we couldn t find it They climbed into the truck and we proceeded It must have been about a mile further that Vladimir Nicolaievitch cocked his ear and shouted to the chauffeur to stop Firing he said Do you hear it For a moment dead silence and then a little ahead and to the left three shots in rapid succession Along here the side of the road was heavily wooded Very much excited now we crept along speaking in whispers until the truck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come from Descending we spread out and every man carrying his rifle went stealthily into the forest Two comrades meanwhile detached the cannon and slewed it around until it aimed as nearly as possible at our backs It was silent in the woods The leaves were gone and the tree trunks were a pale wan colour in the low sickly autumn sun Not a thing moved except the ice of little woodland pools shivering under our feet Was it an ambush We went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin and paused Beyond in a little clearing three soldiers sat around a small fire perfectly oblivious Vladimir Nicolaievitch stepped forward Zra zvuitye comrades he greeted while behind him one cannon twenty rifles and a truck load of grubit bombs hung by a hair The soldiers scrambled to their feet What was the shooting going on around here One of the soldiers answered looking relieved Why we were just shooting a rabbit or two comrade The truck hurtled on toward Romanov through the bright empty day At the first cross roads two soldiers ran out in front of us waving their rifles We slowed down and stopped Passes comrades The Red Guards raised a great clamour We are Red Guards We don t need any passes Go on never mind them But a sailor objected This is wrong comrades We must have revolutionary discipline Suppose some counterrevolutionaries came along in a truck and said We don t need any passes The comrades don t know you At this there was a debate One by one however the sailors and soldiers joined with the first Grumbling each Red Guard produced his dirty bumaga paper All were alike except mine which had been issued by the Revolutionary Staff at Smolny The sentries declared that I must go with them The Red Guards objected strenuously but the sailor who had spoken first insisted This comrade we know to be a true comrade he said But there are orders of the Committee and these orders must be obeyed That is revolutionary discipline In order not to make any trouble I got down from the truck and watched it disappear careening down the road all the company waving farewell The soldiers consulted in low tones for a moment and then led me to a wall against which they placed me It flashed upon me suddenly they were going to shoot me In all three directions not a human being was in sight The only sign of life was smoke from the chimney of a datchya a rambling wooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road The two soldiers were walking out into the road Desperately I ran after them But comrades See Here is the seal of the Military Revolutionary Committee They stared stupidly at my pass then at each other It is different from the others said one sullenly We cannot read brother I took him by the arm Come I said Let s go to that house Some one there can surely read They hesitated No said one The other looked me over Why not he muttered After all it is a serious crime to kill an innocent man We walked up to the front door of the house and knocked A short stout woman opened it and shrank back in alarm babbling I don t know anything about them I don t know anything about them One of my guards held out the pass She screamed Just to read it comrade Hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud swiftly The bearer of this pass John Reed is a representative of the American Social Democracy an internationalist Out on the road again the two soldiers held another consultation We must take you to the Regimental Committee they said In the fast deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road Occasionally we met squads of soldiers who stopped and surrounded me with looks of menace handling my pass around and arguing violently as to whether or not I should be killed It was dark when we came to the barracks of the Second Tsarskoye Selo Rifles low sprawling buildings huddled along the post road A number of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager questions A spy A provocator We mounted a winding stair and emerged into a great bare room with a huge stove in the centre and rows of cots on the floor where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards talking singing and asleep In the roof was a jagged hole made by Kerensky s cannon I stood in the doorway and a sudden silence ran among the groups who turned and stared at me Of a sudden they began to move slowly and then with a rush thundering with faces full of hate Comrades Comrades yelled one of my guards Committee Committee The throng halted banked around me muttering Out of them shouldered a lean youth wearing a red arm band Who is this he asked roughly The guards explained Give me the paper He read it carefully glancing at me with keen eyes Then he smiled and handed me the pass Comrades this is an American comrade I am Chairman of the Committee and I welcome you to the Regiment A sudden general buzz grew into a roar of greeting and they pressed forward to shake my hand You have not dined Here we have had our dinner You shall go to the Officers Club where there are some who speak your language He led me across the court yard to the door of another building An aristocratic looking youth with the shoulder straps of a Lieutenant was entering The Chairman presented me and shaking hands went back I am Stepan Georgevitch Morovsky at your service said the Lieutenant in perfect French From the ornate entrance hall a ceremonial staircase led upward lighted by glittering lustres On the second floor billiard rooms card rooms a library opened from the hall We entered the dining room at a long table in the centre of which sat about twenty officers in full uniform wearing their gold and silver handled swords the ribbons and crosses of Imperial decorations All rose politely as I entered and made a place for me beside the Colonel a large impressive man with a grizzled beard Orderlies were deftly serving dinner The atmosphere was that of any officers mess in Europe Where was the Revolution You are not Bolsheviki I asked Morovsky A smile went around the table but I caught one or two glancing furtively at the orderly No answered my friend There is only one Bolshevik officer in this regiment He is in Petrograd to night The Colonel is a Menshevik Captain Kherlov there is a Cadet I myself am a Socialist Revolutionary of the right wing I should say that most of the officers in the Army are not Bolsheviki but like me they believe in democracy they believe that they must follow the soldier masses Dinner over maps were brought and the Colonel spread them out on the table The rest crowded around to see Here said the Colonel pointing to pencil marks were our positions this morning Vladimir Kyrilovitch where is your company Captain Kherlov pointed According to orders we occupied the position along this road Karsavin relieved me at five o clock Just then the door of the room opened and there entered the Chairman of the Regimental Committee with another soldier They joined the group behind the Colonel peering at the map Good said the Colonel Now the Cossacks have fallen back ten kilometres in our sector I do not think it is necessary to take up advanced positions Gentlemen for to night you will hold the present line strengthening the positions by If you please interrupted the Chairman of the Regimental Committee The orders are to advance with all speed and prepare to engage the Cossacks north of Gatchina in the morning A crushing defeat is necessary Kindly make the proper dispositions There was a short silence The Colonel again turned to the map Very well he said in a different voice Stepan Georgevitch you will please Rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil he gave his orders while a sergeant made shorthand notes The sergeant then withdrew and ten minutes later returned with the orders typewritten and one carbon copy The Chairman of the Committee studied the map with a copy of the orders before him All right he said rising Folding the carbon copy he put it in his pocket Then he signed the other stamped it with a round seal taken from his pocket and presented it to the Colonel Here was the Revolution I returned to the Soviet palace in Tsarskoye in the Regimental Staff automobile Still the crowds of workers soldiers and sailors pouring in and out still the choking press of trucks armoured cars cannon before the door and the shouting the laughter of unwonted victory Half a dozen Red Guards forced their way through a priest in the middle This was Father Ivan they said who had blessed the Cossacks when they entered the town I heard afterward that he was shot See App IX Sect four Dybenko was just coming out giving rapid orders right and left In his hand he carried the big revolver An automobile stood with racing engine at the kerb Alone he climbed in the rear seat and was off off to Gatchina to conquer Kerensky Toward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town and went on afoot What Dybenko told the Cossacks nobody knows but the fact is that General Krasnov and his staff and several thousand Cossacks surrendered and advised Kerensky to do the same See App IX Sect five As for Kerensky I reprint here the deposition made by General Krasnov on the morning of November fourteenth Gatchina November fourteen nineteen seventeen To day about three o clock A M I was summoned by the Supreme Commander Kerensky He was very agitated and very nervous General he said to me you have betrayed me Your Cossacks declare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to the sailors Yes I answered there is talk of it and I know that you have no sympathy anywhere But the officers say the same thing Yes most of all it is the officers who are discontented with you What shall I do I ought to commit suicide If you are an honorable man you will go immediately to Petrograd with a white flag you will present yourself to the Military Revolutionary Committee and enter into negotiations as Chief of the Provisional Government All right I will do that General I will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you No no not a sailor Do you know whether it is true that Dybenko is here I don t know who Dybenko is He is my enemy There is nothing to do If you play for high stakes you must know how to take a chance Yes I ll leave to night Why That would be a flight Leave calmly and openly so that every one can see that you are not running away Very well But you must give me a guard on which I can count Good I went out and called the Cossack Russkov of the Tenth Regiment of the Don and ordered him to pick out ten Cossacks to accompany the Supreme Commander Half an hour later the Cossacks came to tell me that Kerensky was not in his quarters that he had run away I gave the alarm and ordered that he be searched for supposing that he could not have left Gatchina but he could not be found And so Kerensky fled alone disguised in the uniform of a sailor and by that act lost whatever popularity he had retained among the Russian masses I went back to Petrograd riding on the front seat of an auto truck driven by a workman and filled with Red Guards We had no kerosene so our lights were not burning The road was crowded with the proletarian army going home and new reserves pouring out to take their places Immense trucks like ours columns of artillery wagons loomed up in the night without lights as we were We hurtled furiously on wrenched right and left to avoid collisions that seemed inevitable scraping wheels followed by the epithets of pedestrians Across the horizon spread the glittering lights of the capital immeasurably more splendid by night than by day like a dike of jewels heaped on the barren plain The old workman who drove held the wheel in one hand while with the other he swept the far gleaming capital in an exultant gesture Mine he cried his face all alight All mine now My Petrograd Chapter X Moscow The Military Revolutionary Committee with a fierce intensity followed up its victory

RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA See App XI Sect two The first Congress of Soviets in June of this year proclaimed the right of the peoples of Russia to self determination The second Congress of Soviets in November last confirmed this inalienable right of the peoples of Russia more decisively and definitely Executing the will of these Congresses the Council of People s Commissars has resolved to establish as a basis for its activity in the question of Nationalities the following principles one The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia two The right of the peoples of Russia to free self determination even to the point of separation and the formation of an independent state three The abolition of any and all national and national religious privileges and disabilities four The free development of national minorities and ethnographic groups inhabiting the territory of Russia Decrees will be prepared immediately upon the formation of a Commission on Nationalities In the name of the Russian Republic People s Commissar for Nationalities YUSSOV DJUGASHVILI STALIN President of the Council of People s Commissars V ULIANOV LENIN The Central Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independent Republic as did the Government of Finland through the Senate at Helsingfors Independent Governments spring up in Siberia and the Caucasus The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly gathered together the Polish troops in the Russian army abolished their Committees and established an iron discipline All these Governments and movements had two characteristics in common they were controlled by the propertied classes and they feared and detested Bolshevism Steadily amid the chaos of shocking change the Council of People s Commissars hammered at the scaffolding of the Socialist order Decree on Social Insurance on Workers Control Regulations for Volost Land Committees Abolition of Ranks and Titles Abolition of Courts and the Creation of People s Tribunals See App XI Sect three Army after army fleet after fleet sent deputations joyfully to greet the new Government of the People In front of Smolny one day I saw a ragged regiment just come from the trenches The soldiers were drawn up before the great gates thin and grey faced looking up at the building as if God were in it Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door laughing Red Guards came to mount guard All the soldiers turned to look curiously as if they had heard of them but never seen them They laughed good naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the Red Guards on the back with half joking half admiring remarks The Provisional Government was no more On November fifteenth in all the churches of the capital the priests stopped praying for it But as Lenin himself told the Tsay ee kah that was only the beginning of the conquest of power Deprived of arms the opposition which still controlled the economic life of the country settled down to organise disorganisation with all the Russian genius for cooperative action to obstruct cripple and discredit the Soviets The strike of Government employees was well organised financed by the banks and commercial establishments Every move of the Bolsheviki to take over the Government apparatus was resisted Trotzky went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the functionaries refused to recognise him locked themselves in and when the doors were forced resigned He demanded the keys of the archives only when he brought workmen to force the locks were they given up Then it was discovered that Neratov former assistant Foreign Minister had disappeared with the Secret Treaties Shliapnikov tried to take possession of the Ministry of Labour It was bitterly cold and there was no one to light the fires Of all the hundreds of employees not one would show him where the office of the Minister was Alexandra Kollontai appointed the thirteenth of November Commissar of Public Welfare the department of charities and public institutions was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of the functionaries in the Ministry Immediately the poor of the great cities the inmates of institutions were plunged in miserable want delegations of starving cripples of orphans with blue pinched faces besieged the building With tears streaming down her face Kollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the keys of the office and the safe when she got the keys however it was discovered that the former Minister Countess Panina had gone off with all the funds which she refused to surrender except on the order of the Constituent Assembly See App XI Sect four In the Ministry of Agriculture the Ministry of Supplies the Ministry of Finance similar incidents occurred And the employees summoned to return or forfeit their positions and their pensions either stayed away or returned to sabotage Almost all the intelligentzia being anti Bolshevik there was nowhere for the Soviet Government to recruit new staffs The private banks remained stubbornly closed with a back door open for speculators When Bolshevik Commissars entered the clerks left secreting the books and removing the funds All the employees of the State Bank struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and the manufacture of money who refused all demands from Smolny and privately paid out huge sums to the Committee for Salvation and the City Duma Twice a Commissar with a company of Red Guards came formally to insist upon the delivery of large sums for Government expenses The first time the City Duma members and the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary leaders were present in imposing numbers and spoke so gravely of the consequences that the Commissar was frightened The second time he arrived with a warrant which he proceeded to read aloud in due form but some one called his attention to the fact that it had no date and no seal and the traditional Russian respect for documents forced him again to withdraw The officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed their books so that all record of the financial relations of Russia with foreign countries was lost The Supply Committees the administrations of the Municipal owned public utilities either did not work at all or sabotaged And when the Bolsheviki compelled by the desperate needs of the city population attempted to help or to control the public service all the employees went on strike immediately and the Duma flooded Russia with telegrams about Bolshevik violation of Municipal autonomy At Military headquarters and in the offices of the Ministries of War and Marine where the old officials had consented to work the Army Committees and the high command blocked the Soviets in every way possible even to the extent of neglecting the troops at the front The Vikzhel was hostile refusing to transport Soviet troops every troop train that left Petrograd was taken out by force and railway officials had to be arrested each time whereupon the Vikzhel threatened an immediate general strike unless they were released Smolny was plainly powerless The newspapers said that all the factories of Petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in three weeks the Vikzhel announced that trains must cease running by December first there was food for three days only in Petrograd and no more coming in and the Army on the Front was starving The Committee for Salvation the various Central Committees sent word all over the country exhorting the population to ignore the Government decrees And the Allied Embassies were either coldly indifferent or openly hostile The opposition newspapers suppressed one day and reappearing next morning under new names heaped bitter sarcasm on the new regime See App XI Sect five Even Novaya Zhizn characterised it as a combination of demagoguery and impotence From day to day it said the Government of the People s Commissars sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste Having easily conquered the power the Bolsheviki can not make use of it Powerless to direct the existing mechanism of Government they are unable at the same time to create a new one which might work easily and freely according to the theories of social experimenters Just a little while ago the Bolsheviki hadn t enough men to run their growing party a work above all of speakers and writers where then are they going to find trained men to execute the diverse and complicated functions of government The new Government acts and threatens it sprays the country with decrees each one more radical and more socialist than the last But in this exhibition of Socialism on Paper more likely designed for the stupefaction of our descendants there appears neither the desire nor the capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day Meanwhile the Vikzhel s Conference to Form a New Government continued to meet night and day Both sides had already agreed in principle to the basis of the Government the composition of the People s Council was being discussed the Cabinet was tentatively chosen with Tchernov as Premier the Bolsheviki were admitted in a large minority but Lenin and Trotzky were barred The Central Committees of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties the Executive Committee of the Peasant s Soviets resolved that although unalterably opposed to the criminal politics of the Bolsheviki they would in order to halt the fratricidal bloodshed not oppose their entrance into the People s Council The flight of Kerensky however and the astounding success of the Soviets everywhere altered the situation On the sixteenth in a meeting of the Tsay ee kah the Left Socialist Revolutionaries insisted that the Bolsheviki should form a coalition Government with the other Socialist parties otherwise they would withdraw from the Military Revolutionary Committee and the Tsay ee kah Malkin said The news from Moscow where our comrades are dying on both sides of the barricades determines us to bring up once more the question of organisation of power and it is not only our right to do so but our duty We have won the right to sit with the Bolsheviki here within the walls of Smolny Institute and to speak from this tribune After the bitter internal party struggle we shall be obliged if you refuse to compromise to pass to open battle outside We must propose to the democracy terms of an acceptable compromise After a recess to consider this ultimatum the Bolsheviki returned with a resolution read by Kameniev The Tsay ee kah considers it necessary that there enter into the Government representatives of all the Socialist parties composing the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies who recognise the conquests of the Revolution of November seventh that is to say the establishment of a Government of Soviets the decrees on peace land workers control over industry and the arming of the working class The Tsay ee kah therefore resolves to propose negotiations concerning the constitution of the Government to all parties of the Soviet and insists upon the following conditions as a basis The Government is responsible to the Tsay ee kah The Tsay ee kah shall be enlarged to one hundred fifty members To these one hundred fifty delegates of the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies shall be added seventy five delegates of the Provincial Soviets of Peasants Deputies eighty from the Front organisations of the Army and Navy forty from the Trade Unions twenty five from the various All Russian Unions in proportion to their importance ten from the Vikzhel and five from the Post and Telegraph Workers and fifty delegates from the Socialist groups in the Petrograd City Duma In the Ministry itself at least one half the portfolios must be reserved to the Bolsheviki The Ministries of Labour Interior and Foreign Affairs must be given to the Bolsheviki The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and Moscow must remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets The Government undertakes the systematic arming of the workers of all Russia It is resolved to insist upon the candidature of comrades Lenin and Trotzky Kameniev explained The so called People s Council he said proposed by the Conference would consist of about four hundred twenty members of which about one hundred fifty would be Bolsheviki Besides there would be delegates from the counter revolutionary old Tsay ee kah one hundred members chosen by the Municipal Dumas Kornilovtsi all one hundred delegates from the Peasants Soviets appointed by Avksentiev and eighty from the old Army Committees who no longer represent the soldier masses We refuse to admit the old Tsay ee kah and also the representatives of the Municipal Dumas The delegates from the Peasants Soviets shall be elected by the Congress of Peasants which we have called and which will at the same time elect a new Executive Committee The proposal to exclude Lenin and Trotzky is a proposal to decapitate our party and we do not accept it And finally we see no necessity for a People s Council anyway the Soviets are open to all Socialist parties and the Tsay ee kah represents them in their real proportions among the masses Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared that his party would vote for the Bolshevik resolution reserving the right to modify certain details such as the representation of the peasants and demanding that the Ministry of Agriculture be reserved for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries This was agreed to Later at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet Trotzky answered a question about the formation of the new Government I don t know anything about that I am not taking part in the negotiations However I don t think that they are of great importance That night there was great uneasiness in the Conference The delegates of the City Duma withdrew But at Smolny itself in the ranks of the Bolshevik party a formidable opposition to Lenin s policy was growing On the night of November seventeenth the great hall was packed and ominous for the meeting of the Tsay ee kah Larin Bolshevik declared that the moment of elections to the Constituent Assembly approached and it was time to do away with political terrorism The measures taken against the freedom of the press should be modified They had their reason during the struggle but now they have no further excuse The press should be free except for appeals to riot and insurrection In a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party Larin offered the following resolution The decree of the Council of People s Commissars concerning the Press is herewith repealed Measures of political repression can only be employed subject to decision of a special tribunal elected by the Tsay ee kah proportionally to the strength of the different parties represented and this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measures of repression already taken This was met by a thunder of applause not only from the Left Socialist Revolutionaries but also from a part of the Bolsheviki Avanessov for the Leninites hastily proposed that the question of the Press be postponed until after some compromise between the Socialist parties had been reached Overwhelmingly voted down The revolution which is now being accomplished went on Avanessov has not hesitated to attack private property and it is as private property that we must examine the question of the Press Thereupon he read the official Bolshevik resolution The suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only by purely military needs in the course of the insurrection and for the checking of counter revolutionary action but it is also necessary as a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new regime with regard to the Press a regime under which the capitalist owners of printing presses and of paper cannot be the all powerful and exclusive manufacturers of public opinion We must further proceed to the confiscation of private printing plants and supplies of paper which should become the property of the Soviets both in the capital and in the provinces so that the political parties and groups can make use of the facilities of printing in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas they represent in other words proportionally to the number of their constituents The reestablishment of the so called freedom of the press the simple return of printing presses and paper to the capitalists poisoners of the mind of the people this would be an inadmissible surrender to the will of capital a giving up of one of the most important conquests of the Revolution in other words it would be a measure of unquestionably counter revolutionary character Proceeding from the above the Tsay ee kah categorically rejects all propositions aiming at the reestablishment of the old regime in the domain of the Press and unequivocally supports the point of view of the Council of People s Commissars on this question against pretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudices or by evident surrender to the interests of the counter revolutionary bourgeoisie The reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shouts from the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bursts of indignation from the insurgent Bolsheviki Karelin was on his feet protesting Three weeks ago the Bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders of the freedom of the Press The arguments in this resolution suggest singularly the point of view of the old Black Hundreds and the censors of the Tsarist regime for they also talked of poisoners of the mind of the people Trotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution He distinguished between the Press during the civil war and the Press after the victory During civil war the right to use violence belongs only to the oppressed Cries of Who s the oppressed now Cannibal The victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved and the newspapers are arms in their hands In these conditions the closing of the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence Then passing to the question of the Press after the victory Trotzky continued The attitude of Socialists on the question of freedom of the Press should be the same as their attitude toward the freedom of business The rule of the democracy which is being established in Russia demands that the domination of the Press by private property must be abolished just as the domination of industry by private property The power of the Soviets should confiscate all printing plants Cries Confiscate the printing shop of Pravda The monopoly of the Press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished Otherwise it isn t worth while for us to take the power Each group of citizens should have access to print shops and paper The ownership of print type and of paper belongs first to the workers and peasants and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties which are in a minority The passing of the power into the hands of the Soviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essential conditions of existence and this transformation will necessarily be evident in the Press If we are going to nationalise the banks can we then tolerate the financial journals The old regime must die that must be understood once and for all Applause and angry cries Karelin declared that the Tsay ee kah had no right to pass upon this important question which should be left to a special committee Again passionately he demanded that the Press be free Then Lenin calm unemotional his forehead wrinkled as he spoke slowly choosing his words each sentence falling like a hammer blow The civil war is not yet finished the enemy is still with us consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures of repression against the Press We Bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position of power we would close the bourgeois press To tolerate the bourgeois newspapers would mean to cease being a Socialist When one makes a Revolution one cannot mark time one must always go forward or go back He who now talks about the freedom of the Press goes backward and halts our headlong course toward Socialism We have thrown off the yoke of capitalism just as the first revolution threw off the yoke of Tsarism If the first revolution had the right to suppress the Monarchist papers then we have the right to suppress the bourgeois press It is impossible to separate the question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions of the class struggle We have promised to close these newspapers and we shall do it The immense majority of the people is with us Now that the insurrection is over we have absolutely no desire to suppress the papers of the other Socialist parties except inasmuch as they appeal to armed insurrection or to disobedience to the Soviet Government However we shall not permit them under the pretence of freedom of the Socialist press to obtain through the secret support of the bourgeoisie a monopoly of printing presses ink and paper These essentials must become the property of the Soviet Government and be apportioned first of all to the Socialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength Then the vote The resolution of Larin and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries was defeated by thirty one to twenty two the Lenin motion was carried by thirty four to twenty four Among the minority were the Bolsheviki Riazanov and Lozovsky who declared that it was impossible for them to vote against any restriction on the freedom of the Press Upon this the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could no longer be responsible for what was being done and withdrew from the Military Revolutionary Committee and all other positions of executive responsibility Five members Nogin Rykov Miliutin Teodorovitch and Shiapnikov resigned from the Council of People s Commissars declaring We are in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all the parties in the Soviets We consider that only the creation of such a Government can possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggle of the working class and the revolutionary army Outside of that there remains only one way the constitution of a purely Bolshevik Government by means of political terrorism This last is the road taken by the Council of People s Commissars We cannot and will not follow it We see that this leads directly to the elimination from political life of many proletarian organisations to the establishment of an irresponsible regime and to the destruction of the Revolution and the country We cannot take the responsibility for such a policy and we renounce before the Tsay ee kah our function as People s Commissars Other Commissars without resigning their positions signed the declaration Riazanov Derbychev of the Press Department Arbuzov of the Government Printing plant Yureniev of the Red Guard Feodorov of the Commissariat of Labour and Larin secretary of the Section of Elaboration of Decrees At the same time Kameniev Rykov Miliutin Zinoviev and Nogin resigned from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party making public their reasons The constitution of such a Government composed of all the parties of the Soviet is indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood the coming famine the destruction of the Revolution by the Kaledinists to assure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly at the proper time and to apply effectively the programme adopted by the Congress of Soviets We cannot accept the responsibility for the disastrous policy of the Central Committee carried on against the will of an enormous majority of the proletariat and the soldiers who are eager to see the rapid end of the bloodshed between the different political parties of the democracy We renounce our title as members of the Central Committee in order to be able to say openly our opinion to the masses of workers and soldiers We leave the Central Committee at the moment of victory we cannot calmly look on while the policy of the chiefs of the Central Committee leads toward the loss of the fruits of victory and the crushing of the proletariat The masses of the workers the soldiers of the garrison stirred restlessly sending their delegations to Smolny to the Conference for Formation of the New Government where the break in the ranks of the Bolsheviki caused the liveliest joy But the answer of the Leninites was swift and ruthless Shliapnikov and Teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to their posts Kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of the Tsay ee kah and Sverdlov elected in his place Zinoviev was deposed as president of the Petrograd Soviet On the morning of the fifth Pravda contained a ferocious proclamation to the people of Russia written by Lenin which was printed in hundreds of thousands of copies posted on the walls everywhere and distributed over the face of Russia The second All Russian Congress of Soviets gave the majority to the Bolshevik party Only a Government formed by this party can therefore be a Soviet Government And it is known to all that the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party a few hours before the formation of the new Government and before proposing the list of its members to the All Russian Congress of Soviets invited to its meeting three of the most eminent members of the Left Socialist Revolutionary group comrades Kamkov Spiro and Karelin and ASKED THEM to participate in the new Government We regret infinitely that the invited comrades refused we consider their refusal inadmissible for revolutionists and champions of the working class we are willing at any time to include the Left Socialist Revolutionaries in the Government but we declare that as the party of the majority at the second All Russian Congress of Soviets we are entitled and BOUND before the people to form a Government Comrades Several members of the Central Committee of our party and the Council of People s Commissars Kameniev Zinoviev Nogin Rykov Miliutin and a few others left yesterday November seventeenth the Central Committee of our party and the last three the Council of People s Commissars The comrades who left us acted like deserters because they not only abandoned the posts entrusted to them but also disobeyed the direct instructions of the Central Committee of our party to the effect that they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and Moscow party organisations before retiring We blame decisively such desertion We are firmly convinced that all conscious workers soldiers and peasants belonging to our party or sympathising with it will also disapprove of the behaviour of the deserters Remember comrades that two of these deserters Kameniev and Zinoviev even before the uprising in Petrograd appeared as deserters and strike breakers by voting at the decisive meeting of the Central Committee October twenty threed nineteen seventeen against the insurrection and even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central Committee they continued their campaign at a meeting of the party workers But the great impulse of the masses the great heroism of millions of workers soldiers and peasants in Moscow Petrograd at the front in the trenches in the villages pushed aside the deserters as a railway train scatters saw dust Shame upon those who are of little faith hesitate who doubt who allow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie or who succumb before the cries of the latter s direct or indirect accomplices There is NOT A SHADOW of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd Moscow and the rest of Russia We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups of intellectuals which are not followed by the masses which are PRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists Savinkovists yunkers and so forth

Ministry of Finance from the Special Supply Committee declarations that the Military Revolutionary Committee made it impossible for the employees to work appeals to the population to support them against Smolny But the dominant worker and soldier did not believe them it was firmly fixed in the popular mind that the employees were sabotaging starving the Army starving the people In the long bread lines which as formerly stood in the iron winter streets it was not the Government which was blamed as it had been under Kerensky but the tchinovniki the sabotageurs for the Government was their Government their Soviets and the functionaries of the Ministries were against it At the centre of all this opposition was the Duma and its militant organ the Committee for Salvation protesting against all the decrees of the Council of People s Commissars voting again and again not to recognise the Soviet Government openly cooperating with the new counter revolutionary Governments set up at Moghilev On the seventeenth of November for example the Committee for Salvation addressed all Municipal Governments Zemstvos and all democratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants workers soldiers and other citizens in these words Do not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki and struggle against it Form local Committees for Salvation of Country and Revolution who will unite all democratic forces so as to aid the All Russian Committee for Salvation in the tasks which it has set itself Meanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in Petrograd See App XI Sect fifteen gave an enormous plurality to the Bolsheviki so that even the Mensheviki Internationalists pointed out that the Duma ought to be re elected as it no longer represented the political composition of the Petrograd population At the same time floods of resolutions from workers organisations from military units even from the peasants in the surrounding country poured in upon the Duma calling it counter revolutionary Kornilovitz and demanding that it resign The last days of the Duma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workers for decent living wages and the threat of strikes On the twenty threed a formal decree of the Military Revolutionary Committee dissolved the Committee for Salvation On the twenty ninth the Council of People s Commissars ordered the dissolution and re election of the Petrograd City Duma In view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd elected September twod has definitely lost the right to represent the population of Petrograd being in complete disaccord with its state of mind and its aspirations and in view of the fact that the personnel of the Duma majority although having lost all political following continues to make use of its prerogatives to resist in a counter revolutionary manner the will of the workers soldiers and peasants to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of the Government the Council of People s Commissars considers it its duty to invite the population of the capital to pronounce judgment on the policy of the organ of Municipal autonomy To this end the Council of People s Commissars resolves one To dissolve the Municipal Duma the dissolution to take effect November thirtieth nineteen seventeen two All functionaries elected or appointed by the present Duma shall remain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them until their places shall be filled by representatives of the new Duma three All Municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties those who leave the service of their own accord shall be considered discharged four The new elections for the Municipal Duma of Petrograd are fixed for December ninth nineteen seventeen five The Municipal Duma of Petrograd shall meet December eleventh nineteen seventeen at two o clock six Those who disobey this decree as well as those who intentionally harm or destroy the property of the Municipality shall be immediately arrested and brought before the Revolutionary Tribunals The Duma met defiantly passing resolutions to the effect that it would defend its position to the last drop of its blood and appealing desperately to the population to save their own elected City Government But the population remained indifferent or hostile On the thirty first Mayor Schreider and several members were arrested interrogated and released That day and the next the Duma continued to meet interrupted frequently by Red Guards and sailors who politely requested the assembly to disperse At the meeting of December twod an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai Hall while a member was speaking and ordered the members to leave or force would be used They did so protesting to the last but finally ceding to violence The new Duma which was elected ten days later and for which the Moderate Socialists refused to vote was almost entirely Bolshevik There remained several centres of dangerous opposition such as the republics of Ukraine and Finland which were showing definitely anti Soviet tendencies Both at Helsingfors and at Kiev the Governments were gathering troops which could be depended upon and entering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism and of disarming and expelling Russian troops The Ukrainean Rada had taken command of all southern Russia and was furnishing Kaledin reinforcements and supplies Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning secret negotiations with the Germans and were promptly recognised by the Allied Governments which loaned them huge sums of money joining with the propertied classes to create counter revolutionary centres of attack upon Soviet Russia In the end when Bolshevism had conquered in both these countries the defeated bourgeoisie called in the Germans to restore them to power But the most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internal and two headed the Kaledin movement and the Staff at Moghilev where General Dukhonin had assumed command

against the Cossacks and a Red Army was recruited from among the factory workers Hundreds of propagandists were sent to the Don The Council of People s Commissars issued a proclamation to the Cossacks See App XI Sect sixteen explaining what the Soviet Government was how the propertied classes the tchin ovniki landlords bankers and their allies the Cossack princes land owners and Generals were trying to destroy the Revolution and prevent the confiscation of their wealth by the people On November twenty seventh a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to see Trotzky and Lenin They demanded if it were true that the Soviet Government did not intend to divide the Cossack lands among the peasants of Great Russia No answered Trotzky The Cossacks deliberated for a while Well they asked does the Soviet Government intend to confiscate the estates of our great Cossack land owners and divide them among the working Cossacks To this Lenin replied That he said is for you to do We shall support the working Cossacks in all their actions The best way to begin is to form Cossacks Soviets you will be given representation in the Tsay ee kah and then it will be your Government too The Cossacks departed thinking hard Two weeks later General Kaledin received a deputation from his troops Will you they asked promise to divide the great estates of the Cossack landlords among the working Cossacks Only over my dead body responded Kaledin A month later seeing his army melt away before his eyes Kaledin blew out his brains And the Cossack movement was no more Meanwhile at Moghilev were gathered the old Tsay ee kah the moderate Socialist leaders from Avksentiev to Tchernov the active chiefs of the old Army Committees and the reactionary officers The Staff steadily refused to recognise the Council of People s Commissars It had united about it the Death Battalions the Knights of saint George and the Cossacks of the Front and was in close and secret touch with the Allied military attaches and with the Kaledin movement and the Ukrainean Rada The Allied Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree of November eighth in which the Congress of Soviets had asked for a general armistice On November twentieth Trotzky addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors See App XI Sect eighteen I have the honour to inform you mister Ambassador that the All Russian Congress of Soviets on November eighth constituted a new Government of the Russian Republic in the form of the Council of People s Commissars The President of this Government is Vladimir Ilyitch Lenin The direction of Foreign Affairs has been entrusted to me People s Commissar for Foreign Affairs In drawing your attention to the text approved by the All Russian Congress of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic peace without annexations or indemnities based on the right of self determination of peoples I have the honour to request you to consider that document as a formal proposal of an immediate armistice on all fronts and the opening of immediate peace negotiations a proposal which the authorised Government of the Russian Republic addresses at the same time to all the belligerent peoples and their Governments Please accept mister Ambassador the profound assurance of the esteem of the Soviet Government toward your people who cannot but wish for peace like all the other peoples exhausted and drained by this unexampled butchery The same night the Council of People s Commissars telegraphed to General Dukhonin The Council of People s Commissars considers it indispensable without delay to make a formal proposal of armistice to all the powers both enemy and Allied A declaration conforming to this decision has been sent by the Commissar for Foreign Affairs to the representatives of the Allied powers at Petrograd The Council of People s Commissars orders you Citizen Commander to propose to the enemy military authorities immediately to cease hostilities and enter into negotiations for peace In charging you with the conduct of these preliminary pourparlers the Council of People s Commissars orders you one To inform the Council by direct wire immediately of any and all steps in the pourparlers with the representatives of the enemy armies two Not to sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon by the Council of People s Commissars The Allied Ambassadors received Trotzky s note with contemptuous silence accompanied by anonymous interviews in the newspapers full of spite and ridicule The order to Dukhonin was characterised openly as an act of treason As for Dukhonin he gave no sign On the night of November twenty second he was communicated with by telephone and asked if he intended to obey the order Dukhonin answered that he could not unless it emanated from a Government sustained by the Army and the country By telegraph he was immediately dismissed from the post of Supreme Commander and Krylenko appointed in his place Following his tactics of appealing to the masses Lenin sent a radio to all regimental divisional and corps Committees to all soldiers and sailors of the Army and the Fleet acquainting them with Dukhonin s refusal and ordering that the regiments on the front shall elect delegates to begin negotiations with the enemy detachments opposite their positions On the twenty threed the military attaches of the Allied nations acting on instructions from their Governments presented a note to Dukhonin in which he was solemnly warned not to violate the conditions of the treaties concluded between the Powers of the Entente The note went on to say that if a separate armistice with Germany were concluded that act would result in the most serious consequences to Russia This communication Dukhonin at once sent out to all the soldiers Committees Next morning Trotzky made another appeal to the troops characterising the note of the Allied representatives as a flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Russia and a bald attempt to force by threats the Russian Army and the Russian people to continue the war in execution of the treaties concluded by the Tsar From Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation See App XI Sect nineteen denouncing Dukhonin and the counter revolutionary officers about him denouncing the reactionary politicians gathered at Moghilev rousing from one end of the thousand mile Front to the other millions of angry suspicious soldiers And at the same time Krylenko accompanied by three detachments of fanatical sailors set out for the Stavka breathing threats of vengeance See App XI Sect twenty and received by the soldiers everywhere with tremendous ovations a triumphal progress The Central Army Committee issued a declaration in favour of Dukhonin and at once ten thousand troops moved upon Moghilev On December twod the garrison of Moghilev rose and seized the city arresting Dukhonin and the Army Committee and going out with victorious red banners to meet the new Supreme Commander Krylenko entered Moghilev next morning to find a howling mob gathered about the railway car in which Dukhonin had been imprisoned Krylenko made a speech in which he implored the soldiers not to harm Dukhonin as he was to be taken to Petrograd and judged by the Revolutionary Tribunal When he had finished suddenly Dukhonin himself appeared at the window as if to address the throng But with a savage roar the people rushed the car and falling upon the old General dragged him out and beat him to death on the platform So ended the revolt of the Stavka Immensely strengthened by the collapse of the last important stronghold of hostile military power in Russia the Soviet Government began with confidence the organisation of the state Many of the old functionaries flocked to its banner and many members of other parties entered the Government service The financially ambitious however were checked by the decree on Salaries of Government Employees fixing the salaries of the People s Commissars the highest at five hundred rubles about fifty dollars a month The strike of Government Employees led by the Union of Unions collapsed deserted by the financial and commercial interests which had been backing it The bank clerks returned to their jobs With the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks the formation of the Supreme Council of People s Economy the putting into practical operation of the Land decree in the villages the democratic reorganisation of the Army and the sweeping changes in all branches of the Government and of life with all these effective only by the will of the masses of workers soldiers and peasants slowly began with many mistakes and hitches the moulding of proletarian Russia Not by compromise with the propertied classes or with the other political leaders not by conciliating the old Government mechanism did the Bolsheviki conquer the power Nor by the organized violence of a small clique If the masses all over Russia had not been ready for insurrection it must have failed The only reason for Bolshevik success lay in their accomplishing the vast and simple desires of the most profound strata of the people calling them to the work of tearing down and destroying the old and afterward in the smoke of falling ruins cooperating with them to erect the frame work of the new Chapter XII The Peasants Congress It was on November eighteenth that the snow came In the morning we woke to window ledges heaped white and snowflakes falling so whirling thick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead The mud was gone in a twinkling the gloomy city became white dazzling The droshki with their padded coachmen turned into sleights bounding along the uneven street at headlong speed their drivers beards stiff and frozen In spite of Revolution all Russia plunging dizzily into the unknown and terrible future joy swept the city with the coming of the snow Everybody was smiling people ran into the streets holding out their arms to the soft falling flakes laughing Hidden was all the greyness only the gold and coloured spires and cupolas with heightened barbaric splendour gleamed through the white snow Even the sun came out pale and watery at noon The colds and rheumatism of the rainy months vanished The life of the city grew gay and the very Revolution ran swifter I sat one evening in a traktir a kind of lower class inn across the street from the gates of Smolny a low ceilinged loud place called Uncle Tom s Cabin much frequented by Red Guards They crowded it now packed close around the little tables with their dirty table cloths and enormous china tea pots filling the place with foul cigarette smoke while the harassed waiters ran about crying Seichass Seichass In a minute Right away In one corner sat a man in the uniform of a captain addressing the assembly which interrupted him at every few words You are no better than murderers he cried Shooting down your Russian brothers on the streets When did we do that asked a worker Last Sunday you did it when the yunkers Well didn t they shoot us One man exhibited his arm in a sling Haven t I got something to remember them by the devils The captain shouted at the top of his voice You should remain neutral You should remain neutral Who are you to destroy the legal Government Who is Lenin A German Who are you A counter revolutionist A provocator they bellowed at him When he could make himself heard the captain stood up All right said he You call yourselves the people of Russia But you re not the people of Russia The peasants are the people of Russia Wait until the peasants Yes they cried wait until the peasants speak We know what the peasants will say Aren t they workingmen like ourselves In the long run everything depended upon the peasants While the peasants had been politically backward still they had their own peculiar ideas and they constituted more than eighty per cent of the people of Russia The Bolsheviki had a comparatively small following among the peasants and a permanent dictatorship of Russia by the industrial workers was impossible The traditional peasant party was the Socialist Revolutionary party of all the parties now supporting the Soviet Government the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were the logical inheritors of peasant leadership and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries who were at the mercy of the organised city proletariat desperately needed the backing of the peasants Meanwhile Smolny had not neglected the peasants After the Land decree one of the first actions of the new Tsay ee kah had been to call a Congress of Peasants over the head of the Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets A few days later was issued detailed Regulations for the Volost Township Land Committees followed by Lenin s Instruction to Peasants See App XII Sect one which explained the Bolshevik revolution and the new Government in simple terms and on November sixteenth Lenin and Miliutin published the Instructions to Provincial Emissaries of whom thousands were sent by the Soviet Government into the villages one Upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited the emissary should call a joint meeting of the Central Executive Committees of the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws and then demand that a joint plenary session of the Soviets be summoned two He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province a Has the land owners property been taken over and if so in what districts b Who administers the confiscated land the former proprietor or the Land Committees c What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with the farm animals three Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented four How much and in what respect does the amount of land now under cultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as an average minimum five The emissary must insist that after the peasants have received the land it is imperative that they increase the amount of cultivated land as quickly as possible and that they hasten the sending of grain to the cities as the only means of avoiding famine six What are the measures projected or put into effect for the transfer of land from the land owners to the Land Committees and similar bodies appointed by the Soviets seven It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and well organised should be administered by Soviets composed of the regular employees of those properties under the direction of competent agricultural scientists All through the villages a ferment of change was going on caused not only by the electrifying action of the Land decree but also by thousands of revolutionary minded peasant soldiers returning from the front These men especially welcomed the call to a Congress of Peasants Like the old Tsay ee kah in the matter of the second Congress of Workers and Soldiers Soviets the Executive Committee tried to prevent the Peasant Congress summoned by Smolny And like the old Tsay ee kah finding its resistance futile the Executive Committee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election of Conservative delegates Word was even spread among the peasants that the Congress would meet at Moghilev and some delegates went there but by November twenty threed about four hundred had gathered in Petrograd and the party caucuses had begun The first session took place in the Alexander Hall of the Duma building and the first vote showed that more than half of all the delegates were Left Socialist Revolutionaries while the Bolsheviki controlled a bare fifth the conservative Socialist Revolutionaries a quarter and all the rest were united only in their opposition to the old Executive Committee dominated by Avksentiev Tchaikovsky and Peshekhonov The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continual clamour deep stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angry groups To the right was a sprinkling of officers epaulettes and the patriarchal bearded faces of the older more substantial peasants in the centre were a few peasants non commissioned officers and some soldiers and on the left almost all the delegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers These last were the young generation who had been serving in the army The galleries were thronged with workers who in Russia still remember their peasant origin Unlike the old Tsay ee kah the Executive Committee in opening the session did not recognise the Congress as official the official Congress was called for December thirteenth amid a hurricane of applause and angry cries the speaker declared that this gathering was merely Extraordinary Conference But the Extraordinary Conference soon showed its attitude toward the Executive Committee by electing as presiding officer Maria Spiridonova leader of the Left Socialist Revolution aries Most of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whether the representatives of Volost Soviets should be seated or only delegates from the Provincial bodies and just as in the Workers and Soldiers Congress an overwhelming majority declared in favour of the widest possible representation Whereupon the old Executive Committee left the hall Almost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates were hostile to the Government of the People s Commissars Zinoviev attempting to speak for the Bolsheviki was hooted down and as he left the platform amid laughter there were cries There s how a People s Commissar sits in a mudpuddle We Left Socialist Revolutionaries refuse cried Nazariev a delegate from the Provinces to recognise this so called Workers and Peasants Government until the peasants are represented in it At present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers We insist upon the formation of a new Government which will represent the entire democracy The reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling declaring in the face of protests from the Bolshevik benches that the Council of People s Commissars intended either to control the Congress or dissolve it by force of arms an announcement which was received by the peasants with bursts of fury On the third day Lenin suddenly mounted the tribune for ten minutes the room went mad Down with him they shrieked We will not listen to any of your People s Commissars We don t recognise your Government Lenin stood there quite calmly gripping the desk with both hands his little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath Finally except for the right side of the hall the demonstration wore itself out somewhat I do not come here as a member of the Council of People s Commissars said Lenin and waited again for the noise to subside but as a member of the Bolshevik faction duly elected to this Congress And he held his credentials up to that all might see them However he went on in an unmoved voice nobody will deny that the present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevik party he had to wait a moment so that for all purposes it is the same thing Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour but the centre and left were curious and compelled silence Lenin s argument was simple Tell me frankly you peasants to whom we have given the lands of the pomieshtchiki do you want now to prevent the workers from getting control of industry This is class war The pomieshtchiki of course oppose the peasants and the manufactures oppose the workers Are you going to allow the ranks of the proletariat to be divided Which side will you be on We the Bolsheviki are the party of the proletariat of the peasant proletariat as well as the industrial proletariat We the Bolsheviki are the protectors of the Soviets of the Peasants Soviets as well as those of the Workers and Soldiers The present Government is a Government of Soviets we have not only invited the Peasants Soviets to join that Government but we have also invited representatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter the Council of People s Commissars The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of the people of the workers in the factories and mines of the workers in the fields Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of an anti democratic and counter revolutionary act And I serve notice here on you comrades Right Socialist Revolutionaries and on you Messrs Cadets that if the Constituent Assembly attempts to destroy the Soviets we shall not permit the Constituent Assembly to do this thing On the afternoon of November twenty fifth Tchernov arrived in hot haste from Moghilev summoned by the Executive Committee Only two months before considered an extreme revolutionist and very popular with the peasants he was now called to check the dangerous drift of the Congress toward the Left Upon his arrival Tchernov was arrested and taken to Smolny where after a short conversation he was released His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee for leaving the Congress They agreed to return and Tchernov entered the hall welcomed with great applause by the majority and the hoots and jeers of the Bolsheviki Comrades I have been away I participated in the Conference of the Twelfth Army on the question of calling a Congress of all the Peasant delegates of the armies of the Western Front and I know very little about the insurrection which occurred here Zinoviev rose in his seat and shouted Yes you were away for a few minutes Fearful tumult Cries Down with the Bolsheviki Tchernov continued The accusation that I helped lead an army on Petrograd has no foundation and is entirely false Where does such an accusation come from Show me the source Zinoviev Izviestia and Dielo Naroda your own paper that s where it comes from Tchernov s wide face with the small eyes waving hair and greyish beard became red with wrath but he controlled himself and went on I repeat I know practically nothing about what has happened here and I did not lead any army except this army he pointed to the peasant delegates which I am largely responsible for bringing here Laughter and shouts of Bravo Upon my return I visited Smolny No such accusation was made against me there After a brief conversation I left and that s all Let any one present make such an accusation An uproar followed in which the Bolsheviki and some of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were on their feet all at once shaking their fists and yelling and the rest of the assembly tried to yell them down This is an outrage not a session cried Tchernov and he left the hall the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disorder Meanwhile the question of the status of the Executive Committee was agitating all minds By declaring the assembly Extraordinary Conference it had been planned to block the reelection of the Executive Committee But this worked both ways the Left Socialist Revolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over the Executive Committee then the Executive Committee had no power over the Congress On November twenty fifth the assembly resolved that the powers of the Executive Committee be assumed by the Extraordinary Conference in which only members of the Executive who had been elected as delegates might vote The next day in spite of the bitter opposition of the Bolsheviki the resolution was amended to give all the members of the Executive Committee whether elected as delegates or not voice and vote in the assembly On the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the Land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries Kolchinsky for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries outlined the history of the Land question during the Revolution The first Congress of Peasants Soviets he said had voted a precise and formal resolution in favour of putting the landed estates immediately into the hands of the Land Committees But the directors of the Revolution and the bourgeois in the Government had insisted that the question could not be solved until the Constituent Assembly met The second period of the Revolution the period of compromise was signalled by the entrance of Tchernov into the Cabinet The peasants were convinced that now the practical solution of the Land question would begin but in spite of the imperative decision of the first Peasant Congress the reactionaries and conciliators in the Executive Committee had prevented any action This policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders which appeared as the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on the part of the peasants The peasants understood the exact meaning of the Revolution they tried to turn words into action The recent events said the orator do not indicate a simple riot or a Bolshevik adventure but on the contrary a real popular rising which has been greeted with sympathy by the whole country The Bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the Land question but in recommending that the peasants seize the land by force they committed a profound error From the first days the Bolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land by revolutionary mass action This is nothing but anarchy the land can be taken over in an organised manner For the Bolsheviki it was important that the problems of the Revolution should be solved in the quickest possible manner but the Bolsheviki were not interested in how these problems were to be solved The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in its fundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants Congress Why then did not the new Government follow the tactics outlined by that Congress Because the Council of People s Commissars wanted to hasten the settlement of the Land question so that the Constituent Assembly would have nothing to do But also the Government saw that it was necessary to adopt practical measures so without further reflection it adopted the Regulations for Land Committees thus creating a strange situation for the Council of People s Commissars abolished private property in land but the Regulations drawn up by the Land Committees are based on private property However no harm has been done by that for the Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees but are putting into operation their own practical decisions decisions based on the will of the vast majority of the peasants These Land Committees are not attempting the legislative solution of the Land question which belongs to the Constituent Assembly alone But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will of the Russian peasants Of that we cannot be sure All we can be sure of is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is now aroused and that the Constituent will be forced to settle the Land question the way the peasants want it settled The Constituent Assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people Followed him Lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity At this moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question but the question of Social Revolution not only here in Russia but all over the world The Land question cannot be solved independently of the other problems of the Social Revolution For example the confiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance not only of Russian land owners but also of foreign capital with whom the great landed properties are connected through the intermediary of the banks The ownership of the land in Russia is the basis for immense oppression and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is the most important step of our Revolution But it cannot be separated from the other steps as is clearly manifested by the stages through which the Revolution has had to pass The first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalists and land owners whose interests are closely related The second stage was the strengthening of the Soviets and the political compromise with the bourgeoisie The mistake of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that time they did not oppose the policy of compromise because they held the theory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fully developed If Socialism can only be realised when the intellectual development of all the people permits it then we shall not see Socialism for at least five hundred years The Socialist political party this is the vanguard of the working class it must not allow itself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average but it must lead the masses using the Soviets as organs of revolutionary initiative But in order to lead the wavering the comrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries themselves must stop hesitating In July last a series of open breaks began between the popular masses and the compromisers but now in November the Left Socialist Revolutionaries are still holding out their hand to Avksentiev who is pulling the people with his little finger If Compromise continues the Revolution disappears No compromise with the bourgeoisie is possible its power must be absolutely crushed We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme we have not given up the abolition of private property in the land and we do not intend to do so We adopted the Regulations for Land Committees which are not based on private property at all because we want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people have themselves decided to do it so as to draw closer the coalition of all the elements who are fighting for the Social Revolution We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter that coalition insisting however that they cease looking backward and that they break with the conciliators of their party As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned it is true as the preceding speaker has said that the work of the Constituent will depend on the revolutionary determination of the masses I say Count on that revolutionary determination but don t forget your gun Lenin then read the Bolshevik resolution The Peasants Congress fully supporting the Land decree of November eighth approves of the Provisional Workers and Peasants Government of the Russian Republic established by the second All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies The Peasants Congress invites all peasants unanimously to sustain that law and to apply it immediately themselves and at the same time invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions of responsibility only persons who have proved not by words but by acts their entire devotion to the interests of the exploited peasant workers their desire and their ability to defend these interests against all resistance on the part of the great land owners the capitalists their partisans and accomplices The Peasants Congress at the same time expresses its conviction that the complete realisation of all the measures which make up the Land decree can only be successful through the triumph of the Workers Social Revolution which began November seventh nineteen seventeen for only the Social Revolution can accomplish the definite transfer without possibility of return of the land to the peasant workers the confiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasant communes the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging to the great land owners the safe guarding of the interests of the agricultural workers by the complete abolition of wage slavery the regular and methodical distribution among all regions of Russia of the products of agriculture and industry and the seizure of the banks without which the possession of land by the whole people would be impossible after the abolition of private property and all sorts of assistance by the State to the workers For these reasons the Peasants Congress sustains entirely the Revolution of November seventh as a social revolution and expresses its unalterable will to put into operation with whatever modifications are necessary but without any hesitation the social transformation of the Russian Republic The indispensable conditions of the victory of the Social Revolution which alone will secure the lasting success and the complete realisation of the Land decree is the close union of the peasant workers with the industrial working class with the proletariat of all advanced countries From now on in the Russian Republic all the organisation and administration of the State from top to bottom must rest on that union That union crushing all attempts direct or indirect open or dissimulated to return to the policy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie conciliation damned by experience with the chiefs of bourgeois politics can alone insure the victory of Socialism throughout the world The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openly to appear Tchernov however spoke several times with a modest and winning impartiality He was invited to sit on the platform On the second night of the Congress an anonymous note was handed up to the chairman requesting that Tchernov be made honorary President Ustinov read the note aloud and immediately Zinoviev was on his feet screaming that this was a trick of the old Executive Committee to capture the convention in a moment the hall was one bellowing mass of waving arms and angry faces on both sides Nevertheless Tchernov remained very popular In the stormy debates on the Land question and the Lenin resolution the Bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assembly both times restrained by their leaders It seemed to me as if the Congress were hopelessly deadlocked But none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were already going on between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviki at Smolny At first the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had demanded that there be a Government composed of all the Socialist parties in and out of the Soviets to be responsible to a People s Council composed of an equal number of delegates from the Workers and Soldiers organisation and that of the Peasants and completed by representatives of the City Dumas and the Zemstvos Lenin and Trotzky were to be eliminated and the Military Revolutionary Committee and other repressive organs dissolved Wednesday morning November twenty eighth after a terrible all night struggle an agreement was reached The Tsay ee kah composed of one hundred eight members was to be augumented by one hundred eight members elected proportionally from the Peasants Congress by one hundred delegates elected directly from the Army and the Fleet and by fifty representatives of the Trade Unions thirty five from the general Unions ten Railway Workers and five from the Post and Telegraph Workers The Dumas and Zemstvos were dropped Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government and the Military Revolutionary Committee continued to function The sessions of the Congress had now been removed to the Imperial Law School building Fontanka six headquarters of the Peasants Soviets There in the great meeting hall the delegates gathered on Wednesday afternoon The old Executive Committee had withdrawn and was holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the same building made up of bolting delegates and representatives of the Army Committees Tchernov went from one meeting to the other keeping a watchful eye on the proceedings He knew that an agreement with the Bolsheviki was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded He spoke to the rump convention At present when everybody is in favour of forming an all Socialist Government many people forget the first Ministry which was not a coalition Government and in which there was only one Socialist Kerensky a Government which in its time was very popular Now people accuse Kerensky they forget that he was raised to power not only by the Soviets but also by the popular masses Why did public opinion change toward Kerensky The savages set up gods to which they pray and which they punish if one of their prayers is not answered That is what is happening at this moment Yesterday Kerensky to day Lenin and Trotzky another to morrow We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire from the power Kerensky has accepted to day he announced from his hiding place that he has resigned as Premier but the Bolsheviki wish to retain the power and they do not know how to use it If the Bolsheviki succeed or if they fail the fate of Russia will not be changed The Russian villages understand perfectly what they want and they are now carrying out their own measures The villages will save us in the end In the meanwhile in the great hall Ustinov had announced the agreement between the Peasants Congress and Smolny received by the delegates with the wildest joy Suddenly Tchernov appeared and demanded the floor I understand he began that an agreement is being concluded between the Peasants Congress and Smolny Such an agreement would be illegal seeing that the true Congress of Peasants Soviets does not meet until next week Moreover I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will never accept your demands He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter and realising the situation he left the platform and the room taking his popularity with him Late in the afternoon of Thursday November sixteenth the Congress met in extraordinary session There was a holiday feeling in the air on every face was a smile The remainder of the business before the assembly was hurried through and then old Nathanson the white bearded dean of the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionaries his voice trembling and tears in his eyes read the report of the wedding of the Peasants Soviets with the Workers and Soldiers Soviets At every mention of the word union there was ecstatic applause At the end Ustinov announced the arrival rival of a delegation from Smolny accompanied by representatives of the Red Army greeted with a rising ovation One after another a workman a soldier and a sailor took the floor hailing them Then Boris Reinstein delegate of the American Socialist Labor Party The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies is one of the great days of the Revolution The sound of it will ring with resounding echoes throughout the whole world in Paris in London and across the ocean in New York This union will fill with happiness the hearts of all toilers A great idea has triumphed The West and America expected from Russia from the Russian proletariat something tremendous The proletariat of the world is waiting for the Russian Revolution waiting for the great things that it is accomplishing Sverdlov president of the Tsay ee kah greeted them And with the shout Long live the end of civil war Long live the United Democracy the peasants poured out of the building It was already dark and on the ice covered snow glittered the pale light of moon and star Along the bank of the canal were drawn up in full marching order the soldiers of the Pavlovsky Regiment with their band which broke into the Marseillaise Amid the crashing full throated shouts of the soldiers the peasants formed in line unfurling the great red banner of the Executive Committee of the All Russian Peasants Soviets embroidered newly in gold Long live the union of the revolutionary and toiling masses Following were other banners of the District Soviets of Putilov Factory which read We bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of all people From somewhere torches appeared blazing orange in the night a thousand times reflected in the facets of the ice streaming out smokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the Fontanka singing between crowds that stood in astonished silence Long live the Revolutionary Army Long live the Red Guard Long live the Peasants So the great procession wound through the city growing and unfurling ever new red banners lettered in gold Two old peasants bowed with toil were walking hand in hand their faces illumined with child like bliss Well said one I d like to see them take away our land again now Near Smolny the Red Guard was lined up on both sides of the street wild with delight The other old peasant spoke to his comrade I am not tired he said I walked on air all the way On the steps of Smolny about a hundred Workers and Soldiers Deputies were massed with their banner dark against the blaze of light streaming out between the arches Like a wave they rushed down clasping the peasants in their arms and kissing them and the procession poured in through the great door and up the stairs with a noise like thunder In the immense white meeting room the Tsay ee kah was waiting with the whole Petrograd Soviet and a thousand spectators beside with that solemnity which attends great conscious moments in history Zinoviev announced the agreement with the Peasants Congress to a shaking roar which rose and burst into storm as the sound of music blared down the corridor and the head of the procession came in On the platform the presidium rose and made place for the Peasants presidium the two embracing behind them the two banners were intertwined against the white wall over the empty frame from which the Tsar s picture had been torn Then opened the triumphal session After a few words of welcome from Sverdlov Maria Spiridonova slight pale with spectacles and hair drawn flatly down and the air of a New England school teacher took the tribune the most loved and the most powerful woman in all Russia Before the workers of Russia open now horizons which history has never known All workers movements in the past have been defeated But the present movement is international and that is why it is invincible There is no force in the world which can put out the fire of the Revolution The old world crumbles down the new world begins Then Trotzky full of fire I wish you welcome comrades peasants You come here not as guests but as masters of this house which holds the heart of the Russian Revolution The will of millions of workers is now concentrated in this hall There is now only one master of the Russian land the union of the workers soldiers and peasants With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats till then contemptuous of Russia s invitation to an armistice which had been accepted by the Central Powers A new humanity will be born of this war In this hall we swear to workers of all lands to remain at our revolutionary post If we are broken then it will be in defending our flag Krylenko followed him explaining the situation at the front where Dukhonin was preparing to resist the Council of People s Commissars Let Dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall not deal gently with those who bar the road to peace Dybenko saluted the assembly in the name of the Fleet and Krushinsky member of the Vikzhel said From this moment when the union of all true Socialists is realised the whole army of railway workers places itself absolutely at the disposition of the revolutionary democracy And Lunatcharsky almost weeping and Proshian for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and finally Saharashvili for the United Social Democrats Internationalists composed of members of the Martov s and of Gorky s groups who declared We left the Tsay ee kah because of the uncompromising policy of the Bolsheviki and to force them to make concessions in order to realise the union of all the revolutionary democracy Now that that union is brought about we consider it a sacred duty to take our places once more in the Tsay ee kah We declare that all those who have withdrawn from the Tsay ee kah should now return Stachkov a dignified old peasant of the presidium of the Peasants Congress bowed to the four corners of the room I greet you with the christening of a new Russian life and freedom Gronsky in the name of the Polish Social Democracy Skripnik for the Factory Shop Committees Tifonov for the Russian soldiers at Salonika and others interminably speaking out of full hearts with the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled It was late in the night when the following resolution was put and passed unanimously The Tsay ee kah united in extraordinary session with the Petrograd Soviet and the Peasants Congress confirms the Land and Peace decrees adopted by the second Congress of Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies and also the decree on Workers Control adopted by the Tsay ee kah The joint session of the Tsay ee kah and the Peasants Congress expresses its firm conviction that the union of workers soldiers and peasants this fraternal union of all the workers and all exploited will consolidate the power conquered by them that it will take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of the power into the hands of the working class in other countries and that it will assure in this manner the lasting accomplishment of a just peace and the victory of Socialism See App XI Sect two APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I one Oborontsi Defenders All the moderate Socialist groups adopted or were given this name because they consented to the continuation of the war under Allied leadership on the ground that it was a war of National Defence The Bolsheviki the Left Socialist Revolutionaries the Mensheviki Internationalists Martov s faction and the Social Democrats Internationalists Gorky s group were in favour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war aims and to offer peace to Germany on those terms two WAGES AND COST OF LIVING BEFORE AND DURING THE REVOLUTION The following tables of wages and costs were compiled in October nineteen seventeen by a joint Committee from the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and the Moscow section of the Ministry of Labour and published in Novaya Zhizn October twenty sixth nineteen seventeen Wages Per Day Rubles and kopeks Trade July nineteen fourteen July nineteen sixteen August nineteen seventeen Carpenter one point sixty two four six eight point fifty Cabinet maker Terrassier one point thirty one point fifty three three point fifty Mason plasterer one point seventy two point thirty five four six eight Painter upholsterer one point eighty two point twenty three five point fifty eight Blacksmith one two point twenty five four five eight point fifty Chimney sweep one point fifty two four five point fifty seven point fifty Locksmith ninety two three point fifty six nine Helper one one point fifty two point fifty four point fifty eight In spite of numerous stories of gigantic advances in wages immediately following the Revolution of March nineteen seventeen these figures which were published by the Ministry of Labour as characteristic of conditions all over Russia show that wages did not rise immediately after the Revolution but little by little On an average wages increased slightly more than five hundred per cent But at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less than one third its former purchasing power and the cost of the necessities of life increased enormously The following table was compiled by the Municipal Duma of Moscow where food was cheaper and more plentiful than in Petrograd Cost of Food Rubles and Kopeks August nineteen fourteen August nineteen seventeen Increase Black bread Fund two one two twelve three hundred thirty White bread Fund five twenty three hundred Beef Fund twenty two one point ten four

seventy one On an average food increased in price five hundred fifty six per cent or fifty one per cent more than wages As for the other necessities the price of these increased tremendously The following table was compiled by the Economic section of the Moscow Soviet of Workers Deputies and accepted as correct by the Ministry of Supplies of the Provisional Government Cost of Other Necessities Rubles and Kopeks August nineteen fourteen August nineteen seventeen Increase Calico Arshin eleven one point forty eleven seventy three Cotton Arshin fifteen two twelve thirty three cloth

nineteen hundred Metal Ware On an average the above categories of necessities increased about eleven oh nine per cent in price more than twice the increase of salaries The difference of course went into the pockets of speculators and merchants In September nineteen seventeen when I arrived in Petrograd the average daily wage of a skilled industrial worker for example a steel worker in the Putilov Factory was about eight rubles At the same time profits were enormous I was told by one of the owners of the Thornton Woollen Mills an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd that while wages had increased about three hundred per cent in his factory his profits had gone up nine hundred per cent three THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS The history of the efforts of the Socialists in the Provisional Government of July to realise their programme in coalition with the bourgeois Ministers is an illuminating example of class struggle in politics Says Lenin in explanation of this phenomenon The capitalists seeing that the position of the Government was untenable resorted to a method which since eighteen forty eight has been for decades practised by the capitalists in order to befog divide and finally overpower the working class This method is the so called Coalition Ministry composed of bourgeois and of renegades from the Socialist camp In those countries where political freedom and democracy have existed side by side with the revolutionary movement of the workers for example in England and France the capitalists make use of this subterfuge and very successfully too The Socialist leaders upon entering the Ministries invariably prove mere figure heads puppets simply a shield for the capitalists a tool with which to defraud the workers The democratic and republican capitalists in Russia set in motion this very same scheme The Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki fell victim to it and on June first a Coalition Ministry with the participation of Tchernov Tseretelli Skobeliev Avksentiev Savinkov Zarudny and Nikitin became an accomplished fact Problems of the Revolution four SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MOSCOW In the first week of October nineteen seventeen Novaya Zhizn published the following comparative table of election results pointing out that this meant the bankruptcy of the policy of Coalition with the propertied classes If civil war can yet be avoided it can only be done by a united front of all the revolutionary democracy Elections for the Moscow Central and Ward Dumas June nineteen seventeen September nineteen seventeen Socialist Revolutionaries fifty eight Members fourteen Members Cadets seventeen Members thirty Members Mensheviki twelve Members four Members Bolsheviki eleven Members forty seven Members five GROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIES September eighteenth The Cadet Shulgin writing in a Kiev newspaper said that the Provisional Government s declaration that Russia was a Republic constituted a gross abuse of its powers We cannot admit either a Republic or the present Republican Government And we are not sure that we want a Republic in Russia October twenty threed At a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan M Dukhonin declared On March first we must establish a Constitutional Monarchy We must not reject the legitimate heir to the throne Mikhail Alexandrovitch October twenty seventh Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men at Moscow The Conference insists that the Provisional Government take the following immediate measures in the Army one Forbidding of all political propaganda the Army must be out of politics two Propaganda of antinational and international ideas and theories deny the necessity for armies and hurt discipline it should be forbidden and all propagandists punished three The function of the Army Committees must be limited to economic questions exclusively All their decisions should be confirmed by their superior officers who have the right to dissolve the Committees at any time four The salute to be reestablished and made obligatory Full reestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of officers with right of review of sentence five Expulsion from the Corps of Officers of those who dishonour it by participating in the movement of the soldier masses which teaches them disobedience Reestablishment for this purpose of the Courts of Honor six The Provisional Government should take the necessary measures to make possible the return to the army of Generals and other officers unjustly discharged under the influence of Committees and other irresponsible organisations APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II one The Kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming volume Kornilov to Brest Litovsk The responsibility of Kerensky for the situation which gave rise to Kornilov s attempt is now pretty clearly established Many apologists for Kerensky say that he knew of Kornilov s plans and by a trick drew him out prematurely and then crushed him Even mister A J Sack in his book The Birth of the Russian Democracy says Several things are almost certain The first is that Kerensky knew about the movement of several detachments from the Front toward Petrograd and it is possible that as Prime Minister and Minister of War realising the growing Bolshevist danger he called for them The only flaw in that argument is that there was no Bolshevist danger at that time the Bolsheviki still being a powerless minority in the Soviets and their leaders in jail or hiding two DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE When the Democratic Conference was first proposed to Kerensky he suggested an assembly of all the elements in the nation the live forces as he called them including bankers manufacturers land owners and representatives of the Cadet party The Soviet refused and drew up the following table of representation which Kerensky agreed to one hundred delegates All Russian Soviets Workers and Soldiers Deputies one hundred delegates All Russian Soviets Peasants Deputies fifty delegates Provincial Soviets Workers and Soldiers Deputies fifty delegates Peasants District Land Committees one hundred delegates Trade Unions eighty four delegates Army Committees at the Front one hundred fifty delegates Workers and Peasants Cooperative Societies twenty delegates Railway Workers Union ten delegates Post and Telegraph Workers Union twenty delegates Commercial Clerks fifteen delegates Liberal Professions Doctors Lawyers Journalists et cetera fifty delegates Provincial Zemstvos fifty nine delegates Nationalist Organisations Poles Ukraineans et cetera This proportion was altered twice or three times The final disposition of delegates was three hundred delegates All Russian Soviets Workers Soldiers Peasants Deputies three hundred delegates Cooperative Societies three hundred delegates Municipalities one hundred fifty delegates Army Committees at the Front one hundred fifty delegates Provincial Zemstvos two hundred delegates Trade Unions one hundred delegates Nationalist Organisations two hundred delegates Several small groups three THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDED On September twenty eighth nineteen seventeen Izviestia organ of the Tsay ee kah published an article which said speaking of the last Provisional Ministry At last a truly democratic government born of the will of all classes of the Russian people the first rough form of the future liberal parliamentary regime has been formed Ahead of us is the Constituent Assembly which will solve all questions of fundamental law and whose composition will be essentially democratic The function of the Soviets is at an end and the time is approaching when they must retire with the rest of the revolutionary machinery from the stage of a free and victorious people whose weapons shall hereafter be the peaceful ones of political action The leading article of Izviestia for October twenty threed was called The Crisis in the Soviet Organisations It began by saying that travellers reported a lessening activity of local Soviets everywhere This is natural said the writer For the people are becoming interested in the more permanent legislative organs the Municipal Dumas and the Zemstvs In the important centres of Petrograd and Moscow where the Soviets were best organised they did not take in all the democratic elements The majority of the intellectuals did not participate and many workers also some of the workers because they were politically backward others because the centre of gravity for them was in their Unns We cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united with the masses whose everyday needs are better served by them That the local democratic administrations are being energetically organised is highly important The City Dumas are elected by universal suffrage and in purely local matters have more authority than the Soviets Not a single democrat will see anything wrong in this Elections to the Municipalities are being conduct in a better and more democratic way than the elections to the Soviets All classes are represented in the Municipalities And as soon as the local Self Governments begin to organise life in the Municipalities the role of the local Soviets naturally ends There are two factors in the falling off of interest in the Soviets The first we may attribute to the lowering of political interest in the masses the second to the growing effort of provincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of new Russia The more the tendency lies in this latter direction the sooner disappears the significance of the Soviets We ourselves are being called the undertakers of our own organisation In reality we ourselves are the hardest workers in constructing the new Russia When autocracy and the whole bureaucratic regime fell we set up the Soviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporary shelter Now instead of barracks we are building the permanent edifice of a new system and naturally the people will gradually leave the barracks for more comfortable quarters four TROTZKY S SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC The purpose of the Democratic Conference which was called by the Tsay ee kah was to do away with the irresponsible personal government which produced Kornilov and to establish a responsible government which would be capable of finishing the war and ensure the calling of the Constituent Assembly at the given time In the meanwhile behind the back of the Democratic Conference by trickery by deals between Citizen Kerensky the Cadets and the leaders of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary parties we received the opposite result from the officially announced purpose A power was created around which and in which we have open and secret Kornilovs playing leading parts The irresponsibility of the Government is offically proclaimed when it is announced that the Council of the Russian Republic is to be a consultative and not legislative body In the eighth month of the Revolution the irresponsible Government creates a cover for itself in this new edition of Bieligen s Duma The propertied classes have entered this Provision Council in a proportion which clearly shows from elections all over the country that many of them have no right here whatever In spite of that the Cadet party which until yesterday wanted the Provisional Government to be responsible to the State Duma this same Cadet party secured the independence Assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have as favourable position than they have in this Council and they will not be able to be irresponsible to the Constituent Assembly If the propertied classes were really getting ready for the Constituent Assembly six weeks from now there could be no reason for establishing the irresponsibility of the Government at this time The whole truth is that the bourgeoisie which directs the policies of the Provisional Government has for its aim to break the Constituent Assembly At present this is the main purpose of the propertied classes which control our entire national policy external and internal In the industrial agrarian and supply departments the politics of the propertied classes acting with the Government increases the natural disorganisation caused by the war The propertied classes which are provoking a peasants revolt The propertied classes which are provoking civil war and openly hold their course on the bony hand of hunger with which they intend to overthrow the Revolution and finish with the Constituent Assembly No less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisie and its Government After forty months of war the capital is threatened with mortal danger In reply to this arises a plan to move the Government to Moscow The idea of abandoning the capital does not stir the indignation of the bourgeoisie Just the opposite It is accepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promote counter revolutionary conspiracy Instead of recognising that the salvation of the country lies in concluding peace instead of throwing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the worn out peoples over the heads of diplomats and imperialists and making the continuation of the war impossible the Provisional Government by order of the Cadets the Counter Revolutionists and the Allied Imperialists without sense without purpose and without a plan continues to drag on the murderous war sentencing to useless death new hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors and preparing to give up Petrograd and to wreck the Revolution At a time when Bolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers and sailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others the so called Supreme Commander Kerensky continues to suppress the Bolshevik press The leading parties of the Council are acting as a voluntary cover for these policies We the faction of Social Democrats Bolsheviki announce that with this Government of Treason to the People we have nothing in common We have nothing in common with the work of these Murderers of the People which goes on behind official curtains We refuse either directly or indirectly to cover up one day of this work While Wilhelm s troops are threatening Petrograd the Government of Kerensky and Kornilov is preparing to run away from Petrograd and turn Moscow into a base of counter revolution We warn the Moscow workers and soldiers to be on their guard Leaving this Council we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of the workers peasants and soldiers of all Russia Petrograd is in danger The Revolution is in danger The Government has increased the danger the ruling classes intensify it Only the people themselves can save themselves and the country We appeal to the people Long live immediate honest democratic peace All power to the Soviets All land to the people Long live the Constituent Assembly five THE NAKAZ TO SKOBELIEV Resume Passed by the Tsay ee kah and given to Skobeliev as an instruction for the representative of the Russian Revolutionary democracy at the Paris Conference The peace treaty must be based on the principle No annexations no indemnities the right of self determination of peoples Territorial Problems one Evacuation of German troops from invaded Russia Full right of self determination to Poland Lithuania and Livonia two For Turkish Armenia autonomy and later complete self determination as soon as local Governments are established three The question of Alsace Lorraine to be solved by a plebiscite after the withdrawal of all foreign troops four Belgium to be restored Compensation for damages from an international fund five Serbia and Montenegro to be restored and aided by an international relief fund Serbia to have an outlet on the Adriatic Bosnia and Herzegovina to be autonomous six The disputed provinces in the Balkans to have provisional autonomy followed by a plebiscite seven Rumania to be restored but forced to give complete self determination to the Dobrudja Rumania must be forced to execute the clauses of the Berlin Treaty concerning the Jews and recognise them as Rumanian citizens eight In Italia Irridenta a provisional autonomy followed by a plebiscite to determine state dependence nine The German colonies to be returned ten Greece and Persia to be restored Freedom of the Seas All straits opening into inland seas as well as the Suez and Panama Canals are to be neutralised Commercial shipping to be free The right of privateering to be abolished The torpedoing of commercial ships to be forbidden Indemnities All combatants to renounce demands for any indemnities either direct or indirect as for instance charges for the maintenance of prisoners Indemnities and contributions collected during the war must be refunded Economic Terms Commercial treaties are not to be a part of the peace terms Every country must be independent in its commercial relations and must not be obliged to or prevented from concluding an economic treaty by the Treaty of Peace Nevertheless all nations should bind themselves by the Peace Treaty not to practise an economic blockade after the war nor to form separate tariff agreements The right of most favoured nation must be given to all countries without distinction Guarantees of Peace Peace is to be concluded at the Peace Conference by delegates elected by the national representative institutions of each country The peace terms are to be confirmed by these parliaments Secret diplomacy is to be abolished all parties are to bind themselves not to conclude any secret treaties Such treaties are declared in contradiction to international law and void All treaties until confirmed by the parliaments of the different nations are to be considered void Gradual disarmament both on land and sea and the establishment of a militia system The League of Nations advanced by President Wilson may become a valuable aid to international law provided that a all nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal rights and b international politics are to be democratised Ways to Peace The Allies are to announce immediately that they are willing to open peace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their consent to the renunciation of all forcible annexations The Allies must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations nor to conclude peace except in a general Peace Conference with the participation of delegates from all the neutral countries All obstacles to the Stockholm Socialist Conference are to be removed and passports are to be given immediately to all delegates of parties and organisations who wish to participate The Executive Committee of the Peasants Soviets also issued a nakaz which differs little from the above six PEACE AT RUSSIA S EXPENSE The Ribot revelations of Austria s peace offer to France the so called Peace Conference at Berne Switzerland during the summer of nineteen seventeen in which delegates participated from all belligerent countries representing large financial interests in all these countries and the attempted negotiations of an English agent with a Bulgarian church dignitary all pointed to the fact that there were strong currents on both sides favourable to patching up a peace at the expense of Russia In my next book Kornilov to Brest Litovsk I intend to treat this matter at some length publishing several secret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Petrograd seven RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE Official Report of the Provisional Government From the time the news of the Russian Revolution reached Paris Russian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appear and these newspapers as well as individuals freely circulated among the soldier masses and began a Bolshevik propaganda often spreading false news which appeared in the French journals In the absence of all official news and of precise details this campaign provoked discontent among the soldiers The result was a desire to return to Russia and a hatred toward the officers Finally it all turned into rebellion In one of their meetings the soldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill since they had decided to fight no more It was decided to isolate the rebels and General Zankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the Provisional Government to leave the camp of Courtine and to carry with them all ammunition On June twenty fifth the order was executed there remained at the camp only the soldiers who said they would submit conditionally to the Provisional Government The soldiers at the camp of Courtine received several times the visit of the Commander in Chief of the Russian Armies abroad of Rapp the Commissar of the Ministry of War and of several distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them but these attempts were unsuccessful and finally Commissar Rapp insisted that the rebels lay down their arms and in sign of submission march in good order to a place called Clairvaux The order was only partially obeyed first five hundred men went out of whom twenty two were arrested twenty four hours later about six thousand followed About two thousand remained It was decided to increase the pressure their rations were diminished their pay was cut off and the roads toward the village of Courtine were guarded by French soldiers General Zankievitch having discovered that a Russian artillery brigade was passing through France decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry and artillery to reduce the rebels A deputation was sent to the rebels the deputation returned several hours later convinced of the futility of the negotiations On September first General Zankievitch sent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down their arms and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery if the order was not obeyed by September threed at ten o clock The order not being executed a light fire of artillery was opened on the place at the hour agreed upon Eighteen shells were fired and the rebels were warned that the bombardment would become more intense In the night of September threed one hundred sixty men surrendered September fourth the artillery bombardment recommenced and at eleven o clock after thirty six shells had been fired the rebels raised two white flags and began to leave the camp without arms By evening eight thousand three hundred men had surrendered one hundred fifty soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machine guns that night The fifth of September to make an end of the affair a heavy barrage was laid on the camp and our soldiers occupied it little by little The rebels kept up a heavy fire with their machine guns September sixth at nine o clock the camp was entirely occupied After the disarmament of the rebels eighty one arrests were made Thus the report From secret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs however we know that the account is not strictly accurate The first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to form Committees as their comrades in Russia were doing They demanded to be sent back to Russia which was refused and then being considered a dangerous influence in France they were ordered to Salonika They refused to go and the battle followed It was discovered that they had been left in camp without officers for about two months and badly treated before they became rebellious All attempts to find out the name of the Russian artillery brigade which had fired on them were futile the telegrams discovered in the Ministry left it to be inferred that French artillery was used After their surrender more than two hundred of the mutineers were shot in cold blood eight TERESTCHENKO S SPEECH Resume The questions of foreign policy are closely related to those of national defence And so if in questions of national defence you think it is necessary to hold session in secret also in our foreign policy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecy German diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion Therefore the declarations of directors of great democratic organisations who talk loudly of a revolutionary Congress and the impossibility of another winter campaign are dangerous All these declarations cost human lives I wish to speak merely of governmental logic without touching the questions of the honour and dignity of the State From the point of view of logic the foreign policy of Russia ought to be based on a real comprehension of the interests of Russia These interests mean that it is impossible that our country remain alone and that the present alignment of forces with us the Allies is satisfactory All humanity longs for peace but in Russia no one will permit a humiliating peace which would violate the State interests of our fatherland The orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years if not for centuries retard the triumph of democratic principles in the world and would inevitably cause new wars All remember the days of May when the fraternisation on our Front threatened to end the war by a simple cessation of military operations and lead the country to a shameful separate peace and what efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses at the front understand that it was not by this method that the Russian State must end the war and guarantee its interest He spoke of the miraculous effect of the July offensive what strength it gave to the words of Russian ambassadors abroad and the despair in Germany caused by the Russian victories And also the disillusionment in Allied countries which followed the Russian defeat As to the Russian Government it adhered strictly to the formula of May No annexations and no punitive indemnities We consider it essential not only to proclaim the self determination of peoples but also to renounce imperialist aims Germany is continually trying to make peace The only talk in Germany is of peace she knows she cannot win I reject the reproaches aimed at the Government which allege that Russian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aims of the war If the question arises as to what ends the Allies are pursuing it is indispensable first to demand what aims the Central Powers have agreed upon The desire is often heard that we publish the details of the treaties which bind the Allies but people forget that up to now we do not know the treaties which bind the Central Powers Germany he said evidently wants to separate Russia from the West by a series of weak buffer states This tendency to strike at the vital interests of Russia must be checked And will the Russian democracy which has inscribed on its banner the rights of nations to dispose of themselves allow calmly the continuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples in Austria Hungary Those who fear that the Allies will try to profit by our difficult situation to make us support more than our share of the burden of war and to solve the questions of peace at our expense are entirely mistaken Our enemy looks upon Russia as a market for its products The end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition and with our frontier open the flood of German products can easily hold back for years our industrial development Measures must be taken to guard against this I say openly and frankly the combination of forces which unites us to the Allies is favourable to the interests of Russia It is therefore important that our views on the questions of war and peace shall be in accord with the views of the Allies as clearly and precisely as possible To avoid all misunderstanding I must say frankly that Russia must present at the Paris Conference one point of view He did not want to comment on the nakaz to Skobeliev but he referred to the Manifesto of the Dutch Scandinavian Committee just published in Stockholm This Manifesto declared for the autonomy of Lithuania and Livonia but that is clearly impossible said Terestchenko for Russia must have free ports on the Baltic all the year round In this question the problems of foreign policy are also closely related to interior politics for if there existed a strong sentiment of unity of all great Russia one would not witness the repeated manifestations everywhere of a desire of peoples to separate from the Central Government Such separations are contrary to the interests of Russia and the Russian delegates cannot raise the issue nine THE BRITISH FLEET etc At the time of the naval battle of the Gulf of Riga not only the Bolsheviki but also the Ministers of the Provisional Government considered that the British Fleet had deliberately abandoned the Baltic as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publicly by the British press and semi publicly by British representatives in Russia Russia s finished No use bothering about Russia See interview with Kerensky Appendix thirteen GENERAL GURKO was a former Chief of Staff of the Russian armies under the Tsar He was a prominent figure in the corrupt Imperial Court After the Revolution he was one of the very few persons exiled for his political and personal record The Russian naval defeat in the Gulf of Riga coincided with the public reception by King George in London of General Gurko a man whom the Russian Provisional Government considered dangerously pro German as well as reactionary ten APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION To Workers and Soldiers Comrades The Dark Forces are increasingly trying to call forth in Petrograd and other towns DISORDERS AND Pogroms Disorder is necessary to the Dark Forces for disorder will give them an opportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood Under the pretext of establishing order and of protecting the inhabitants they hope to establish the domination of Kornilov which the revolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago Woe to the people if these hopes are realised The triumphant counter revolution will destroy the Soviets and the Army Committees will disperse the Constituent Assembly will stop the transfer of the land to the Land Committees will put an end to all the hopes of the people for a speedy peace and will fill all the prisons with revolutionary soldiers and workers In their calculations the counter revolutionists and Black Hundred leaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightened part of the people with the disorganisation of the food supply the continuation of the war and the general difficulties of life They hope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into a pogrom which will frighten the peaceful population and throw it into the arms of the Restorers of Law and Order Under such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration in these days although for the most laudable object would be a crime All conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policy of the Government will only bring injury to themselves and to the Revolution if they indulge in demonstrations THEREFORE THE Tsay ee kah ASKS ALL WORKERS NOT TO OBEY ANY CALLS TO DEMONSTRATE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT YIELD TO PROVOCATION REMEMBER YOUR DUTY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO THE REVOLUTION DO NOT BREAK THE UNITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT BY DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE BOUND TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies Tsay ee kah Russian Social Democratic Labour Party THE DANGER IS NEAR To All Workers and Soldiers Read and Hand to Others Comrades Workers and Soldiers Our country is in danger On account of this danger our freedom and our Revolution are passing through difficult days The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd The disorganisation is growing with every hours It becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread for Petrograd All of from the smallest to the greatest must redouble their efforts must endeavour to arrange things properly We must save our country save freedom More arms and provisions for the Army Bread for the great cities Order and organisation in the country And in these terrible critical days rumours creep about that SOMEWHERE a demonstration is being prepared that SOME ONE is calling on the soldiers and workers to destroy revolutionary peace and order Rabotchi Put the newspaper of the Bolsheviki is pouring oil on the flames it flattering trying to please the unenlightened people tempting the worker and soldiers urging them on against the Government promising them mountains of good things The confiding ignorant men believe they do not reason And from the other side come also rumours rumours that the Dark Forces the friends of the Tsar the German spies are rubbing their hands with glee They are ready to join the Bolsheviki and with them fan the disorders into civil war The Bolsheviki and the ignorant soldiers and workers seduced by them cry senselessly Down with the Government All power to the Soviets And the Dark servants of the Tsar and the spies of Wilhelm will egg the on Beat the Jews beat the shopkeepers rob the markets devastate the shops pillage the wine stores Slay burn rob And then will begin a terrible confusion a war between one part of the people and the other All will become still more disorganised and perhaps once more blood will be shed on the streets of the capital And then what then Then the road to Petrograd will be open to Wilhelm Then no bread will come to Petrograd the children will die of hunger Then the Army as the front will remain without support our brothers in the trenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy Then Russia will lose all prestige in other countries our money will lose its value everything will be so dear as to make life impossible Then the long awaited Constituent Assembly will be postponed it will be impossible to convene it in time And then Death to the Revolution Death to our Liberty Is it this that you want workers and soldiers No If you do not then go go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers and tell them the whole truth which we have told you Let all know that EVERY MAN WHO IN THESE TERRIBLE DAYS CALLS ON YOU TO COME OUT IN THE STREETS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IS EITHER A SECRET SERVANT OF THE TSAR A PROVOCATOR OR AN UNWISE ASSISTANT OF THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE OR A PAID SPY OF WILHELM Every conscious worker revolutionist every conscious peasant every revolutionary soldier all who understand what harm a demonstration or a revolt against the Government might cause to the people must join together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy our freedom The Petrograd Electoral Committee of the Mensheviki oborontzi eleven LENIN s LETTER TO THE COMRADES This series of articles appeared in Rabotchi Put several days running at the end of October and beginning of November nineteen seventeen I give here only extracts from two instalments one Kameniev and Riazanov say that we have not a majority among the people and that without a majority insurrection is hopeless Answer People capable of speaking such things are falsifiers pedants or simply don t want to look the real situation in the face In the last elections we received in all the country more than fifty per cent of all thevotes The most important thing in Russia to day is the peasants revolution In Tambov Government there has been a real agrarian uprising with wonderful political results Even Dielo Naroda has been scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to the peasants and not only the Socialist Revolutionaries in the Council of the Republic but also the Government itself has been similarly affected Another valuable result was the bringing of bread which had been hoarded by the pomieshtchiki to the railroad stations in that province The Russkaya Volia had to admit that the stations were filled with bread after the peasants rising two We are not sufficiently strong to take over the Government and the bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the Constituent Assembly Answer This is nothing but timidity expressed by pessimism as regards workers and soldiers and optimism as regards the failure of the bourgeoisie If yunkers and Cossacks say they will fight you believe them if workmen and soldiers say so you doubt it What is the distinction between such doubts and siding politically with the bourgeoisie Kornilov proved that the Soviets were really a power To believe Kerensky and the Council of the Republic if the bourgeoisie is not strong enough to break the Soviets it is not strong enough to break the Constituent But that is wrong The bourgeoisie will break the Constituent by sabotage by lock outs by giving up Petrograd by opening the front to the Germans This has already been done in the case of Riga three The Soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the Government to force the calling of the Constituent Assembly and to suppress any further Kornilov attempts Answer Refusal of insurrection is refusal of All Power to the Soviets Since September the Bolshevik party has been discussing the question of insurrection Refusing to rise means to trust our hopes in the faith of the good bourgeoisie who have promised to call the Constituent Assembly When the Soviets have all the power the calling of the Constituent is guaranteed and its success assured Refusal of insurrection means surrender to the Lieber Dans Either we must drop All Power to the Soviets or make an insurrection there is no middle course four The bourgeoisie cannot give up Petrograd although the Rodziankos want it because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting but our heroic soldiers and sailors Answer This did not prevent two admirals from running away at the Moonsund battle The Staff has not changed it is composed of Kornilovtsi If the Staff with Kerensky at its head wants to give up Petrograd it can do it doubly or trebly It can make arrangements with the Germans or the British open the fronts It can sabotage the Army s food supply At all these doors has it knocked We have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes the Revolution Rodzianko is a man of action who has faithfully and truthfully served the bourgeoisie for years Half the Lieber Dans are cowardly compromisers half of them simple fatalists five We re getting stronger every day We shall be able to enter the Constituent Assembly as a strong opposition Then why should we play everything on one card Answer This is the argument of a sophomore with no practical experience who reads that the Constituent Assembly is being called and trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way Even the voting of the Constituent Assembly will not do away with hunger or beat Wilhelm The issue of hunger and of surrendering Petrograd cannot be decided by waiting for the Constituent Assembly Hunger is not waiting The peasants Revolution is not waiting The Admirals who ran away did not wait Blind people are surprised that hungry people betrayed by admirals and generals do not take an interest in voting six If the Kornilovtsi make an attempt we would show them our strength But why should we risk everything by making an attempt ourselves Answer History doesn t repeat Perhaps Kornilov will some day make an attempt What a serious base for proletarian action But suppose Kornilov waits for starvation for the opening of the fronts what then This attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionary party on one of the bourgeoisie s former mistakes Let us forget everything except that there is no way out but by the dictatorship of the proletariat either that or the dictatorship of Kornilov Let us wait comrades for a miracle twelve MILIUKOV s SPEECH Resume Every one admits it seems that the defence of the country is our principal task and that to assure it we must have discipline in the Army and order in the rear To achieve this there must be a power capable of daring not only by persuasion but also by force The germ of all our evils comes from the point of view original truly Russian concerning foreign policy which passes for the Internationalist point of view The noble Lenin only imitates the noble Keroyevsky when he holds that from Russia will come the New World which shall resuscitate the aged West and which will replace the old banner of doctrinary Socialism by the new direct action of starving masses and that will push humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of the social paradise These men sincerely believed that the decomposition of Russia would bring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist regime Starting from that point of view they were able to commit the unconscious treason in wartime of calmly telling the soldiers to abandon the trenches and instead of fighting the external enemy creating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors and capitalists Here Miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the Left demanding what Socialist had ever advised such action Martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariat can condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques and break down the dictatorship of these cliques Not by an accord between Governments for a limitation of armaments but by the disarming of these Governments and the radical democratisation of the military system He attacked Martov viciously and then turned on the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries whom he accused of entering the Government as Ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the class struggle The Socialists of Germany and of the Allied countries contemplated these gentlemen with ill concealed contempt but they decided that it was for Russia and sent us some apostles of the Universal Conflagration The formula of our democracy is very simple no foreign policy no art of diplomacy an immediate democratic peace a declaration to the Allies We want nothing we haven t anything to fight with And then our adversaries will make the same declaration and the brotherhood of peoples will be accomplished Miliukov took a fling at the Zimmerwald Manifesto and declared that even Kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of that unhappy document which will forever be your indictment He then attacked Skobeliev whose position in foreign assemblies where he would appear as a Russian delegate yet opposed to the foreign policy of his Government would be so strange that people would say What s that gentleman carrying and what shall we talk to him about As for the nakaz Miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist that he believed in the creation of an International Arbitration Board and the necessity for a limitation of armaments and parliamentary control over secret diplomacy which did not mean the abolition of secret diplomacy As for the Socialist ideas in the nakaz which he called Stockholm ideas peace without victory the right of self determination of peoples and renunciation of the economic war The German successes are directly proportionate to the successes of those who call themselves the revolutionary democracy I do not wish to say to the successes of the Revolution because I believe that the defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for the Revolution The influence of the Soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant One had only to listen to the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs to be convinced that in this hall the influence of the revolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong that the Minister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honour and dignity of Russia We can see in the nakaz of the Soviets that the ideas of the Stockholm Manifesto have been elaborated in two direction that of Utopianism and that of German interests Interrupted by the angry cries of the Left and rebuked by the President Miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concluded by popular assemblies not by diplomats and the proposal to undertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renounced annexations were pro German Recently Kuhlman said that a personal declaration bound only him who made it Anyway we will imitate the Germans before we will imitate the Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies The sections treating of the independence of Lithuania and Livonia were symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of Russia supported said Miliukov by German money Amid bedlam from the Left he contrasted the clauses of the nakaz concerning Alsace Lorraine Rumania and Serbia with those treating of the nationalities in Germany and Austria The nakaz embraced the German and Austrian point of view said Miliukov Passing to Terestchenko s speech he contemptuously accused him of being afraid to speak the thought in his mind and even afraid to think in terms of the greatness of Russia The Dardanelles must belong to Russia You are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he is fighting and that when he does know he ll fight It is true that the soldier doesn t know why he is fighting but now you have told him that there is no reason for him to fight that we have no national interests and that we are fighting for alien ends Paying tribute to the Allies who he said with the assistance of America will yet save the cause of humanity he ended Long live the light of humanity the advanced democracies of the West who for a long time have been travelling the way we now only begin to enter with ill assured and hesitating steps Long live our brave Allies thirteen INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKY The Associated Press man tried his hand mister Kerensky he began in England and France people are disappointed with the Revolution Yes I know interrupted Kerensky quizzically Abroad the Revolution is no longer fashionable What is your explanation of why the Russians have stopped fighting That is a foolish question to ask Kerensky was annoyed Russia entered the war first of all the Allies and for a long time she bore the whole brunt of it Her losses have been inconceivably greater than those of all the other nations put together Russia has now the right to demand of the Allies that they bring greater force of arms to bear He stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutor You are asking why the Russians have stopped fighting and the Russians are asking where is the British fleet with German battle ships in the Gulf of Riga Again he ceased suddenly and as suddenly burst out The Russian Revolution hasn t failed and the revolutionary Army hasn t failed It is not the Revolution which caused disorganisation in the army that disorganisation was accomplished years ago by the old regime Why aren t the Russians fighting I will tell you Because the masses of the people are economically exhausted and because they are disillusioned with the Allies The interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the United States and in a few days sent back by the American State Department with a demand that it be altered This Kerensky refused to do but it was done by his secretary doctor David Soskice and thus purged of all offensive references to the Allies was given to the press of the world APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III one RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY SHOP COMMITTEES Workers Control one See page forty three two The organisation of Workers Control is a manifestation of the same healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production as are party organisations in the sphere of politics trade unions in employment Cooperatives in the domain of consumption and literary clubs in the sphere of culture three The working class has much more interest in the proper and uninterrupted operation of factories than the capitalist class Workers Control is a better security in this respect for the interests of modern society of the whole people than the arbitrary will of the owners who are guided only by their selfish desire for material profits or political privileges Therefore Workers Control is demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest but in the interest of the whole country and should be supported by the revolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary Army four Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalist class toward the Revolution experience shows that proper distribution of raw materials and fuel as well as the most efficient management of factories is impossible without Workers Control five Only Workers Control over capitalist enterprises cultivating the workers conscious attitude toward work and making clear its social meaning can create conditions favourable to the development of a firm self discipline in labour and the development of all labour s possible productivity six The impending transformation of industry from a war to a peace basis and the redistribution of labour all over the country as well as among the different factories can be accomplished without great disturbances only by means of the democratic self government of the workers themselves Therefore the realisation of Workers Control is an indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry seven In accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party Bolsheviki Workers Control on a national scale in order to bring results must extend to all capitalist concerns and not be organised accidentally without system it must be well planned and not separated from the industrial life of the country as a whole eight The economic life of the country agriculture industry commerce and transport must be subjected to one unified plan constructed so as to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the wide masses of the people it must be approved by their elected representatives and carried out under the direction of these representatives by means of national and local organisations nine That part of the plan which deals with land labour must be carried out under supervision of the peasants and land workers organisations that relating to industry trade and transport operated by wage earners by means of Workers Control the natural organs of Workers Control inside the industrial plant will be the Factory Shop and similar Committees and in the labour market the Trade Unions ten The collective wage agreements arranged by the Trade Unions for the majority of workers in any branch of labour must be binding on all the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the given district eleven Employment bureaus must be placed under the control and management of the Trade Unions as class organisations acting within the limits of the whole industrial plan and in accordance with it twelve Trade Unions must have the right upon their own initiative to begin legal action against all employers who violate labour contracts or labour legislation and also in behalf of any individual worker in any branch of labour thirteen On all questions relating to Workers Control over production distribution and employment the Trade Unions must confer with the workers of individual establishments through their Factory Shop Committees fourteen Matters of employment and discharge vacations wage scales refusal of work degree of productivity and skill reasons for abrogating agreements disputes with the administration and similar problems of the internal life of the factory must be settled exclusively according to the findings of the Factory Shop Committee which has the right to exclude from participation in the discussion any members of the factory administration fifteen The Factory Shop Committee forms a commission to control the supplying of the factory with raw materials fuel orders labour power and technical staff including equipment and all other supplies and arrangements and also to assure the factory s adherence to the general industrial plan The factory administration is obliged to surrender to the organs of Workers Control for their aid and information all data concerning the business to make it possible to verify this data and to produce the books of the company upon demand of the Factory Shop Committee sixteen Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered by the Factory Shop Committees or any suspicion of such illegal acts which cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone shall be referred to the district central organisation of Factory Shop Committees charged with the particular branch of labour involved which shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with the execution of the general industrial plan and find means to deal with the matter even to the extent of confiscating the factory seventeen The union of the Factory Shop Committees of different concerns must be accomplished on the basis of the different trades in order to facilitate control over the whole branch of industry so as to come within the general industrial plan and so as to create an effective plan of distribution among the different factories of orders raw materials fuel technical and labour power and also to facilitate cooperation with the Trade Unions which are organised by trades eighteen The central city councils of Trade Unions and Factory Shop Committees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincial and local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the general industrial plan and to organise economic relations between the towns and the villages workers and peasants They also possess final authority for the management of Factory Shop Committees and Trade Unions so far as Workers Control in their district is concerned and they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workers discipline in the routine of production which regulations however must be approved by vote of the workers themselves two THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI Russkaya Volia October twenty eight The decisive moment approaches It is decisive for the Bolsheviki Either they will give us a second edition of the events of July sixteen eighteen or they will have to admit that with their plans and intentions with their impertinent policy of wishing to separate themselves from everything consciously national they have been definitely defeated What are the chances of Bolshevik success It is difficult to answer that question for their principal support is the ignorance of the popular masses They speculate on it they work upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop The Government must play its part in this affair Supporting itself morally by the Council of the Republic the Government must take a clearly defined attitude toward the Bolsheviki And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legal power and thus facilitate the German invasion they must be treated as mutineers and traitors Birzhevya Viedomosti October twenty eight Now that the Bolsheviki have separated themselves from the rest of the democracy the struggle against them is very much simpler and it is not reasonable in order to fight against Bolshevism to wait until they make a manifestation The Government should not even allow the manifestation The appeals of the Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are acts punishable by the criminal courts and in the freest countries their authors would receive severe sentences For what the Bolsheviki are carrying on is not a political struggle against the Government or even for the power it is propaganda for anarchy massacres and civil war This propaganda must be extirpated at its roots it would be strange to wait in order to begin action against an agitation for pogroms until the pogroms actually occurred Novoye Vremya November one Why is the Government excited only about November twod date of calling of the Congress of Soviets and not about September twelfth or October threed This is not the first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins and that the smoke of the terrible conflagration makes the eyes of our Allies smart Since it came to power has there been a single order issued by the Government for the purpose of halting anarchy or has any one attempted to put out the Russian conflagration There were other things to do The Government turned its attention to a more immediate problem It crushed an insurrection the Kornilov attempt concerning which every one is now asking Did it ever exist three MODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI Dielo Naroda October twenty eight Socialist Revolutionary The most frightful crime of the Bolsheviki against the Revolution is that they impute exclusively to the bad intentions of the revolutionary Government all the calamities which the masses are so cruelly suffering when as a matter of fact these calamities spring from objective causes They make golden promises to the masses knowing in advance that they can fulfil none of them they lead the masses on a false trail deceiving them as to the source of all their troubles The Bolsheviki are the most dangerous enemies of the Revolution Dien October thirty Menshevik Is this really the freedom of the press Every day Novaya Rus and Rabotchi Put openly incite to insurrection Every day these two papers commit in their columns actual crimes Every day they urge pogroms Is that the freedom of the press The Government ought to defend itself and defend us We have the right to insist that the Government machinery does not remain passive while the threat of bloody riots endangers the lives of its citizens four YEDINSTVO Plekhanov s paper Yedinstvo suspended publication a few weeks after the Bolsheviki seized the power Contrary to popular report Yedinstvo was not suppressed by the Soviet Government an announcement in the last number admitted that it was unable to continue because there were too few subscribers five WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS The French newspaper Entente of Petrograd on November fifteenth published an article of which the following is a part The Government of Kerensky discusses and hesitates The Government of Lenin and Trotzky attacks and acts This last is called a Government of Conspirators but that is wrong Government of usurpers yes like all revolutionary Governments which triumph over their adversaries Conspirators no No They did not conspire On the contrary openly audaciously without mincing words without dissimulating their intentions they multiplied their agitation intensified their propaganda in the factories the barracks at the Front in the country everywhere even fixing in advance the date of their taking up arms the date of their seizure of the power They conspirators Never six APPEAL AGAINST INSURRECTION From the Central Army Committee Above everything we insist upon the inflexible execution of the organised will of the majority of the people expressed by the Provisional Government in accord with the Council of the Republic and the Tsay ee kah as organ of the popular power Any demonstration to depose this power by violence at a moment when a Government crisis will infallibly create disorganisation the ruin of the country and civil war will be considered by the Army as a counter revolutionary act and repressed by force of arms The interests of private groups and classes should be submitted to a single interest that of augmenting industrial production and distributing the necessities of life with fairness All who are capable of sabotage disorganisation or disorder all deserters all slackers all looters should be forced to do auxiliary service in the rear of the Army We invite the Provisional Government to form out of these violators of the people s will these enemies of the Revolution labour detachments to work in the rear on the Front in the trenches under enemy fire seven EVENTS OF THE NIGHT NOVEMBER sixTH Toward evening bands of Red Guards began to occupy the printing shops of the bourgeois press where they printed Rabotchi Put Soldat and various proclamations by the hundred thousand The City Militia was ordered to clear these places but found the offices barricaded and armed men defending them Soldiers who were ordered to attack the print shops refused About midnight a Colonel with a company of yunkers arrived at the club Free Mind with a warrant to arrest the editor of Rabotchi Put Immediately an enormous mob gathered in the street outside and threatened to lynch the yunkers The Colonel thereupon begged that he and the yunkers be arrested and taken to Peter Paul prison for safety This request was granted At one A M a detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupied the Telegraph Agency At one point thirty five the Post Office was occupied Toward morning the Military Hotel was taken and at five o clock the Telephone Exchange At dawn the State Bank was surrounded And at ten A M a cordon of troops was drawn about the Winter Palace APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV one EVENTS OF NOVEMBER sevenTH From four A M until dawn Kerensky remained at the Petrograd Staff Headquarters sending orders to the Cossacks and to the yunkers in the Officers Schools in and around Petrograd all of whom answered that they were unable to move Colonel Polkovnikov Commandant of the City hurried between the Staff and the Winter Palace evidently without any plan Kerensky gave an order to open the bridges three hours passed without any action and then an officer and five men went out on their own initiative and putting to flight a picket of Red Guards opened the Nicolai Bridge Immediately after they left however some sailors closed it again Kerensky ordered the print shop of Rabotchi Put to be occupied The officer detailed to the work was promised a squad of soldiers two hours later he was promised some yunkers then the order was forgotten An attempt was made to recapture the Post Office and the Telegraph Agency a few shots were fired and the Government troops announced that they would no longer oppose the Soviets To a delegation of yunkers Kerensky said As chief of the Provisional Government and as Supreme Commander I know nothing I cannot advise you but as a veteran revolutionist I appeal to you young revolutionists to remain at your posts and defend the conquests of the Revolution Orders of Kishkin November seventh By decree of the Provisional Government I am invested with extraordinary powers for the reestablishment of order in Petrograd in complete command of all civil and military authorities In accordance with the powers conferred upon me by the Provisional Government I herewith relieve from his functions as Commandant of the Petrograd Military District Colonel George Polkovnikov Appeal to the Population signed by Vice Premier Konovalov November seventh Citizens Save the fatherland the republic and your freedom Maniacs have raised a revolt against the only governmental power chosen by the people the Provisional Government The members of the Provisional Government fulfil their duty remain at their post and continue to work for the good of the fatherland the reestablishment of order and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly future sovereign of Russia and of all the Russian peoples Citizens you must support the Provisional Government You must strengthen its authority You must oppose these maniacs with whom are joined all enemies of liberty and order and the followers of the Tsarist regime in order to wreck the Constituent Assembly destroy the conquests of the Revolution and the future of our dear fatherland Citizens Organise around the Provisional Government for the defence of its temporary authority in the name of order and the happiness of all peoples Proclamation of the Provisional Government The Petrograd Soviet has declared the Provisional Government overthrown and has demanded that the Governmental power be turned over to it under threat of bombarding the Winter Palace with the cannon of Peter Paul Fortress and of the cruiser Avrora anchored in the Neva The Government can surrender its authority only to the Consituent Assembly for that reason it has decided not to submit and to demand aid from the population and the Army A telegram has been sent to the Stavka and an answer received says that a strong detachment of troops is being sent Let the Army and the People reject the irresponsible attempts of the Bolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear About nine A M Kerensky left for the Front Toward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves at the Staff Headquarters as delegates of the garrison of Peter Paul Fortress Entering the meeting room of the Staff where Kishkin Rutenburg Paltchinski General Bagratouni Colonel Paradielov and Count Tolstoy were gathered they demanded the immediate surrender of the Staff threatening in case of refusal to bombard headquarters After two panicky conferences the Staff retreated to the Winter Palace and the headquarters were occupied by Red Guards Late in the afternoon several Bolshevik armoured cars cruised around the Palace Square and Soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parley with the yunkers Firing on the Palace began about seven o clock in the evening At ten P M began an artillery bombardment from three sides in which most of the shells were blanks only three small shrapnels striking the facade of the Palace two KERENSKY IN FLIGHT Leaving Petrograd in the morning of November seventh Kerensky arrived by automobile at Gatchina where he demanded a special train Toward evening he was in Ostrov Province of Pskov The next morning extraordinary session of the local Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Depulies with participation of Cossack delegates there being six thousand Cossacks at Ostrov Kerensky spoke to the assembly appealing for aid against the Bolsheviki and addressed himself almost exclusively to the Cossacks The soldier delegates protested Why did you come here shouted voices Kerensky answered To ask the Cossacks assistance in crushing the Bolshevik insurrection At this there were violent protestations which increased when he continued I broke the Kornilov attempt and I will break the Bolsheviki The noise became so great that he had to leave the platform The soldier deputies and the Ussuri Cossacks decided to arrest Kerensky but the Don Cossacks prevented them and got him away by train A Military Revolutionary Committee set up during the day tried to inform the garrison of Pskov but the telephone and telegraph lines were cut Kerensky did not arrive at Pskov Revolutionary soldiers had cut the railway line to prevent troops being sent against the capital On the night of November eighth he arrived by automobile at Luga where he was well received by the Death Battalions stationed there Next day he took train for the South West Front and visited the Army Committee at headquarters The Fifth Army however was wild with enthusiasm over the news of the Bolshevik success and the Army Committee was unable to promise Kerensky any support From there he went to the Stavka at Moghilev where he ordered ten regiments from different parts of the Front to move against Petrograd The soldiers almost unanimously refused and those regiments which did start halted on the way About five thousand Cossacks finally followed him three LOOTING OF THE WINTER PALACE I do not mean to maintain that there was no looting in the Winter Palace Both after and before the Winter Palace fell there was considerable pilfering The statement of the Socialist Revolutionary paper Narod and of members of the City Duma to the effect that precious objects to the value of five hundred million rubles had been stolen was however a gross exaggeration The most important art treasures of the Palace paintings statues tapestries rare porcelains and armorie had been transferred to Moscow during the month of September and they were still in good order in the basement of the Imperial Palace there ten days after the capture of the Kremlin by Bolshevik troops I can personally testify to this Individuals however especially the general public which was allowed to circulate freely through the Winter Palace for several days after its capture made away with table silver clocks bedding mirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and semi precious stone to the value of about fifty thousand dollars The Soviet Government immediately created a special commission composed of artists and archaeologists to recover the stolen objects On November first two proclamations were issued CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD We urgently ask all citizens to exert every effort to find whatever possible of the objects stolen from the Winter Palace in the night of November seven eight and to forward them to the Commandant of the Winter Palace Receivers of stolen goods antiquarians and all who are proved to be hiding such objects will be held legally responsible and punished with all severity Commissars for the Protection of Museums and Artistic Collections G YATMANOV B MANDELBAUM TO REGIMENTAL AND FLEET COMMITTEES In the night of November seven eight in the Winter Palace which is the inalienable property of the Russian people valuable objects of art were stolen We urgently appeal to all to exert every effort so that the stolen objects are returned to the Winter Palace Commissars G YATMANOV B MANDELBAUM About half the loot was recovered some of it in the baggage of foreigners leaving Russia A conference of artists and archaeologists held at the suggestion of Smolny appointed a commission of make an inventory of the Winter Palace treasures which was given complete charge of the Palace and of all artistic collections and State museums in Petrograd On November sixteenth the Winter Palace was closed to the public while the inventory was being made During the last week in November a decree was issued by the Council of People s Commissars changing the name of the Winter Palace to People s Museum entrusting it to the complete charge of the artistic archaeological commission and declaring that henceforth all Governmental activities within its wall were prohibited four RAPE OF THE WOMEN S BATTALION Immediately following the taking of the Winter Palace all sorts of sensational stories were published in the anti Bolshevik press and told in the City Duma about the fate of the Women s Battalion defending the Palace It was said that some of the girl soldiers had been thrown from the windows into the street most of the rest had been violated and many had committed suicide as a result of the horrors they had gone through The City Duma appointed a commission to investigate the matter On November sixteenth the commission returned from Levashovo headquarters of the Women s Battalion Madame Tyrkova reported that the girls had been at first taken to the barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment and that there some of them had been badly treated but that at present most of them were at Levashovo and the rest scattered about the city in private houses doctor Mandelbaum another of the commission testified drily that none of the women had been thrown out of the windows of the Winter Palace that none were wounded that three had been violated and that one had committed suicide leaving a note which said that she had been disappointed in her ideals On November twenty first the Military Revolutionary Committee officially dissolved the Women s Battalion at the request of the girls themselves who returned to civilian clothes In Louise Bryant s book Six Red Months in Russia there is an interesting description of the girl soldiers during this time APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V one APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS From the Military Revolutionary Committee November eight To All Army Committees and All Soviets of Soldiers Deputies The Petrograd garrison has overturned the Government of Kerensky which had risen against the Revolution and the People In sending this news to the Front and the country the Military Revolutionary Committee requests all soldiers to keep vigilant watch on the conduct of officers Officers who do not frankly and openly declare for the Revolution should be immediately arrested as enemies The Petrograd Soviet interprets the programme of the new Government as immediate proposals of a general democratic peace the immediate transfer of great landed estates to the peasants and the honest convocation of the Constituent Assembly The people s revolutionary Army must not permit troops of doubtful morale to be sent to Petrograd Act by means of arguments by means of moral suasion but if that fails halt the movement of troops by implacable force The present order must be immediately read to all military units of every branch of the service Whoever keeps the knowledge of this order from the soldier masses commits a serious crime against the Revolution and will be punished with all the rigour of revolutionary law Soldiers For peace bread land and popular government To All Front and Rear Army Corps Divisional Regimental and Company Committees and All Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies Soldiers and Revolutionary Officers The Military Revolutionary Committee by agreement with the majority of the workers soldiers and peasants has decreed that General Kornilov and all the accomplices of his conspiracy shall be brought immediately to Petrograd for incarceration in Peter Paul Fortress and arraignment before a military revolutionary court martial All who resist the execution of this decree are declared by the Committee to be traitors to the Revolution and their orders are herewith declared null and void The Military Revolutionary Committee Attached to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies To all Provincial and District Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies By resolution of the All Russian Congress of Soviets all arrested members of Land Committees are immediately set free The Commissars who arrested them are to be arrested From this moment all power belongs to the Soviets The Commissars of the Provisional Government are removed The presidents of the various local Soviets are invited to enter into direct relations with the revolutionary Government Military Revolutionary Committee two PROTEST OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA The Central City Duma elected on the most democratic principles has undertaken the burden of managing Municipal affairs and food supplies at the time of the greatest disorganisation At the present moment the Bolshevik party three weeks before the elections to the Constituent Assembly and in spite of the menace of the external enemy having removed by armed force the only legal revolutionary authority is making an attempt against the rights and independence of the Municipal Self Government demanding submission to its Commissars and its illegal authority In this terrible and tragic moment the Petrograd City Duma in the face of its constituents and of all Russia declares loudly that it will not submit to any encroachments on its rights and its independence and will remain at the post of responsibility to which it has been called by the will of the population of the capital The Central City Duma of Petrograd appeals to all Dumas and Zemstvos of the Russian Republic to rally to the defence of one of the greatest conquests of the Russian Revolution the independence and inviolability of popular self government three LAND DECREE PEASANTS NAKAZ The Land question can only be permanently settled by the general Constituent Assembly The most equitable solution of the Land question should be as follows one The right of private ownership of land is abolished forever land cannot be sold nor leased nor mortgaged nor alienated in any way All dominical lands lands attached to titles lands belonging to the Emperor s cabinet to monasteries churches possession lands entailed lands private estates communal lands peasant free holds and others are confiscated without compensation and become national property and are placed at the disposition of the workers who cultivate them Those who are damaged because of this social transformation of the rights of property are entitled to public aid during the time necessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions of existence two All the riches beneath the earth ores oil coal salt et cetera as well as forests and waters having a national importance become the exclusive property of the State All minor streams lakes and forests are placed in the hands of the communities on condition of being managed by the local organs of government three All plots of land scientifically cultivated gardens plantations nurseries seed plots green houses and others shall not be divided but transformed into model farms and pass into the hands of the State or of the community according to their size and importance Buildings communal lands and villages with their private gardens and their orchards remain in the hands of their present owners the dimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for their use shall be fixed by law four All studs governmental and private cattle breeding and bird breeding establishments and others are confiscated and become national property and are transferred either to the State or to the community according to their size and importance All questions of compensation for the above are within the competence of the Constituent Assembly five All inventoried agricultural property of the confiscated lands machinery and live stock are transferred without compensation to the State or the community according to their quantity and importance The confiscation of such machinery or live stock shall not apply to the small properties of peasants six The right to use the land is granted to all citizens without distinction of sex who wish to work the land themselves with the help of their families or in partnership and only so long as they are able to work No hired labour is permitted In the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the commune for a period of two years the commune shall be bound to render him assistance during this time by working his land in common Farmers who through old age or sickness have permanently lost the capacity to work the land themselves shall surrender their land and receive instead a Government pension seven The use of the land should be equalised that is to say the land shall be divided among the workers according to local conditions the unit of labour and the needs of the individual The way in which land is to be used may be individually determined upon as homesteads as farms by communes by partnerships as will be decided by the villages and settlements eight All land upon its confiscation is pooled in the general People s Land Fund Its distribution among the workers is carried out by the local and central organs of administration beginning with the village democratic organisations and ending with the central provincial institutions with the exception of urban and rural cooperative societies The Land Fund is subject to periodical redistribution according to the increase of population and the development of productivity and rural economy In case of modification of the boundaries of allotments the original centre of the allotment remains intact The lands of persons retiring from the community return to the Land Fund providing that near relatives of the persons retiring or friends designated by them shall have preference in the redistribution of these lands When lands are returned to the Land Fund the money expended for manuring or improving the land which has not been exhausted shall be reimbursed If in some localities the Land Fund is insufficient to satisfy the local population the surplus population should emigrate The organisation of the emigration also the costs thereof and the providing of emigrants with the necessary machinery and live stock shall be the business of the State The emigration shall be carried out in the following order first the peasants without land who express their wish to emigrate then the undesirable members of the community deserters et cetera and finally by drawing lots on agreement All which is contained in this nakaz being the expression of the indisputable will of the great majority of conscious peasants of Russia is declared to be a temporary law and until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly becomes effective immediately so far as is possible and in some parts of it gradually as will be determined by the District Soviets of Peasants Deputies four THE LAND AND DESERTERS The Government was not forced to make any decision concerning the rights of deserters to the land The end of the war and the demobilisation of the army automatically removed the deserter problem five THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE S COMMISSARS The Council of People s Commissars was at first composed entirely of Bolsheviki This was not entirely the fault of the Bolsheviki however On November eighth they offered portfolios to members of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries who declined See page two hundred seventy three APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI one APPEALS AND DENUNCIATIONS Appeal to all Citizens and to the Military Organisations of the Socialist Revolutionary Party The senseless attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of complete failure The garrison is disaffected The Ministries are idle bread is lacking All factions except a handful of Bolsheviki have left the Congress of Soviets The Bolsheviki are alone Abuses of all sorts acts of vandalism and pillage the bombardment of the Winter Palace arbitrary arrests all these crimes committed by the Bolsheviki have aroused against them the resentment of the majority of the sailors and soldiers The Tsentroflot refuses to submit to the orders of the Bolsheviki We call upon all sane elements to gather around the Committee for Salvation of Country and Revolution to take serious measures to be ready at the first call of the Central Committee of the Party to act against the counter revolutionists who will doubtless attempt to profit by these troubles provoked by the Bolshevik adventure and to watch closely the external enemy who also would like to take advantage of this opportune moment when the Front is weakened The Military Section of the Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionary Party From Pravda What is Kerensky A usurper whose place is in Peter Paul prison with Kornilov and Kishkin A criminal and a traitor to the workers soldiers and peasants who believed in him Kerensky A murderer of soldiers Kerensky A public executioner of peasants Kerensky A strangler of workers Such is the second Kornilov who now wants to butcher Liberty APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII one TWO DECREES On the Press In the serious decisive hour of the Revolution and the days immediately following it the Provisional Revolutionary Committee is compelled to adopt a series of measures against the counter revolutionary press of all shades Immediately on all sides there are cries that the new Socialist authority is in this violating the essential principles of its own programme by an attempt against the freedom of the press The Workers and Peasants Government calls the attention of the population to the fact that in our country behind this liberal shield is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to seize the lion s share of the whole press and by this means to poison the popular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness of the masses Every one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the most powerful weapons of the bourgeoisie Especially in this critical moment when the new authority of the workers and peasants is in process of consolidation it is impossible to leave it in the hands of the enemy at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs and machine guns This is why temporary and extraordinary measures have been adopted for the purpose of stopping the flow of filth and calumny in which the yellow and green press would be glad to drown the young victory of the people As soon as the new order is consolidated all administrative measures against the press will be suspended full liberty will be given it within the limits of responsibility before the law in accordance with the broadest and most progressive regulations Bearing in mind however the fact that any restrictions of the freedom of the press even in critical moments are admissible only within the bounds of necessity the Council of People s Commissars decrees as follows one The following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure a Those inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the Workers and Peasants Government b Those creating confusion by obviously and deliberately perverting the news c Those inciting to acts of a criminal character punishable by the laws two The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press shall be carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council of People s Commissars three The present decree is of a temporary nature and will be revoked by a special ukaz when normal conditions of public life are re established President of the Council of People s Commissars VLADIMIR ULIANOV LENIN On Workers Militia one All Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies shall form a Workers Militia two This Workers Militia shall be entirely at the orders of the Soviets of Workers and Soldiers Deputies three Military and civil authorities must render every assistance in arming the workers and in supplying them with technical equipment even to the extent of requisitioning arms belonging to the War Department of the Government four This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph Petrograd November ten nineteen seventeen People s Commissar of the Interior A I RYKOV This decree encouraged the formation of companies of Red Guards all over Russia which became the most valuable arm of the Soviet Government in the ensuing civil war two THE STRIKE FUND The fund for the striking Government employees and bank clerks was subscribed by banks and business houses of Petrograd and other cities and also by foreign corporations doing business in Russia All who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid full wages and in some cases their pay was increased It was the realisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki were firmly in power followed by their refusal to pay strike benefits which finally broke the strike APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII one KERENSKY S ADVANCE On November ninth Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina where the garrison hopelessly split into two factions immediately surrendered The members of the Gatchina Soviet were arrested and at first threatened with death later they were released on good behaviour The Cossack advance guards practically unopposed occupied Pavlovsk Alexandrovsk and other stations and reached the outskirts of Tsarskoye Selo next morning November tenth At once the garrison divided into three groups the officers loyal to Kerenskly part of the soldiers and non commissioned officers who declared themselves neutral and most of the rank and file who were for the Bolsheviki The Bolshevik soldiers who were without leaders or organisation fell back toward the capital The local Soviet also withdrew to the village of Pulkovo From Pulkovo six members of the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with an automobile load of proclamations to Gatchina to propagandise the Cossacks They spent most of the day going around Gatchina from one Cossack barracks to another pleading arguing and explaining Toward evening some officers discovered their presence and they were arrested and brought before General Krasnov who said You fought against Kornilov now you are opposing Kerensky I ll have you all shot After reading aloud to them the order appointing him commander in chief of the Petrograd District Krasnov asked if they were Bolsheviki They replied in the affirmative upon which Krasnov went away a short time later an officer came and set them free saying that it was by order of General Krasnov In the meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd from the Duma the Committee for Salvation and last of all from the Vikzhel The Union of Railway Workers insisted that some agreement be reached to halt the civil war and demanded that Kerensky treat with the Bolsheviki and that he stop the advance on Petrograd In case of refusal the Vikzhel threatened a general strike at midnight of November eleventh Kerensky asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the Socialist Ministers and with the Committee for Salvation He was plainly undecided On the eleventh Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo from which the local Soviet and the heterogeneous forces of the Military Revolutionary Committee precipitately retired some of them surrendering That night they also touched Pulkovo where the first real resistance was encountered Cossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd declaring that Kerensky had lied to them that he had spread broadcast over the front proclamations which said that Petrograd was burning that the Bolsheviki had invited the Germans to come in and that they were murdering women and children and looting indiscriminately The Military Revolutionary Committee immediately sent out some dozens of agitators with thousands of printed appeals to inform the Cossacks of the real situation two PROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE To All Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies The All Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take the most energetic measures to oppose all counter revolutionary anti Semitic disturbances and all pogroms of whatever nature The honour of the workers peasants and soldiers Revolution cannot tolerate any disorders The Red Guard of Petrograd the revolutionary garrison and the sailors have maintained complete order in the capital Workers soldiers and peasants everywhere you should follow the example of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd Comrades soldiers and Cossacks on us falls the duty of keeping real revolutionary order All revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes on you The All Russian Congress of Soviets decrees To abolish capital punishment at the Front which was reintroduced by Kerensky Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re established in the country All soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest for so called political crimes are at once to be set free The ex Premier Kerensky overthrown by the people refuses to submit to the Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legal Government elected by the All Russian Congress the Council of People s Commissars The Front has refused to aid Kerensky Moscow has rallied to the new Government In many cities Minsk Moghilev Kharkov the power is in the hands of the Soviets No infantry detachment consents to march against the Workers and Peasants Government which in accord with the firm will of the Army and the people has begun peace negotiations and has given the land to the peasants We give public warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky who has deceived them and is leading them against Petrograd the revolutionary forces will rise with all their might for the defence of the precious conquests of the Revolution Peace and Land Citizens of Petrograd Kerensky fled from the city abandoning the authority to Kishkin who wanted to surrender the capital to the Germans Rutenburg of the Black Band who sabotaged the Municipal Food Supply and Paltchinsky hated by the whole democracy Kerensky has fled abandoning you to the Germans to famine to bloody massacres The revolting people have arrested Kerensky s Ministers and you have seen how the order and supplying of Petrograd at once improved Kerensky at the demand of the aristocrat proprietors the capitalists speculators marches against you for the purpose of giving back the land to the land owners and continuing the hated and ruinous war Citizens of Petrograd We know that the great majority of you are in favour of the people s revolutionary authority against the Kornilovtsi led by Kerensky Do not be deceived by the lying declarations of the impotent bourgeois conspirators who will be pitilessly crushed Workers soldiers peasants We call upon you for revolutionary devotion and discipline Millions of peasants and soldiers are with us The victory of the people s Revolution is assured three ACTS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE s COMMISSARS In this book I am giving only such decrees as are in my opinion pertinent to the Bolshevik conquest of power The rest belong to a detailed account of the Structure of the Soviet State for which I have no place in this work This will be dealt with very fully in the second volume now in preparation Kornilov to Brest Litovsk Concerning Dwelling Places one The independent Municipal Self Governments have the right to sequestrate all unoccupied or uninhabited dwelling places two The Municipalities may according to laws and arrangements established by them install in all available lodgings citizens who have no place to live or who live in congested or unhealthy lodgings three The Municipalities may establish a service of inspection of dwelling places organise it and define its powers four The Municipalities may issue orders on the institution of House Committees define their organisation their powers and give them juridical authority five The Municipalities may create Housing Tribunals define their powers and their authority six This decree is promulgated by telegraph People s Commissar of the Interior A I RYKOV On Social Insurance The Russian proletariat has inscribed on its banners the promise of complete Social Insurance of wage workers as well as of the town and village poor The Government of the Tsar the proprietors and the capitalists as well as the Government of coalition and conciliation failed to realise the desires of the workers with regard to Social Insurance The Workers and Peasants Government relying upon the support of the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies announces to the working class of Russia and to the town and village poor that it will immediately prepare laws on Social Insurance based on the formulas proposed by the Labour organisations one Insurance for all wage workers without exception as well as for all urban and rural poor two Insurance to cover all categories of loss of working capacity such as illness infirmities old age childbirth widowhood orphanage and unemployment three All the costs of insurance to be charged to employers four Compensation of at least full wages in all loss of working capacity and unemployment five Complete workers self government of all Insurance institutions In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic The People s Commissar of Labour ALEXANDER SHLIAPNIKOV On Popular Education Citizens of Russia With the insurrection of November seventh the working masses have won for the first time the real power The All Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred this power both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People s Commissars By the will of the revolutionary people I have been appointed People s Commissar of Education The work of guiding in general the people s education inasmuch as it remains with the central government is until the Constituent Assembly meets entrusted to a Commission on the People s Education whose chairman and executive is the People s Commissar Upon what fundamental propositions will rest this State Commission How is its sphere of competence determined The General Line of Educational Activity Every genuinely democratic power must in the domain of education in a country where illiteracy and ignorance reign supreme make its first aim the struggle against this darkness It must acquire in the shortest time universal literacy by organising a network of schools answering to the demands of modern pedagogics it must introduce universal obligatory and free tuition for all and establish at the same time a series of such teachers institutes and seminaries as will in the shortest time furnish a powerful army of people s teachers so necessary for the universal instruction of the population of our boundless Russia Decentralisation The State Commission on People s Education is by no means a central power governing the institutions of instruction and education On the contrary the entire school work ought to be transferred to the organs of local self government The independent work of the workers soldiers and peasants establishing on their own initiative cultural educational organisations must be given full autonomy both by the State centre and the Municipal centres The work of the State Commission serves as a link and helpmate to organise resources of material and moral support to the Municipal and private institutions particularly to those with a class character established by the workers The State Committee on People s Education A whole series of invaluable law projects was elaborated from the beginning of the Revolution by the State Committee for People s Education a tolerably democratic body as to its composition and rich in experts The State Commission sincerely desires the collaboration of this Committee It has addressed itself to the bureau of the Committee with the request at once to convoke an extraordinary session of the Committee for the fulfilment of the following programme one The revision of rules of representation in the Committee in the sense of greater democratisation two The revision of the Committee s rights in the sense of widening them and of converting the Committee into a fundamental State institute for the elaboration of law projects calculated to reorganise public instruction and education in Russia upon democratic principles three The revision jointly with the new State Commission of the laws already created by the Committee a revision required by the fact that in editing them the Committee had to take into account the bourgeois spirit of previous Ministries which obstructed it even in this its narrowed form After this revision these laws will be put into effect without any bureaucratic red tape in the revolutionary order The Pedagogues and the Societists The State Commission welcomes the pedagogues to the bright and honourable work of educating the people the masters of the country No one measure in the domain of the people s education ought to be adopted by any power without the attentive deliberation of those who represent the pedagogues On the other hand a decision cannot by any means be reached exclusively through the cooperation of specialists This refers as well to reforms of the institutes of general education The cooperation of the pedagogues with the social forces this is how the Commission will work both in its own constitution in the State Committee and in all its activities As its first task the Commission considers the improvement of the teachers status and first of all of those very poor though almost most important contributors to the work of culture the elementary school teachers Their just demands ought to be satisfied at once and at any cost The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded an increase of salary to one hundred rubles per month It would be a disgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of the overwhelming majority of the Russian people But a real democracy cannot stop at mere literacy at universal elementary instruction It must endeavour to organise a uniform secular school of several grades The ideal is equal and if possible higher education for all the citizens So long as this idea has not been realised for all the natural transition through all the schooling grades up to the university a transition to a higher stage must depend entirely upon the pupil s aptitude and not upon the resources of his family The problem of a genuinely democratic organisation of instruction is particularly difficult in a country impoverished by a long criminal imperialistic war but the workers who have taken the power must remember that education will serve them as the greatest instrument in their struggle for a better lot and for a spiritual growth However needful it may be to curtail other articles of the people s budget the expenses on education must stand high A large educational budget is the pride and glory of a nation The free and enfranchised peoples of Russia will not forget this The fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to a thorough establishment of school education for children and youths Adults too will be anxious to save themselves from the debasing position of a man who cannot read and write The school for adults must occupy a conspicuous place in the general plan of popular instruction Instruction and Education One must emphasise the difference between instruction and education Instruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the teacher to his pupil Education is a creative process The personality of the individual is being educated throughout life is being formed grows richer in content stronger and more perfect The toiling masses of the people the workmen the peasants the soldiers are thirsting for elementary and advanced instruction But they are also thirsting for education Neither the government nor the intellectuals nor any other power outside of themselves can give it to them The school the book the theatre the museum et cetera may here by only aids They have their own ideas formed by their social position so different from the position of those ruling classes and intellectuals who have hitherto created culture They have their own ideas their own emotions their own ways of approaching the problems of personality and society The city labourer according to his own fashion the rural toiler according to his will each build his clear world conception permeated with the class idea of the workers There is no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of which our nearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants The building by collective Labour of its own general rich and free soul Instruction will surely be an important but not a decisive element What is more important here is the criticism the creativeness of the masses themselves for science and art have only in some of their parts a general human importance They suffer radical changes with every far reaching class upheaval Throughout Russia particularly among the city labourers but also among the peasants a powerful wave of cultural educational movement has arisen workers and soldiers organisations of this kind are multiplying rapidly To meet them to lend them support to clear the road before them is the first task of a revolutionary and popular government in the domain of democratic education The Constituent Assembly will doubtless soon begin its work It alone can permanently establish the order of national and social life in our country and at the same time the general character of the organisation of popular education Now however with the passage of power to the Soviets the really democratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured The line which the State Commission relying upon the State Committee will follow will hardly suffer any modification under the influence of the Constituent Assembly Without pre determining it the new People s Government considers itself within its rights in enacting in this domain a series of measures which aim at enriching and enlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the country The Ministry The present work must in the interim proceed through the Ministry of the People s Education Of all the necessary alterations in its composition and construction the State Commission will have charge elected by the Executive Committee of the Soviets and the State Committee Of course the order of State authority in the domain of the people s education will be established by the Constituent Assembly Until then the Ministry must play the part of the executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the State Commission for People s Education The pledge of the country s safety lies in the cooperation of all its vital and genuinely democratic forces We believe that the energetic effort of the working people and of the honest enlightened intellectuals will lead the country out of its painful crisis and through complete democracy to the reign of Socialism and the brotherhood of nations People s Commissar on Education A V LUNACHARSKY On the Order in Which the Laws Are to be Ratified and Published one Until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly the enacting and publishing of laws shall be carried out in the order decreed by the present Provisional Workmen s and Peasants Government elected by the All Russian Congress of Workers Peasants and Soldiers Deputies two Every bill is presented for consideration of the Government by the respective Ministry signed by the duly authorised People s Commissar or it is presented by the legislative section attached to the Government signed by the chief of the section three After its ratification by the Government the decree in its final edition in the name of the Russian Republic is signed by the president of the Council of People s Commissars or for him by the People s Commissar who presented it for the consideration of the Government and is then published four The date of publishing it in the official Gazette of the Provisional Workmen s and Peasants Government is the date of its becoming law five In the decree there may be appointed a date other than the date of publication on which it shall become law or it may be promulgated by telegraph in which case it is to be regarded in every locality as becoming law upon the publication of the telegram six The promulgation of legislative acts of the government by the State Senate is abolished The Legislative Section attached to the Council of People s Commissars issues periodically a collection of regulations and orders of the government which possess the force of law seven The Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers Peasants and Soldiers Deputies Tsay ee kah has at all times the right to cancel alter or annul any of the Government decrees In the name of the Russian Republic the President of the Council of People s Commissars V ULIANOV LENIN four THE LIQUOR PROBLEM Order Issued by the Military Revolutonary Committee one Until further order the production of alcohol and alcoholic drinks is prohibited two It is ordered to all producers of alcohol and alcoholic drinks to inform not later than on the twenty seventh inst of the exact site of their stores three All culprits against this order will be tried by a Military Revolutionary Court THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE five ORDER NO two From the Committee of the Finland Guard Reserve Regiment to all House Committees and to the citizens of Vasili Ostrov The bourgeoisie has chosen a very sinister method of fighting against the proletariat it has established in various parts of the city huge wine depots and distributes liquor among the soldiers in this manner attempting to sow dissatisfaction in the ranks of the Revolutionary army It is herewith ordered to all house committees that at three o clock the time set for posting this order they shall in person and secretly notify the President of the Committee of the Finland Guard Regiment concerning the amount of wine in their premises Those who violate this order will be arrested and given trial before a merciless court and their property will be confiscated and the stock of wine discovered will be BLOWN UP WITH DYNAMITE two hours after this warning because more lenient measures as experience has shown do not bring the desired results REMEMBER THERE WILL BE NO OTHER WARNING BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS Regimental Committee of the Finland Guard Regiment APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IX one MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE BULLETIN NO two November twelfth in the evening Kerensky sent a proposition to the revolutionary troops to lay down their arms Kerensky s men opened artillery fire Our artillery answered and compelled the enemy to be silent The Cossacks assumed the offensive The deadly fire of the sailors the Red Guards and the soldiers forced the Cossacks to retreat Our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks of the enemy The enemy is fleeing Our troops are in pursuit The order has been given to arrest Kerensky Tsarskoye Selo has been taken by the revolutionary troops The Lettish Riflemen The Military Revolutionary Committee has received precise information that the valiant Lettish Riflemen have arrived from the Front and taken up a position in the rear of Kerensky s bands From the Staff of the Military Revolutionary Committee The seizure of Gatchina and Tsarskoye Selo by Kerensky s detachments is to be explained by the complete absence of artillery and machine guns in these places whereas Kerensky s cavalry was provided with artillery from the beginning The last two days were days of enforced work for our Staff to provide the necessary quantity of guns machine guns field telephones et cetera for the revolutionary troops When this work with the energetic assistance of the District Soviets and the factories the Putilov Works Obukhov and others was accomplished the issue of the expected encounter left no place for doubt on the side of the revolutionary troops there was not only a surplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as Petrograd but also an enormous moral advantage All the Petrograd regiments moved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm The Garrison Conference elected a Control Commission of five soldiers thus securing a complete unity between the commander in chief and the garrison At the Garrison Conference it was unanimously decided to begin decisive action The artillery fire on the twelfth of November developed with extraordinary force by three P M The Cossacks were completely demoralised A parliamentarian came from them to the staff of the detachment at Krasnoye Selo and proposed to stop the firing threatening otherwise to take decisive measures He was answered that the firing would cease when Kerensky laid down his arms In the developing encounter all sections of the troops the sailors soldiers and the Red Guards showed unlimited courage The sailors continued to advance until they had fired all their cartridges The number of casualties has not been established yet but it is larger on the part of the counter revolutionary troops who experienced great losses through one of our armoured cars Kerensky s staff fearing that they would be surrounded gave the order to retreat which retreat speedily assumed a disorderly character By eleven twelve P M Tsarkoye Selo including the wireless station was entirely occupied by the troops of the Soviets The Cossacks retreated towards Gatchina and Colpinno The morale of the troops is beyond all praise The order has been given to pursue the retreating Cossacks From the Tsarskoye Selo station a radio telegram was sent immediately to the Front and to all local Soviets throughout Russia Further details will be communicated two EVENTS OF THE thirteenTH IN PETROGRAD Three regiments of the Petrograd garrison to take any part in the battle against Kerensky On the morning of the thirteenth they summoned to a joint conference sixty delegates from the Front in order to find some way to stop the civil war This conference appointed a committee to go and persuade Kerensky s troops to lay down their arms They proposed to ask the Government soldiers the following questions one Will the soldiers and Cossacks of Kerensky recognise the Tsay ee kah as the repository of Governmental power responsible to the Congress of Soviets two Will the soldiers and Cossacks accept the decrees of the second Congress of Soviets three Will they accept the Land and Peace decrees four Will they agree to cease hostilities and return to their units five Will they consent to the arrest of Kerensky Krasnov and Savinkov At the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet Zinoviev said It would be foolish to think that this committee could finish affair The enemy can only be broken by force However it would be a crime for us not to try every peaceful means to bring the Cossacks over to us What we need is a military victory The news of an armistice is premature Our Staff will be ready to conclude an armistice when the enemy can no longer do any harm At present the influence of our victory is creating new political conditions To day the Socialist Revolutionaries are inclined to admit the Bolsheviki into the new Government A decisive victory is indispensable so that those who hesitate will have no further hesitation At the City Duma all attention was concentrated on the formation of the new Government In many factories and barracks already Revolutionary Tribunals were operating and the Bolsheviki were threatening to set up more of these and try Gotz and Avksentiev before them Dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding the abolition of these Revolutionary Tribunals or the other members of the Conference would immediately break off all negotiations with the Bolsheviki Shingariov Cadet declared that the Municipality ought not to take part in any agreement with the Bolsheviki Any agreement with the maniacs is impossible until they lay down their arms and recognise the authority of independent courts of law Yartsev for the Yedinstvo group declared that any agreement with the Bolsheviki would be equivalent to a Bolshevik victory Mayor Schreider for the Socialist Revolutionaries stated that he was opposed to all agreement with the Bolsheviki As for a Government that ought to spring from the popular will and since the popular will has been expressed in the municipal elections the popular will which can create a Government is actually concentrated in the Duma After other speakers of which only the representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists was in favour of considering the admission of the Bolsheviki into the new Government the Duma voted to continue its representatives in the Vikzhel s conference but to insist upon the restoration of the Provisional Government before everything and to exclude the Bolsheviki from the new power three TRUCE KRASNOV s ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION In answer to your telegram proposing an immediate armistice the Supreme Commander not wishing further futile bloodshed consents to enter into negotiations and to establish relations between the armies of the Government and the insurrectionists He proposes to the General Staff of the insurrectionists to recall its regiments to Petrograd to declare the line Ligovo Pulkovo Colpinno neutral and to allow the advance guards of the Government cavalry to enter Tsarskoye Selo for the purpose of establishing order The answer to this proposal must be placed in the hands of our envoys before eight o clock to morrow morning KRASNOV four EVENTS AT TSARSKOYE SELO On the evening that Kerensky s troops retreated from Tsarskoye Selo some priests organised a religious procession through the streets of the town making speeches to the citizens in which they asked the people to support the rightful authority the Provisional Government When the Cossacks had retreated and the first Red Guards entered the town witnesses reported that the priests had incited the people against the Soviets and had said prayers at the grave of Rasputin which lies behind the Imperial Palace One of the priests Father Ivan Kutchurov was arrested and shot by the infuriated Red Guards Just as the Red Guards entered the town the electric lights were shut off plunging the streets in complete darkness The director of the electric light plant Lubovitch was arrested by the Soviet troops and asked why he had shut off the lights He was found some time later in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in his hand and a bullet hole in his temple The Petrograd anti Bolshevik papers came out next day with headlines Plekhanov s temperature thirty nine degrees Plekhanov lived at Tsarskoye Selo where he was lying ill in bed Red Guards arrived at the house and searched it for arms questioning the old man What class of society do you belong to they asked him I am a revolutionist answered Plekhanov who for forty years has devoted his life to the struggle for liberty Anyway said a workman you have now sold yourself to the bourgeoisie The workers no longer knew Plekhanov pioneer of the Russian Social Democracy five APPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT The detachments at Gatchina deceived by Kerensky have laid down their arms and decided to arrest Kerensky That chief of the counter revolutionary campaign has fled The Army by an enormous majority has pronounced in favour of the second All Russian Congress of Soviets and of the Government which it has created Scores of delegates from the Front have hastened to Petrograd to assure the Soviet Government of the Army s fidelity No twisting of the facts no calumny against the revolutionary workers soldiers and peasants has been able to defeat the People The Workers and Soldiers Revolution is victorious The Tsay ee kah appeals to the troops which march under the flag of the counter revolution and invites them immediately to lay down their arms to shed no longer the blood of their brothers in the interests of a handful of land owners and capitalists The Workers Soldiers and Peasants Revolution curses those who remain even for a moment under the flag of the People s enemies Cossacks Come over to the rank of the victorious People Railwaymen postmen telegraphers all all support the new Government of the People APPENDIX TO CHAPTER X one DAMAGE TO THE KREMLIN I myself verified the damage to the Kremlin which I visited immediately after the bombardment The Little Nicolai Palace a building of no particular importance which was occupied occasionally by receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses had served as barracks for the yunkers It was not only bombarded but pretty well sacked fortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical value Usspensky Cathedral had a shell hole in one of the cupolas but except for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling was undamaged The frescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were badly damaged by a shell Another shell hit the corner of Ivan Veliki Tchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times but only one shell went through a window into the interior the others breaking the brick window moulding and the roof cornices The clock over the Spasskaya Gate was smashed Troitsky Gate was battered but easily reparable One of the lower towers had lost its brick spire The church of saint Basil was untouched as was the great Imperial Palace with all the treasures of Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar and the crown jewels in the Treasury These places were not even entered two LUNATCHARSKY s DECLARATION Comrades You are the young masters of the country and although now you have much to do and think about you must know how to defend your artistic and scientific treasures Comrades That which is happening at Moscow is a horrible irreparable misfortune The People in its struggle for the power has mutilated our glorious capital It is particularly terrible in these days of violent struggle of destructive warfare to be Commissar of Public Education Only the hope of the victory of Socialism the source of a new and superior culture brings me comfort On me weighs the responsibility of protecting the artistic wealth of the people Not being able to remain at my post where I had no influence I resigned My comrades the other Commissars considered this resignation inadmissible I shall therefore remain at my post And moreover I understand that the damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has been reported But I beg you comrades to give me your support Preserve for yourselves and your descendants the beauty of our land be the guardians of the property of the People Soon very soon even the most ignorant who have been held in ignorance so long will awake and understand what a source of joy strength and wisdom is art three QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE

CHAPTER XI one LIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTER This chapter extends over a period of two months more or less It covers the time of negotiations with the Allies the negotiations and armistice with the Germans and the beginning of the Peace negotiations at Brest Litovsk as well as the period in which were laid the foundations of the Soviet State However it is no part of my purpose in this book to describe and interpret these very important historical events which require more space They are therefore reserved for another volume Kornilov to Brest Litovsk In this chapter then I have confined myself to the Soviet Government s attempts to consolidate its political power at home and sketched its successive conquests of hostile domestic elements which process was temporarily interrupted by the disastrous Peace of Brest Litovsk two PREAMBLE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA The October Revolution of the workers and peasants began under the common banner of Emancipation The peasants are being emancipated from the power of the landowners for there is no longer the landowner s property right in the land it has been abolished The soldiers and sailors are being emancipated from the power of autocratic generals for generals will henceforth be elective and subject to recall The workingmen are being emancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists for henceforth there will be established the control of the workers over mills and factories Everything living and capable of life is being emancipated from the hateful shackles There remain only the peoples of Russia who have suffered and are suffering oppression and arbitrariness and whose emancipation must immediately be begun whose liberation must be effected resolutely and definitely During the period of Tsarism the peoples of Russia were systematically incited against one another The result of such a policy are known massacres and pogroms on the one hand slavery of peoples on the other There can be and there must be no return to this disgraceful policy Henceforth the policy of a voluntary and honest union of the peoples of Russia must be substituted In the period of imperialism after the March revolution when the power was transferred into the hands of the Cadet bourgeoisie the naked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust of the peoples of Russia to a policy of fault finding of meaningless freedom and equality of peoples The results of such a policy are known the growth of national enmity the impairment of mutual confidence An end must be put to this unworthy policy of falsehood and distrust of fault finding and provocation Henceforth it must be replaced by an open and honest policy leading to the complete mutual confidence of the peoples of Russia Only as the result of such a trust can there be formed an honest and lasting union of the peoples of Russia Only as the result of such a union can the workers and peasants of the peoples of Russia be cemented into one revolutionary force able to resist all attempts on the part of the imperialist annexationist bourgeoisie three DECREES On the Nationalisation of the Banks In the interest of the regular organisation of the national economy of the thorough eradication of bank speculation and the complete emancipation of the workers peasants and the whole labouring population from the exploitation of banking capital and with a view to the establishment of a single national bank of the Russian Republic which shall serve the real interests of the people and the poorer classes the Central Executive Committee Tsay ee kah resolves one The banking business is declared a state monopoly two All existing private joint stock banks and banking offices are merged in the State Bank three The assets and liabilities of the liquidated establishments are taken over by the State Bank four The order of the merger of private banks in the State Bank is to be determined by a special decree five The temporary administration of the affairs of the private banks is entrusted to the board of the State Bank six The interests of the small depositors will be safeguarded On the Equality of Rank of All Military Men In realisation of the will of the revolutionary people regarding the prompt and decisive abolition of all remnants of former inequality in the Army the Council of People s Commissars decrees one All ranks and grades in the Army beginning with the rank of Corporal and ending with the rank of General are abolished The Army of the Russian Republic consists now of free and equal citizens bearing the honourable title of Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army two All privileges connected with the former ranks and grades also all outward marks of distinction are abolished three All addressing by titles is abolished four All decorations orders and other marks of distinction are abolished five With the abolition of the rank of officer all

limits of military units and combinations is vested in the respective Soldiers Committees and Soviets three Those phases of the life and activity of the troops which are already under the jurisdiction

the immediate peace of the Bolsheviki reminds us of a joyous moving picture film Neratov runs Trotzky pursues Neratov climbs a wall Trotzky too Neratov dives into the water Trotzky follows Neratov climbs onto the roof Trotzky right behind him Neratov hides under the bed and Trotzky has him He has him Naturally peace is immediately signed All is empty and silent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs The couriers are respectful but their faces wear a caustic expression How about arresting an ambassador and signing an armistice or a Peace Treaty with him But they are strange folk these ambassadors They keep silent just as if they had heard nothing Hola hola England France Germany We have signed an armistice with you Is it possible that you know nothing about it Nevertheless it has been published in all the papers and posted on all the walls On a Bolshevik s word of honour Peace has been signed We re not asking much of you you just have to write two words The ambassadors remain silent The Powers remain silent All is empty and silent in the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Listen says Robespierre Trotzky to his assistant Marat Uritzky run over to the British Ambassador s tell him we re proposing peace Go yourself says Marat Uritzky He s not receiving Telephone him then I ve tried The receiver s off the hook Send him a telegram I did Well with what result Marat Uritzky sighs and does not answer Robespierre Trotzky spits furiously into the corner Listen Marat recommences Trotzky after a moment We must absolutely show that we re conducting an active foreign policy How can we do that Launch another decree about arresting Neratov answers Uritzky with a profound air Marat you re a blockhead cries Trotzky All of a sudden he arises terrible and majestic looking at this moment like Robespierre Write Uritzky he says with severity Write a letter to the British ambassador a registered letter with receipt demanded Write I also will write The peoples of the world await an immediate peace In the enormous and empty Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to be heard only the sound of two typewriters With his own hands Trotzky is conducting an active foreign policy six ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENT To the Attention of All Workers and All Soldiers November eleventh in the club of the Preobrazhensky Regiment was held an extraordinary meeting of representatives of all the units of the Petrograd garrison The meeting was called upon the initiative of the Preobrazhensky and Semionovsky Regiments for the discussion of the question as to which Socialist parties are for the power of the Soviets which are against which are for the people which against and if an agreement between them is possible The representatives of the Tsay ee kah of the Municipal Duma of the Avksentiev Peasants Soviets and of all the political parties from the Bolsheviki to the Populist Socialists were invited to the meeting After long deliberation having heard the declarations of all parties and organisations the meeting by a tremendous majority of votes agreed that only the Bolsheviki and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries are for the people and that all the other parties are only attempting under cover of seeking an agreement to deprive the people of the conquests won in the days of the great Workers and Peasants Revolution of November Here is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of the Petrograd garrison by sixty one votes against eleven and twelve not voting The garrison conference summoned at the initiative of the Semionovsky and Preobrazhensky Regiments on hearing the representatives of all the Socialist parties and popular organisations on the question of an agreement between the different political parties finds that one The representatives of the Tasy ee kah the representatives of the Bolshevik party and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared definitely that they stand for a Government of the Soviets for the decrees on Land Peace and Workers Control of Industry and that upon this platform they are willing to agree with all the Socialist parties two At the same time the representatives of the other parties Mensheviki Socialist Revolutionaries either gave no answer at all or declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the Soviets and against the decrees on Land Peace and Workers Control In view of this the meeting resolves one To express severe censure of all parties which under cover of an agreement wish practically to annul the popular conquests of the Revolution of November two To express full confidence in the Tsay ee kah and the Council of People s Commissars and to promise them complete support At the same time the meeting deems it necessary that the comrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries should enter the People s Government seven WINE POGROMS It was afterward discovered that there was a regular organisation maintained by the Cadets for provoking rioting among the soldiers There would be telephone messages to the different barracks announcing that wine was being given away at such and such an address and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an individual would point out the location of the cellar The Council of People s Commissars appointed a Commissar for the Fight Against Drunkenness who besides mercilessly putting down the wine riots destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor The Winter Palace cellars containing rare vintages valued at more than five million dollars were at first flooded and then the liquor was removed to Cronstadt and destroyed In this work the Cronstadt sailors flower and pride of the revolutionary forces as Trotzky called them acquitted themselves with iron self dicipline eight SPECULATORS Two orders concerning them Council of People s Commissars To the Military Revolutionary Committee The disorganisation of the food supply created by the war and the lack of system is becoming to the last degree acute thanks to the speculators marauders and their followers on the railways in the steamship offices forwarding offices et cetera Taking advantage of the nation s greatest misfortunes these criminal spoliators are playing with the health and life of millions of soldiers and workers for their own benefit Such a situation cannot be borne a single day longer The Council of People s Commissars proposes to the Military Revolutionary Committee to take the most decisive measures towards the uprooting of speculation sabotage hiding of supplies fraudulent detention of cargoes et cetera All persons guilty of

speculators and marauders THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE Petrograd Dec twod nineteen seventeen nine PURISHKEVITCH s LETTER TO KALEDIN The situation at Petrograd is desperate The city is cut off from the outside world and is entirely in the power of the Bolsheviki People are arrested in the streets thrown into the Neva drowned and imprisoned without any charge Even Burtzev is shut up in Peter Paul fortress under strict guard The organisation at whose head I am is working without rest to unite all the officers and what is left of the yunker schools and to arm them The situation cannot be saved except by creating regiments of officers and yunkers Attacking with these regiments and having gained a first success we could later gain the aid of the garrison troops but without that first success it is impossible to count on a single soldier because thousands of them are divided and terrorised by the scum which exists in every regiment Most of the Cossacks are tainted by Bolshevik propaganda thanks to the strange policy of General Dutov who allowed to pass the moment when by decisive action something could have been obtained The policy of negotiations and concessions has borne its fruits all that is respectable is persecuted and it is the plebe and the criminals who dominate and nothing can be done except by shooting and hanging them We are awaiting you here General and at the moment of your arrival we shall advance with all the forces at our disposal But for that we must establish some communication with you and before all clear up the following points one Do you know that in your name all officers who could take part in the fight are being invited to leave Petrograd on the pretext of joining you two About when can we count on your arrival at Petrograd We should like to know in order to coordinate our actions In spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious people here which allowed the yoke of Bolshevism to be laid upon us in spite of the extraordinary pig headedness of the majority of officers so difficult to organise we believe in spite of all that Truth is on our side and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forces who say that they are acting for motives of love of country and in order to save it Whatever comes we shall not permit ourselves to be struck down and shall remain firm until the end Purishkevitch being brought to trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal was given a short prison term ten DECREE ON THE MONOPOLY OF ADVERTISEMENTS one The printing of advertisements in newspapers books bill boards kiosks in offices and

won at Petrograd at Moscow From the Front and the villages arrive every day every hour greetings to the new Government The victory of the Revolution is assured seeing that it is sustained by the majority of the people It is entirely understandable that the proprietors and the capitalists the employees and functionaries closely allied with the bourgeoisic in a word all the rich and all those who join hands with them regard the new Revolution with hostility oppose its success threaten to halt the activity of the banks and sabotage or obstruct the work of other establishments Every conscious worker understands perfectly that we cannot avoid this hostility because the high officials have set themselves against the People and do not wish to abandon their posts without resistance But the working classes are not for one moment afraid of that resistance The majority of the people are for us For us are the majority of the workers and the oppressed of the whole world We have justice on our side Our ultimate victory is certain The resistance of the capitalists and high officials will be broken No one will be deprived of his property without a special law on the nationalisation of banks and financial syndicates This law is in preparation Not a worker will lose a single kopek on the contrary he will be assisted Without at this moment establishing the new taxes the new Government considers one of its primary duties to make a severe accounting and control on the reception of taxes decreed by the former regime Comrades workers Remember that you yourselves direct the Government No one will help you unless you organise yourselves and take into your own hands the affairs of the State Your Soviets are now the organs of governmental power Strengthen them establish a severe revolutionary control pitilessly crush the attempts at anarchy on the part of drunkards brigands counter revolutionary yunkers and Kornilovists Establish a strict control over production and the accounting for products Arrest and turn over to the Revolutionary Tribunal of the People every one who injures the property of the People by sabotage in production by concealment of grain reserves reserves of other products by retarding the shipments of grain by bringing confusion into the railroads the posts and the telegraphs or in general opposing the great work of bringing Peace and transferring the Land to the peasants Comrades workers soldiers peasants all toilers Take immediately all local power into your hands Little by little with the consent of the majority of peasants we shall march firmly and unhesitatingly toward the victory of Socialism which will fortify the advance guards of the working class of the most civilised Countries and give to the peoples an enduring peace and free them from every slavery and every exploitation thirteen To All Workers of Petrograd Comrades The Revolution is winning the revolution has won All the power has passed over to our Soviets The first weeks are the most difficult ones The broken reaction must be finally crushed a full triumph must be secured to our endeavours The working class ought to must show in these days THE GREATEST FIRMNESS AND ENDURANCE in order to facilitate the execution of all the aims of the new People s Government of Soviets In the next few days decrees on the Labour question will be issued

Committees fourteen APPEALS AND COUNTER APPEALS From the Employees of the State and private Banks To the Population of Petrograd Comrades workers soldiers and citizens The Military Revolutionary Committee in an extraordinary notice is accusing the workers of the State and private banking and other institutions of impeding the work of the Government directed towards the ensuring of the Front with provisions Comrades and citizens do not believe this calumny brought against us who are part of the general army of labour However difficult it be for us to work under the constant threat of interference by acts of violence in our hard working life however depressing it be to know that our Country and the Revolution are on the verge of ruin we nevertheless all of us from the highest to the lowest employees artelshtchiki counters labourers couriers et cetera are continuing to fulfil our duties which are connected with the ensuring of provisions and munitions to the Front and country Counting upon your lack of information comrades workers and soldiers in questions of finance and banking you are being incited against workers like yourselves because it is desirable to divert the responsibility for the starving and dying brother soldiers at the Front from the guilty persons to the innocent workers who are accomplishing their duty under the burden of general poverty and disorganisation REMEMBER WORKERS AND SOLDIERS THE EMPLOYEES HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR AND WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE TOILING PEOPLE PART OF WHICH THEY ARE THEMSELVES AND NOT A SINGLE KOPEK NECESSARY FOR THE FRONT AND THE WORKERS HAS EVER BEEN DETAINED AND WILL NOT BE DETAINED BY THE EMPLOYEES From November sixth to November twenty threed i e during seventeen days five hundred million rubles were dispatched to the Front and one hundred twenty millions to Moscow besides the sums sent to other towns Keeping guard over the wealth of the people the master of which can be only the Constituent Assembly representing the whole nation the employees refuse to give out money for purposes which are unknown to them DO NOT BELIEVE THE CALUMNIATORS CALLING YOU TO TAKE THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS Central Board of the All Russian Union of Employees of the State Bank Central Board of the All Russian Trade Union of Employees of Credit Institutions To the Population of Petrograd CITIZENS Do not believe the falsehood which irresponsible people are trying to suggest to you by spreading terrible calumnies against the employees of the Ministry of Supplies and the workers in other Supply organisations who are labouring in these dark days for the salvation of Russia Citizens In posted placards you are called upon to lynch us we are accused falsely of sabotage and strikes we are blamed for all the woes and misfortunes that the people are suffering although we have been striving indefatigably and uninterruptedly and are still striving to save the Russian people from the horrors of starvation Notwithstanding all that we are bearing as citizens of unhappy Russia we have not for one hour abandoned our heavy and responsible work of supplying the Army and population with provisions The image of the Army cold and hungry saving our very existence by its blood and its tortures does not leave us for a single moment Citizens If we have survived the blackest days in the life and history of our people if we have succeeded in preventing famine in Petrograd if we have managed to procure to the suffering army bread and forage by means of enormous almost superhuman efforts it is because we have honestly continued and are still continuing to do our work To the last warning of the usurpers of the power we reply It is not for you who are leading the country to ruin to threaten us who are doing all we can not to allow the country to perish We are not afraid of threats before us stands the sacred image of tortured Russia We will continue our work of supplying the Army and the people with bread to our last efforts so long as you will not prevent us from accomplishing our duty to our country In the contrary case the Army and the people will stand before the horrors of famine but the responsibility therefor belongs to the perpetrators of violence Executive Committee of the Employees of the Ministry of Supplies To the Tchinovniki Government Officials It is notified hereby that all officials and persons who have quitted the service in Government and public institutions or have been dismissed for sabotage or for having failed to report for work on the day fixed and who have nevertheless received their salary paid in advance for the time they have not served are bound to return such salary not later than on November twenty seventh nineteen seventeen to those institutions where they were in service In the event of this not being done these persons will be rendered answerable for stealing the Treasury s property and tried by the Military Revolutionary Court The Military Revolutionary Committee December seventh nineteen seventeen From the Special Board for the Supplies CITIZENS The conditions of our work for the supplying of Petrograd are getting more and more difficult every day The interference with our work which is so ruinous to our business of the Commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee is still continuing THEIR ARBITRARY ACTS their annulling of our orders MAY LEAD TO A CATASTROPHE Seals have been affixed to one of the cold storages where the meat and butter destined for the population are kept and we cannot regulate the temperature SO THAT THE PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE SPOILT One carload of potatoes and one carload of cabbages have been seized and carried away no one knows where to Cargoes which are not liable to requisition khalva are requisitioned by the Commissars and as was the case one day five boxes of khalva were seized by the Commissar for his own use WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO DISPOSE OF OUR STORAGES where the self appointed Commissars do not allow the cargoes to be taken out and terrorise our employees threatening them with arrest ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN PETROGRAD IS KNOWN IN THE PROVINCES AND FROM THE DON FROM SIBERIA FROM VORONEZH AND OTHER PLACES PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO SEND FLOUR AND BREAD THIS CANNOT GO ON MUCH LONGER The work is simply falling out of our hands OUR DUTY is to let the population know of this To the last possibility we will remain on guard of the interests of the population WE WILL DO EVERYTHING TO AVOID THE ONCOMING FAMINE BUT IF UNDER THESE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS

sixteen FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE s COMMISSARS TO THE TOILING COSSACKS Brothers Cossacks You are being deceived You are being incited against the People You are told that the Soviets of Workers Soldiers and Peasants Deputies are your enemies that they want to take away your Cossack land your Cossack liberty Don t believe it Cossacks Your own Generals and landowners are deceiving you in order to keep you in darkness and slavery We the Council of People s Commissars address ourselves to you Cossacks with these words Read them attentively and judge yourselves which is the truth and which is cruel deceit The life and service of a Cossack were always bondage and penal servitude At the first call of the authorities a Cossack always had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign All his military equipment a Cossack had to provide with his own hardly earned means A Cossack is on service his farm is going to rack and ruin Is such a condition fair No it must be altered for ever THE COSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE The new People s Soviet power is willing to come to the assistance of the toiling Cossacks It is only necessary that the Cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish the old order that they should refuse submission to their slave driver officers land owners rich men that they should throw off the cursed yoke from their necks Arise Cossacks Unite The Council of People s Commissars calls upon you to enter a new fresh more happy life In November and December in Petrograd there were All Russian Congresses of Soviets of Soldiers Workers and Peasants Deputies These Congresses transferred all the authority in the different localities into the hands of the Soviets i e into the hands of men elected by the People From now on there must be in Russia no rulers or functionaries who command the People from above and drive them The People create the authority themselves A General has no more rights than a soldier All are equal Consider Cossacks is this wrong or right We are calling upon you Cossacks to join this new order and to create your own Soviets of Cossacks Deputies To such Soviets all the power must belong in the different localities Not to hetmans with the rank of General but to the elected representatives of the toiling Cossacks to your own trustworthy reliable men The All Russian Congresses of Soldiers Workers and Peasants Deputies have passed a resolution to transfer all landowners land into the possession of the toiling people Is not that fair Cossacks The Kornilovs Kaledins Dutovs Karaulovs Bardizhes all defend with their whole souls the interests of the rich men and they are ready to drown Russia in blood if only the lands remain in the hands of the landowners But you the toiling Cossacks do not you suffer yourselves from poverty oppression and lack of land How many Cossacks are there who have more than four five dessiatins per head But the landowners who have thousands of dessiatins of their own land wish besides to get into their hands the lands of the Cossack Army According to the new Soviet laws the lands of Cossack landowners must pass without compensation into the hands of the Cossack workers the poorer Cossacks You are being told that the Soviets wish to take away your lands from you Who is frightening you The rich Cossacks who know that the Soviet AUTHORITY WISHES TO transfer the landowners lands to you Choose then Cossacks for whom will you stand for the Kornilovs and Kaledins for the Generals and rich men or for the Soviets of Peasants Soldiers Workers and Cossacks Deputies THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE s COMMISSARS elected by the All Russian Congress HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND AN HONOURABLE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION All the capitalists landowners Generals Kornilovists have risen against the peaceful policy of the Soviets The war was bringing them profits power distinctions And to you Cossack privates You were perishing without reason without purpose like your brothers soldiers and sailors It will soon be three years and a half that this accursed war has gone on a war devised by the capitalists and landowners of all countries for their own profit their world robberies To the toiling Cossacks the war has only brought ruin and death The war has drained all the resources from Cossack farm life The only salvation for the whole of our country and for the Cossacks in particular is a prompt and honest peace The Council of People s Commissars has declared to all Governments and peoples We do not want other people s property and we do not wish to give away our own Peace without annexations and without indemnities Every nation must decide its own fate There must be no oppressing of one nation by another Such is the honest democratic People s peace which the Council of People s Commissars is proposing to all Governments to all peoples allies and enemies And the results are visible ON THE RUSSIAN FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED The soldier s and the Cossack s blood is not flowing there any more Now Cossacks decide do you wish to continue this ruinous senseless criminal slaughter Then support the Cadets the enemies of the people support Tchernov Tseretelli Skobeliev who drove you into the offensive of July first support Kornilov who introduced capital punishment for soldiers and Cossacks at the front BUT IF YOU WISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE SOVIETS AND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE s COMMISSARS Your fate Cossacks lies in your own hands Our common foes the landowners capitalists officers Kornilovists bourgeois newspapers are deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin In Orenburg Dutov has arrested the Soviet and disarmed the garrison Kaledin is threatening the Soviets in the province of the Don He has declared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling his troops Karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the Caucasus The Cadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions Their common aim is to suppress the People s Soviets to crush the workers and peasants to introduce again the discipline of the whip in the army and to eternalise the bondage of the toiling Cossacks Our revolutionary troops are moving to the Don and the Ural in order to put an end to this criminal revolt against the people The commanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not to enter into any negotiations with the mutinous Generals to act decisively and mercilessly Cossacks On you depends now whether your brothers blood is to flow still We are holding out our hand to you Join the whole people against its enemies Declare Kaledin Kornilov Dutov Karaulov and all their aiders and abettors to be the enemies of the people traitors and betrayers Arrest them with your own forces and turn them over into the hands of the Soviet authority which will judge them in open and public Revolutionary Tribunal Cossacks Form Soviets of Cossacks Deputies Take into your toil worn hands the management of all the affairs of the Cossacks Take away the lands of your own wealthy landowners Take over their grain their inventoried property and live stock for the cultivation of the lands of the toiling Cossacks who are ruined by the war Forward Cossacks to the fight for the common cause of the people Long live the toiling Cossacks Long live the union of the Cossacks the soldiers peasants and workers Long live the power of the Soviets of Cossacks Soldiers Workers and Peasants Deputies Down with the war Down with the landowners and the Kornilovist Generals Long live Peace and the Brotherhood of peoples Council of People s Commissars seventeen FROM THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL CITY

note of the Allied military Attaches to General Dukhonin are too voluminous to give here Moreover they belong to another phase of the history of the Soviet Republic with which this book has nothing to do the foreign relations of the Soviet Government This I treat at length in the next volume Kornilov to Brest Litovsk nineteen APPEALS TO THE FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN The struggle for peace has met with the resistance of the bourgeoisie and the counter revolutionary Generals From the accounts in the newspapers at the Stavka of former Supreme Commander Dukhonin are gathering the agents and allies of the bourgeoisie Verkhovski Avksentiev Tchernov Gotz Tseretelli et cetera It seems even that they want to form a new power against the Soviets Comrades soldiers All the persons we have mentioned have been Ministers already They have acted in accord with Kerensky and the bourgeoisie They are responsible for the offensive of July first and for the prolongation of the war They promised the land to the peasants and then arrested the Land Committees They reestablished capital punishment for soldiers They obey the orders of French English and American financiers General Dukhonin for having refused to obey orders of the Council of People s Commissars has been dismissed from his position as Supreme Commander For answer he is circulating among the troops the note from the Military Attaches of the
