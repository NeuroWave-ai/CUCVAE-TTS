none	none	 I received on the ninth your letters of September twenty ninth October two seven ten twelve seventeenth November fifth eighth to the twenty fourth and I am truly sensible of all your kindness and affectionate regard for me which I am sure is reciprocal in every respect from your own Nelson If that Lady Bitch knew of that person s coming to her house it was a trick but which I hope you will not subject yourself to again But I do not like it However it is passed and we must have confidence in each other and my dearest Emma judging of you by myself it is not all the world that could seduce me in thought word or deed from all my soul holds most dear Indeed if I can help it I never intend to go out of the ship but to the shore of Portsmouth and that will be if it pleases God before next Christmas Indeed I think long before if the French will venture to sea I send you a letter from the Queen of Naples They call out might and main for our protection and God knows they are sure of me mister Elliot complains heavily of the expence and says he will retire the moment it is peace He expected his family when they would sit down eleven Elliots If

none	none	you are to mind all the reports you may hear you may always be angry with your Nelson In the first place instead of eight days mister Acourt he came on board one day just before dinner and left me next morning after breakfast What pleasure people can have in telling lies But I care not what they say I defy them all You may safely rely that I can for ever repeat with truth these words for ever I love you and only you my Emma and you may be assured as long as you are the same to me that you are never absent a moment from my thoughts I am glad you are going to Merton you will live much more comfortable and much cheaper than in London and this spring if you like to have the house altered you can do it But I fancy you will soon tire of so much dirt and the inconvenience will be very great the whole summer All I request if you fix to have it done is that mister Davison s architect who drew the plan may have the inspection and he must take care that it does not exceed the estimate If it is done by contract you must not alter or a bill is run up much worse than if we had never contracted Therefore I must either buy the materials and employ respectable workmen under the architect or contract I rather believe it would be better for me to buy the materials and put out the building to a workman but you must get some good advice With respect to the new entrance LETTER XLI Victory March fourteenth eighteen oh four off Toulon Young Faddy my Dearest Emma brought me two days ago your dear and most kind letter of November twenty sixth and you are sure that I shall take a very early opportunity of promoting him and he appears to be grown a fine young man but vacancies do not happen very frequently in this station However if he behaves well he may be sure of me With respect to mister Jefferson I can neither say nor do any thing The surgeon of the Victory is a very able excellent man and the ship is kept in the most perfect state of health and I would not if I could but thank God I cannot do such an unjust act as to remove him He is my own asking for and I have every reason to be perfectly content mister Jefferson got on by my help and by his own misconduct he got out of a good employ and has seen another person at Malta hospital put over his head He must now begin again and act with much more attention and sobriety than he has done to ever get forward again but time may do much and I shall rejoice to hear of his reformation I am not surprised my dearest Emma at the enormous expences of the watering place but if it has done my own Emma service it is well laid out A thousand pounds a year will not go far and we need be great economists to make both ends meet and to carry on the little improvements As for making one farthing more prize money I do not expect it except by taking the French fleet and the event of that day who can foresee With respect to missus Graefer what she has done God and herself knows but I have made up my mind that Gibbs will propose an hundred pounds a year for her if so I shall grant it and have done I send you missus Graefer s last letter Whilst I am upon the subject of Bronte I have one word more and your good dear kind heart must not think that I shall die one hour the sooner on the contrary my mind has been more content ever since I have done I have left you a part of the rental of Bronte to be first paid every half year and in advance It is but common justice and whether mister Addington gives you any thing or not you will want it I would not have you lay out more than is necessary at Merton The rooms and the new entrance will take a good deal of money The entrance by the corner I would have certainly done a common white gate will do for the present and one of the cottages which is in the barn can be put up as a temporary lodge The road can be made to a temporary bridge for that part of the Nile one day shall be filled up Downing s canvas awning will do for a passage For the winter the carriage can be put in the barn and giving up mister Bennett s premises will save fifty pounds a year and another year we can fit up the coach house and stables which are in the barn The foot path should be turned I did shew mister Haslewood the way I wished it done and mister will have no objections if we make it better than ever it has been and I also beg as my dear Horatia is to be at Merton that a strong netting about three feet high may be placed round the Nile that the little thing may not tumble in and then you may have ducks again in it I forget at what place we saw the netting and either mister Perry or mister Goldsmid told us where it was to be bought I shall be very anxious until I know this is done I have had no very late opportunities of sending to Naples but via Malta I wrote to Gibbs to desire he would send over and purchase the amorins They will arrive in time I hope the watch is arrived safe The British Fair cutter I hope is arrived safe She has three packets from me to England The expences of the alterations at Merton you are not to pay from the income Let it all be put to a separate account and I will provide a fund for the payment All I long for just now is to hear that you are perfectly recovered and then I care for nothing all my hopes are to see you and be happy at dear Merton again but I fear this miscarriage of Pichegru s in France will prolong the war It has kept the French fleet in port which we are all sorry for Sir William Bolton was on board yesterday He looks thin The fag in a brig is very great and I see no prospect of his either making prize money or being made post at present but I shall omit no opportunity I wrote to missus Bolton a few months ago and gave her letter yesterday to Bolton He conducts himself very well indeed Ever my dearest Emma for ever I am your most faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE Although I cannot well afford it yet I could not bear that poor blind missus Nelson should be in want in her old days and sell her plate therefore if you will find out what are her debts if they come within my power I will certainly pay them Many I dare say if they had commanded here would have made money but I can assure you for prizes taken within the Mediterranean I have not more than paid my expences However I would rather pinch myself than she poor soul should want Your good angelic heart my dearest beloved Emma will fully agree with me every thing is very expensive and even we find it and will be obliged to economise if we assist our friends and I am sure we should feel more comfort in it than in loaded tables and entertaining a set of people who care not for us An account is this moment brought me that a small sum is payable to me for some neutral taken off Cadiz in May eighteen hundred so that I shall not be poorer for my gift It is odd is it not I shall when I come home settle four thousand pounds in trustees hands for Horatia for I will not put it in my own power to have her left destitute for she would want friends if we left her in this world She shall be independent of any smiles or frowns I am glad you are going to take her home and if you will take the trouble with Eliza and Ann I am the very last to object Tom I shall certainly assist at college and I am sure the Doctor expects that I should do the same for Horace but I must make my arrangements so as not to run in debt April ninth I have wrote to the Duke but by your account I fear he is not alive I write because you wish me and because I like the Duke and hope he will leave you some money But for myself I can have no right to expect a farthing nor would I be a legacy hunter for the world I never knew any good come from it I send you a letter from mister Falconet I am afraid they have made a jumble about the amorins And I send you a very impertinent letter from that old cat I have sent her a very dry answer and told her I should send the sweetmeats to you I always hated the old bitch But was she young and as beautiful as an angel I am engaged I am all soul and body my Emmas nor would I change her for all this world could give me I would not have Horatia think of a dog I shall not bring her one and I am sure she is better without a pet of that sort But she is like her mother would get all the old dogs in the place about her April fourteenth I am so sea sick that I cannot write another line except to say God Almighty bless you my dearest beloved Emma prays ever your faithful NELSON BRONTE LETTER XLII Victory April twod eighteen oh four I have my Dearest Beloved Emma been so uneasy for this last month desiring most ardently to hear of your well doing Captain Capel brought me your letters sent by the Thisbe from Gibraltar I opened opened found none but December and early in January I was in such an agitation At last I found one without a date which thank God told my poor heart that you was recovering but that dear little Emma was no more and that Horatia had been so very ill it all together upset me But it was just at bed time and I had time to reflect and be thankful to God for sparing you and our dear Horatia I am sure the loss of one much more both would have drove me mad I was so agitated as it was that I was glad it was night and that I could be by myself Kiss dear Horatia for me and tell her to be a dutiful and good child and if she is that we shall always love her You may if you like tell missus G that I shall certainly settle a small pension on her It shall not be large as we may have the pleasure of making her little presents and my dearest Emma I shall not be wanting to every body who has been kind to you be they servants or gentlefolks Admiral Lutwidge is a good man and I like missus Lutwidge and shall always more because she is fond of you Never mind the great Bashaw at the Priory He be damned If he was single and had a mind to marry you he could only make you a Marchioness but as he is situated and I situated I can make you a Duchess and if it pleases God that time may arrive Amen Amen As for your friend Lady H she is in her way as great a pimp as any of them What a set But if they manage their own intrigues is not that enough I am sure neither you or I care what they do much less envy them their chere amies As for Lord S and the other I care nothing about them for I have every reason by my own feelings towards you to think you care only for your Nelson I have not heard of your receiving the little box from Naples bracelets I fancy but I did not open them I wish the amorins may come in time for the conveyance of Captain Layman who has most unfortunately lost his sloop he is strongly recommended by the governor and garrison of Gibraltar But perhaps he may not be able to obtain it We have such reports about the King s health that the present ministry may be out and for what I know or care another set may be no better for you or me As for the Admiralty let who will be in they can neither do me any great good or harm they may vex me a little but that will recoil upon themselves I hope however they will confirm Captain Layman for he is attached not only to me but is a very active officer But it was his venturing to know more about India than Troubridge that made them look shy upon him and his tongue runs too fast I often tell him not to let his tongue run so fast or his pen write so much LETTER XLIII Victory off Toulon April tenth eighteen oh four MY DEAREST EMMA I have received all your truly kind and affectionate letters to January twenty fifth by the Thisbe and last night your letter of January thirteenth by Naples The amorins will go under the care of Captain Layman who unfortunately lost his sloop but with much credit to himself he has been acquitted of all blame I rejoice that dear Horatia is got well and also that you my dearest Emma are recovered of your severe indisposition In our present situation with Spain this letter probably may never reach you I have wrote fully and intend to send them by the Argus who I expect to join every minute Elphi Bey I hear has had all his fine things taken from him He escaped into the Desert and is pursued probably his head is off long before this time The French fleet came out on the fifth but went in again the next morning Yesterday a Rear Admiral and seven sail of ships including frigates put their nose outside the harbour If they go on playing this game some day we shall lay salt upon their tails and so end the campaign of my dearest Emma your most faithful and affectionate I am glad to hear that you are going to take my dear Horatia to educate her She must turn out an angel if she minds what you say to her and Eliza and Ann will never forget your goodness My health is so so I shall get through the summer and in the winter shall go home You will readily fancy all I would say and do think My kind love to all friends LETTER XLIV Victory April nineteenth eighteen oh four MY DEAREST EMMA I had wrote you a line intended for the Swift cutter but instead of her joining me I had the mortification not only to hear that she was taken but that all the dispatches and letters had fallen into the hands of the enemy a very pretty piece of work I am not surprised at the capture but am very much so that any dispatches should be sent in a vessel with twenty three men not equal to cope with any row boat privateer As I do not know what letters of your s are in her I cannot guess what will be said I suppose there will be a publication The loss of the Hindostan was great enough but for importance it is lost in comparison to the probable knowledge the enemy will obtain of our connections with foreign countries Foreigners for ever say and it is true We dare not trust England one way or other we are sure to be committed However it is now too late to launch out on this subject Not a thing has been saved out of the Hindostan not a second shirt for any one and it has been by extraordinary exertions that the people s lives were saved Captain Hallowell is so good as to take home for me wine as by the inclosed list and if I can some honey The Spanish honey is so precious that if any one has a cut or sore throat it is used to cure it I mention this in case you should wish to give the Duke a jar The smell is wonderful It is to be produced no where but in the mountains near Rosas The Cyprus wine one hogshead was for Buonaparte I would recommend the wine cooper drawing it off and you can send a few dozens to the Duke who I know takes a glass every day at two o clock I wish I had any thing else to send you but my dearest Emma you must take the will for the deed I am pleased with Charlotte s letter and as she loves my dear Horatia I shall always like her What hearts those must have who do not But thank God she shall not be dependent on any of them Your letter of February twelfth through mister Falconet I have received I know they are all read therefore never sign your name I shall continue to write through Spain but never say a word that can convey any information except of eternal attachment and affection for you and that I care not who knows for I am for ever and ever your only your NELSON BRONTE Poor Captain Le Gros had your note to him in his pocket book and that was all he saved mister Este left him at Gibraltar and went to Malta in the Thisbe Captain Le Gros is now trying I think it will turn out that every person is obliged to his conduct for saving their lives She took fire thirteen leagues from the land LETTER XLV Victory April two hundred thirty one thousand eight hundred four MY DEAREST EMMA Hallowell has promised me if the Admiralty will give him leave to go to London that he will call at Merton His spirit is certainly more independent than almost any man s I ever knew but I believe he is attached to me I am sure he has no reason to be so to either Troubridge or any one at the Admiralty I have sent last night a box of Marischino Veritabile of Zara which I got Jemmy Anderson to buy for me and twelve bottles of tokay I have kept none for myself being better pleased that you should have it I am ever and for ever your most faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE Hallowell parted last night but being in sight I am sending a frigate with a letter to the Admiralty May God Almighty bless you and send us a happy meeting LETTER XLVI Victory May five eighteen oh four I find my Dearest Emma that your picture is very much admired by the French Consul at Barcelona and that he has not sent it to be admired which I am sure it would be by Buonaparte They pretend that there were three pictures taken I wish I had them but they are all gone as irretrievably as the dispatches unless we may read them in a book as we printed their correspondence from Egypt But from us what can they find out That I love you most dearly and hate the French most damnably doctor Scott went to Barcelona to try to get the private letters but I fancy they are all gone to Paris The Swedish and American Consuls told him that the French Consul had your picture and read your letters and Doctor thinks one of them probably read the letters By the master s account of the cutter I would not have trusted a pair of old shoes in her He tells me she did not sail but was a good sea boat I hope mister Marsden will not trust any more of my private letters in such a conveyance if they choose to trust the affairs of the public in such a thing I cannot help it I long for the invasion being over it must finish the war and I have no fears for the event I do not say all I wish and which my dearest beloved Emma read that whoever opens this letter and for what I care publish it to the world your fertile imagination can readily fancy I would say but this I can say with great truth that I am FOR EVER YOUR S LETTER XLVII Victory May twenty seventh eighteen oh four MY DEAREST EMMA Yesterday I took Charles Connor on board from the Phoebe to try what we can do with him At present poor fellow he has got a very bad eye and I almost fear that he will be blind of it owing to an olive stone striking his eye but the surgeon of the Victory who is by far the most able medical man I have ever seen and equally so as a surgeon says that if it can be saved he will do it The other complaint in his head is but little more I think than it was when he first came to Deal a kind of silly laugh when spoken to He always complains of a pain in the back part of his head but when that is gone I do not perceive but that he is as wise as many of his neighbours You may rely my dear Emma that nothing shall be wanting on my part to render him every service Capel although I am sure very kind to younkers I do not think has the knack of keeping them in high discipline he lets them be their own master too much I paid Charles s account yesterday since he has been in the Phoebe one hundred and fifty five pounds fourteen shillings However he must now turn over a new leaf and I sincerely hope poor fellow he will yet do well I wrote you on the twenty twod through Rosas in Spain and I shall write in a few days by Barcelona this goes by Gibraltar I have wrote Admiral Lutwidge missus Lutwidge must wait for I cannot get through all my numerous letters for whoever writes although upon their own affairs are offended if they are not answered I have not seen young Bailey I suppose he is in the Leviathan By the parcel I see he is in the Canopus and I can at present be of no use to him May thirtieth Charles is very much recovered I write you this day by Barcelona Your dear phiz but not the least like you on the cup is safe but I would not use it for the world for if it was broke it would distress me very much Your letters by Swift I shall never get back The French Consul at Barcelona is bragging that he has three pictures of you from the Swift I do not believe him but what if he had a hundred Your resemblance is so deeply engraved in my heart that there it can never be effaced and who knows some day I may have the happiness of having a living picture of you Old Mother L is a damned b but I do not understand what you mean or what plan I am not surprised at my friend Kingsmill admiring you and forgetting Mary he loves variety and handsome women You touch upon the old Duke but I am dull of comprehension believing you all my own I cannot imagine any one else to offer in any way We have enough with prudence and without it we should soon be beggars if we had five times as much I see Lord Stafford is going to oppose mister Addington the present ministry cannot stand I wish mister Addington had given you the pension Pitt and hard hearted Grenville never will What a fortune the death of Lord Camelford gives him Every thing you tell me about my dear Horatia charms me I think I see her hear her and admire her but she is like her dear dear mother I am sorry if your account of George Martin s wife is correct he deserved a better fate But he is like Foley gave up a great deal to marry the relation of a great man although in fact she is no relation to the Duke of Portland I wish I could but be at dear Merton to assist in making the alterations I think I should have persuaded you to have kept the pike and a clear stream and to have put all the carp tench and fish who muddy the water into the pond But as you like I am content Only take care that my darling does not fall in and get drowned I begged you to get the little netting along the edge and particularly on the bridges I admire the seal and

none	none	also Amen The boy South is on board another ship learning to be a musician He will return soon when he shall have the letter and money I hope he will deserve it but he has been a very bad boy but good floggings I hope will save him from the gallows mister Falcon is a clever man He would not have made such a blunder as our friend Drake and Spencer Smith I hear the last is coming via Trieste to Malta Perhaps he wants to get to Constantinople and if the Spencers get in the Smiths will get any thing mister Elliot I hear is a candidate for it He complains of the expence of Naples I hear and that he cannot make both ends meet although he sees no company The histories of the Queen are beyond whatever I have heard from Sir William Prince Leopold s establishment is all French The Queen s favourite Lieutenant Colonel saint Clair was a subaltern La Tour the Captain in the navy and another However I never touch on these matters for I care not how she amuses herself It will be the upset of Acton or rather he will not I am told stay The King is angry with her his love is long gone by I have only one word more Do not believe a syllable the newspapers say or what you hear Mankind seems fond of telling lies Remember me kindly to missus Cadogan and all our mutual friends and be assured I am for ever my dearest Emma your most faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE George Campbell desires me always to present his best respects and make mine to good mister Yonge What can I write him I am sure he must have great pleasure in attending you and when you see Sir William Scott make my best regards acceptable to him There is no man I have a higher opinion of both as a public and private character You will long ago have had my letter with one to Davison desiring he will pay for the alterations at Merton I shall send you a letter for the hundred pounds a month to the Bank LETTER XLVIII Victory June sixth eighteen oh four Since I wrote you my Dearest Emma on the thirtieth and thirty first May nothing new has happened except our hearing the feu de joie at Toulon for the declaration of Emperor What a capricious nation those French must be However I think it must in any way be advantageous to England There ends for a century all republics By vessels from Marseilles the French think it will be a peace and they say that several of their merchant ships are fitting out I earnestly pray that it may be so and that we may have a few years of rest I rather believe my antagonist at Toulon begins to be angry with me at least I am trying to make him so and then he may come out and beat me as he says he did off Boulogne He is the Admiral that went to Naples in December seventeen ninety two La Touche Treville who landed the grenadiers I owe him something for that I am better my dear Emma than I have been and shall get through the summer very well and I have the pleasure to tell you that Charles is very much recovered There is no more the matter with his intellects than with mine Quite the contrary he is very quick mister Scott who has overlooked all his things says his clothes c are in the highest order he has ever seen I shall place him in the Niger with Captain Hilliar when he joins but all our ships are so full that it is very difficult to get a birth for one in any ship Would you conceive it possible but it is now from April twod since I have heard direct from Ball The average time for a frigate to go and return is from six to seven weeks From you I had letters April fifth and the papers to April eighth received May tenth with a convoy This goes through friend Gayner Sir William Bolton joined last night and received his letters announcing his being called papa He is got a very fine young man and good officer Lord saint Vincent has desired he may have the first Admiralty vacancy for post but nobody will die or go home A propos I believe you should buy a piece of plate value fifty pounds for our god daughter of Lady Bolton and something of twenty or thirty pounds value for Colonel Suckling s But my Emma you are not to pay for them let it rest for me or if the amount is sent me I will order payment Remember me most kindly to Horatia good missus Cadogan Charlotte Miss Connor and all our friends at dear dear Merton where from my soul I wish I was this moment then I sincerely hope we should have no cause for sorrow You will say what is right to mister Perry Newton Patterson mister Lancaster c you know all these matters God in Heaven bless and preserve you for ever prays ever your s most faithfully LETTER XLIX Victory June tenth eighteen oh four MY DEAREST EMMA I wrote to you on the sixth via Rosas this goes by Barcelona to which place I am sending Sir William Bolton to fetch doctor Scott who is gone there poor fellow for the benefit of his health I have just had very melancholy letters from the King and Queen of Naples on account of General Acton s going to Sicily The insolence of Buonaparte was not to be parried without a war for which they are unable if unassisted I have letters from Acton May twenty eight on board the Archimedes just going into Palermo He will probably return to Naples unless new events arise and that may be for a minister once out may find some difficulty in renewing his post He has acted with great and becoming spirit I am better but I have been very unwell It blows here as much as ever Yesterday was a little hurricane of wind I dare say Prince Castelcicala knows it by express if not you may tell him with my best respects He and every one else may be sure of my attachment to those good sovereigns By this route I do not choose to say more on this subject With my kindest regards to Horatia and your good mother Charlotte Miss C and all our friends believe me my dear Emma for ever your most faithful and affectionate I fear Sardinia will be invaded from Corsica before you get this letter I have not small ships to send there or any where else not in the proportion of one to five You may communicate this to mister Addington if you think that he does not know it but to no one else except Castelcicala of what relates to Naples I have very flattering letters from the Grand Vizier in the name of the Sultan and from Cadir now Capitan Pacha LETTER L Victory July first eighteen oh four Although I have wrote you my dearest Emma a letter by Rosas of June twenty seventh not yet gone the weather being so very bad that ships cannot get across the Gulph of Lyons yet I will not miss the opportunity of writing by Gibraltar You must not my Emma think of hearing from me by way of Malta it takes as long to send a letter to Malta as to England The Monmouth which you complain of not hearing by I knew nothing of her movements for some months before The ships from Malta with the convoys pick up our letters at Gibraltar Therefore do not hurt my feelings by telling me that I neglect any opportunity of writing Your letters of April thirteenth twenty twod and May thirteenth through mister Falconet came safe a few days ago mister Falconet is the French banker and he dare not buy a little macaroni for me or let an Englishman into his house Gibbs is still at Palermo I fancy he will make a good thing of my estate however I wish it was settled He wrote me a short time since that he wished I would give him a hint but without noticing that it came from him that I thought missus Graefer and her child had better go to England on pretence of educating her daughter c But I would have nothing to do with any such recommendation It would end in her coming to me in England and saying that she could not live upon what she had and that I advised her to come to England or she should not have thought of it In short Gibbs wants to remove her He is afraid of his pocket I fancy and the daughter is I fancy now in some seminary at Palermo at Gibbs s expence I wrote him word fully I would advise no such thing she was to form her own judgment What our friends are after at Naples they best know The poor King is miserable at the loss of Acton The Queen writes me about honest Acton c c and I hear that she has been the cause of ousting him and they say her enemies that her conduct is all French That I do not believe although she is likely to be the dupe of French emigres who always beset her I doubt much my dear Emma even her constancy of real friendship to you although in my letter to Acton which mister Elliot says he read to her I mentioned the obligations she was under to you c c in very strong terms What could the name of the minister signify It was the letter which was wanted to the Prime Minister But never mind with prudence we shall do very well I have wrote to Davison by land who I am very sorry for but he never would take a friend s caution and he has been severely bit Your accounts of Merton delight me and you will long ago have known that I have directed the bills for the alterations to be paid I never could have intended to have taken it from the hundred pounds a month You will not hear of my making prize money I have not paid my expences these last nine months I shall expect to eat my Christmas dinner at Merton unless those events happen which I can neither foresee nor prevent I am not well and must have rest for a few months even should the country want me which very likely they will not News I can have none April ninth Leviathan sailed so government don t care much for us Kiss my dear Horatia for me I hope you will have her at Merton and believe me my dear Emma that I am for ever as ever your attached faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE LETTER LI Victory August twelfth eighteen oh four 
5628-47230-0000	train-other-500	Although my Dearest Emma from the length of time my other letters have been getting to you I cannot expect that this will share a better fate yet as the Childers is going to Rosas to get us some news from Paris

5628-47230-0010	train-other-500	Yesterday I wrote to you through Spain this goes by Naples mister Falconet I think will send it although I am sure he feels great fear from the French minister for having any thing to do with us mister Greville is a shabby fellow
none	none	 It never could have been the intention of Sir William but that you should have had seven hundred pounds a year neat money 
5628-47230-0011	train-other-500	for when he made the will the Income Tax was double to what it is at present and the estate which it is paid from is increasing every year in value It may be law but it is not just nor in equity would I believe be considered as the will and intention of Sir William Never mind
none	none	 Thank God you do not want any of his kindness nor will he give you justice 
5628-47230-0012	train-other-500	I may fairly say all this because my actions are different even to a person who has treated me so ill

5628-47230-0013	train-other-500	I know the full extent of the obligation I owe him and he may be useful to me again but I can never forget his unkindness to you But I guess many reasons influenced his conduct in bragging of his riches and my honourable poverty
5628-47230-0014	train-other-500	but as I have often said and with honest pride what I have is my own it never cost the widow a tear or the nation a farthing I got what I have with my pure blood from the enemies of my country Our house my own Emma is built upon a solid foundation

5628-47230-0017	train-other-500	I do not think she likes mister Elliot and therefore I wish she had never shewn him my letters about you We also know that he has a card of his own to play doctor Scott who is a good man although poor fellow very often wrong in the head

5628-47230-0019	train-other-500	I hope they will do the thing handsomely and allow of my return in the spring but I do not expect it I am very uneasy at your and Horatia being on the coast for you cannot move if the French make the attempt
5628-47230-0020	train-other-500	which I am told they have done and been repulsed Pray God it may be true I shall rejoice to hear you and Horatia are safe at Merton and happy shall I be the day I join you Gannam Justem Gaetano is very grateful for your remembrance of him

5628-47230-0024	train-other-500	I well know that you will keep it and have my dear Horatia to drink my health Forty six years of toil and trouble How few more the common lot of mankind leads us to expect and therefore it is almost time to think of spending the few last years in peace and quietness
5628-47230-0025	train-other-500	By this time I should think either my successor is named or permission is granted me to come home and if so you will not long receive this letter before I make my appearance which will make us I am sure both truly happy

5628-47230-0026	train-other-500	and that I could have told you something comfortable for you from that quarter and it is now seven weeks since we heard from Malta Therefore I know nothing of what is passing in the world
5628-47230-0027	train-other-500	I would not have you my dear Emma allow the work of brick and mortar to go on in the winter months It can all be finished next summer when I hope we shall have peace or such an universal war as will upset that vagabond Buonaparte

the gentry will soon come out I cannot say more by such a conveyance LETTER LVI Victory October thirteen eighteen oh four MY DEAREST EMMA The dreadful effects of the yellow fever at Gibraltar and many parts of Spain will naturally give you much uneasiness till you hear that thank God we are entirely free from it and in the most perfect health not one man being ill in the fleet The cold weather will I hope cure the disorder Whilst I am writing this letter a cutter is arrived from England with strong indications of a Spanish war I hope from my heart that it will not prove one But however that is my die is cast and long before this time I expect another Admiral is far on his way to supersede me Lord Keith I think a very likely man I should for your sake and for many of our friends have liked an odd hundred thousand pounds but never mind If they give me the choice of staying a few months longer it will be very handsome and for the sake of others we would give up my dear Emma very much of our own felicity If they do not we shall be happy with each other and with dear Horatia The cutter returns with my answers directly therefore my own Emma you must only fancy all my thoughts and feelings towards you They are every thing which a fond heart can fancy I have not a moment I am writing and signing orders whilst I am writing to my own Emma My life my soul God in Heaven bless you Your letter is September sixteenth your last is August twenty seventh I have not made myself understood about missus Bolton s money You give away too much Kiss our dear Horatia a thousand times for your own faithful Nelson I send two hundred pounds keep it for your own pocket money You must tell Davison and Haslewood that I cannot answer their letters Linton cannot be fixed but you will know whether I come home or stay from mister Marsden God bless you Tell my brother that I have made mister Yonge a Lieutenant into the Sea horse frigate Captain Boyle Once more God bless my dearest Emma Write your name on the back of the bill if you send any person for the money I have scrawled three lines to Davison that he should not think I neglected him in his confinement I have received the inclosed from Allen Can we assist the poor foolish man with a character LETTER LVII Victory November two hundred thirty one thousand eight hundred four As all our communication with Spain is at an end I can now only expect to hear from my own dear Emma by the very slow mode of Admiralty vessels and it is now more than two months since the John Bull sailed I much fear something has been taken for they never would I am sure have kept me so long in the dark However by management and a portion of good luck I got the account from Madrid in a much shorter space of time than I could have hoped for and I have set the whole Mediterranean to work and think the fleet cannot fail of being successful and if I had had the spare troops at Malta at my disposal Minorca would at this moment have had English colours flying This letter my dearest beloved Emma goes although in mister Marsden s letter such a roundabout way that I cannot say all that my heart wishes Imagine every thing which is kind and affectionate and you will come near the mark Where is my successor I am not a little surprised at his not arriving A Spanish war I thought would have hastened him Ministers could not have thought that I wanted to fly the service my whole life has proved the contrary and if they refuse me now I shall most certainly leave this country in March or April for a few months rest I must have very soon If I am in my grave what are the mines of Peru to me But to say the truth I have no idea of killing myself I may with care live yet to do good service to the state My cough is very bad and my side where I was struck on the fourteenth of February is very much swelled at times a lump as large as my fist brought on occasionally by violent coughing but I hope and believe my lungs are yet safe Sir William Bolton is just arrived from Malta I am preparing to send him a cruise where he will have the best chance I can give him of making ten thousand pounds He is a very attentive good young man I have not heard from Naples this age I have in fact no small craft to send for news If I am soon to go home I shall be with you before this letter May God bless you Thomson desires to be most kindly remembered to his dear wife and children He is most sincerely attached to them and wishes to save what he can for their benefit As our means of communicating are cut off I have only to beg that you will not believe the idle rumours of battles c c c May Heavens bless you prays fervently my dear Emma ever your most faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE LETTER LVIII Victory March ninth eighteen oh five I do assure you my Dearest Emma that nothing can be more miserable or unhappy than your poor Nelson From the nineteenth of February have we been beating from Malta to off Palma where I am now anchored the wind and sea being so very contrary and bad But I cannot help myself and no one in the fleet can feel what I do and to mend my fate yesterday Captain Layman arrived to my great surprise not in his brig but in a Spanish cartel he having been wrecked off Cadiz and lost all the dispatches and letters You will conceive my disappointment It is now from November twod that I have had a line from England Captain Layman says he is sure the letters are sunk never to rise again but as they were not thrown overboard until the vessel struck the rock I have much fear that they may have fallen into the hands of the Dons My reports from off Toulon state the French fleet as still in port but I shall ever be uneasy at not having fallen in with them I know my dear Emma that it is in vain to repine but my feelings are alive to meeting those fellows after near two years hard service What a time I could not have thought it possible that I should have been so long absent unwell and uncomfortable in many respects However when I calculate upon the French fleet s not coming to sea for this summer I shall certainly go for dear England and a thousand times dearer Merton May Heavens bless you my own Emma I cannot think where Sir William Bolton is got to he ought to have joined me before this time I send you a trifle for a birth day s gift I would to God I could give you more but I have it not I get no prize money worth naming but if I have the good fortune to meet the French fleet I hope they will make me amends for all my anxiety which has been and is indescribable How is my dear Horatia I hope you have her under your guardian wing at Merton May God bless her Captain Layman is now upon his trial I hope he will come clear with honour I fear it was too great confidence in his own judgment that got him into the scrape but it was impossible that any person living could have exerted himself more when in a most trying and difficult situation March tenth Poor Captain L has been censured by the court but I have my own opinion I sincerely pity him and have wrote to Lord Melville and Sir Evan Nepean to try what can be done All together I am much unhinged To morrow if the wind lasts I shall be off Toulon Sir William Bolton is safe I heard of him this morning I hear that a ship is coming out for him but as this is only rumour I cannot keep him from this opportunity of being made post and I dare say he will cause by his delay such a tumble that Louis s son who I have appointed to the Childers will lose his promotion and then Sir Billy will be wished at the devil But I have done with this subject the whole history has hurt me Hardy has talked enough to him to rouze his lethargic disposition I have been much hurt at the loss of poor mister Girdlestone He was a good man but there will be an end of us all What has Charles Connor been about His is a curious letter If he does not drink he will do very well Captain Hilliar has been very good to him Colonel Suckling I find has sent his son to the Mediterranean taking him from the Narcissus where I had been at so much pains to place him I know not where to find a frigate to place him He never will be so well and properly situated again I am more plagued with other people s business or rather nonsense than with my own concerns With some difficulty I have got Suckling placed in the Ambuscade with Captain Durban who came on board at the moment I was writing March thirty first The history of Suckling will never be done I have this moment got from him your letter and one from his father I shall say nothing to him I don t blame the child but those who took him out of the most desirable situation in the navy He never will get into such another advantageous ship but his father is a fool and so my dear Emma that ends The box which you sent me in May eighteen oh four is just arrived in the Diligent store ship I have sent the arms to Palermo to Gibbs The clothes are very acceptable I will give you a kiss for sending them God bless you Amen April first I am not surprised that we should both think the same about the kitchen and if I can afford it I should like it to be done but by the fatal example of poor mister Hamilton and many others we must take care not to get into debt for then we can neither help any of our relations and must be for ever in misery But of this we will talk more when we walk upon the poop at Merton Do you ever see Admiral and missus Lutwidge You will not forget me when you do To missus Cadogan say every thing that is kind and to all our other friends and be assured I am for ever and ever your s and only your s NELSON BRONTE As I know that all the Mediterranean letters are cut and smoaked and perhaps read I do not send you a little letter in this but your utmost

fresh at W S W dead foul wind I sent my own Dearest Emma a letter for you last night in a Torbay boat and gave the man a guinea to put it in the Post Office We have had a nasty blowing night and it looks very dirty I am now signalizing the ships at Plymouth to join me but I rather doubt their ability to get to sea However I have got clear of Portland and have Cawsand Bay and Torbay under the lee I intreat my dear Emma that you will chear up and we will look forward to many many happy years and be surrounded by our children s children God Almighty can when he pleases remove the impediment My heart and soul is with you and Horatia I got this line ready in case a boat should get alongside For ever ever I am your s most devotedly NELSON BRONTE mister Rose said he would write to mister Bolton if I was sailed but I have forgot to give him the direction but I will send it to day I think I shall succeed very soon if not at this moment Wednesday September eighteenth off the Lizard I had no opportunity of sending your letter yesterday nor do I see any prospect at present The Ajax and Thunderer are joining but it is nearly calm with a swell from the westward Perseverance has got us thus far and the same will I dare say get us on Thomas seems to do very well and content Tell mister Lancaster that I have no doubt that his son will do very well God bless you my own Emma I am giving my letters to Blackwood to put on board the first vessel he meets going to England or Ireland Once more Heavens bless you Ever for ever your NELSON BRONTE LETTER LX Victory October first eighteen oh five MY DEAREST EMMA It is a relief to me to take up the pen and write you a line for I have had about four o clock this morning one of my dreadful spasms which has almost enervated me It is very odd I was hardly ever better than yesterday Freemantle stayed with me till eight o clock and I slept uncommonly well but was awoke with this disorder My opinion of its effect some one day has never altered However it is entirely gone off and I am only quite weak The good people of England will not believe that rest of body and mind is necessary for me But perhaps this spasm may not come again these six months I had been writing seven hours yesterday perhaps that had some hand in bringing it upon me I joined the fleet late on the evening of the twenty eighth of September but could not communicate with them until the next morning I believe my arrival was most welcome not only to the commander of the fleet but also to every individual in it and when I came to explain to them the Nelson touch it was like an electric shock Some shed tears all approved It was new it was singular it was simple and from Admirals downwards it was repeated It must succeed if ever they will allow us to get at them You are my Lord surrounded by friends whom you inspire with confidence Some may be Judas s but the majority are certainly much pleased with my commanding them SUPPLEMENT INTERESTING LETTERS

esquire TO LADY HAMILTON LETTERS OF ALEX DAVISON esquire c I eighteen oh four MY DEAR MADAM I have equally with yourself felt extremely uneasy all night thinking on the letter which is a very serious one and until we receive our next dispatches I shall still feel every day more and more anxious I rely on that kind Providence which has hitherto sheltered him under every danger upon the occasion He was on the eve of engaging for protection and preservation It is indeed an anxious moment I have long thought a plan was in agitation regarding the Toulon fleet being given up but whether it was in contemplation at the period the last letter was written I know not I am rather disposed to think otherwise The next packet will explain the whole and I trust will relieve our minds of that burden hardly supportable at present I shall this evening go quietly into the country and return to town about noon to morrow as I require air and a little relaxation for I am actually overpowered with business Your s most truly ALEX DAVISON Thursday Morning II eighteen oh four MY DEAR MADAM Yesterday I wrote to you just in time to save the post but whether that letter or even this reach you I have my doubts if they do not you have only yourself to blame for I cannot for the soul of me make out the name of the place You have been in such a hurry when writing it that it really is not legible and I do not sufficiently know Norfolk to guess at it I did yesterday as I shall this imitate your writing leaving it to the Post Office gentlemen to find it out I acquainted you that I would take care to obey your wishes and hold back your check on Coutts and company till such time as it would be quite convenient to yourself and you tell me to send it for payment Your mind may be perfectly at ease on that score as indeed it may in every thing in which you have to do with me though we do now and then differ a little in trifles but not in essentials having one only one object in mind that of the comforts and ultimate happiness of our dear your beloved Nelson for whom what would you or I not do What a world of matter is now in agitation Every thing is big with events and soon very soon I hope to see what I have long desired and anxiously been waiting for an event to contribute to the glory the independency of our Nelson I still hope ere Christmas to see him that hope founded on the darling expectation of his squadron falling in with a rich Spanish flotilla I think too that the French fleet will now come out I have written to our dear friend every information I have been able to collect and have sent him a continuation of all the newspapers It affords me particular pleasure to hear you feel so happy in Norfolk How is it possible it can be otherwise seated as you are in the midst of the friends of your best friend enjoying every kindness and attention in their power to shew to the favourite of their brother I shall be very much rejoiced when you come back to talk over very

twenty twod September eighteen oh four A D When I have the pleasure of seeing you I shall deliver the trust over to you to receive the bespoken said sum of twenty thousand pounds What a glorious receipt will it be I am glad you received my letters though I could not make out the name of the place the Post Office runners are expert at it What do you say to a Spanish war I think now the breeze begins to freshen and that the flames at last will succeed I sent off last night a very long epistle to our dear Nelson I am truly distressed at his not receiving my letters though I can pretty well guess how to account for it and in whose hands they were detained Experience teaches us how better to guard against similar misfortunes and in future I shall be cautious to whom I give my letters So that I know the Hero of heroes is well I care the less about letters knowing that writing delivering or receiving them will not either in him or me make the least alteration or lessen our attachment or affection I am pleased to see how happy you are in Norfolk I wish you may not find it so fascinating that the arrival of Lord Nelson at Merton would not induce you to quit the county I beg you will

your Daily Advertiser No sport again In the midst of such a quantity of game they have contrived to carry him far off where there is none He has no other comfort to day than having killed a wild cat and his face is a yard long However his Majesty has vowed vengeance on the boars to morrow and will go according to his own fancy and I dare say there will be a terrible slaughter The last day we are to keep all we kill and I suppose it will be night before we get home Yesterday the courier brought the order of saint Stephano from the Emperor for the Prince Ausberg and the King was desired to invest him with it As soon as the King received it he ran into the Prince s room whom he found in his shirt and without his breeches and in that condition was he decorated with the star and ribbon by his Majesty who has wrote the whole circumstance to the Emperor Leopold may perhaps not like the joking with his first order Such nonsense should certainly be done with solemnity or it becomes what it really is a little tinsel and a few yards of broad ribbon The Prince entre nous is not very wise but he is a good creature and we are great friends I have wrote to missus Dickinson I forget whether you have or not if not pray do it soon for you know she is a good friend of your s I have just received your good letter I am glad they have taken the Guarda patana s son in law I insist upon Smith s letting the Regent of the Vicaria know of his having stabbed my porter He ought to go to the gallies and my honour is concerned if this insult offered my livery is unnoticed The girl had better cry than be ill used and her father killed Adieu my sweet Em Your s with all my heart W H III Persano Friday Evening Jan sixth seventeen ninety two I Inclose our friend Knight s admirable letter to you I could not refrain reading it and I am sure it was his intention I should do so having left it unsealed He is a fine fellow it was worth going to England to secure such a sensible friend You will probably have seen General Werner last night this is Friday night and he will have told you I am well We have been out all day in the rain I killed none and the King and party but few Such obstinate bad weather I really never experienced for so long a time together You did perfectly right in buying the lamps and I am glad the Prince asked to dine with you I am sure he was comfortably received by you You see what devils there are in England They wanted to stir up something against me but our conduct shall be such as to be unattackable and I fear not an injustice from England Twenty seven years service having spent all the King s money and all my own besides running in debt deserves something better than a dismission The King has declared he will return to Naples next Saturday se n night so you know the worst my dear Emma Indeed I shall embrace you most cordially for I would not be married to any woman but yourself on earth for all the world Lord A Hamilton s son you see recommends a friend of his who I suppose is arrived if so receive him well Adieu again Your s ever W H IV Persano Saturday Night January seventh seventeen ninety two This has been one of the cruel days which attend the King s chasse All the posts except the King s Prince Ausberg D Onerato and Priori bad We have been out all day in cold rain without seeing a boar The King has killed twenty five and a wolf and the other good posts in proportion Why not rather leave us at home than go out with the impossibility of sport But we must take the good and bad or give it up Lamberg is too delicate for this business he has been in bed with a slight fever all to day You will have another boar to day which boar being a sow I have made a bull The sows are much better than the boars so you may keep some to eat at home and dispose of the rest to your favourite English I am glad all goes on so well I never doubted your gaining every soul you approach I am far from being angry at your feeling the loss of me so much Nay I am flattered but believe me the time will soon come that we shall meet Years pass seemingly in an instant why then afraid of a few days Upon the whole we are sociable here but we go to bed at nine and get up at five o clock I generally read an hour to digest my supper but indeed I live chiefly on bread and butter Salandra desires his compliments to you as does Lamberg and Prince Ausberg Adieu my dear Emma Ever your s and your s alone W H I send you back your two letters Dutens was very satisfactory I send the papers to Smith who will give them to you first if you have not read them The cold and fatigue makes my hand something like your s which by the bye you neglect rather too much but as what you write is good sense every body will forgive the scrawl V Sunday Night Jan eighth seventeen ninety two We are come in late and I have but a moment to tell you we are well and I have killed three large boars a fox and four woodcocks Nothing pleases me more than to hear you do not neglect your singing It would be a pity as you are near the point of perfection Adieu my dearest Emma Your s with my whole soul W H VI Persano Monday January tenth ninth seventeen ninety

If the Wilkinsons are not content with our civilities let them help themselves We have had a charming day and most excellent sport More than a hundred wild boars and two wolves have fallen I killed five boars truly monsters and a fox Vincenzo could not follow me to day he cannot walk two steps without being out of breath However I load the guns myself and with the peasant I brought from Caserta

morrow s post Lamberg is still in bed with a fever and Prince Ausberg s eyes are a little inflamed with cold and fatigue My cold was renewed a little yesterday but a good night s rest and quiet to day has set all to rights again Vincenzo was so bad yesterday that he could not follow me and was blooded He is better to day but he will never serve more except to load my guns at the post He cannot walk a mile without being out of breath I am glad you have been at the Academy and in the great world It is time enough for you to find out that the only real comfort is to be met with at home I have been in that secret some time You are certainly the most domestic young woman I know but you are young and most beautiful and it would not be natural if you did not like to shew yourself a little in public The effusion of tenderness with regard to me in your letter is very flattering I know the value of it and will do all I can to keep it alive We are now one flesh and it must be our study to keep that flesh as warm and comfortable as we can I will do all in my power to please you and I do not doubt of your doing the same towards me Adieu my dearest Emma Having nothing interesting to write and as you insist upon hearing from me every day you must content yourself with such a stupid letter as this Your Ladyship s commands shall always be punctually obeyed by dear Madam your Ladyship s most obedient and faithful servant W HAMILTON VIII Persano Wednesday eleventh Jan seventeen ninety two I have just received your letter and as I always do with infinite pleasure I hope you received twelve wood biddies to day and to morrow you will have a wild boar all left to your discretion No talk of returning yet We must complete sixteen days shooting and one day has been lost by bad weather We had a good day and tolerable sport I have killed two and one the largest boar I have seen yet here Vincenzo they say will be well in a day or two as it is only a cold I fear it is more serious The King has killed twenty one boars to day and is quite happy The Germans all drink tea with me every evening Lamberg is better Adieu my ever dear Emma We are always in a hurry though we have absolutely nothing to do but kill examine and weigh wild boars I assure you that I shall rejoice when I can embrace you once more A picture would not content me your image is more strongly represented on my heart than any that could be produced by human art Your most affectionate husband W H IX Persano Thursday Night Jan twelfth seventeen ninety two Never put yourself in a hurry my dear Emma I have got

the letter to him We have had good sport to day though the bad weather came on at eleven o clock Fifty four wild boars have been killed I had seven shot and killed five three of which are enormous Dispose of the boar I send you to day as you think proper I always thought Ruspoli a dirty fellow but what has he done of late As to your mother s going with you to the English parties very well but believe me it will be best for her and more to her happiness to stay at home than go with you to the Neapolitan parties The King is in good humour to day as I foretold We continue to dine at eight at night and have nothing from breakfast to that hour But I give tea and bread and butter of which Prince Ausberg and Lamberg partake with pleasure The Prince having no opportunity of making love does nothing but talk of his new flame which is Lady A Hatton I put him right for he thought she spelt her name with two rr instead of two tt I rejoice at your having Aprile again pray tell him so for I know the rapid progress you will make under his care My cold is near gone The worst is my room smokes confoundedly and so do all the other rooms except the King s Adieu my dear Emma Amuse yourself as

none	none	My dear Lord your s most sincerely Wm HAMILTON VII Piccadilly February nineteenth eighteen oh one MY DEAR LORD Whether Emma will be able to write to you to day or not is a question as she has got one of her terrible sick head achs Among other things that vex her is that we have been drawn in to be under the absolute necessity of giving a dinner to on Sunday next He asked it himself having expressed his strong desire of hearing Banti s and Emma s voices together I am well aware of the danger that would attend frequenting our house Not that I fear that Emma could ever be induced to act contrary to the prudent conduct she has hitherto pursued but the world is so ill natured that the worst construction is put upon the most innocent actions As this dinner must be or would be offended I shall keep it strictly to the musical part invite only Banti her husband and Taylor and as I wish to shew a civility to Davison I have sent him an invitation In short we will get rid of it as well as we can and guard against its producing more meetings of the same sort Emma would really have gone any lengths to have avoided Sunday s dinner But I thought it would not be prudent to break with who really has shewn the greatest civility to us when we were last in England and since we returned and she has at last acquiesced to my opinion I have been thus explicit as I know well your Lordship s way of thinking and your very kind attachment to us and to every thing that concerns us The King caught cold at the Chapel the other day and there was no levee yesterday and to day the Queen alone will be at the drawing room and I believe the new ministry will not be quite fixed until the levee day next week As to my business I have done all I can to bring it to a point The pension recommended by Lord Grenville was only like Walpole s a nominal two thousand pounds I have represented the injustice of that after my having had the King s promise of not being removed from Naples but at my own request and having only empowered Lord Grenville to remove me on securing to me a nett income of two thousand pounds per annum Lord Grenville has recommended to the Treasury the taking my extraordinary expences into consideration I have fully demonstrated to Lord Grenville and Treasury that eight thousand pounds is absolutely necessary for the clearing off my unfunded debt without making up for my losses Upon the whole then I do not expect to get more than the nett annuity above mentioned and the eight thousand pounds But unless that is granted I shall indeed have been very ill used I hope in my next to be able to inform your Lordship that all has been finally settled I am busy in putting in order the remains of my vases and pictures that you so kindly saved for me on board the Fourdroyant and the sale of them will enable me to go on more at my ease and not leave a debt unpaid But unfortunately there have been too many picture sales this year and mine will come late Adieu my very dear Lord May health and success attend you wherever you go And I flatter myself this political jumble may hasten a peace and bring you back soon Your Lordship s ever obliged and most sincerely attached friend and servant Wm HAMILTON VIII Piccadilly February twentieth eighteen oh one MY DEAR LORD You need not be the least alarmed that Emma has commissioned me to send you the newspapers and write you a line to tell you that she is much better having vomited naturally and is now purposing to take a regular one of tartar emetic All her convulsive complaints certainly proceed from a foul stomach and I will answer for it she will be in spirits to write to you herself to morrow Adieu my very dear Lord I have not a moment to lose as the bell is going Your ever attached and obliged humble servant Wm HAMILTON IX Piccadilly March seventh eighteen oh one MY VERY DEAR LORD I wish it was in my power to profit of your kind invitation you would soon see me and Emma on board the saint George but I am now totally occupied in preparing for the sale of my pictures and what I have saved of my vases To my great satisfaction I have found some of the most capital vases and which I thought surely lost on board the Colossus It has comforted me much We remain in the same cruel state with respect to the King s recovery There can be no doubt but that his Majesty is better However if my conjectures are true the Regency must soon take place as it may be long before his Majesty could be troubled with business supposing even his fever to have totally subsided and the times admit of no delays We see now the certainty of the French squadron s being in the Mediterranean God knows how all this will end But I hope it will be your Lordship s lot to bring Paul to his senses God send you every success and send you home safe and well crowned with additional laurels And then I hope you will repose your shattered frame and make your friends happy by staying with them Emma Emma is certainly much better but not quite free from bile Ever my dear Lord your Lordship s most attached and eternally obliged humble servant Wm HAMILTON X Piccadilly April sixteenth eighteen oh one What can I say my Dear Lord that would convey the smallest idea of what we felt yesterday on receiving the authentic letters confirming your late most glorious victory and read in your own hand that God had not only granted you complete success against the enemies of our country but in the midst of such perils prevented your receiving the smallest scratch We can only repeat what we knew well and often said before that Nelson was is and to the last will ever be the first However we all agree that when we get you safe home once more that you should never more risk your shattered frame You have done enough and are well entitled to the motto of Virgil Hic Victor caestus artemque repono The famous Broughton after he had beaten every opponent that dared to measure hard blows with him set up an ale house the Broughton s Head in London with the above verse of Virgil under it Some years after he was persuaded to accept the challenge of a coachman and was beaten Not that I mean to convey that any such thing could happen to your Lordship but you have done enough Let others follow your examples they will be remembered to the latest posterity It appeared to me most extraordinary that the sixth inst the date of your last letter to Emma the death of the Emperor Paul which we have no doubt of here should not be known at Copenhagen It appears to us that as soon as that great event is known in Sweden and Denmark with the severe blow you have just given the latter the formidable giant Northern Coalition will of itself fall to pieces and that we shall have the happiness of embracing you again here in a very short time You would have laughed to have seen what I saw yesterday Emma did not know whether she was on her head or heels in such a hurry to tell your great news that she could utter nothing but tears of joy and tenderness I went to Davison yesterday morning and found him still in bed having had a severe fit of the gout and with your letter which he had just received and he cried like a child But what was very extraordinary assured me that from the instant he had read your letter all pain had left him and that he felt himself able to get up and walk about Your brother missus Nelson and Horace dined with us Your brother was more extraordinary than ever He would get up suddenly and cut a caper rubbing his hands every time that the thought of your fresh laurels came into his head In short except myself and your Lordship knows that I have some phlegm all the company which was considerable after dinner the Duke Lord William mister Este c were mad with joy But I am sure that no one really rejoiced more at heart than I did I have lived too long to have extacies But with calm reflection I felt for my friend having got to the very summit of glory the Ne plus ultra that he has had another opportunity of rendering his country the most important service and manifesting again his judgment his intrepidity and humanity God bless you my very dear Lord and send you soon home to your friends Enemies you have none but those that are bursting with envy and such animals infest all parts of the world The King be assured is though weak getting well fast Lord Loughborough told Livingston who has just been here that he was with the King the day before yesterday before and after delivery of the seals and that he was perfectly calm and recollected Ever your sincerely attached and truly obliged humble servant Wm HAMILTON XI Milford August twelfth eighteen oh one MY DEAR LORD Emma has constantly given me every possible intelligence relative to your Lordship and the important operations you are about at this most interesting moment You have already calmed the minds of every body with respect to the threatened French invasion In short all your Lordship does is complete like yourself and nobody else But still I think there is no occasion for the Commander in Chief to expose his person as much as you do Why should you not have a private flag known to your fleet and not to the enemy when you shift it and go reconnoitring Captain Hopkins going from hence in the Speedwell cutter to join your Lordship will be happy to introduce himself to you by presenting this letter himself They give him a good character in this country but my acquaintance with him is but of two days I was yesterday with Captain Dobbins in the Diligence cutter We sailed out of this glorious harbour and the day being fine sailed out some leagues and examined the Crow Rock which is reckoned the greatest danger as to entering the harbour But the two light houses lately erected take off all danger in the night and it is visible in the day time except a short time in spring tides I am delighted with the improvements at Milford It will surely be a great town if we have peace in three years the houses rising up like mushrooms even in these difficult times We allow any one to build at their own expence at an easy ground rent and to fall in at the expiration of three lives or sixty years You may judge that having two thousand acres all round the town these inhabitants will want land for cows and horses and gardens c and of course I must be a gainer in the end I visited the two light houses and found them perfectly clean and in good order and I never could conceive the brilliant light that they give one has sixteen reflected lights and the other ten To day I go upon my last visit to Lord Milford and on Saturday set out for Piccadilly and where I am not without hopes of meeting your Lordship as I think in the manner you dispatch business you will have completed all by Wednesday next the day I shall probably be in London Charles Greville s kind compliments The name of Nelson is in every mouth and indeed we owe every thing to your judgment and exertions Adieu God bless you Ever your Lordship s affectionate friend and obliged humble servant Wm HAMILTON XII Piccadilly April twenty eighth eighteen oh two MY DEAR LORD Emma says I must write a letter to you of condolence for the heavy loss your Lordship has suffered When persons in the prime of life are carried off by accidents or sickness or what is I believe oftener the case by the ignorance and mistakes of the physicians then indeed there is reason to lament But as in the case of your good Father the lamp was suffered to burn out fairly and that his sufferings were not great and that by his Son s glorious and unparalleled successes he saw his family ennobled and with the probability in time of its being amply rewarded as it ought to have been long ago his mind could not be troubled in his latter moments on account of the family he left behind him and as to his own peace of mind at the moment of his dissolution there can be no doubt among those who ever had the honour of his acquaintance I have said more than I intended but dare say your Lordship had nearly the same thoughts with the addition of the feelings of a dutiful Son for the loss of a most excellent Father It is however now as your Lordship is the Father of your Family incumbent upon you to take particular care of your own health Nay you are by the voice of the nation its first prop and support Keep up your spirits and that you may long enjoy your well earned honours is the sincere wish of your Lordship s affectionate friend and attached humble servant Wm HAMILTON Letters FROM LORD NELSON TO SIR

5628-47240-0000	train-other-500	MY DEAR SIR Will you have the goodness to forward the inclosed to mister Brand and to present my letter to Lady Hamilton Every lover of his country will rejoice in our great and almost unexampled success to the honour of my Lord Hood
5628-47240-0001	train-other-500	and to the shame of those who opposed his endeavours to serve his country General Stewart I am happy to say is just arrived We shall now join heart and hand against Calvi When conquered
none	none	 I shall hope to pay my respects to your Excellency at Naples 
5628-47240-0002	train-other-500	which will give real pleasure to your very faithful and obliged HORATIO NELSON
none	none	 II Agamemnon Leghorn March eleventh seventeen ninety six SIR mister Wyndham having communicated to mister Udney the conversation of the French minister with the Tuscans I cannot 
5628-47240-0003	train-other-500	being intrusted by the Admiral with the command of the small squadron in the Gulph of Genoa but think it right for me to beg that your Excellency will apply for such vessels of war belonging to his Sicilian Majesty as may be judged proper to cruize in the Gulph of Genoa
5628-47240-0004	train-other-500	and particularly off the point of the Gulph of Especia Xebecs corvettes and frigates are the fittest to cruize and the first have the great advantage of rowing as well as sailing I am told very fast
5628-47240-0005	train-other-500	General Acton knows full as well as myself the vessels proper to prevent the disembarkation of troops on this coast therefore I shall not particularly point them out Last campaign the word flotilla was misunderstood
5628-47240-0006	train-other-500	I can only say that all vessels which can sail and row must be useful and for small craft Port Especia is a secure harbour Whatever is to be done should be done speedily for by mister Wyndham s account we have no time to lose
5628-47240-0007	train-other-500	If we have the proper vessels I am confident the French will not be able to bring their ten thousand men by sea
none	none	 and should they attempt to pass through the Genoese territories 
5628-47240-0008	train-other-500	I hope the Austrians will prevent them but however should all our precautions not be able to prevent the enemy s possessing themselves of Leghorn yet we are not to despair Fourteen days from their entry if the allied powers unite heartily
none	none	 I am confident we shall take them all prisoners I am confident it can and therefore should such an unlucky event take place as their possessing themselves of Leghorn I hope will be done I have sent to the Admiral I am very lately from off Toulon 
5628-47240-0009	train-other-500	where thirteen sail of the line and five frigates are ready for sea and others fitting With my best respects to Lady Hamilton believe me dear Sir your Excellency s most obedient servant HORATIO NELSON

5628-47240-0010	train-other-500	Vanguard Syracuse July twentieth seventeen ninety eight MY DEAR SIR It is an old saying The devil s children have the devil s luck I cannot find
5628-47240-0011	train-other-500	or to this moment learn beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to All my ill fortune hitherto has proceeded from want of frigates Off Cape Passaro on the twenty second of June at day light I saw two frigates which were supposed to be French
5628-47240-0012	train-other-500	and it has been said since that a line of battle ship was to leeward of them with the riches of Malta on board
none	none	 But it was the destruction of the enemy and not riches for myself that I was seeking 
5628-47240-0013	train-other-500	these would have fell to me if I had had frigates but except the ship of the line I regard not all the riches in this world From my information off Malta I believed they were gone to Egypt
5628-47240-0014	train-other-500	therefore on the twenty eighth I was communicating with Alexandria in Egypt where I found the Turks preparing to resist them but knew nothing beyond report From thence I stretched over to the coast of Caramania where not speaking a vessel who could give me information
5628-47240-0015	train-other-500	I became distressed for the kingdom of the Two Sicilies and having gone a round of six hundred leagues at this season of the year with a single ship with an expedition incredible here I am as ignorant of the situation of the enemy as I was twenty seven days ago
none	none	 I sincerely hope the dispatches which I understand are at Cape Passaro will give me full information I shall be able for nine or ten weeks longer to keep the fleet on active service when we shall want provisions and stores I send a paper on that subject herewith 
5628-47240-0016	train-other-500	mister Littledale is I suppose sent up by the Admiral to victual us and I hope he will do it cheaper than any other person but if I find out that he charges more than the fair price
none	none	 and has not the provisions of the very best quality I will not take them 
5628-47240-0017	train-other-500	for as no fleet has more fag than this nothing but the best food and greatest attention can keep them healthy At this moment we have not one sick man in the fleet In about six days I shall sail from hence
none	none	 and if I hear nothing more of the French I shall go to the Archipelago 
5628-47240-0018	train-other-500	where if they are gone towards Constantinople I shall hear of them
none	none	 I shall go to Cyprus and if they are gone to Alexandretta 
5628-47240-0019	train-other-500	or any other part of Syria or Egypt I shall get information You will I am sure and so will our country easily conceive what has passed in my anxious mind but I have this comfort that I have no fault to accuse myself of this bears me up and this only
5628-47240-0020	train-other-500	I send you a paper
none	none	 where a letter is fixed for different places which I may leave at any place and except those who have the key none can tell where I am gone to July twenty one The messenger is returned from Cape Passaro and says that your letters for me are returned to Naples 
5628-47240-0022	train-other-500	What a situation am I placed in As yet I can learn nothing of the enemy therefore I have no conjecture but that they are gone to Syria and at Cyprus I hope to hear of them
none	none	 If they were gone to the westward 
5628-47240-0023	train-other-500	I rely that every place in Sicily would have information for me for it is too important news to leave me in one moment s doubt about
none	none	 I have no frigate or a sign of one The masts yards c for the Vanguard will I hope be prepared directly for should the French be so strongly secured in port that I cannot get at them I shall immediately shift my flag into some other ship and send the Vanguard to Naples to be refitted 
5628-47240-0024	train-other-500	for hardly any person but myself would have continued on service so long in such a wretched state
none	none	 I want to send a great number of papers to Lord saint Vincent 
5628-47240-0025	train-other-500	but I durst not trust any person here to carry them even to Naples Pray send a copy of my letter to Lord Spencer he must be very anxious to hear of this fleet
none	none	 I have taken the liberty of troubling your Excellency with a letter for Lady Nelson 
5628-47240-0026	train-other-500	Pray forward it for me and believe me with the greatest respect your most obedient servant HORATIO NELSON
none	none	 Sent on shore to the charge of the Governor of Syracuse IV Vanguard Syracuse July twenty twod seventeen ninety eight MY DEAR SIR I have had so much said about the King of Naples s orders only to admit three or four of the ships of our fleet into his ports 
5628-47240-0027	train-other-500	that I am astonished I understood that private orders at least would have been given for our free admission If we are to be refused supplies pray send me by many vessels an account that I may in good time take the King s fleet to Gibraltar
none	none	 Our treatment is scandalous for a great nation to put up with and the King s flag is insulted at every friendly port we look at I am with the greatest respect 
5628-47240-0028	train-other-500	your most obedient servant HORATIO NELSON P S I do not complain of the want of attention in individuals for all classes of people are remarkably attentive to us Sent on shore to the charge of the Governor of Syracuse

5628-47240-0029	train-other-500	Vanguard Mouth of the Nile August eighth seventeen ninety eight MY DEAR SIR Almighty God has made me the happy instrument in destroying the enemy s fleet which I hope will be a blessing to Europe You will have the goodness to communicate this happy event to all the courts in Italy
none	none	 for my head is so indifferent that I can scarcely scrawl this letter Captain Capel who is charged with my dispatches for England will give you every information Pray put him in the quickest mode of getting home 
5628-47240-0030	train-other-500	You will not send by post any particulars of this action as I should be sorry to have any accounts get home before my dispatches I hope there will be no difficulty in our getting refitted at Naples Culloden must be instantly hove down
5628-47240-0031	train-other-500	and Vanguard all new masts and bowsprit Not more than four or five sail of the line will probably come to Naples the rest will go with the prizes to Gibraltar As this army never will return I hope to hear the Emperor has regained the whole of Italy
none	none	 With every good wish believe me dear Sir your most obliged and affectionate HORATIO NELSON ninth August I have intercepted all Buonaparte s dispatches going to France This army is in a scrape and will not get out of it VI August twelfth seventeen ninety eight 
5628-47240-0032	train-other-500	MY DEAR SIR As the greater part of this squadron is going down the Mediterranean
none	none	 we shall not want the quantity of wine or bread ordered 
5628-47240-0033	train-other-500	therefore what is not already prepared had better be put a stop to I will settle all the matter if ever I live to see Naples
none	none	 I have the satisfaction to tell you the French army have got a complaint amongst them caused by the heat and nothing but water which will make Egypt the grave of the greatest part Ever your s faithfully HORATIO NELSON VII 
5628-47241-0000	train-other-500	Vanguard off Malta October twenty fourth seventeen ninety eight MY DEAR SIR I am just arrived off this place where I found Captain Ball
none	none	 and the Marquis de Niza From those officers I do not find such an immediate prospect of getting possession of the town 
5628-47241-0001	train-other-500	as the ministers at Naples seem to think All the country it is true is in possession of the islanders and I believe the French have not many luxuries in the town but as yet their bullocks are not eat up
none	none	 The Marquis tells me 
5628-47241-0002	train-other-500	the islanders want arms victuals mortars and cannon to annoy the town When I get the elect of the people on board I shall desire them to draw up a memorial for the King of Naples stating their wants and desires which I shall bring with me
5628-47241-0003	train-other-500	The Marquis sails for Naples to morrow morning Till he is gone I shall not do any thing about the island but I will be fully master of that subject before I leave this place God bless you is the sincere prayer of HORATIO NELSON
none	none	 VIII Vanguard off Malta 
5628-47241-0004	train-other-500	October twenty seventh seventeen ninety eight MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM
none	none	 Although I believe I shall be at Naples before the cutter yet I should be sorry to omit acknowledging your kind letter of the twenty sixth 
5628-47241-0005	train-other-500	When I come to Naples I can have nothing pleasant to say of the conduct of his Sicilian Majesty s ministers
none	none	 towards the inhabitants of Malta 
5628-47241-0006	train-other-500	who wish to be under the dominion of their legitimate Sovereign The total neglect and indifference with which they have been treated appears to me cruel in the extreme Had not the English supplied fifteen hundred stand of arms with
none	none	 bayonets cartouch boxes and ammunition c c and the Marquis supplied some few 
5628-47241-0007	train-other-500	and kept the spirit of those brave islanders from falling off they must long ago have bowed again to the French yoke Could you my dear Sir William
none	none	 have believed after what General Acton and the Marquis de Gallo had said 
5628-47241-0008	train-other-500	in our various conversations relative to this island
none	none	 that nothing had been sent by the Governor of Syracuse secretly was the word to us or openly to this island And I am farther assured that the Governor of Syracuse never had any orders sent him to supply the smallest article 
5628-47241-0009	train-other-500	I beg your Excellency will state this in confidence to General Acton I shall most assuredly tell it to the King The justice I owe myself now I feel employed in the service of their Sicilian Majesties demands it of me and also
5628-47241-0010	train-other-500	the duty I owe our gracious King in order to shew that I am doing my utmost to comply with his royal commands As I have before stated had it not been for the English long long ago the Maltese must have been overpowered
none	none	 Including the fifteen hundred stand of arms given by us not more than three thousand are in the island I wonder how they have kept on the defensive so long The Emerald will sail in twenty four hours after my arrival for Malta at least two thousand stand of small arms complete ammunition c c should be sent by her This is wanted to defend themselves 
5628-47241-0011	train-other-500	for offence two or three large mortars fifteen hundred shells with all necessaries and perhaps a few artillery two ten inch howitzers with a thousand shells The Bormola and all the left side of the harbour with this assistance
5628-47241-0012	train-other-500	will fall Ten thousand men are required to defend those works the French can only spare twelve hundred therefore a vigorous assault in many parts some one must succeed But who have the government of Naples sent to lead or encourage these people
5628-47241-0013	train-other-500	A very good and I dare say brave old man enervated and shaking with the palsy
none	none	 This is the sort of man that they have sent 
5628-47241-0014	train-other-500	without any supply without even a promise of protection and without his bringing any answer to the repeated respectful memorials of these people to their Sovereign I know their Majesties must feel hurt when they hear these truths I may be thought presuming but I trust
5628-47241-0015	train-other-500	General Acton will forgive an honest seaman for telling plain truths As for the other minister I do not understand him we are different men He has been bred in a court and I in a rough element But I believe
5628-47241-0016	train-other-500	my heart is as susceptible of the finer feelings as his and as compassionate for the distress of those who look up to me for protection The officer sent here should have brought supplies promises of protection and an answer from the King to their memorials
5628-47241-0017	train-other-500	he should have been a man of judgment bravery and activity He should be the first to lead them to glory and the last when necessary to retreat the first to mount the walls of the Bormola and never to quit it This is the man to send Such many such are to be found
5628-47241-0018	train-other-500	If he succeeds promise him rewards my life for it the business would soon be over God bless you I am anxious to get this matter finished I have sent Ball this day to summon Goza if it resists I shall send on shore and batter down the castle
none	none	 Three vessels loaded with bullocks c for the garrison were taken yesterday from Tripoli ten more are coming 
5628-47241-0019	train-other-500	but we shall have them I had almost forgot to mention that orders should be immediately given that no quarantine should be laid on boats going to the coast of Sicily for corn
none	none	 At present as a matter of favour 
5628-47241-0020	train-other-500	they have fourteen days only Yesterday there was only four days bread in the island Luckily we got hold of a vessel loaded with wheat
none	none	 and sent her into saint Paul s Once more God bless you and ever believe me your obliged and affectionate HORATIO NELSON This day I have landed twenty barrels of gunpowder two thousand eight hundred pounds at Malta IX Palermo 
5628-47241-0021	train-other-500	January tenth eighteen hundred SIR Your Excellency having had the goodness to communicate to me a dispatch from General Acton together with several letters from Girganti
5628-47241-0022	train-other-500	giving an account that a violence had been committed in that port by the seizing and carrying off to Malta two vessels loaded with corn
none	none	 I beg leave to express to your Excellency my real concern 
5628-47241-0023	train-other-500	that even the appearance of the slightest disrespect should be offered by any officers under my command to the flag of his Sicilian Majesty and I must request your Excellency to state fully to General Acton
5628-47241-0024	train-other-500	that the act ought not to be considered as any intended disrespect to his Sicilian Majesty but as an act of the most absolute and imperious necessity either that the island of Malta should have been delivered up to the French
5628-47241-0025	train-other-500	or that the King s orders should be anticipated for these vessels carrying their cargoes of corn to Malta I trust that the government of this country will never again force any of our Royal Master s servants to so unpleasant an alternative
none	none	 I have the honour to be with the greatest respect your Excellency s most obedient and faithful servant B N X 
5628-47241-0026	train-other-500	March eighth eighteen hundred MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM
none	none	 I thank you kindly for all your letters and good wishes 
5628-47241-0027	train-other-500	It is my determination my health requiring it to come to Palermo and to stay two weeks with you I must again urge that four gunb oats may be ordered for the service of Malta they will most essentially assist in the reduction of the place
5628-47241-0028	train-other-500	by preventing small vessels from getting in or out I think from the enemy on the night of the fourth
none	none	 trying and getting out for a short distance 
5628-47241-0029	train-other-500	a very fast sailing polacca that Vaubois is extremely anxious to send dispatches to France to say he cannot much longer hold out
none	none	 and if our troops as Captain Blackwood thinks are coming from Gibraltar and Minorca I have no idea the enemy will hold out a week I beg General Acton will order the gun boats Troubridge has got the jaundice and is very ill As I shall so very soon see you I shall only say that I am ever your obliged and affectionate BRONTE NELSON XI 
5628-47241-0030	train-other-500	Palermo March thirtieth eighteen hundred MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM As from the orders I have given to all the ships under my command to arrest and bring into port all the vessels and troops returning by convention with the Porte to France
none	none	 and as the Russian ships have similar orders I must request that your Excellency will endeavour to arrange with the government of this country how in the first instance they are to be treated and received in the ports of the Two Sicilies for it is obvious I can do nothing more than bring them into port and if they are kept on board ship 
5628-47241-0031	train-other-500	the fever will make such ravages as to be little short of the plague It is a very serious consideration for this country either to receive them or let them pass when they would invade probably these kingdoms
5628-47241-0032	train-other-500	In my present situation in the King s fleet I have only to obey
none	none	 had I been as before in the command 
5628-47241-0033	train-other-500	I should have gone one short and direct road to avert this great evil viz to have sent a letter to the French and the Grand Vizir in Egypt that I would not on any consideration permit a single Frenchman to leave Egypt
5628-47241-0034	train-other-500	and I would do it at the risk of even creating a coldness for the moment with the Turks Of two evils choose the least and nothing can be so horrid as permitting that horde of thieves to return to Europe
5628-47241-0035	train-other-500	If all the wise heads had left them to God Almighty after the bridge was broke all would have ended well For I differ entirely with my Commander in Chief
none	none	 in wishing they were permitted to return to France and likewise with Lord Elgin 
5628-47241-0036	train-other-500	in the great importance of removing them from Egypt No there they should perish has ever been the firm determination of your Excellency s most obedient and faithful servant BRONTE NELSON OF THE NILE
none	none	 XII Palermo April tenth eighteen hundred MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM Reports are brought to me that the Spanish ships of war in this port are preparing to put to sea a circumstance which must be productive of very unpleasant consequences to both England and this country 
5628-47241-0037	train-other-500	It is fully known with what exactness I have adhered to the neutrality of this port for upon our arrival here from Naples in December seventeen ninety eight from the conduct of his Catholic Majesty s minister I should have been fully justified in seizing those ships
5628-47241-0038	train-other-500	We know that one object of the Spanish fleet combined with the French was to wrest entirely from the hands of his Sicilian Majesty his kingdoms of the Two Sicilies The Spaniards are by bad councils the tools of the French
5628-47241-0039	train-other-500	and of course the bitter enemy of his Sicilian Majesty and family The conduct I have pursued towards these ships circumstanced as they are has been moderate and truly considerate towards his Sicilian Majesty The time is now come that
none	none	 profiting of my forbearance the Spanish ships are fitting for sea It is not possible if they persist in their preparations that I can avoid attacking them even in the port of Palermo for they never can or shall be suffered to go to sea and placed in a situation of assisting the French 
5628-47241-0040	train-other-500	against not only Great Britain but also the Two Sicilies I have therefore to request that your Excellency will convey my sentiments on this very delicate subject to his Sicilian Majesty s ministers that they may take measures to prevent such a truly unpleasant event happening
none	none	 which would be as much against my wish as it can be against their s and I request that your Excellency will through its proper channel assure his Sicilian Majesty that his safety and honour is as dear to me as that of our Royal Master I have the honour to be with the greatest respect my dear Sir William your Excellency s most affectionate humble servant BRONTE NELSON OF THE NILE THE END
