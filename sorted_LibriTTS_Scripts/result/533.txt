none	none	 five See here See here demanded the Cardinal Chapter one Good cheer Good cheer exulted the Cardinal He darted through the orange orchard searching for slugs for his breakfast and between whiles he rocked on the branches and rang over his message of encouragement to men The song of the Cardinal was overflowing with joy for this was his holiday his playtime The southern world was filled with brilliant sunshine gaudy flowers an abundance of fruit myriads of insects and never a thing to do except to bathe feast and be happy No wonder his song was a prophecy of good cheer for the future for happiness made up the whole of his past The Cardinal was only a yearling yet his crest flared high his beard was crisp and black and he was a very prodigy in size and colouring Fathers of his family that had accomplished many migrations appeared small beside him and coats that had been shed season after season seemed dull compared with his It was as if a pulsing heart of flame passed by when he came winging through the orchard Last season the Cardinal had pipped his shell away to the north in that paradise of the birds the Limberlost There thousands of acres of black marsh muck stretch under summers sun and winters snows There are darksome pools of murky water bits of swale and high morass Giants of the forest reach skyward or coated with velvet slime lie decaying in sun flecked pools while the underbrush is almost impenetrable The swamp resembles a big dining table for the birds Wild grape vines clamber to the tops of the highest trees spreading umbrella wise over the branches and their festooned floating trailers wave as silken fringe in the play of the wind The birds loll in the shade peel bark gather dried curlers for nest material and feast on the pungent fruit They chatter in swarms over the wild cherry trees and overload their crops with red haws wild plums papaws blackberries and mandrake The alders around the edge draw flocks in search of berries and the marsh grasses and weeds are weighted with seed hunters The muck is alive with worms and the whole swamp ablaze with flowers whose colours and perfumes attract myriads of insects and butterflies Wild creepers flaunt their red and gold from the treetops and the bumblebees and humming birds make common cause in rifling the honey laden trumpets The air around the wild plum and redhaw trees is vibrant with the beating wings of millions of wild bees and the bee birds feast to gluttony The fetid odours of the swamp draw insects in swarms and fly catchers tumble and twist in air in pursuit of them Every hollow tree homes its colony of bats Snakes sun on the bushes The water folk leave trails of shining ripples in their wake as they cross the lagoons Turtles waddle clumsily from the logs Frogs take graceful leaps from pool to pool Everything native to that section of the country underground creeping or a wing can be found in the Limberlost but above all the birds Dainty green warblers nest in its tree tops and red eyed vireos choose a location below It is the home of bell birds finches and thrushes There are flocks of blackbirds grackles and crows Jays and catbirds quarrel constantly and marsh wrens keep up never ending chatter Orioles swing their pendent purses from the branches and with the tanagers picnic on mulberries and insects In the evening night hawks dart on silent wing whippoorwills set up a plaintive cry that they continue far into the night and owls revel in moonlight and rich hunting At dawn robins wake the echoes of each new day with the admonition Cheer up Cheer up and a little later big black vultures go wheeling through cloudland or hang there like frozen splashes searching the Limberlost and the surrounding country for food The boom of the bittern resounds all day and above it the rasping scream of the blue heron as he strikes terror to the hearts of frogdom while the occasional cries of a lost loon strayed from its flock in northern migration fill the swamp with sounds of wailing Flashing through the tree tops of the Limberlost there are birds whose colour is more brilliant than that of the gaudiest flower lifting its face to light and air The lilies of the mire are not so white as the white herons that fish among them The ripest spray of goldenrod is not so highly coloured as the burnished gold on the breast of the oriole that rocks on it The jays are bluer than the calamus bed they wrangle above with throaty chatter The finches are a finer purple than the ironwort For every clump of foxfire flaming in the Limberlost there is a cardinal glowing redder on a bush above it These may not be more numerous than other birds but their brilliant colouring and the fearless disposition make them seem so The Cardinal was hatched in a thicket of sweetbrier and blackberry His father was a tough old widower of many experiences and variable temper He was the biggest most aggressive redbird in the Limberlost and easily reigned king of his kind Catbirds king birds and shrikes gave him a wide berth and not even the ever quarrelsome jays plucked up enough courage to antagonize him A few days after his latest bereavement he saw a fine plump young female and she so filled his eye that he gave her no rest until she permitted his caresses and carried the first twig to the wild rose She was very proud to mate with the king of the Limberlost and if deep in her heart she felt transient fears of her lordly master she gave no sign for she was a bird of goodly proportion and fine feather herself She chose her location with the eye of an artist and the judgment of a nest builder of more experience It would be difficult for snakes and squirrels to penetrate that briery thicket The white berry blossoms scarcely had ceased to attract a swarm of insects before the sweets of the roses recalled them by the time they had faded luscious big berries ripened within reach and drew food hunters She built with far more than ordinary care It was a beautiful nest not nearly so carelessly made as those of her kindred all through the swamp There was a distinct attempt at a cup shape and it really was neatly lined with dried blades of sweet marsh grass But it was in the laying of her first egg that the queen cardinal forever distinguished herself She was a fine healthy bird full of love and happiness over her first venture in nest building and she so far surpassed herself on that occasion she had difficulty in convincing any one that she was responsible for the result Indeed she was compelled to lift beak and wing against her mate in defense of this egg for it was so unusually large that he could not be persuaded short of force that some sneak of the feathered tribe had not slipped in and deposited it in her absence The king felt sure there was something wrong with the egg and wanted to roll it from the nest but the queen knew her own and stoutly battled for its protection She further increased their prospects by laying three others After that the king made up his mind that she was a most remarkable bird and went away pleasure seeking but the queen settled to brooding a picture of joyous faith and contentment Through all the long days when the heat became intense and the king was none too thoughtful of her appetite or comfort she nestled those four eggs against her breast and patiently waited The big egg was her treasure She gave it constant care Many times in a day she turned it and always against her breast there was the individual pressure that distinguished it from the others It was the first to hatch of course and the queen felt that she had enough if all the others failed her for this egg pipped with a resounding pip and before the silky down was really dry on the big terracotta body the young Cardinal arose and lustily demanded food The king came to see him and at once acknowledged subjugation He was the father of many promising cardinals yet he never had seen one like this He set the Limberlost echoes rolling with his jubilant rejoicing He unceasingly hunted for the ripest berries and seed He stuffed that baby from morning until night and never came with food that he did not find him standing a top the others calling for more The queen was just as proud of him and quite as foolish in her idolatry but she kept tally and gave the remainder every other worm in turn They were unusually fine babies but what chance has merely a fine baby in a family that possesses a prodigy The Cardinal was as large as any two of the other nestlings and so red the very down on him seemed tinged with crimson his skin and even his feet were red He was the first to climb to the edge of the nest and the first to hop on a limb He surprised his parents by finding a slug and winged his first flight to such a distance that his adoring mother almost went into spasms lest his strength might fail and he would fall into the swamp and become the victim of a hungry old turtle He returned safely however and the king was so pleased he hunted him an unusually ripe berry and perching before him gave him his first language lesson Of course the Cardinal knew how to cry Pee and Chee when he burst his shell but the king taught him to chip with accuracy and expression and he learned that very day that male birds of the cardinal family always call Chip and the females Chook In fact he learned so rapidly and was generally so observant that before the king thought it wise to give the next lesson he found him on a limb his beak closed his throat swelling practising his own rendering of the tribal calls Wheat Wheat Wheat Here Here Here and Cheer Cheer Cheer This so delighted the king that he whistled them over and over and helped the youngster all he could He was so proud of him that this same night he gave him his first lesson in tucking his head properly and going to sleep alone In a few more days when he was sure of his wing strength he gave him instructions in flying He taught him how to spread his wings and slowly sail from tree to tree how to fly in short broken curves to avoid the aim of a hunter how to turn abruptly in air and make a quick dash after a bug or an enemy He taught him the proper angle at which to breast a stiff wind and that he always should meet a storm head first so that the water would run as the plumage lay His first bathing lesson was a pronounced success The Cardinal enjoyed water like a duck He bathed splashed and romped until his mother was almost crazy for fear he would attract a watersnake or turtle but the element of fear was not a part of his disposition He learned to dry dress and plume his feathers and showed such remarkable pride in keeping himself immaculate that although only a youngster he was already a bird of such great promise that many of the feathered inhabitants of the Limberlost came to pay him a call Next the king took him on a long trip around the swamp and taught him to select the proper places to hunt for worms how to search under leaves for plant lice and slugs for meat which berries were good and safe and the kind of weeds that bore the most and best seeds He showed him how to find tiny pebbles to grind his food and how to sharpen and polish his beak Then he took up the real music lessons and taught him how to whistle and how to warble and trill Good Cheer Good Cheer intoned the king Coo Cher Coo Cher imitated the Cardinal These songs were only studied repetitions but there was a depth and volume in his voice that gave promise of future greatness when age should have developed him and experience awakened his emotions He was an excellent musician for a youngster He soon did so

none	none	in caring for himself in finding food and in flight and grew so big and independent that he made numerous excursions alone through the Limberlost and so impressive were his proportions and so aggressive his manner that he suffered no molestation In fact the reign of the king promised to end speedily but if he feared it he made no sign and his pride in his wonderful offspring was always manifest After the Cardinal had explored the swamp thoroughly a longing for a wider range grew upon him and day after day he lingered around the borders looking across the wide cultivated fields almost aching to test his wings in one long high wild stretch of flight A day came when the heat of the late summer set the marsh steaming and the Cardinal flying close to the borders caught the breeze from the upland and the vision of broad fields stretching toward the north so enticed him that he spread his wings and following the line of trees and fences as much as possible he made his first journey from home That day was so delightful it decided his fortunes It would seem that the swamp so appreciated by his kindred should have been sufficient for the Cardinal but it was not With every mile he winged his flight came a greater sense of power and strength and a keener love for the broad sweep of field and forest His heart bounded with the zest of rocking on the wind racing through the sunshine and sailing over the endless panorama of waving corn fields and woodlands The heat and closeness of the Limberlost seemed a prison well escaped as on and on he flew in straight untiring flight Crossing a field of half ripened corn that sloped to the river the Cardinal saw many birds feeding there so he alighted on a tall tree to watch them Soon he decided that he would like to try this new food He found a place where a crow had left an ear nicely laid open and clinging to the husk as he saw the others do he stretched to his full height and drove his strong sharp beak into the creamy grain After the stifling swamp hunting after the long exciting flight to rock on this swaying corn and drink the rich milk of the grain was to the Cardinal his first taste of nectar and ambrosia He lifted his head when he came to the golden kernel and chipping it in tiny specks he tasted and approved with all the delight of an epicure in a delicious new dish Perhaps there were other treats in the next field He decided to fly even farther But he had gone only a short distance when he changed his course and turned to the South for below him was a long shining creeping thing fringed with willows while towering above them were giant sycamore maple tulip and elm trees that caught and rocked with the wind and the Cardinal did not know what it was Filled with wonder he dropped lower and lower Birds were everywhere many flying over and dipping into it but its clear creeping silver was a mystery to the Cardinal The beautiful river of poetry and song that the Indians first discovered and later with the French named Ouabache the winding shining river that Logan and Me shin go me sia loved the only river that could tempt Wa ca company nah from the Salamonie and Mississinewa the river beneath whose silver sycamores and giant maples Chief Godfrey pitched his campfires was never more beautiful than on that perfect autumn day With his feathers pressed closely the Cardinal alighted on a willow and leaned to look quivering with excitement and uttering explosive chips for there he was face to face with a big redbird that appeared neither peaceful nor timid He uttered an impudent Chip of challenge which as it left his beak was flung back to him The Cardinal flared his crest and half lifted his wings stiffening them at the butt the bird he was facing did the same In his surprise he arose to his full height with a dexterous little side step and the other bird straightened and side stepped exactly with him This was too insulting for the Cardinal Straining every muscle he made a dash at the impudent stranger He struck the water with such force that it splashed above the willows and a kingfisher stationed on a stump opposite him watching the shoals for minnows saw it He spread his beak and rolled forth rattling laughter until his voice reechoed from point to point down the river The Cardinal scarcely knew how he got out but he had learned a new lesson That beautiful shining creeping thing was water not thick tepid black marsh water but pure cool silver water He shook his plumage feeling a degree redder from shame but he would not be laughed into leaving He found it too delightful In a short time he ventured down and took a sip and it was the first real drink of his life Oh but it was good When thirst from the heat and his long flight was quenched he ventured in for a bath and that was a new and delightful experience How he splashed and splashed and sent the silver drops flying How he ducked and soaked and cooled in that rippling water in which he might remain as long as he pleased and splash his fill for he could see the bottom for a long distance all around and easily could avoid anything attempting to harm him He was so wet when his bath was finished he scarcely could reach a bush to dry and dress his plumage Once again in perfect feather he remembered the bird of the water and returned to the willow There in the depths of the shining river the Cardinal discovered himself and his heart swelled big with just pride Was that broad full breast his Where had he seen any other cardinal with a crest so high it waved in the wind How big and black his eyes were and his beard was almost as long and crisp as his father s He spread his wings and gloated on their sweep and twisted and flirted his tail He went over his toilet again and dressed every feather on him He scoured the back of his neck with the butt of his wings and tucking his head under them slowly drew it out time after time to polish his crest He turned and twisted He rocked and paraded and every glimpse he caught of his size and beauty filled him with pride He strutted like a peacock and chattered like a jay When he could find no further points to admire something else caught his attention When he chipped there was an answering Chip across the river certainly there was no cardinal there so it must be that he was hearing his own voice as well as seeing himself Selecting a conspicuous perch he sent an incisive Chip across the water and in kind it came back to him Then he chipped softly and tenderly as he did in the Limberlost to a favourite little sister who often came and perched beside him in the maple where he slept and softly and tenderly came the answer Then the Cardinal understood Wheat Wheat Wheat He whistled it high and he whistled it low Cheer Cheer Cheer He whistled it tenderly and sharply and imperiously Here Here Here At this ringing command every bird as far as the river carried his voice came to investigate and remained to admire Over and over he rang every change he could invent He made a gallant effort at warbling and trilling and then with the gladdest heart he ever had known he burst into ringing song Good Cheer Good Cheer Good Cheer As evening came on he grew restless and uneasy so he slowly winged his way back to the Limberlost but that day forever spoiled him for a swamp bird In the night he restlessly ruffled his feathers and sniffed for the breeze of the meadows He tasted the corn and the clear water again He admired his image in the river and longed for the sound of his voice until he began murmuring Wheat Wheat Wheat in his sleep In the earliest dawn a robin awoke him singing Cheer up Cheer up and he answered with a sleepy Cheer Cheer Cheer Later the robin sang again with exquisite softness and tenderness Cheer up Dearie Cheer up Dearie Cheer up Cheer up Cheer The Cardinal now fully awakened shouted lustily Good Cheer Good Cheer and after that it was only a short time until he was on his way toward the shining river It was better than before and every following day found him feasting in the corn field and bathing in the shining water but he always returned to his family at nightfall When black frosts began to strip the Limberlost and food was almost reduced to dry seed there came a day on which the king marshalled his followers and gave the magic signal With dusk he led them southward mile after mile until their breath fell short and their wings ached with unaccustomed flight but because of the trips to the river the Cardinal was stronger than the others and he easily kept abreast of the king In the early morning even before the robins were awake the king settled in the Everglades But the Cardinal had lost all liking for swamp life so he stubbornly set out alone and in a short time he had found another river It was not quite so delightful as the shining river but still it was beautiful and on its gently sloping bank was an orange orchard There the Cardinal rested and found a winter home after his heart s desire The following morning a golden haired little girl and an old 
8195_117382_000038_000001	train-clean-360	man 
none	none	with snowy locks came hand in hand through the orchard The child saw the redbird and immediately claimed him and that same day the edict went forth that a very dreadful time was in store for any one who harmed or even frightened the Cardinal So in security began a series of days that were pure delight The orchard was alive with insects attracted by the heavy odours and slugs infested the bark Feasting was almost as good as in the Limberlost and always there was the river to drink from and to splash in at will In those days the child and the old man lingered for hours in the orchard watching the bird that every day seemed to grow bigger and brighter What a picture his coat now a bright cardinal red made against the waxy green leaves How big and brilliant he seemed as he raced and darted in play among the creamy blossoms How the little girl stood with clasped hands worshipping him as with swelling throat he rocked on the highest spray and sang his inspiring chorus over and over Good Cheer Good Cheer Every day they came to watch and listen They scattered crumbs and the Cardinal grew so friendly that he greeted their coming with a quick Chip Chip while the delighted child tried to repeat it after him Soon they became such friends that when he saw them approaching he would call softly Chip Chip and then with beady eyes and tilted head await her reply Sometimes a member of his family from the Everglades found his way into the orchard and the Cardinal having grown to feel a sense of proprietorship resented the intrusion and pursued him like a streak of flame Whenever any straggler had this experience he returned to the swamp realizing that the Cardinal of the orange orchard was almost twice his size and strength and so startlingly red as to be a wonder One day a gentle breeze from the north sprang up and stirred the orange branches wafting the heavy perfume across the land and out to sea and spread in its stead a cool delicate pungent odour The Cardinal lifted his head and whistled an inquiring note He was not certain and went on searching for slugs and predicting happiness in full round notes Good Cheer Good Cheer Again the odour swept the orchard so strong that this time there was no mistaking it The Cardinal darted to the topmost branch his crest flaring his tail twitching nervously Chip Chip he cried with excited insistence Chip Chip The breeze was coming stiffly and steadily now unlike anything the Cardinal ever had known for its cool breath told of ice bound fields breaking up under the sun Its damp touch was from the spring showers washing the face of the northland Its subtle odour was the commingling of myriads of unfolding leaves and crisp plants upspringing its pungent perfume was the pollen of catkins Up in the land of the Limberlost old Mother Nature with strident muttering had set about her annual house cleaning With her efficient broom the March wind she was sweeping every nook and cranny clean With her scrub bucket overflowing with April showers she was washing the face of all creation and if these measures failed to produce cleanliness to her satisfaction she gave a final polish with storms of hail The shining river was filled to overflowing breaking up the ice and carrying a load of refuse it went rolling to the sea The ice and snow had not altogether gone but the long pregnant earth was mothering her children She cringed at every step for the ground was teeming with life Bug and worm were working to light and warmth Thrusting aside the mold and leaves above them spring beauties hepaticas and violets lifted tender golden green heads The sap was flowing and leafless trees were covered with swelling buds Delicate mosses were creeping over every stick of decaying timber The lichens on stone and fence were freshly painted in unending shades of gray and green Myriads of flowers and vines were springing up to cover last year s decaying leaves The beautiful uncut hair of graves was creeping over meadow spreading beside roadways and blanketing every naked spot The Limberlost was waking to life even ahead of the fields and the river Through the winter it had been the barest and dreariest of places but now the earliest signs of returning spring were in its martial music for when the green hyla pipes and the bullfrog drums the bird voices soon join them The catkins bloomed first and then in an incredibly short time flags rushes and vines were like a sea of waving green and swelling buds were ready to burst In the upland the smoke was curling over sugar camp and clearing in the forests animals were rousing from their long sleep the shad were starting anew their never ending journey up the shining river peeps of green were mantling hilltop and valley and the northland was ready for its dearest springtime treasures to come home again From overhead were ringing those first glad notes caught nearer the Throne than those of any other bird Spring o year Spring o year while stilt legged little killdeers were scudding around the Limberlost and beside the river flinging from cloudland their Kill deer Kill deer call The robins in the orchards were pulling the long dried blades of last year s grass from beneath the snow to line their mud walled cups and the bluebirds were at the hollow apple tree Flat on the top rail the doves were gathering their few coarse sticks and twigs together It was such a splendid place to set their cradle The weatherbeaten rotting old rails were the very colour of the busy dove mother Her red rimmed eye fitted into the background like a tiny scarlet lichen cup Surely no one would ever see her The Limberlost and shining river the fields and forests the wayside bushes and fences the stumps logs hollow trees even the bare brown breast of Mother Earth were all waiting to cradle their own again and by one of the untold miracles each would return to its place There was intoxication in the air The subtle pungent ravishing odours on the wind of unfolding leaves ice water washed plants and catkin pollen were an elixir to humanity The cattle of the field were fairly drunk with it and herds dry fed during the winter were coming to their first grazing with heads thrown high romping bellowing and racing like wild things The north wind sweeping from icy fastnesses caught this odour of spring and carried it to the orange orchards and Everglades and at a breath of it crazed with excitement the Cardinal went flaming through the orchard for with no one to teach him he knew what it meant The call had come Holidays were over It was time to go home time to riot in crisp freshness time to go courting time to make love time to possess his own time for mating and nest building All that day he flashed around nervous with dread of the unknown and palpitant with delightful expectation but with the coming of dusk he began his journey northward When he passed the Everglades he winged his way slowly and repeatedly sent down a challenging Chip but there was no answer Then the Cardinal knew that the north wind had carried a true message for the king and his followers were ahead of him on their way to the Limberlost Mile after mile a thing of pulsing fire he breasted the blue black night and it was not so very long until he could discern a flickering patch of darkness sweeping the sky before him The Cardinal flew steadily in a straight sweep until with a throb of triumph in his heart he arose in his course and from far overhead flung down a boastful challenge to the king and his followers as he sailed above them and was lost from sight It was still dusky with the darkness of night when he crossed the Limberlost dropping low enough to see its branches laid bare to catch a gleam of green in its swelling buds and to hear the wavering chorus of its frogs But there was no hesitation in his flight Straight and sure he winged his way toward the shining river and it was only a few more miles until the rolling waters of its springtime flood caught his eye Dropping precipitately he plunged his burning beak into the loved water then he flew into a fine old stag sumac and tucked his head under his wing for a short rest He had made the long flight in one unbroken sweep and he was sleepy In utter content he ruffled his feathers and closed his eyes for he was beside the shining river and it would be another season before the orange orchard would ring again with his Good Cheer Good Cheer Chapter two Wet year Wet year prophesied the Cardinal 
8195_117382_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The sumac seemed to fill his idea of a perfect location from the very first 
8195_117382_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He perched on a limb and between dressing his plumage and pecking at last year s sour dried berries he sent abroad his prediction 
8195_117382_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Old Mother Nature verified his wisdom by sending a dashing shower but he cared not at all for a wetting 
none	none	He knew how to turn his crimson suit into the most perfect of water proof coats so he flattened his crest sleeked his feathers and breasting the April downpour kept on calling for rain 
8195_117382_000002_000004	train-clean-360	He knew he would appear brighter when it was past and he seemed to know too that every day of sunshine and shower would bring nearer his heart s desire 
8195_117382_000003_000000	train-clean-360	He was a very Beau Brummel while he waited 
8195_117382_000003_000001	train-clean-360	From morning until night he bathed dressed his feathers sunned himself fluffed and flirted He strutted and chipped incessantly 
8195_117382_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He claimed that sumac for his very own and stoutly battled for possession with many intruders 
none	none	It grew on a densely wooded slope and the shining river went singing between grassy banks whitened with spring beauties below it 
8195_117382_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Crowded around it were thickets of papaw wild grape vines thorn dogwood and red haw that attracted bug and insect and just across the old snake fence was a field of mellow mould sloping to the river that soon would be plowed for corn turning out numberless big fat grubs 
8195_117382_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He was compelled almost hourly to wage battles for his location for there was something fine about the old stag sumac that attracted homestead seekers 
none	none	A sober pair of robins began laying their foundations there the morning the Cardinal arrived and a couple of blackbirds tried to take possession before the day had passed 
8195_117382_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He had little trouble with the robins 
none	none	They were easily conquered and with small protest settled a rod up the bank in a wild plum tree but the air was thick with chips chatter and red and black feathers before the blackbirds acknowledged defeat They were old timers and knew about the grubs and the young corn but they also knew when they were beaten so they moved down stream to a scrub oak trying to assure each other that it was the place they really had wanted from the first 
8195_117382_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The Cardinal was left boasting and strutting in the sumac but in his heart he found it lonesome business 
8195_117382_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Being the son of a king he was much too dignified to beg for a mate and besides it took all his time to guard the sumac but his eyes were wide open to all that went on around him and he envied the blackbird his glossy devoted little sweetheart with all his might 
8195_117382_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He almost strained his voice trying to rival the love song of a skylark that hung among the clouds above a meadow across the river and poured down to his mate a story of adoring love and sympathy 
8195_117382_000005_000003	train-clean-360	He screamed a Chip of such savage jealousy at a pair of killdeer lovers that he sent them scampering down the river bank without knowing that the crime of which they stood convicted was that of being mated when he was not 
none	none	As for the doves that were already brooding on the line fence beneath the maples the Cardinal was torn between two opinions He was alone he was love sick and he was holding the finest building location beside the shining river for his mate and her slowness in coming made their devotion difficult to endure when he coveted a true love but it seemed to the Cardinal that he never could so forget himself as to emulate the example of that dove lover 
8195_117382_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The dove had no dignity he was so effusive he was a nuisance 
8195_117382_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He kept his dignified Quaker mate stuffed to discomfort he clung to the side of the nest trying to help brood until he almost crowded her from the eggs 
8195_117382_000006_000003	train-clean-360	He pestered her with caresses and cooed over his love song until every chipmunk on the line fence was familiar with his story 
8195_117382_000006_000004	train-clean-360	The Cardinal s temper was worn to such a fine edge that he darted at the dove one day and pulled a big tuft of feathers from his back 
none	none	When he had returned to the sumac he was compelled to admit that his anger lay quite as much in that he had no one to love as because the dove was disgustingly devoted 
8195_117382_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Every morning brought new arrivals trim young females fresh from their long holiday and big boastful males appearing their brightest and bravest each singer almost splitting his throat in the effort to captivate the mate he coveted 
none	none	They came flashing down the river bank like rockets of scarlet gold blue and black rocking on the willows splashing in the water bursting into jets of melody making every possible display of their beauty and music and at times fighting fiercely when they discovered that the females they were wooing favoured their rivals and desired only to be friendly with them 
8195_117382_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The heart of the Cardinal sank as he watched 
none	none	There was not a member of his immediate family among them 
8195_117382_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He pitied himself as he wondered if fate had in store for him the trials he saw others suffering 
8195_117382_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Those dreadful feathered females 
8195_117382_000008_000004	train-clean-360	How they coquetted 
8195_117382_000008_000005	train-clean-360	How they flirted 
8195_117382_000008_000006	train-clean-360	How they sleeked and flattened their plumage and with half open beaks and sparkling eyes hopped closer and closer as if charmed 
none	none	The eager singers with swelling throats sang and sang in a very frenzy of extravagant pleading but just when they felt sure their little loves were on the point of surrender a rod distant above the bushes would go streaks of feathers and there was nothing left but to endure the bitter disappointment follow them and begin all over For the last three days the Cardinal had been watching his cousin rose breasted Grosbeak make violent love to the most exquisite little female who apparently encouraged his advances only to see him left sitting as blue and disconsolate as any human lover when he discovers that the maid who has coquetted with him for a season belongs to another man 
8195_117382_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The Cardinal flew to the very top of the highest sycamore and looked across country toward the Limberlost 
none	none	Should he go there seeking a swamp mate among his kindred 
8195_117382_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It was not an endurable thought 
none	none	To be sure matters were becoming serious 
8195_117382_000009_000004	train-clean-360	No bird beside the shining river had plumed paraded or made more music than he 
8195_117382_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Was it all to be wasted 
8195_117382_000009_000006	train-clean-360	By this time he confidently had expected results 
8195_117382_000009_000007	train-clean-360	Only that morning he had swelled with pride as he heard missus Jay tell her quarrelsome husband that she wished she could exchange him for the Cardinal 
none	none	Did not the gentle dove pause by the sumac when she left brooding to take her morning dip in the dust and gaze at him with unconcealed admiration 
8195_117382_000009_000009	train-clean-360	No doubt she devoutly wished her plain pudgy husband wore a scarlet coat 
8195_117382_000009_000010	train-clean-360	But it is praise from one s own sex that is praise indeed and only an hour ago the lark had reported that from his lookout above cloud he saw no other singer anywhere so splendid as the Cardinal of the sumac 
8195_117382_000009_000011	train-clean-360	Because of these things he held fast to his conviction that he was a prince indeed and he decided to remain in his chosen location and with his physical and vocal attractions compel the finest little cardinal in the fields to seek him 
none	none	He planned it all very carefully how she would hear his splendid music and come to take a peep at him how she would be captivated by his size and beauty how she would come timidly but come of course for his approval how he would condescend to accept her if she pleased him in all particulars how she would be devoted to him and how she would approve his choice of a home for the sumac was in a lovely spot for scenery as well as nest building 
8195_117382_000011_000000	train-clean-360	For several days he had boasted he had bantered he had challenged he had on this last day almost condescended to coaxing but not one little bright eyed cardinal female had come to offer herself 
8195_117382_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The performance of a brown thrush drove him wild with envy 
8195_117382_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The thrush came gliding up the river bank a rusty coated sneaking thing of the underbrush and taking possession of a thorn bush just opposite the sumac he sang for an hour in the open 
8195_117382_000012_000002	train-clean-360	There was no way to improve that music 
none	none	It was woven fresh from the warp and woof of his fancy It was a song so filled with the joy and gladness of spring notes so thrilled with love s pleading and passion s tender pulsing pain that at its close there were a half dozen admiring thrush females gathered around 
8195_117382_000012_000004	train-clean-360	With care and deliberation the brown thrush selected the most attractive and she followed him to the thicket as if charmed 
8195_117382_000013_000000	train-clean-360	It was the Cardinal s dream materialized for another before his very eyes and it filled him with envy 
none	none	If that plain brown bird that slinked as if he had a theft to account for could by showing himself and singing for an hour win a mate why should not he the most gorgeous bird of the woods openly flaunting his charms and discoursing his music have at least equal success 
8195_117382_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Should he the proudest most magnificent of cardinals be compelled to go seeking a mate like any common bird 
8195_117382_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Perish the thought 
8195_117382_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He went to the river to bathe 
none	none	After finding a spot where the water flowed crystal clear over a bed of white limestone he washed until he felt that he could be no cleaner Then the Cardinal went to his favourite sun parlour and stretching on a limb he stood his feathers on end and sunned fluffed and prinked until he was immaculate 
8195_117382_000015_000000	train-clean-360	On the tip top antler of the old stag sumac he perched and strained until his jetty whiskers appeared stubby 
8195_117382_000015_000001	train-clean-360	He poured out a tumultuous cry vibrant with every passion raging in him 
8195_117382_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He caught up his own rolling echoes and changed and varied them 
none	none	He improvised and set the shining river ringing Wet year Wet year 
8195_117382_000016_000000	train-clean-360	He whistled and whistled until all birdland and even mankind heard for the farmer paused at his kitchen door with his pails of foaming milk and called to his wife 
8195_117382_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Hear that Maria 
none	none	Jest hear it

8195_117382_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Abram grinned sheepishly 
8195_117382_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I m willin to call it the bird if you are Maria 
none	none	I ve been hearin him from the barn all day an there s somethin kind o human in his notes at takes me jest a little diffrunt from any other bird I ever noticed 
8195_117382_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I m really curious to set eyes on him

8195_117382_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Bosh exclaimed Maria

8195_117382_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It s jest the old Wabash rollin up the echoes 
none	none	A bird singin beside the river always sounds twicet as fine as one on the hills 
8195_117382_000020_000004	train-clean-360	I ve knowed that for forty year 
none	none	Chances are at he ll be gone fore you get there 
8195_117382_000021_000000	train-clean-360	As Abram opened the door Wet year 
none	none	Wet year pealed the flaming prophet 
8195_117382_000022_000000	train-clean-360	He went out closing the door softly and with an utter disregard for the corn field made a bee line for the musician 
none	none	I don t know as this is the best for twinges o rheumatiz he muttered as he turned up his collar and drew his old hat lower to keep the splashing drops from his face
8195_117382_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t jest rightly s pose I should go but I m free to admit I d as lief be dead as not to answer when I get a call an the fact is I m CALLED down beside the river 
none	none	Wet year 
8195_117382_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Wet year rolled the Cardinal s prediction 
8195_117382_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanky old fellow

none	none	I d like it powerful well if you d settle right here say bout where you are An where are you anyway 
8195_117382_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Abram went peering and dodging beside the fence peeping into the bushes searching for the bird 
none	none	Suddenly there was a whir of wings and a streak of crimson Scared you into the next county I s pose he muttered 
8195_117382_000028_000000	train-clean-360	But it came nearer being a scared man than a frightened bird for the Cardinal flashed straight toward him until only a few yards away and then swaying on a bush it chipped cheered peeked whistled broken notes and manifested perfect delight at the sight of the white haired old man 
8195_117382_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Abram stared in astonishment 
none	none	Lord A mighty he gasped
8195_117382_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Big as a blackbird red as a live coal an a comin right at me 
none	none	You are somebody s pet that s what you are An no you ain t either 
8195_117382_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Settin on a sawed stick in a little wire house takes all the ginger out of any bird an their feathers are always mussy

8195_117382_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Leaning toward Abram the Cardinal turned his head from side to side and peered chipped and waited for an answering Chip from a little golden haired child but there was no way for the man to know that 
none	none	It s jest as sure as fate he said You think you know me an you are tryin to tell me somethin Wish to land I knowed what you want Are you tryin to tell me Howdy Well I don t low nobody to be politer an I am so far as I know 
8195_117382_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Abram lifted his old hat and the raindrops glistened on his white hair 
8195_117382_000032_000001	train-clean-360	He squared his shoulders and stood very erect 
none	none	Howdy mister Redbird How d ye find yerself this evenin I don t jest riccolict ever seein you before but I ll never meet you agin thout knowin you When d you arrive Come through by the special midnight flyer did you

8195_117382_000033_000007	train-clean-360	How do you like it

8195_117382_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Look at the grass a creepin right down till it s a trailin in the water 
none	none	Did you ever see jest quite such fine fringy willers An you wait a little an the flowerin mallows at grows long the shinin old river are fine as garden hollyhocks Maria says at thy d be purtier an hers if they were only double but Lord mister Redbird they are See em once on the bank an agin in the water An back a little an there s jest thickets of papaw an thorns an wild grape vines an crab an red an black haw an dogwood an sumac an spicebush an trees Lord mister Redbird the sycamores an maples an tulip an ash an elm trees are so bustin fine long the old Wabash they put em into poetry books an sing songs about em What do you think o that Jest back o you a little there s a sycamore split into five trunks any one o them a famous big tree tops up mong the clouds an roots diggin under the old river an over a little farther s a maple at s eight big trees in one 
8195_117382_000034_000011	train-clean-360	Most anything you can name you can find it long this ole Wabash if you only know where to hunt for it

8195_117382_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Abram set a foot on the third rail and leaned his elbows on the top The Cardinal chipped delightedly and hopped and tilted closer 
none	none	I hadn t jest lowed all winter I d tackle this field again I ve turned it every spring for forty year Bought it when I was a young fellow jest married to Maria Shouldered a big debt on it but I always loved these slopin fields an my share of this old Wabash hasn t been for sale nor tradin any time this past forty year

8195_117382_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Abram took out his jack knife and dotting a row of grains along the top rail he split and shaved them down as fine as possible and as he reached one end of the rail the Cardinal with a spasmodic Chip dashed down and snatched a particle from the other and flashed back to the bush tested approved and chipped his thanks 
none	none	Pshaw now said Abram staring wide eyed Doesn t that beat you So you really are a pet Best kind of a pet in the whole world too Makin everybody at sees you happy an havin some chance to be happy yourself An I look like your friend Well Well I m monstrous willin to adopt you if you ll take me an as for feedin from to morrow on I ll find time to set your little table long this same rail every day I s pose Maria ull say at I m gone plumb crazy but for that matter if I ever get her down to see you jest once the trick s done with her too for you re the prettiest thing God ever made in the shape of a bird at I ever saw

8195_117382_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Here whistled the Cardinal 
8195_117382_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I m mighty glad if you re sayin you ll stay

8195_117382_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Abram straightened and touched his hat brim in a trim half military salute 
8195_117382_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Well good bye mister Redbird 
none	none	Never had more pleasure meetin anybody in my life cept first time I met Maria You think about the plowin an if you say stay it s a go Good bye an do be a little more careful o yourself 
8195_117382_000045_000005	train-clean-360	See you in the mornin right after breakfast no count taken o the weather 
none	none	Wet year 
8195_117382_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Wet year called the Cardinal after his retreating figure 
none	none	Abram turned and gravely saluted the second time 
8195_117382_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The Cardinal went to the top rail and feasted on the sweet grains of corn until his craw was full and then nestled in the sumac and went to sleep 
8195_117382_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Early next morning he was abroad and in fine toilet and with a full voice from the top of the sumac greeted the day Wet year 
none	none	Wet year Far down the river echoed his voice until it so closely resembled some member of his family replying that he followed searching the banks mile after mile on either side until finally he heard voices of his kind 
8195_117382_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He located them but it was only several staid old couples a long time mated and busy with their nest building 
none	none	The Cardinal returned to the sumac feeling a degree lonelier than ever 
8195_117382_000049_000000	train-clean-360	He decided to prospect in the opposite direction and taking wing he started up the river 
8195_117382_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Following the channel he winged his flight for miles over the cool sparkling water between the tangle of foliage bordering the banks 
none	none	When he came to the long cumbrous structures of wood with which men had bridged the river where the shuffling feet of tired farm horses raised clouds of dust and set the echoes rolling with their thunderous hoof beats he was afraid and rising high he sailed over them in short broken curves of flight But where giant maple and ash leaning locked branches across the channel in one of old Mother Nature s bridges for the squirrels he knew no fear and dipped so low beneath them that his image trailed a wavering shadow on the silver path he followed 
8195_117382_000050_000000	train-clean-360	He rounded curve after curve and frequently stopping on a conspicuous perch flung a ringing challenge in the face of the morning 
8195_117382_000050_000001	train-clean-360	With every mile the way he followed grew more beautiful 
8195_117382_000050_000002	train-clean-360	The river bed was limestone and the swiftly flowing water clear and limpid 
none	none	The banks were precipitate in some places gently sloping in others and always crowded with a tangle of foliage At an abrupt curve in the river he mounted to the summit of a big ash and made boastful prophecy Wet year Wet year and on all sides there sprang up the voices of his kind 
8195_117382_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Startled the Cardinal took wing 
none	none	He followed the river in a circling flight until he remembered that here might be the opportunity to win the coveted river mate and going slower to select the highest branch on which to display his charms he discovered that he was only a few yards from the ash from which he had made his prediction The Cardinal flew over the narrow neck and sent another call then without awaiting a reply again he flashed up the river and circled Horseshoe Bend When he came to the same ash for the third time he understood 
8195_117382_000052_000000	train-clean-360	The river circled in one great curve 
8195_117382_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The Cardinal mounted to the tip top limb of the ash and looked around him 
none	none	There was never a fairer sight for the eye of man or bird 
8195_117382_000052_000003	train-clean-360	The mist and shimmer of early spring were in the air 
none	none	The Wabash rounded Horseshoe Bend in a silver circle rimmed by a tangle of foliage bordering both its banks and inside lay a low open space covered with waving marsh grass and the blue bloom of sweet calamus 
8195_117382_000052_000005	train-clean-360	Scattered around were mighty trees but conspicuous above any in the very center was a giant sycamore split at its base into three large trees whose waving branches seemed to sweep the face of heaven and whose roots like miserly fingers clutched deep into the black muck of Rainbow Bottom 
8195_117382_000053_000000	train-clean-360	It was in this lovely spot that the rainbow at last materialized and at its base free to all humanity who cared to seek the Great Alchemist had left His rarest treasures the gold of sunshine diamond water drops emerald foliage and sapphire sky 
none	none	For good measure there were added seeds berries and insects for the birds and wild flowers fruit and nuts for the children 
8195_117382_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Above all the sycamore waved its majestic head 
none	none	It made a throne that seemed suitable for the son of the king and mounting to its topmost branch for miles the river carried his challenge Ho cardinals 
8195_117382_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Look this way 
8195_117382_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Behold me 
8195_117382_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Have you seen any other of so great size 
8195_117382_000055_000004	train-clean-360	Have you any to equal my grace 
8195_117382_000055_000005	train-clean-360	Who can whistle so loud so clear so compelling a note 
8195_117382_000055_000006	train-clean-360	Who will fly to me for protection 
8195_117382_000055_000007	train-clean-360	Who will come and be my mate 
8195_117382_000056_000000	train-clean-360	He flared his crest high swelled his throat with rolling notes and appeared so big and brilliant that among the many cardinals that had gathered to hear there was not one to compare with him 
8195_117382_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Black envy filled their hearts 
none	none	Who was this flaming dashing stranger flaunting himself in the faces of their females 
8195_117382_000057_000002	train-clean-360	There were many unmated cardinals in Rainbow Bottom and many jealous males 
none	none	A second time the Cardinal rocking and flashing proclaimed himself and there was a note of feminine approval so strong that he caught it Tilting on a twig his crest flared to full height his throat swelled to bursting his heart too big for his body the Cardinal shouted his challenge for the third time when clear and sharp arose a cry in answer Here Here Here It came from a female that had accepted the caresses of the brightest cardinal in Rainbow Bottom only the day before and had spent the morning carrying twigs to a thicket of red haws 
8195_117382_000058_000000	train-clean-360	The Cardinal with a royal flourish sprang in air to seek her but her outraged mate was ahead of him and with a scream she fled leaving a tuft of feathers in her mate s beak 
8195_117382_000058_000001	train-clean-360	In turn the Cardinal struck him like a flashing rocket and then red war waged in Rainbow Bottom 
8195_117382_000058_000002	train-clean-360	The females scattered for cover with all their might 
8195_117382_000058_000003	train-clean-360	The Cardinal worked in a kiss on one poor little bird too frightened to escape him then the males closed in and serious business began 
8195_117382_000058_000004	train-clean-360	The Cardinal would have enjoyed a fight vastly with two or three opponents but a half dozen made discretion better than valour 
8195_117382_000058_000005	train-clean-360	He darted among them scattering them right and left and made for the sycamore 
none	none	With all his remaining breath he insolently repeated his challenge and then headed down stream for the sumac with what grace he could command There was an hour of angry recrimination before sweet peace brooded again in Rainbow Bottom 
8195_117382_000059_000001	train-clean-360	The newly mated pair finally made up the females speedily resumed their coquetting and forgot the captivating stranger all save the poor little one that had been kissed by accident 
none	none	She never had been kissed before and never had expected that she would be for she was a creature of many misfortunes of every nature 
8195_117382_000060_000000	train-clean-360	She had been hatched from a fifth egg to begin with and every one knows the disadvantage of beginning life with four sturdy older birds on top of one 
8195_117382_000060_000001	train-clean-360	It was a meager egg and a feeble baby that pipped its shell 
8195_117382_000060_000002	train-clean-360	The remainder of the family stood and took nearly all the food so that she almost starved in the nest and she never really knew the luxury of a hearty meal until her elders had flown 
none	none	That lasted only a few days for the others went then and their parents followed them so far afield that the poor little soul clamouring alone in the nest almost perished 
8195_117382_000060_000004	train-clean-360	Hunger driven she climbed to the edge and exercised her wings until she managed some sort of flight to a neighbouring bush She missed the twig and fell to the ground where she lay cold and shivering 
8195_117382_000061_000000	train-clean-360	She cried pitifully and was almost dead when a brown faced barefoot boy with a fishing pole on his shoulder passed and heard her 
8195_117382_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor little thing you are almost dead he said 
8195_117382_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 I know what I ll do with you 
8195_117382_000062_000002	train-clean-360	I ll take you over and set you in the bushes where I heard those other redbirds and then your ma will feed you 
none	none	The boy turned back and carefully set her on a limb close to one of her brothers and there she got just enough food to keep her alive 
8195_117382_000064_000000	train-clean-360	So her troubles continued 
none	none	Once a squirrel chased her and she saved herself by crowding into a hole so small her pursuer could not follow The only reason she escaped a big blue racer when she went to take her first bath was that a hawk had his eye on the snake and snapped it up at just the proper moment to save the poor quivering little bird 
8195_117382_000064_000002	train-clean-360	She was left so badly frightened that she could not move for a long time 
8195_117382_000065_000000	train-clean-360	All the tribulations of birdland fell to her lot 
8195_117382_000065_000001	train-clean-360	She was so frail and weak she lost her family in migration and followed with some strangers that were none too kind 
8195_117382_000065_000002	train-clean-360	Life in the South had been full of trouble Once a bullet grazed her so closely she lost two of her wing quills and that made her more timid than ever 
none	none	Coming North she had given out again and finally had wandered into Rainbow Bottom lost and alone 
8195_117382_000066_000000	train-clean-360	She was such a shy fearsome little body the females all flouted her and the males never seemed to notice that there was material in her for a very fine mate 
8195_117382_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Every other female cardinal in Rainbow Bottom had several males courting her but this poor frightened lonely one had never a suitor and she needed love so badly 
8195_117382_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Now she had been kissed by this magnificent stranger 
none	none	Of course she knew it really was not her kiss 
8195_117382_000067_000001	train-clean-360	He had intended it for the bold creature that had answered his challenge but since it came to her it was hers in a way after all 
none	none	She hid in the underbrush for the remainder of the day and was never so frightened in all her life She brooded over it constantly and morning found her at the down curve of the horseshoe straining her ears for the rarest note she ever had heard 
8195_117382_000067_000003	train-clean-360	All day she hid and waited and the following days were filled with longing but he never came again 
none	none	So one morning possessed with courage she did not understand and filled with longing that drove her against her will she started down the river 
8195_117382_000068_000001	train-clean-360	For miles she sneaked through the underbrush and watched and listened until at last night came and she returned to Rainbow Bottom 
none	none	The next morning she set out early and flew to the spot from which she had turned back the night before 
8195_117382_000068_000003	train-clean-360	From there she glided through the bushes and underbrush trembling and quaking yet pushing stoutly onward straining her ears for some note of the brilliant stranger s 
none	none	It was mid forenoon when she reached the region of the sumac and as she hopped warily along only a short distance from her full and splendid there burst the voice of the singer for whom she was searching 
8195_117382_000069_000001	train-clean-360	She sprang into air and fled a mile before she realized that she was flying 
8195_117382_000069_000002	train-clean-360	Then she stopped and listened and rolling with the river she heard those bold true tones 
none	none	Close to earth she went back again to see if unobserved she could find a spot where she might watch the stranger that had kissed her When at last she reached a place where she could see him plainly his beauty was so bewildering and his song so enticing that she gradually hopped closer and closer without knowing she was moving 
8195_117382_000070_000000	train-clean-360	High in the sumac the Cardinal had sung until his throat was parched and the fountain of hope was almost dry 
none	none	There was nothing save defeat from overwhelming numbers in Rainbow Bottom He had paraded and made all the music he ever had been taught and improvised much more 
8195_117382_000070_000003	train-clean-360	Yet no one had come to seek him 
none	none	Was it of necessity to be the Limberlost then This one day more he would retain his dignity and his location He tipped tilted and flirted He whistled and sang and trilled Over the lowland and up and down the shining river ringing in every change he could invent he sent for the last time his prophetic message Wet year Wet year Chapter three Come here Come here entreated the Cardinal He felt that his music was not reaching his standard as he burst into this new song He was almost discouraged No way seemed open to him but flight to the Limberlost and he so disdained the swamp that love making would lose something of its greatest charm if he were driven there for a mate The time seemed ripe for stringent measures and the Cardinal was ready to take them but how could he stringently urge a little mate that would not come on his imploring invitations He listlessly pecked at the berries and flung abroad an inquiring Chip With just an atom of hope he frequently mounted to his choir loft and issued an order that savoured far more of a plea Come here Come here and then leaning he listened intently to the voice of the river lest he fail to catch the faintest responsive Chook it might bear He could hear the sniffling of carp wallowing beside the bank A big pickerel slashed around breakfasting on minnows Opposite the sumac the black bass with gamy spring snapped up before it struck the water every luckless honey laden insect that fell from the feast of sweets in a blossom whitened wild crab The sharp bark of the red squirrel and the low of cattle lazily chewing their cuds among the willows came to him The hammering of a woodpecker on a dead sycamore a little above him rolled to his straining ears like a drum beat The Cardinal hated the woodpecker more than he disliked the dove It was only foolishly effusive but the woodpecker was a veritable Bluebeard The Cardinal longed to pull the feathers from his back until it was as red as his head for the woodpecker had dressed his suit in finest style and with dulcet tones and melting tenderness had gone acourting Sweet as the dove s had been his wooing and one more pang the lonely Cardinal had suffered at being forced to witness his felicity yet scarcely had his plump amiable little mate consented to his caresses and approved the sycamore before he turned on her pecked her severely and pulled a tuft of plumage from her breast There was not the least excuse for this tyrannical action and the sight filled the Cardinal with rage He fully expected to see Madam Woodpecker divorce herself and flee her new home and he most earnestly hoped that she would but she did no such thing She meekly flattened her feathers hurried work in a lively manner and tried in every way to anticipate and avert her mate s displeasure Under this treatment he grew more abusive and now Madam Woodpecker dodged every time she came within his reach It made the Cardinal feel so vengeful that he longed to go up and drum the sycamore with the woodpecker s head until he taught him how to treat his mate properly There was plently of lark music rolling with the river and that morning brought the first liquid golden notes of the orioles They had arrived at dawn and were overjoyed with their homecoming for they were darting from bank to bank singing exquisitely on wing There seemed no end to the bird voices that floated with the river and yet there was no beginning to the one voice for which the Cardinal waited with passionate longing The oriole s singing was so inspiring that it tempted the Cardinal to another effort and perching where he gleamed crimson and black against the April sky he tested his voice and when sure of his tones he entreatingly called Come here Come here Just then he saw her She came daintily over the earth soft as down before the wind a rosy flush suffusing her plumage a coral beak her very feet pink the shyest most timid little thing alive Her bright eyes were popping with fear and down there among the ferns anemones and last year s dried leaves she tilted her sleek crested head and peered at him with frightened wonder and silent helplessness It was for this the Cardinal had waited hoped and planned for many days He had rehearsed what he conceived to be every point of the situation and yet he was not prepared for the thing that suddenly happened to him He had expected to reject many applicants before he selected one to match his charms but instantly this shy little creature slipping along near earth taking a surreptitious peep at him made him feel a very small bird and he certainly never before had felt small The crushing possibility that somewhere there might be a cardinal that was larger brighter and a finer musician than he staggered him and worst of all his voice broke suddenly to his complete embarrassment Half screened by the flowers she seemed so little so shy so delightfully sweet He chipped carefully once or twice to steady himself and clear his throat for unaccountably it had grown dry and husky and then he tenderly tried again Come here Come here implored the Cardinal He forgot all about his dignity He knew that his voice was trembling with eagerness and hoarse with fear He was afraid to attempt approaching her but he leaned toward her begging and pleading He teased and insisted and he did not care a particle if he did It suddenly seemed an honour to coax her He rocked on the limb He side stepped and hopped and gyrated gracefully He fluffed and flirted and showed himself to every advantage It never occurred to him that the dove and the woodpecker might be watching though he would not have cared in the least if they had been and as for any other cardinal he would have attacked the combined forces of the Limberlost and Rainbow Bottom He sang and sang Every impulse of passion in his big crimson palpitating body was thrown into those notes but she only turned her head from side to side peering at him seeming sufficiently frightened to flee at a breath and answered not even the faintest little Chook of encouragement The Cardinal rested a second before he tried again That steadied him and gave him better command of himself He could tell that his notes were clearing and growing sweeter He was improving Perhaps she was interested There was some encouragement in the fact that she was still there The Cardinal felt that his time had come Come here Come here He was on his mettle now Surely no cardinal could sing fuller clearer sweeter notes He began at the very first and rollicked through a story of adventure colouring it with every wild dashing catchy note he could improvise He followed that with a rippling song of the joy and fulness of spring in notes as light and airy as the wind blown soul of melody and with swaying body kept time to his rhythmic measures Then he glided into a song of love and tenderly pleadingly passionately told the story as only a courting bird can tell it Then he sang a song of ravishment a song quavering with fear and the pain tugging at his heart He almost had run the gamut and she really appeared as if she intended to flee rather than to come to him He was afraid to take even one timid little hop toward her In a fit of desperation the Cardinal burst into the passion song He arose to his full height leaned toward her with outspread quivering wings and crest flared to the utmost and rocking from side to side in the intensity of his fervour he poured out a perfect torrent of palpitant song His cardinal body swayed to the rolling flood of his ecstatic tones until he appeared like a flaming pulsing note of materialized music as he entreated coaxed commanded and pled From sheer exhaustion he threw up his head to round off the last note he could utter and breathlessly glancing down to see if she were coming caught sight of a faint streak of gray in the distance He had planned so to subdue the little female he courted that she would come to him he was in hot pursuit a half day s journey away before he remembered it No other cardinal ever endured such a chase as she led him in the following days Through fear and timidity she had kept most of her life in the underbrush The Cardinal was a bird of the open fields and tree tops He loved to rock with the wind and speed arrow like in great plunges of flight This darting and twisting over logs among leaves and through tangled thickets tired tried and exasperated him more than hundreds of miles of open flight Sometimes he drove her from cover and then she wildly dashed up hill and down dale seeking another thicket but wherever she went the Cardinal was only a breath behind her and with every passing mile his passion for her grew There was no time to eat bathe or sing only mile after mile of unceasing pursuit It seemed that the little creature could not stop if she would and as for the Cardinal he was in that chase to remain until his last heart beat It was a question how the frightened bird kept in advance She was visibly the worse for this ardent courtship Two tail feathers were gone and there was a broken one beating from her wing Once she had flown too low striking her head against a rail until a drop of blood came and she cried pitifully Several times the Cardinal had cornered her and tried to hold her by a bunch of feathers and compel her by force to listen to reason but she only broke from his hold and dashed away a stricken thing leaving him half dead with longing and remorse But no matter how baffled she grew or where she fled in her headlong flight the one thing she always remembered was not to lead the Cardinal into the punishment that awaited him in Rainbow Bottom Panting for breath quivering with fear longing for well concealed retreats worn and half blinded by the disasters of flight through strange country the tired bird beat her aimless way but she would have been torn to pieces before she would have led her magnificent pursuer into the wrath of his enemies Poor little feathered creature She had been fleeing some kind of danger all her life She could not realize that love and protection had come in this splendid guise and she fled on and on Once the Cardinal aching with passion and love fell behind that she might rest and before he realized that another bird was close an impudent big relative of his straying from the Limberlost entered the race and pursued her so hotly that with a note of utter panic she wheeled and darted back to the Cardinal for protection When to the rush of rage that possessed him at the sight of a rival was added the knowledge that she was seeking him in her extremity such a mighty wave of anger swept the Cardinal that he appeared twice his real size Like a flaming brand of vengeance he struck that Limberlost upstart and sent him rolling to earth a mass of battered feathers With beak and claw he made his attack and when he so utterly demolished his rival that he hopped away trembling with dishevelled plumage stained with his own blood the Cardinal remembered his little love and hastened back confidently hoping for his reward She was so securely hidden that although he went searching calling pleading he found no trace of her the remainder of that day The Cardinal almost went distracted and his tender imploring cries would have moved any except a panic stricken bird He did not even know in what direction to pursue her Night closed down and found him in a fever of love sick fear but it brought rest and wisdom She could not have gone very far She was too worn He would not proclaim his presence Soon she would suffer past enduring for food and water He hid in the willows close where he had lost her and waited with what patience he could and it was a wise plan Shortly after dawn moving stilly as the break of day trembling with fear she came slipping to the river for a drink It was almost brutal cruelty but her fear must be overcome someway and with a cry of triumph the Cardinal in a plunge of flight was beside her She gave him one stricken look and dashed away The chase began once more and continued until she was visibly breaking There was no room for a rival that morning The Cardinal flew abreast of her and gave her a caress or attempted a kiss whenever he found the slightest chance She was almost worn out her flights were wavering and growing shorter The Cardinal did his utmost If she paused to rest he crept close as he dared and piteously begged Come here Come here When she took wing he so dexterously intercepted her course that several time she found refuge in his sumac without realizing where she was When she did that he perched just as closely as he dared and while they both rested he sang to her a soft little whispered love song deep in his throat and with every note he gently edged nearer She turned her head from him and although she was panting for breath and palpitant with fear the Cardinal knew that he dared not go closer or she would dash away like the wild thing she was The next time she took wing she found him so persistently in her course that she turned sharply and fled panting to the sumac When this had happened so often that she seemed to recognize the sumac as a place of refuge the Cardinal slipped aside and spent all his remaining breath in an exultant whistle of triumph for now he was beginning to see his way He dashed into mid air and with a gyration that would have done credit to a flycatcher he snapped up a gadfly that should have been more alert With a tender Chip from branch to branch slowly cautiously he came with it Because he was half starved himself he knew that she must be almost famished Holding it where she could see he hopped toward her eagerly carefully the gadfly in his beak his heart in his mouth He stretched his neck and legs to the limit as he reached the fly toward her What matter that she took it with a snap and plunged a quarter of a mile before eating it She had taken food from him That was the beginning Cautiously he impelled her toward the sumac and with untiring patience kept her there the remainder of the day He carried her every choice morsel he could find in the immediate vicinity of the sumac and occasionally she took a bit from his beak though oftenest he was compelled to lay it on a limb beside her At dusk she repeatedly dashed toward the underbrush but the Cardinal with endless patience and tenderness maneuvered her to the sumac until she gave up and beneath the shelter of a neighbouring grapevine perched on a limb that was the Cardinal s own chosen resting place tucked her tired head beneath her wing and went to rest When she was soundly sleeping the Cardinal crept as closely as he dared and with one eye on his little gray love and the other roving for any possible danger he spent a night of watching for any danger that might approach He was almost worn out but this was infinitely better than the previous night at any rate for now he not only knew where she was but she was fast asleep in his own favourite place Huddled on the limb the Cardinal gloated over her He found her beauty perfect To be sure she was dishevelled but she could make her toilet There were a few feathers gone but they would grow speedily She made a heart satisfying picture on which the Cardinal feasted his love sick soul by the light of every straying moonbeam that slid around the edges of the grape leaves Wave after wave of tender passion shook him In his throat half the night he kept softly calling to her Come here Come here Next morning when the robins announced day beside the shining river she awoke with a start but before she could decide in which direction to fly she discovered a nice fresh grub laid on the limb close to her and very sensibly remained for breakfast Then the Cardinal went to the river and bathed He made such delightful play of it and the splash of the water sounded so refreshing to the tired draggled bird that she could not resist venturing for a few dips When she was wet she could not fly well and he improved the opportunity to pull her broken quills help her dress herself and bestow a few extra caresses He guided her to his favourite place for a sun bath and followed the farmer s plow in the corn field until he found a big sweet beetle He snapped off its head peeled the stiff wing shields and daintily offered it to her He was so delighted when she took it from his beak and remained in the sumac to eat it that he established himself on an adjoining thorn bush where the snowy blossoms of a wild morning glory made a fine background for his scarlet coat He sang the old pleading song as he never had sung it before for now there was a tinge of hope battling with the fear in his heart Over and over he sang rounding fulling swelling every note leaning toward her in coaxing tenderness flashing his brilliant beauty as he swayed and rocked for her approval and all that he had suffered and all that he hoped for was in his song Just when his heart was growing sick within him his straining ear caught the faintest most timid call a lover ever answered Only one imploring gentle Chook from the sumac His song broke in a suffocating burst of exultation Cautiously he hopped from twig to twig toward her With tender throaty murmurings he slowly edged nearer and wonder of wonders with tired eyes and quivering wings she reached him her beak for a kiss At dinner that day the farmer said to his wife Maria if you want to hear the prettiest singin an see the cutest sight you ever saw jest come down along the line fence an watch the antics o that redbird we been hearin I don t know as redbirds are so scarce at I ve any call to wade through slush a half mile to see one answered Maria Footin s

you ll be honey once you set eyes on the fellow Better come if you can You re invited He s askin the whole endurin country to come Maria said nothing more but she mentally decided she had no time to fool with a bird when there were housekeeping and spring sewing to do As she recalled Abram s enthusiastic praise of the singer and had a whiff of the odour laden air as she passed from kitchen to spring house she was compelled to admit that it was a temptation to go but she finished her noon work and resolutely sat down with her needle She stitched industriously her thread straightening with a quick nervous sweep learned through years of experience and if her eyes wandered riverward and if she paused frequently with arrested hand and listened intently she did not realize it By two o clock a spirit of unrest that demanded recognition had taken possession of her Setting her lips firmly a scowl clouding her brow she stitched on By half past two her hands dropped in her lap Abram s new hickory shirt slid to the floor and she hesitatingly arose and crossed the room to the closet from which she took her overshoes and set them by the kitchen fire to have them ready in case she wanted them Pshaw she muttered I got this shirt to finish this afternoon There s butter an bakin in the mornin an Mary Jane Simms is comin for a visit in the afternoon She returned to the window and took up the shirt sewing with unusual swiftness for the next half hour but by three she dropped it and opening the kitchen door gazed toward the river Every intoxicating delight of early spring was in the air The breeze that fanned her cheek was laden with subtle perfume of pollen and the crisp fresh odour of unfolding leaves Curling skyward like a beckoning finger went a spiral of violet and gray smoke from the log heap Abram was burning and scattered over spaces of a mile were half a dozen others telling a story of the activity of his neighbours Like the low murmur of distant music came the beating wings of hundreds of her bees rimming the water trough insane with thirst On the wood pile the guinea cock clattered incessantly Phut rack Phut rack Across the dooryard came the old turkey gobbler with fan tail and a rasping scrape of wing evincing his delight in spring and mating time by a series of explosive snorts On the barnyard gate the old Shanghai was lustily challenging to mortal combat one of his kind three miles across country From the river arose the strident scream of her blue gander jealously guarding his harem In the poultry yard the hens made a noisy cackling party and the stable lot was filled with cattle bellowing for the freedom of the meadow pasture as yet scarcely ready for grazing It seemed to the little woman hesitating in the doorway as if all nature had entered into a conspiracy to lure her from her work and just then clear and imperious arose the demand of the Cardinal Come here Come here Blank amazement filled her face As I m a livin woman she gasped He s changed his song That s what Abram meant by me bein invited He s askin folks to see his mate I m goin The dull red of excitement sprang into her cheeks She hurried on her overshoes and drew an old shawl over her head She crossed the dooryard followed the path through the orchard and came to the lane Below the barn she turned back and attempted to cross The mud was deep and thick and she lost an overshoe but with the help of a stick she pried it out and replaced it Joke on me if I d a tumbled over in this mud she muttered She entered the barn and came out a minute later carefully closing and buttoning the door and started down the line fence toward the river Half way across the field Abram saw her coming No need to recount how often he had looked in that direction during the afternoon He slapped the lines on the old gray s back and came tearing down the slope his eyes flashing his cheeks red his hands firmly gripping the plow that rolled up a line of black mould as he passed Maria staring at his flushed face and shining eyes recognized that his whole being proclaimed an inward exultation Abram Johnson she solemnly demanded have you got the power Yes cried Abram pulling off his old felt hat and gazing into the crown as if for inspiration You ve said it honey I got the power Got it of a little red bird Power o spring Power o song Power o love If that poor little red target for some ornery cuss s bullet can get all he s getting out o life to day there s no cause why a reasonin thinkin man shouldn t realize some o his blessings You hit it Maria I got the power It s the power o God but I learned how to lay hold of it from that little red bird Come here Maria Abram wrapped the lines around the plow handle and cautiously led his wife to the fence He found a piece of thick bark for her to stand on and placed her where she would be screened by a big oak Then he stood behind her and pointed out the sumac and the female bird Jest you keep still a minute an you ll feel paid for comin all right honey he whispered but don t make any sudden movement I don t know as I ever saw a worse lookin specimen an she is answered Maria She looks first class to him There s no kick comin on his part I can tell you replied Abram The bride hopped shyly through the sumac She pecked at the dried berries and frequently tried to improve her plumage which certainly had been badly draggled and there was a drop of blood dried at the base of her beak She plainly showed the effects of her rough experience and yet she was a most attractive bird for the dimples in her plump body showed through the feathers and instead of the usual wickedly black eyes of the cardinal family hers were a soft tender brown touched by a love light there was no mistaking She was a beautiful bird and she was doing all in her power to make herself dainty again Her movements clearly indicated how timid she was and yet she remained in the sumac as if she feared to leave it and frequently peered expectantly among the tree tops There was a burst of exultation down the river The little bird gave her plumage a fluff and watched anxiously On came the Cardinal like a flaming rocket calling to her on wing He alighted beside her dropped into her beak a morsel of food gave her a kiss to aid digestion caressingly ran his beak the length of her wing quills and flew to the dogwood missus Cardinal enjoyed the meal It struck her palate exactly right She liked the kiss and caress cared in fact for all that he did for her and with the appreciation of his tenderness came repentance for the dreadful chase she had led him in her foolish fright and an impulse to repay She took a dainty hop toward the dogwood and the invitation she sent him was exquisite With a shrill whistle of exultant triumph the Cardinal answered at a headlong rush The farmer s grip tightened on his wife s shoulder but Maria turned toward him with blazing tear filled eyes An you call yourself a decent man Abram Johnson Decent quavered the astonished Abram Decent I believe I am I believe you ain t hotly retorted his wife You don t know what decency is if you go peekin at them They ain t birds They re folks Maria pled Abram Maria honey I am plumb ashamed of you broke in Maria How d you s pose she d feel if she knew there was a man here peekin at her Ain t she got a right to be lovin and tender Ain t she got a right to pay him best she knows They re jest common human bein s an I don t know where you got privilege to spy on a female when she s doin the best she knows Maria broke from his grasp and started down the line fence In a few strides Abram had her in his arms his withered cheek with its springtime bloom pressed against her equally withered tear stained one Maria he whispered waveringly Maria honey I wasn t meanin any disrespect to the sex Maria wiped her eyes on the corner of her shawl I don t s pose you was Abram she admitted but you re jest like all the rest o the men You never think Now you go on with your plowin an let that little female alone She unclasped his arms and turned homeward Honey called Abram softly since you brought em that pocketful o wheat you might as well let me have it Landy exclaimed Maria blushing I plumb forgot my wheat I thought maybe bein so early pickin was scarce an if you d put out a little wheat an a few crumbs they d stay an nest in the sumac as you re so fond o them Jest what I m fairly prayin they ll do an I been carryin stuff an pettin him up best I knowed for a week said Abram as he knelt and cupped his shrunken hands while Maria guided the wheat from her apron into them I ll scatter it along the top rail an they ll be after it in fifteen minutes Thank you Maria T was good o you to think of it Maria watched him steadily How dear he was How dear he always had been How happy they were together Abram she asked hesitatingly is there anything else I could do for your birds They were creatures of habitual repression and the inner glimpses they had taken of each other that day were surprises they scarcely knew how to meet Abram said nothing because he could not He slowly shook his head and turned to the plow his eyes misty Maria started toward the line fence but she paused repeatedly to listen and it was no wonder for all the redbirds from miles down the river had gathered around the sumac to see if there were a battle in birdland but it was only the Cardinal turning somersaults in the air and screaming with bursting exuberance Come here Come here Chapter four So dear So dear crooned the Cardinal 
8113_117384_000003_000000	train-clean-360	She had taken possession of the sumac 
8113_117384_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The location was her selection and he loudly applauded her choice 
8113_117384_000003_000002	train-clean-360	She placed the first twig and after examining it carefully he spent the day carrying her others just as much alike as possible 
8113_117384_000003_000003	train-clean-360	If she used a dried grass blade he carried grass blades until she began dropping them on the ground 
8113_117384_000003_000004	train-clean-360	If she worked in a bit of wild grape vine bark he peeled grape vines until she would have no more 
none	none	It never occurred to him that he was the largest cardinal in the woods in those days and he had forgotten that he wore a red coat 
8113_117384_000003_000006	train-clean-360	She was not a skilled architect 
8113_117384_000003_000007	train-clean-360	Her nest certainly was a loose ramshackle affair but she had built it and had allowed him to help her 
8113_117384_000003_000008	train-clean-360	It was hers and he improvised a paean in its praise 
none	none	Every morning he perched on the edge of the nest and gazed in songless wonder at each beautiful new egg and whenever she came to brood she sat as if entranced eyeing her treasures in an ecstasy of proud possession 
8113_117384_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Then she nestled them against her warm breast and turned adoring eyes toward the Cardinal 
8113_117384_000004_000001	train-clean-360	If he sang from the dogwood she faced that way If he rocked on the wild grape vine she turned in her nest 
8113_117384_000004_000002	train-clean-360	If he went to the corn field for grubs she stood astride her eggs and peered down watching his every movement with unconcealed anxiety 
8113_117384_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The Cardinal forgot to be vain of his beauty she delighted in it every hour of the day 
none	none	Shy and timid beyond belief she had been during her courtship but she made reparation by being an incomparably generous and devoted mate And the Cardinal He was astonished to find himself capable of so much and such varied feeling 
8113_117384_000005_000002	train-clean-360	It was not enough that he brooded while she went to bathe and exercise 
8113_117384_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The daintiest of every morsel he found was carried to her 
8113_117384_000005_000004	train-clean-360	When she refused to swallow another particle he perched on a twig close by the nest many times in a day and with sleek feathers and lowered crest gazed at her in silent worshipful adoration 
none	none	Up and down the river bank he flamed and rioted 
8113_117384_000006_000001	train-clean-360	In the sumac he uttered not the faintest Chip that might attract attention 
8113_117384_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He was so anxious to be inconspicuous that he appeared only half his real size 
8113_117384_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Always on leaving he gave her a tender little peck and ran his beak the length of her wing a characteristic caress that he delighted to bestow on her 
8113_117384_000007_000000	train-clean-360	If he felt that he was disturbing her too often he perched on the dogwood and sang for life and love and happiness 
8113_117384_000007_000001	train-clean-360	His music was in a minor key now 
none	none	The high exultant ringing notes of passion were mellowed and subdued He was improvising cradle songs and lullabies He was telling her how he loved her how he would fight for her how he was watching over her how he would signal if any danger were approaching how proud he was of her what a perfect nest she had built how beautiful he thought her eggs what magnificent babies they would produce Full of tenderness melting with love liquid with sweetness the Cardinal sang to his patient little brooding mate So dear So dear 
8113_117384_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The farmer leaned on his corn planter and listened to him intently 
none	none	I swanny If he hasn t changed his song again an this time I m blest if I can tell what he s saying Every time the Cardinal lifted his voice the clip of the corn planter ceased and Abram hung on the notes and studied them over 
8113_117384_000009_000000	train-clean-360	One night he said to his wife Maria have you been noticin the redbird of late 
none	none	He s changed to a new tune an this time I m completely stalled 
8113_117384_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I can t for the life of me make out what he s saying 
none	none	S pose you step down to morrow an see if you can catch it for me I d give a pretty to know 
8113_117384_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Maria felt flattered 
8113_117384_000010_000001	train-clean-360	She always had believed that she had a musical ear 
8113_117384_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Here was an opportunity to test it and please Abram at the same time 
8113_117384_000010_000003	train-clean-360	She hastened her work the following morning and very early slipped along the line fence 
8113_117384_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Hiding behind the oak with straining ear and throbbing heart she eagerly listened 
8113_117384_000010_000005	train-clean-360	 Clip clip came the sound of the planter as Abram s dear old figure trudged up the hill Chip 
8113_117384_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Chip came the warning of the Cardinal as he flew to his mate 
none	none	He gave her some food stroked her wing and flying to the dogwood sang of the love that encompassed him 
8113_117384_000011_000001	train-clean-360	As he trilled forth his tender caressing strain the heart of the listening woman translated as did that of the brooding bird 
8113_117384_000012_000000	train-clean-360	With shining eyes and flushed cheeks she sped down the fence 
8113_117384_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Panting and palpitating with excitement she met Abram half way on his return trip 
8113_117384_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Forgetful of her habitual reserve she threw her arms around his neck and drawing his face to hers she cried Oh Abram 
none	none	I got it I got it I know what he s saying 
8113_117384_000012_000005	train-clean-360	Oh Abram my love 
8113_117384_000012_000006	train-clean-360	My own 
none	none	To me so dear So dear So dear 
8113_117384_000013_000001	train-clean-360	So dear echoed the Cardinal 
8113_117384_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The bewilderment in Abram s face melted into comprehension 
8113_117384_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He swept Maria from her feet as he lifted his head 
none	none	On my soul 
8113_117384_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You have got it honey 
8113_117384_000015_000002	train-clean-360	That s what he s saying plain as gospel 
none	none	I can tell it plainer n anything he s sung yet now I sense it 
8113_117384_000016_000000	train-clean-360	He gathered Maria in his arms pressed her head against his breast with a trembling old hand while the face he turned to the morning was beautiful 
none	none	I wish to God he said quaveringly at every creature on earth was as well fixed as me an the redbird Clasping each other they listened with rapt faces as mellowing across the corn field came the notes of the Cardinal So dear So dear 
8113_117384_000018_000000	train-clean-360	After that Abram s devotion to his bird family became a mild mania 
8113_117384_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He carried food to the top rail of the line fence every day rain or shine with the same regularity that he curried and fed Nancy in the barn 
none	none	From caring for and so loving the Cardinal there grew in his tender old heart a welling flood of sympathy for every bird that homed on his farm 
8113_117384_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He drove a stake to mark the spot where the killdeer hen brooded in the corn field so that he would not drive Nancy over the nest 
none	none	When he closed the bars at the end of the lane he always was careful to leave the third one down for there was a chippy brooding in the opening where it fitted when closed 
8113_117384_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Alders and sweetbriers grew in his fence corners undisturbed that spring if he discovered that they sheltered an anxious eyed little mother 
8113_117384_000019_000003	train-clean-360	He left a square yard of clover unmowed because it seemed to him that the lark singing nearer the Throne than any other bird was picking up stray notes dropped by the Invisible Choir and with unequalled purity and tenderness sending them ringing down to his brooding mate whose home and happiness would be despoiled by the reaping of that spot of green 
8113_117384_000019_000004	train-clean-360	He delayed burning the brush heap from the spring pruning back of the orchard until fall when he found it housed a pair of fine thrushes for the song of the thrush delighted him almost as much as that of the lark 
8113_117384_000019_000005	train-clean-360	He left a hollow limb on the old red pearmain apple tree because when he came to cut it there was a pair of bluebirds twittering around frantic with anxiety 
8113_117384_000020_000000	train-clean-360	His pockets were bulgy with wheat and crumbs and his heart was big with happiness 
none	none	It was the golden springtime of his later life The sky never had seemed so blue or the earth so beautiful The Cardinal had opened the fountains of his soul life took on a new colour and joy while every work of God manifested a fresh and heretofore unappreciated loveliness 
8113_117384_000020_000004	train-clean-360	His very muscles seemed to relax and new strength arose to meet the demands of his uplifted spirit 
none	none	He had not finished his day s work with such ease and pleasure in years and he could see the influence of his rejuvenation in Maria She was flitting around her house with broken snatches of song even sweeter to Abram s ears than the notes of the birds and in recent days he had noticed that she dressed particularly for her afternoon s sewing putting on her Sunday lace collar and a white apron He immediately went to town and bought her a finer collar than she ever had owned in her life 
8113_117384_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Then he hunted a sign painter and came home bearing a number of pine boards on which gleamed in big shiny black letters 
none	none	NO HUNTING ALLOWED ON THIS FARM He seemed slightly embarrassed when he showed them to Maria I feel a little mite onfriendly putting up signs like that fore my neighbours he admitted but the fact is it ain t the neighbours so much as it s boys that need raising an them town creatures who call themselves sportsmen an kill a hummin bird to see if they can hit it Time was when trees an underbrush were full o birds an squirrels any amount o rabbits an the fish fairly crowdin in the river I used to kill all the quail an wild turkeys about here a body needed to make an appetizing change It was always my plan to take a little an leave a little But jest look at it now Surprise o my life if I get a two pound bass Wild turkey gobblin would scare me most out of my senses an as for the birds there are jest about a fourth what there used to be an the crops eaten to pay for it I d do all I m tryin to for any bird because of its song an colour an pretty teeterin ways but I ain t so slow but I see I m paid in what they do for me Up go these signs an it won t be a happy day for anybody I catch trespassin on my birds 
8113_117384_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Maria studied the signs meditatively 
none	none	You shouldn t be forced to put em up she said conclusively If it s been decided at it s good for em to be here an laws made to protect em people ought to act with some sense an leave them alone I never was so int rested in the birds in all my life an I ll jest do a little lookin out myself If you hear a spang o the dinner bell when you re out in the field you ll know it means there s some one sneakin round with a gun 
8113_117384_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Abram caught Maria and planted a resounding smack on her cheek where the roses of girlhood yet bloomed for him 
8113_117384_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Then he filled his pockets with crumbs and grain and strolled to the river to set the Cardinal s table 
8113_117384_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He could hear the sharp incisive Chip and the tender mellow love notes as he left the barn and all the way to the sumac they rang in his ears 
8113_117384_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The Cardinal met him at the corner of the field and hopped over bushes and the fence only a few yards from him 
8113_117384_000026_000001	train-clean-360	When Abram had scattered his store on the rail the bird came tipping and tilting daintily caught up a crumb and carried it to the sumac 
8113_117384_000026_000002	train-clean-360	His mate was pleased to take it and he carried her one morsel after another until she refused to open her beak for more 
8113_117384_000026_000003	train-clean-360	He made a light supper himself and then swinging on the grape vine he closed the day with an hour of music He repeatedly turned a bright questioning eye toward Abram but he never for a moment lost sight of the nest and the plump gray figure of his little mate 
none	none	As she brooded over her eggs he brooded over her and that she might realize the depth and constancy of his devotion he told her repeatedly with every tender inflection he could throw into his tones that she was So dear So dear The Cardinal had not known that the coming of the mate he so coveted would fill his life with such unceasing gladness and yet on the very day that happiness seemed at fullest measure there was trouble in the sumac 
8113_117384_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He had overstayed his time chasing a fat moth he particularly wanted for his mate and she growing thirsty past endurance left the nest and went to the river 
8113_117384_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Seeing her there he made all possible haste to take his turn at brooding so he arrived just in time to see a pilfering red squirrel starting away with an egg 
8113_117384_000028_000000	train-clean-360	With a vicious scream the Cardinal struck him full force 
none	none	His rush of rage cost the squirrel an eye but it lost the father a birdling for the squirrel dropped the egg outside the nest 
8113_117384_000028_000002	train-clean-360	The Cardinal mournfully carried away the tell tale bits of shell so that any one seeing them would not look up and discover his treasures 
none	none	That left three eggs and the brooding bird mourned over the lost one so pitifully that the Cardinal perched close to the nest the remainder of the day and whispered over and over for her comfort that she was So dear So dear Chapter five See here See here demanded the Cardinal The mandate repeatedly rang from the topmost twig of the thorn tree and yet the Cardinal was not in earnest He was beside himself with a new and delightful excitement and he found it impossible to refrain from giving vent to his feelings He was commanding the farmer and every furred and feathered denizen of the river bottom to see then he fought like a wild thing if any of them ventured close for great things were happening in the sumac In past days the Cardinal had brooded an hour every morning while his mate went to take her exercise bathe and fluff in the sun parlour He had gone to her that morning as usual and she looked at him with anxious eyes and refused to move He had hopped to the very edge of the nest and repeatedly urged her to go She only ruffled her feathers and nestled the eggs she was brooding to turn them but did not offer to leave The Cardinal reached over and gently nudged her with his beak to remind her that it was his time to brood but she looked at him almost savagely and gave him a sharp peck so he knew she was not to be bothered He carried her every dainty he could find and hovered near her tense with anxiety It was late in the afternoon before she went after the drink for which she was half famished She scarcely had reached a willow and bent over the water before the Cardinal was on the edge of the nest He examined it closely but he could see no change He leaned to give the eggs careful scrutiny and from somewhere there came to him the faintest little Chip he ever had heard Up went the Cardinal s crest and he dashed to the willow There was no danger in sight and his mate was greedily dipping her rosy beak in the water He went back to the cradle and listened intently and again that feeble cry came to him Under the nest around it and all through the sumac he searched until at last completely baffled he came back to the edge The sound was so much plainer there that he suddenly leaned caressing the eggs with his beak then the Cardinal knew He had heard the first faint cries of his shell incased babies With a wild scream he made a flying leap through the air His heart was beating to suffocation He started in a race down the river If he alighted on a bush he took only one swing and springing from it flamed on in headlong flight He flashed to the top of the tallest tulip tree and cried cloudward to the lark See here See here He dashed to the river bank and told the killdeers and then visited the underbrush and informed the thrushes and wood robins Father tender he grew so delirious with joy that he forgot his habitual aloofness and fraternized with every bird beside the shining river He even laid aside his customary caution went chipping into the sumac and caressed his mate so boisterously she gazed at him severely and gave his wing a savage pull to recall him to his sober senses That night the Cardinal slept in the sumac very close to his mate and he shut only one eye at a time Early in the morning when he carried her the first food he found that she was on the edge of the nest dropping bits of shell outside and creeping to peep he saw the tiniest coral baby with closed eyes and little patches of soft silky down Its beak was wide open and though his heart was even fuller than on the previous day the Cardinal knew what that meant and instead of indulging in another celebration he assumed the duties of paternity and began searching for food for now there were two empty crops in his family On the following day there were four Then he really worked How eagerly he searched and how gladly he flew to the sumac with every rare morsel The babies were too small for the mother to leave and for the first few days the Cardinal was constantly on wing If he could not find sufficiently dainty food for them in the trees and bushes or among the offerings of the farmer he descended to earth and searched like a wood robin He forgot he needed a bath or owned a sun parlour but everywhere he went from his full heart there constantly burst the cry See here See here His mate made never a sound Her eyes were bigger and softer than ever and in them glowed a steady lovelight She hovered over those three red mites of nestlings so tenderly She was so absorbed in feeding stroking and coddling them she neglected herself until she became quite lean When the Cardinal came every few minutes with food she was a picture of love and gratitude for his devoted attention and once she reached over and softly kissed his wing See here See here shrilled the Cardinal and in his ecstasy he again forgot himself and sang in the sumac Then he carried food with greater activity than ever to cover his lapse The farmer knew that it lacked an hour of noon but he was so anxious to tell Maria the news that he could not endure the suspense another minute There was a new song from the sumac He had heard it as he turned the first corner with the shovel plow He had listened eagerly and had caught the meaning almost at once See here See here He tied the old gray mare to the fence to prevent her eating the young corn and went immediately By leaning a rail against the thorn tree he was able to peer into the sumac and take a good look at the nest of handsome birdlings now well screened with the umbrella like foliage It seemed to Abram that he never could wait until noon He critically examined the harness in the hope that he would find a buckle missing and tried to discover a flaw in the plow that would send him to the barn for a file but he could not invent an excuse for going So when he had waited until an hour of noon he could endure it no longer Got news for you Maria he called from the well where he was making a pretense of thirst Oh I don t know answered Maria with a superior smile If it s about the redbirds he s been up to the garden three times this morning yellin See here fit to split an I jest figured that their little ones had hatched Is that your news Well I be durned gasped the astonished Abram Mid afternoon Abram turned Nancy and started the plow down a row that led straight to the sumac He intended to stop there tie to the fence and go to the river bank in the shade for a visit with the Cardinal It was very warm and he was feeling the heat so much that in his heart he knew he would be glad to reach the end of the row and the rest he had promised himself The quick nervous strokes of the dinner bell Clang Clang came cutting the air clearly and sharply Abram stopped Nancy with a jerk It was the warning Maria had promised to send him if she saw prowlers with guns He shaded his eyes with his hand and scanned the points of the compass through narrowed lids with concentrated vision He first caught a gleam of light playing on a gun barrel and then he could discern the figure of a man clad in hunter s outfit leisurely walking down the lane toward the river Abram hastily hitched Nancy to the fence By making the best time he could he reached the opposite corner and was nibbling the midrib of a young corn blade and placidly viewing the landscape when the hunter passed Howdy he said in an even cordial voice The hunter walked on without lifting his eyes or making audible reply To Abram s friendly oldfashioned heart this seemed the rankest discourtesy and there was a flash in his eye and a certain quality in his voice he lifted a hand for parley Hold a minute my friend he said Since you are on my premises might I be privileged to ask if you have seen a few signs at I have posted pertainin to the use of a gun I am not blind replied the hunter and my education has been looked after to the extent that I can make out your notices From the number and size of them I think I could do it old man if I had no eyes The scarcely suppressed sneer and the old man grated on Abram s nerves amazingly for a man of sixty years of peace The gleam in his eyes grew stronger and there was a perceptible lift of his shoulders as he answered I meant em to be read an understood From the main road passin that cabin up there on the bank straight to the river an from the furthermost line o this field to the same is my premises an on every foot of em the signs are in full force They re in a little fuller force in June when half the bushes an tufts o grass are housin a young bird family an at any other time They re sort o upholdin the legislature s act providing for the protection o game an singin birds an maybe it ud be well for you to notice at I m not so old but I m able to stand up for my right to any livin man There certainly was an added tinge of respect in the hunter s tones as he asked Would you consider it trespass if a man simply crossed your land following the line of the fences to reach the farm of a friend Certainly not cried Abram cordial in his relief To be sure not Glad to have you convenience yourself I only wanted to jest call to your notice at the BIRDS are protected on this farm I have no intention of interfering with your precious birds I assure you replied the hunter And if you require an explanation of the gun in June I confess I did hope to be able to pick off a squirrel for a very sick friend But I suppose for even such cause it would not be allowed on your premises Oh pshaw now said Abram Man alive I m not onreasonable O course in case o sickness I d be glad if you could run across a squirrel All I wanted was to have a clear understandin about the birds Good luck an good day to you Abram started across the field to Nancy but he repeatedly turned to watch the gleam of the gun barrel as the hunter rounded the corner and started down the river bank He saw him leave the line of the fence and disappear in the thicket Goin straight for the sumac muttered Abram It s likely I m a fool for not stayin right beside him past that point An yet I made it fair an plain an he passed his word at he wouldn t touch the birds He untied Nancy and for the second time started toward the sumac He had been plowing carefully his attention divided between the mare and the corn but he uprooted half that row for his eyes wandered to the Cardinal s home as if he were fascinated and his hands were shaking with undue excitement as he gripped the plow handles At last he stopped Nancy and stood gazing eagerly toward the river Must be jest about the sumac he whispered Lord but I ll be glad to see the old gun barrel gleamin safe t other side o it There was a thin puff of smoke and a screaming echo went rolling and reverberating down the Wabash Abram s eyes widened and a curious whiteness settled on his lips He stood as if incapable of moving Clang Clang came Maria s second warning The trembling slid from him and his muscles hardened There was no trace of rheumatic stiffness in his movements With a bound he struck the chain traces from the singletree at Nancy s heels He caught the hames leaped on her back and digging his heels into her sides he stretched along her neck like an Indian and raced across the corn field Nancy s twenty years slipped from her as her master s sixty had from him Without understanding the emergency she knew that he required all the speed there was in her and with trace chains rattling and beating on her heels she stretched out until she fairly swept the young corn as she raced for the sumac Once Abram straightened and slipping a hand into his pocket drew out a formidable jack knife opening it as he rode When he reached the fence he almost flew over Nancy s head He went into a fence corner and with a few slashes severed a stout hickory withe stripping the leaves and topping it as he leaped the fence He grasped this ugly weapon his eyes dark with anger as he appeared before the hunter who supposed him at the other side of the field Did you shoot at that redbird he roared As his gun was at the sportman s shoulder and he was still peering among the bushes denial seemed useless Yes I did he replied and made a pretense of turning to the sumac again There was a forward impulse of Abram s body Hit im he demanded with awful calm Thought I had but I guess I only winged him Abram s fingers closed around his club At the sound of his friend s voice the Cardinal came darting through the bushes a wavering flame and swept so closely to him for protection that a wing almost brushed his cheek See here See here shrilled the bird in deadly panic There was not a cut feather on him Abram s relief was so great he seemed to shrink an inch in height Young man you better thank your God you missed that bird he said solemnly for if you d killed him I d a mauled this stick to ribbons on you an I m most afraid I wouldn t a knowed when to quit He advanced a step in his eagerness and the hunter mistaking his motive levelled his gun Drop that shouted Abram as he broke through the bushes that clung to him tore the clothing from his shoulders and held him back Drop that Don t you dare point a weapon at me on my own premises an after you passed your word Your word repeated Abram with withering scorn his white quivering old face terrible to see Young man I got a couple o things to say to you You r shaped like a man an you r dressed like a man an yet the smartest person livin would never take you for anything but an egg suckin dog this minute All the time God ever spent on you was wasted an your mother s had the same luck I s pose God s used to having creatures at He s made go wrong but I pity your mother Goodness knows a woman suffers an works enough over her children an then to fetch a boy to man s estate an have him of his own free will an accord be a liar Young man truth is the cornerstone o the temple o character Nobody can put up a good buildin without a solid foundation an you can t do solid character buildin with a lie at the base Man at s a liar ain t fit for anything Can t trust him in no sphere or relation o life or in any way shape or manner You passed out your word like a man an like a man I took it an went off trustin you an you failed me Like as not that squirrel story was a lie too Have you got a sick friend who is needin squirrel broth The hunter shook his head No That wasn t true either I ll own you make me curious Ud you mind tellin me what was your idy in cookin up that squirrel story The hunter spoke with an effort I suppose I wanted to do something to make you feel small he admitted in a husky voice You wanted to make me feel small repeated Abram wonderingly Lord Lord Young man did you ever hear o a boomerang It s a kind o weapon used in Borneo er Australy er some o them furrin parts an it s so made at the heathens can pitch it an it cuts a circle an comes back to the fellow at throwed I can t see myself an I don t know how small I m lookin but I d rather lose ten year o my life an to have anybody catch me lookin as little as you do right now I guess we look about the way we feel in this world I m feelin near the size o Goliath at present but your size is such at it hustles me to see any MAN in you at all An you wanted to make me feel small My oh my An you so young yet too An if it hadn t a compassed a matter o breakin your word what ud you want to kill the redbird for anyhow Who give you rights to go round takin such beauty an joy out of the world Who do you think made this world an the things at s in it Maybe it s your notion at somebody about your size whittled it from a block o wood scattered a little sand for earth stuck a few seeds for trees an started the oceans with a waterin pot I don t know what paved streets an stall feedin do for a man but any one at s lived sixty year on the ground knows at this whole old earth is jest teemin with work at s too big for anything but a God an a mighty BIG God at that You don t never need bother none bout the diskivries o science for if science could prove at the earth was a red hot slag broken from the sun at balled an cooled flyin through space until the force o gravity caught an held it it doesn t prove what the sun broke from or why it balled an didn t cool Sky over your head earth under foot trees around you an river there all full o life at you ain t no mortal right to touch cos God made it an it s His Course I know at He said distinct at man was to have dominion over the beasts o the field an the fowls o the air An that means at you re free to smash a copperhead instead of letting it sting you Means at you better shoot a wolf than to let it carry off your lambs Means at it s right to kill a hawk an save your chickens but God knows at shootin a redbird just to see the feathers fly isn t having dominion over anything it s jest makin a plumb beast o YERSELF Passes me how you can face up to the Almighty an draw a bead on a thing like that Takes more gall n I got God never made anything prettier an that bird an He must a been mighty proud o the job Jest cast your eyes on it there Ever see anything so runnin over with dainty pretty coaxin ways Little red creatures full o hist ry too Ever think o that Last year s bird hatched hereabout like as not Went South for winter an made friends at s been feedin an teachin it to TRUST mankind Back this spring in a night an struck that sumac over a month ago Broke me all up first time I ever set eyes on it Biggest reddest redbird I ever saw an jest a master hand at king s English Talk plain as you can Don t know what he said down South but you can bank on it it was sumpin pretty fine When he settled here he was discoursin on the weather an he talked it out about proper He d say Wet year Wet year jest like that He got the wet jest as good as I can an if he drawed the ye ar out a little still any blockhead could a told what he was sayin an in a voice pretty an clear as a bell Then he got love sick an begged for comp ny until he broke me all up An if I d a been a hen redbird I wouldn t a been so long comin Had me pulverized in less n no time Then a little hen comes long an stops with him an twas like an organ playin prayers to hear him tell her how he loved her Now they ve got a nest full o the cunningest little topknot babies an he s splittin the echoes calling for the whole neighbourhood to come see em he s so mortal proud Stake my life he s never been fired on afore He s pretty near wild with narvousness but he s got too much spunk to leave his fam ly an go off an hide from creatures like you They s no caution in him Look at him tearin round to give you another chance I felt most too rheumaticky to tackle field work this spring until he come long an the fire o his coat an song got me warmed up as I ain t been in years Work s gone like it was greased an my soul s been singin for joy o life an happiness ev ry minute o the time since he come Been carryin him grub to that top rail once an twice a day for the last month an I can go in three feet o him My wife comes to see him an brings him stuff an we about worship him Who are you to come long an wipe out his joy in life an our joy in him for jest nothin You d a left him to rot on the ground if you d a hit him an me an Maria s loved him so D you ever stop to think how full this world is o things to love if your heart s jest big enough to let em in We love to live for the beauty o the things surroundin us an the joy we take in bein among em An it s my belief at the way to make folks love us is for us to be able to preciate what they can do If a man s puttin his heart an soul an blood an beef steak an bones into paintin picters you can talk farmin to him all day an he s dumb but jest show him at you see what he s a drivin at in his work an he ll love you like a brother Whatever anybody succeeds in it s success cos they so love it at they put the best o theirselves into it an so lovin what they do is lovin them It ud bout kill a painter man to put the best o himself into his picture an then have some fellow like you come long an pour turpentine on it jest to see the paint run an I think it must pretty well use God up to figure out how to make an colour a thing like that bird an then have you walk up an shoot the little red heart out of it jest to prove at you can He s the very life o this river bank I d as soon see you dig up the underbrush an dry up the river an spoil the picture they make against the sky as to hev you drop the redbird He s the red life o the whole thing God must a made him when his heart was pulsin hot with love an the lust o creatin in com PAR able things an He jest saw how pretty it ud be to dip his featherin into the blood He was puttin in his veins To my mind ain t no better way to love an worship God an to protect an preciate these fine gifts He s given for our joy an use Worshipin that bird s a kind o religion with me Getting the beauty from the sky an the trees an the grass an the water at God made is nothin but doin Him homage Whole earth s a sanctuary You can worship from sky above to grass under foot Course each man has his particular altar Mine s in that cabin up at the bend o the river Maria lives there God never did cleaner work an when He made Maria Lovin her s sacrament She s so clean an pure an honest an big hearted In forty year I ve never jest durst brace right up to Maria an try to put in words what she means to me Never saw nothin else as beautiful or as good No flower s as fragrant an smelly as her hair on her pillow Never tapped a bee tree with honey sweet as her lips a twitchin with a love quiver Ain t a bird long the ol Wabash with a voice up to hers Love o God ain t broader n her kindness When she s been home to see her folks I ve been so hungry for her at I ve gone to her closet an kissed the hem o her skirts more n once I ve never yet dared kiss her feet but I ve always wanted to I ve laid out at if she dies first I ll do it then An Maria ud cry her eyes out if you d a hit the redbird Your trappin s look like you could shoot I guess twas God made that shot fly the mark I guess If you can stop for the love of mercy do it cried the hunter His face was a sickly white his temples wet with sweat and his body trembling I can t endure any more I don t suppose you think I ve any human instincts at all but I have a few and I see the way to arouse more You probably won t believe me but I ll never kill another innocent harmless thing and I will never lie again so long as I live He leaned his gun against the thorn tree and dropped the remainder of his hunter s outfit beside it on the ground I don t seem a fit subject to have dominion he said I ll leave those thing for you and thank you for what you have done for me There was a crash through the bushes a leap over the fence and Abram and the Cardinal were alone The old man sat down suddenly on a fallen limb of the sycamore He was almost dazed with astonishment He held up his shaking hands and watched them wonderingly and then cupped one over each trembling knee to steady himself He outlined his dry lips with the tip of his tongue and breathed in heavy gusts He glanced toward the thorn tree Left his gun he hoarsely whispered an it s fine as a fiddle Lock stock an barrel just a shinin An all that heap o leather fixin s Must a cost a lot o money Said he wasn t fit to use em Lept the fence like a panther an cut dirt across the corn field An left me the gun Well Well Well Wonder what I said I must a been almost FIERCE See here See here shrilled the Cardinal Abram looked him over carefully He was quivering with fear but in no way injured My but that was a close call ol fellow said Abram Minute later an our fun ud a been over an the summer jest spoiled Wonder if you knew what it meant an if you ll be gun shy after this Land knows I hope so for a few more such doses ull jest lay me up He gathered himself together at last set the gun over the fence and climbing after it caught Nancy who had feasted to plethora on young corn He fastened up the trace chains and climbing to her back laid the gun across his lap and rode to the barn He attended the mare with particular solicitude and bathed his face and hands in the water trough to make himself a little more presentable to Maria He started to the house but had only gone a short way when he stopped and after standing in thought for a time turned back to the barn and gave Nancy another ear of corn After all it was all you ol girl he said patting her shoulder I never on earth could a made it on time afoot He was so tired he leaned for support against her for the unusual exertion and intense excitement were telling on him sorely and as he rested he confided to her I don t know as I ever in my life was so riled Nancy I m afraid I was a little mite fierce He exhibited the gun and told the story very soberly at supper time and Maria was so filled with solicitude for him and the bird and so indignant at the act of the hunter that she never said a word about Abram s torn clothing and the hours of patching that would ensue She sat looking at the gun and thinking intently for a long time and then she said pityingly I don t know jest what you could a said at ud make a man go off an leave a gun like that Poor fellow I do hope Abram you didn t come down on him too awful strong Maybe he lost his mother when he was jest a little tyke an he hasn t had much teachin Abram was completely worn out and went early to bed Far in the night Maria felt him fumbling around her face in an effort to learn if she were covered and as he drew the sheet over her shoulder he muttered in worn and sleepy tones I m afraid they s no use denyin it Maria I WAS JEST MORTAL FIERCE In the sumac the frightened little mother cardinal was pressing her precious babies close against her breast and all through the night she kept calling to her mate Chook Chook and was satisfied only when an answering Chip came As for the Cardinal he had learned a new lesson He had not been under fire before Never again would he trust any one carrying a shining thing that belched fire and smoke He had seen the hunter coming and had raced home to defend his mate and babies thus making a brilliant mark of himself and as he would not have deserted them only the arrival of the farmer had averted a tragedy in the sumac He did not learn to use caution for himself but after that if a gun came down the shining river he sent a warning Chip to his mate telling her to crouch low in her nest and keep very quiet and then in broken waves of flight and with chirp and flutter he exposed himself until he had lured danger from his beloved ones When the babies grew large enough for their mother to leave them a short time she assisted in food hunting and the Cardinal was not so busy He then could find time frequently to mount to the top of the dogwood and cry to the world See here See here for the cardinal babies were splendid But his music was broken intermittent vocalizing now often uttered past a beakful of food and interspersed with spasmodic chips if danger threatened his mate and nestlings Despite all their care it was not so very long until trouble came to the sumac and it was all because the first born was plainly greedy much more so than either his little brother or his sister and he was one day ahead of them in strength He always pushed himself forward cried the loudest and longest and so took the greater part of the food carried to the nest and one day while he was still quite awkward and uncertain he climbed to the edge and reached so far that he fell He rolled down the river bank splash into the water and a hungry old pickerel sunning in the weeds finished him at a snap He made a morsel so fat sweet and juicy that the pickerel lingered close for a week waiting to see if there would be any more accidents The Cardinal hunting grubs in the corn field heard the frightened cries of his mate and dashed to the sumac in time to see the poor little ball of brightly tinted feathers disappear in the water and to hear the splash of the fish He called in helpless panic and fluttered over the spot He watched and waited until there was no hope of the nestling coming up then he went to the sumac to try to comfort his mate She could not be convinced that her young one was gone and for the remainder of the day filled the air with alarm cries and notes of wailing The two that remained were surely the envy of Birdland The male baby was a perfect copy of his big crimson father only his little coat was gray but it was so highly tinged with red that it was brilliant and his beak and feet were really red and how his crest did flare and how proud and important he felt when he found he could raise and lower it at will His sister was not nearly so bright as he and she was almost as greedy as the lost brother With his father s chivalry he allowed her to crowd in and take the most of the seeds and berries so that she continually appeared as if she could swallow no more yet she was constantly calling for food She took the first flight being so greedy she forgot to be afraid and actually flew to a neighbouring thorn tree to meet the Cardinal coming with food before she realized what she had done For once gluttony had its proper reward She not only missed the bite but she got her little self mightily well scared With popping eyes and fear flattened crest she clung to the thorn limb shivering at the depths below and it was the greatest comfort when her brother plucked up courage and came sailing across to her But of course she could not be expected to admit that When she saw how easily he did it she flared her crest turned her head indifferently and inquired if he did not find flying a very easy matter once he mustered courage to try it and she made him very much ashamed indeed because he had allowed her to be the first to leave the nest From the thorn tree they worked their way to the dead sycamore but there the lack of foliage made them so conspicuous that their mother almost went into spasms from fright and she literally drove them back to the sumac The Cardinal was so inordinately proud and made such a brave showing of teaching them to fly bathe and all the other things necessary for young birds to know that it was a great mercy they escaped with their lives He had mastered many lessons but he never could be taught how to be quiet and conceal himself With explosive chips flaming and flashing he met dangers that sent all the other birds beside the shining river racing to cover Concealment he scorned and repose he never knew It was a summer full of rich experience for the Cardinal After these first babies were raised and had flown two more nests were built and two other broods flew around the sumac By fall the Cardinal was the father of a small flock and they were each one neat trim beautiful river birds He had lived through spring with its perfumed air pale flowers and burning heart hunger He had known summer in its golden mood with forests pungent with spicebush and sassafras festooned with wild grape woodbine and bittersweet carpeted with velvet moss and starry mandrake peeping from beneath green shades the never ending murmur of the shining river and the rich fulfilment of love s fruition Now it was fall and all the promises of spring were accomplished The woods were glorious in autumnal tints There were ripened red haws black haws and wild grapes only waiting for severe frosts nuts rattling down scurrying squirrels and the rabbits flash of gray and brown The waysides were bright with the glory of goldenrod and royal with the purple of asters and ironwort There was the rustle of falling leaves the flitting of velvety butterflies the whir of wings trained southward and the call of the king crow gathering his followers Then to the Cardinal came the intuition that it was time to lead his family to the orange orchard One day they flamed and rioted up and down the shining river raced over the corn field and tilted on the sumac The next a black frost had stripped its antlered limbs Stark and deserted it stood a picture of loneliness O bird of wonderful plumage and human like song What a precious thought of Divinity to create such beauty and music for our pleasure Brave songster of the flaming coat too proud to hide your flashing beauty too fearless to be cautious of the many dangers that beset you from the top of the morning we greet you and hail you King of Birdland at your imperious command See here See here End of Project Gutenberg s The Song of the Cardinal by Gene Stratton Porter END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG
