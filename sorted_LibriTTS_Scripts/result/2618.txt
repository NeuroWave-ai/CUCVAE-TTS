Transcribed from the nineteen oh two Harper and Brothers edition by David Price email ccxseventy four coventry ac uk A HOUSE BOAT ON THE STYX by John Kendrick Bangs CHAPTER I CHARON MAKES A DISCOVERY Charon the Ferryman of renown was cruising slowly along the Styx one pleasant Friday morning not long ago and as he paddled idly on he chuckled mildly to himself as he thought of the monopoly in ferriage which in the course of years he had managed to build up It s a great thing he said with a smirk of satisfaction it s a great thing to be the go between between two states of being to have the exclusive franchise to export and import shades from one state to the other and withal to have had as clean a record as mine has been Valuable as is my franchise I never corrupted a public official in my life and Here Charon stopped his soliloquy and his boat simultaneously As he rounded one of the many turns in the river a singular object met his gaze and one too that filled him with misgiving It was another craft and that was a thing not to be tolerated Had he Charon owned the exclusive right of way on the Styx all these years to have it disputed here in the closing decade of the Nineteenth Century Had not he dealt satisfactorily with all whether it was in the line of ferriage or in the providing of boats for pleasure trips up the river Had he not received expressions of satisfaction indeed from the most exclusive families of Hades with the very select series of picnics he had given at Charon s Glen Island No wonder then that the queer looking boat that met his gaze moored in a shady nook on the dark side of the river filled him with dismay Blow me for a landlubber if I like that he said in a hardly audible whisper And shiver my timbers if I don t find out what she s there for If anybody thinks he can run an opposition line to mine on this river he s mightily mistaken If it comes to competition I can carry shades for nothing and still quaff the B G yellow label benzine three times a day without experiencing a financial panic I ll show em a thing or two if they attempt to rival me And what a boat It looks for all the world like a Florentine barn on a canal boat Charon paddled up to the side of the craft and standing up in the middle of his boat cried out Ship ahoy There was no answer and the Ferryman hailed her again Receiving no response to his second call he resolved to investigate for himself so fastening his own boat to the stern post of the stranger he clambered on board If he was astonished as he sat in his ferry boat he was paralyzed when he cast his eye over the unwelcome vessel he had boarded He stood for at least two minutes rooted to the spot His eye swept over a long broad deck the polish of which resembled that of a ball room floor Amidships running from three quarters aft to three quarters forward stood a structure that in its lines resembled as Charon had intimated a barn designed by an architect enamoured of Florentine simplicity but in its construction the richest of woods had been used and in its interior arrangement and adornment nothing more palatial could be conceived What s the blooming thing for said Charon more dismayed than ever If they start another line with a craft like this I m very much afraid I m done for after all I wouldn t take a boat like mine myself if there was a floating palace like this going the same way I ll have to see the Commissioners about this and find out what it all means I suppose it ll cost me a pretty penny too confound them A prey to these unhappy reflections Charon investigated further and the more he saw the less he liked it He was about to encounter opposition and an opposition which was apparently backed by persons of great wealth perhaps the Commissioners themselves It was a consoling thought that he had saved enough money in the course of his career to enable him to live in comfort all his days but this was not really what Charon was after He wished to acquire enough to retire and become one of the smart set It had been done in that section of the universe which lay on the bright side of the Styx why not therefore on the other he asked I m pretty well connected even if I am a boatman he had been known to say With Chaos for a grandfather and Erebus and Nox for parents I ve just as good blood in my veins as anybody in Hades The Noxes are a mighty fine family not as bright as the Days but older and we re poor that s it poor and it s money makes caste these days If I had millions and owned a railroad they d call me a yacht owner As I haven t I m only a boatman Bah Wait and see I ll be giving swell functions myself some day and these upstarts will be on their knees before me begging to be asked Then I ll get up a little aristocracy of my own and I won t let a soul into it whose name isn t mentioned in the Grecian mythologies Mention in Burke s peerage and the Elite directories of America won t admit anybody to Commodore Charon s house unless there s some other mighty good reason for it Foreseeing an unhappy ending to all his hopes the old man clambered sadly back into his ancient vessel and paddled off into the darkness Some hours later returning with a large company of new arrivals while counting up the profits of the day Charon again caught sight of the new craft and saw that it was brilliantly lighted and thronged with the most famous citizens of the Erebean country Up in the bow was a spirit band discoursing music of the sweetest sort Merry peals of laughter rang out over the dark waters of the Styx The clink of glasses and the popping of corks punctuated the music with a frequency which would have delighted the soul of the most ardent lover of commas all of which so overpowered the grand master boatman of the Stygian Ferry Company that he dropped three oboli and an American dime which he carried as a pocket piece overboard This of course added to his woe but it was forgotten in an instant for some one on the new boat had turned a search light directly upon Charon himself and simultaneously hailed the master of the ferry boat Charon cried the shade in charge of the light Charon ahoy Ahoy yourself returned the old man paddling his craft close up to the stranger What do you want You said the shade The house committee want to see you right away What for asked Charon cautiously I m sure I don t know I m only a member of the club and house committees never let mere members know anything about their plans All I know is that you are wanted said the other Who are the house committee queried the Ferryman Sir Walter Raleigh Cassius Demosthenes Blackstone Doctor Johnson and Confucius replied the shade Tell em I ll be back in an hour said Charon pushing off I ve got a cargo of shades on board consigned to various places up the river I ve promised to get em all through to night but I ll put on a couple of extra paddles two of the new arrivals are working their passage this trip and it won t take as long as usual What boat is this anyhow The Nancy Nox of Erebus Thunder cried Charon as he pushed off and proceeded on his way up the river Named after my mother Perhaps it ll come out all right yet More hopeful of mood Charon aided by the two dead head passengers soon got through with his evening s work and in less than an hour was back seeking admittance as requested to the company of Sir Walter Raleigh and his fellow members on the house committee He was received by these worthies with considerable effusiveness considering his position in society and it warmed the cockles of his aged heart to note that Sir Walter who had always been rather distant to him since he had carelessly upset that worthy and Queen Elizabeth in the middle of the Styx far back in the last century permitted him to shake three fingers of his left hand when he entered the committee room How do you do Charon said Sir Walter affably We are very glad to see you Thank you kindly Sir Walter said the boatman I m glad to hear those words your honor for I ve been feeling very bad since I had the misfortune to drop your Excellency and her Majesty overboard I never knew how it happened sir but happen it did and but for her Majesty s kind assistance it might have been the worse for us Eh Sir Walter The knight shook his head menacingly at Charon Hitherto he had managed to keep it a secret that the Queen had rescued him from drowning upon that occasion by swimming ashore herself first and throwing Sir Walter her ruff as soon as she landed which he had used as a life preserver Sh he said sotto voce Don t say anything about that my man Very well Sir Walter I won t said the boatman but he made a mental note of the knight s agitation and perceived a means by which that illustrious courtier could be made useful to him in his scheming for social advancement I understood you had something to say to me said Charon after he had greeted the others We have said Sir Walter We want you to assume command of this boat The old fellow s eyes lighted up with pleasure You want a captain eh he said No said Confucius tapping the table with a diamond studded chop stick No We want a er what the deuce is it they call the functionary Cassius Senator I think said Cassius Demosthenes gave a loud laugh Your mind is still running on Senatorships my dear Cassius That is quite evident he said This is not one of them however The title we wish Charon to assume is neither Captain nor Senator it is Janitor What s that asked Charon a little disappointed What does a Janitor have to do He has to look after things in the house explained Sir Walter He s a sort of proprietor by proxy We want you to take charge of the house and see to it that the boat is kept shipshape Where is the house queried the astonished boatman This is it said Sir Walter This is the house and the boat too In fact it is a house boat Then it isn t a new fangled scheme to drive me out of business said Charon warily Not at all returned Sir Walter It s a new fangled scheme to set you up in business We ll pay you a large salary and there won t be much to do You are the best man for the place because while you don t know much about houses you do know a great deal about boats and the boat part is the most important part of a house boat If the boat sinks you can t save the house but if the house burns you may be able to save the boat See I think I do sir said Charon Another reason why we want to employ you for Janitor said Confucius is that our club wants to be in direct communication with both sides of the Styx and we think you as Janitor would be able to make better arrangements for transportation with yourself as boatman than some other man as Janitor could make with you Spoken like a sage said Demosthenes Furthermore said Cassius occasionally we shall want to have this boat towed up or down the river according to the house committee s pleasure and we think it would be well to have a Janitor who has some influence with the towing company which you represent Can t this boat be moved without towing asked Charon No said Cassius And I m the only man who can tow it eh You are said Blackstone Worse luck And you want me to be Janitor on a salary of what A hundred oboli a month said Sir Walter uneasily Very well gentlemen said Charon I ll accept the office on a salary of two hundred oboli a month with Saturdays off The committee went into executive session for five minutes and on their return informed Charon that in behalf of the Associated Shades they accepted his offer In behalf of what the old man asked The Associated Shades said Sir Walter The swellest organization in Hades whose new house boat you are now on board of When shall you be ready to begin work Right away said Charon noting by the clock that it was the hour of midnight I ll start in right away and as it is now Saturday morning I ll begin by taking my day off CHAPTER II 
474-141422-0000	train-other-500	A DISPUTED AUTHORSHIP How are you Charon said Shakespeare as the Janitor assisted him on board Any one here to night Yes sir said Charon Lord Bacon is up in the library
474-141422-0001	train-other-500	and Doctor Johnson is down in the billiard room playing pool with Nero Ha ha laughed Shakespeare Pool eh Does Nero play pool Not as well as he does the fiddle sir said the Janitor with a twinkle in his eye
474-141422-0002	train-other-500	Shakespeare entered the house and tossed up an obolus Heads Bacon tails pool with Nero and Johnson he said The coin came down with heads up and Shakespeare went into the pool room
474-141422-0003	train-other-500	just to show the Fates that he didn t care a tuppence for their verdict as registered through the obolus It was a peculiar custom of Shakespeare s to toss up a coin to decide questions of little consequence and then do the thing the coin decided he should not do
474-141422-0004	train-other-500	It showed in Shakespeare s estimation his entire independence of those dull persons who supposed that in them was centred the destiny of all mankind The Fates however only smiled at these little acts of rebellion
474-141422-0005	train-other-500	and it was common gossip in Erebus that one of the trio had told the Furies that they had observed Shakespeare s tendency to kick over the traces and always acted accordingly They never let the coin fall so as to decide a question the way they wanted it
474-141422-0006	train-other-500	so that unwittingly the great dramatist did their will after all It was a part of their plan that upon this occasion Shakespeare should play pool with Doctor Johnson and the Emperor Nero
none	none	 and hence it was that the coin bade him repair to the library and chat with Lord Bacon 
474-141422-0007	train-other-500	Hullo William said the Doctor pocketing three balls on the break How s our little Swanlet of Avon this afternoon Worn out Shakespeare replied I ve been hard at work on a play this morning and I m tired
474-141422-0008	train-other-500	All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy said Nero grinning broadly You are a bright spirit said Shakespeare with a sigh I wish I had thought to work you up into a tragedy I ve often wondered why you didn t
474-141422-0009	train-other-500	said Doctor Johnson He d have made a superb tragedy Nero would I don t believe there was any kind of a crime he left uncommitted Was there Emperor Yes I never wrote an English dictionary returned the Emperor dryly
474-141422-0010	train-other-500	I ve murdered everything but English though I could have made a fine tragedy out of you said Shakespeare Just think what a dreadful climax for a tragedy it would be Johnson to have Nero as the curtain fell playing a violin solo
474-141422-0011	train-other-500	Pretty good returned the Doctor But what s the use of killing off your audience that way It s better business to let em live I say Suppose Nero gave a London audience that little musicale he provided at Queen Elizabeth s Wednesday night
none	none	 How many purely mortal beings do you think would have come out alive 
474-141422-0012	train-other-500	Not one said Shakespeare I was mighty glad that night that we were an immortal band If it had been possible to kill us we d have died then and there That s all right said Nero with a significant shake of his head
none	none	 As my friend Bacon makes Ingo say Beware my lord of jealousy You never could play a garden hose much less a fiddle 
474-141422-0013	train-other-500	What do you mean my attributing those words to Bacon demanded Shakespeare getting red in the face Oh come now William remonstrated Nero
474-141422-0014	train-other-500	It s all right to pull the wool over the eyes of the mortals That s what they re there for but as for us we re all in the secret here What s the use of putting on nonsense with us We ll see in a minute what the use is retorted the Avonian We ll have Bacon down here
none	none	 Here he touched an electric button and Charon came in answer Charon bring Doctor Johnson the usual glass of ale 
474-141422-0015	train-other-500	Get some ice for the Emperor and ask Lord Bacon to step down here a minute I don t want any ice said Nero Not now retorted Shakespeare but you will in a few minutes When we have finished with you you ll want an iceberg
474-141422-0016	train-other-500	I m getting tired of this idiotic talk about not having written my own works There s one thing about Nero s music that I ve never said because I haven t wanted to hurt his feelings but since he has chosen to cast aspersions upon my honesty I haven t any hesitation in saying it now
474-141422-0017	train-other-500	I believe it was one of his fiddlings that sent Nature into convulsions and caused the destruction of Pompeii so there Put that on your music rack and fiddle it my little Emperor Nero s face grew purple with anger
none	none	 and if Shakespeare had been anything but a shade he would have fared ill 
474-141422-0018	train-other-500	for the enraged Roman poising his cue on high as though it were a lance hurled it at the impertinent dramatist with all his strength and with such accuracy of aim withal that it pierced the spot beneath which in life the heart of Shakespeare used to beat
474-141422-0019	train-other-500	Good shot said Doctor Johnson nonchalantly
none	none	 If you had been a mortal William it would have been the end of you 
474-141422-0020	train-other-500	You can t kill me said Shakespeare shrugging his shoulders I know seven dozen actors in the United States who are trying to do it but they can t
none	none	 I wish they d try to kill a critic once in a while instead of me though he added 
474-141422-0021	train-other-500	I went over to Boston one night last week and unknown to anybody I waylaid a fellow who was to play Hamlet that night I drugged him and went to the theatre and played the part myself It was the coldest house you ever saw in your life
none	none	 When the audience did applaud it sounded like an ice man chopping up ice with a small pick Several times I looked up at the galleries to see if there were not icicles growing on them it was so cold Well I did the best could with the part and next morning watched curiously for the criticisms 
474-141422-0022	train-other-500	Favorable asked the Doctor They all dismissed me with a line said the dramatist Said my conception of the part was not Shakespearian And that s criticism
474-141422-0023	train-other-500	No said the shade of Emerson which had strolled in while Shakespeare was talking that isn t criticism that s Boston Who discovered Boston anyhow asked Doctor Johnson It wasn t Columbus was it
474-141422-0024	train-other-500	Oh no said Emerson Old Governor Winthrop is to blame for that When he settled at Charlestown he saw the old Indian town of Shawmut across the Charles And Shawmut was the Boston microbe was it asked Johnson Yes
474-141422-0025	train-other-500	said Emerson Spelt with a P I suppose said Shakespeare P S H A W Pshaw M U T mut Pshawmut so called because the inhabitants are always muttering pshaw Eh Pretty good said Johnson
474-141422-0026	train-other-500	I wish I d said that Well tell Boswell said Shakespeare
none	none	 He ll make you say it and it ll be all the same in a hundred years 
474-141422-0027	train-other-500	Lord Bacon accompanied by Charon and the ice for Nero and the ale for Doctor Johnson appeared as Shakespeare spoke The philosopher bowed stiffly at Doctor Johnson as though he hardly approved of him extended his left hand to Shakespeare
474-141422-0028	train-other-500	and stared coldly at Nero Did you send for me William he asked languidly I did said Shakespeare
none	none	 I sent for you because this imperial violinist here says that you wrote Othello 
474-141422-0029	train-other-500	What nonsense said Bacon The only plays of yours I wrote were Ham Sh said Shakespeare shaking his head madly Hush Nobody s said anything about that This is purely a discussion of Othello
474-141422-0030	train-other-500	The fiddling ex Emperor Nero said Bacon loudly enough to be heard all about the room is mistaken when he attributes Othello to me Aha Master Nero cried Shakespeare triumphantly What did I tell you
474-141422-0031	train-other-500	Then I erred that is all said Nero And I apologize But really my Lord he added addressing Bacon I fancied I detected your fine Italian hand in that No I had nothing to do with the Othello said Bacon
none	none	 I never really knew who wrote it Never mind about that whispered Shakespeare You ve said enough That s good too said Nero with a chuckle Shakespeare here claims it as his own 
474-141422-0032	train-other-500	Bacon smiled and nodded approvingly at the blushing Avonian
none	none	 Will always was having his little joke he said Eh Will How we fooled em on Hamlet eh my boy Ha 
474-141422-0033	train-other-500	ha ha It was the greatest joke of the century Well the laugh is on you said Doctor Johnson If you wrote Hamlet and didn t have the sense to acknowledge it
474-141422-0034	train-other-500	you present to my mind a closer resemblance to Simple Simon than to Socrates For my part I don t believe you did write it and I do believe that Shakespeare did I can tell that by the spelling in the original edition
474-141422-0035	train-other-500	Shakespeare was my stenographer gentlemen said Lord Bacon If you want to know the whole truth he did write Hamlet literally But it was at my dictation I deny it said Shakespeare
474-141422-0036	train-other-500	I admit you gave me a suggestion now and then so as to keep it dull and heavy in spots so that it would seem more like a real tragedy than a comedy punctuated with deaths but beyond that you had nothing to do with it I side with Shakespeare put in Emerson
474-141422-0037	train-other-500	I ve seen his autographs and no sane person would employ a man who wrote such a villanously bad hand as an amanuensis It s no use Bacon we know a thing or two I m a New Englander I am
474-141422-0038	train-other-500	Well said Bacon shrugging his shoulders as though the results of the controversy were immaterial to him have it so if you please There isn t any money in Shakespeare these days so what s the use of quarrelling I wrote Hamlet
474-141422-0039	train-other-500	and Shakespeare knows it Others know it Ah here comes Sir Walter Raleigh We ll leave it to him He was cognizant of the whole affair I leave it to nobody said Shakespeare sulkily What s the trouble asked Raleigh
474-141422-0040	train-other-500	sauntering up and taking a chair under the cue rack Talking politics Not we said Bacon It s the old question about the authorship of Hamlet Will as usual claims it for himself He ll be saying he wrote Genesis next
none	none	 Well what if he does laughed Raleigh 
474-141422-0041	train-other-500	We all know Will and his droll ways No doubt put in Nero But the question of Hamlet always excites him so that we d like to have it settled once and for all as to who wrote it Bacon says you know
none	none	 I do said Raleigh Then settle it once and for all said Bacon I m rather tired of the discussion myself Shall I tell em Shakespeare asked Raleigh It s immaterial to me said Shakespeare airily If you wish only tell the truth Very well said Raleigh lighting a cigar I m not ashamed of it I wrote the thing myself There was a roar of laughter which when it subsided found Shakespeare rapidly disappearing through the door while all the others in the room ordered various beverages at the expense of Lord Bacon CHAPTER III WASHINGTON GIVES A DINNER It was Washington s Birthday and the gentleman who had the pleasure of being Father of his Country decided to celebrate it at the Associated Shades floating palace on the Styx as the Elysium Weekly Gossip a Journal of Society called it by giving a dinner to a select number of friends Among the invited guests were Baron Munchausen Doctor Johnson Confucius Napoleon Bonaparte Diogenes and Ptolemy Boswell was also present but not as a guest He had a table off to one side all to himself and upon it there were no china plates silver spoons knives forks and dishes of fruit but pads pens and ink in great quantity It was evident that Boswell s reportorial duties did not end with his labors in the mundane sphere The dinner was set down to begin at seven o clock so that the guests as was proper sauntered slowly in between that hour and eight The menu was particularly choice the shades of countless canvas back ducks terrapin and sheep having been called into requisition and cooked by no less a person than Brillat Savarin in the hottest oven he could find in the famous cooking establishment superintended by the government Washington was on hand early sampling the olives and the celery and the wines and giving to Charon final instructions as to the manner in which he wished things served The first guest to arrive was Confucius and after him came Diogenes the latter in great excitement over having discovered a comparatively honest man whose name however he had not been able to ascertain though he was under the impression that it was something like Burpin or Turpin he said At eight the brilliant company was arranged comfortably about the board An orchestra of five under the leadership of Mozart discoursed sweet music behind a screen and the feast of reason and flow of soul began This is a great day said Doctor Johnson assisting himself copiously to the olives Yes said Columbus who was also a guest yes it is a great day but it isn t a marker to a little day in October I wot of Still sore on that point queried Confucius trying the edge of his knife on the shade of a salted almond Oh no said Columbus calmly I don t feel jealous of Washington He is the Father of his Country and I am not I only discovered the orphan I knew the country before it had a father or a mother There wasn t anybody who was willing to be even a sister to it when I knew it But G W here took it in hand groomed it down spanked it when it needed it and started it off on the career which has made it worth while for me to let my name be known in connection with it Why should I be jealous of him I am sure I don t know why anybody anywhere should be jealous of anybody else anyhow said Diogenes I never was and I never expect to be Jealousy is a quality that is utterly foreign to the nature of an honest man Take my own case for instance When I was what they call alive how did I live I don t know said Doctor Johnson turning his head as he spoke so that Boswell could not fail to hear I wasn t there Boswell nodded approvingly chuckled slightly and put the Doctor s remark down for publication in The Gossip You re doubtless right there retorted Diogenes What you don t know would fill a circulating library Well I lived in a tub Now if I believed in envy I suppose you think I d be envious of people who live in brownstone fronts with back yards and mortgages eh I d rather live under a mortgage than in a tub said Bonaparte contemptuously I know you would said Diogenes Mortgages never bothered you but I wouldn t In the first place my tub was warm I never saw a house with a brownstone front that was except in summer and then the owner cursed it because it was so My tub had no plumbing in it to get out of order It hadn t any flights of stairs in it that had to be climbed after dinner or late at night when I came home from the club It had no front door with a wandering key hole calculated to elude the key ninety nine times out of every hundred efforts to bring the two together and reconcile their differences in order that their owner may get into his own house late at night It wasn t chained down to any particular neighborhood as are most brownstone fronts If the neighborhood ran down I could move my tub off into a better neighborhood and it never lost value through the deterioration of its location I never had to pay taxes on it and no burglar was ever so hard up that he thought of breaking into my habitation to rob me So why should I be jealous of the brownstone house dwellers I am a philosopher gentlemen I tell you philosophy is the thief of jealousy and I had the good luck to find it out early in life There is much in what you say said Confucius But there s another side to the matter If a man is an aristocrat by nature as I was his neighborhood never could run down Wherever he lived would be the swell section so that really your last argument isn t worth a stewed icicle Stewed icicles are pretty good though said Baron Munchausen with an ecstatic smack of his lips I ve eaten them many a time in the polar regions I have no doubt of it put in Doctor Johnson You ve eaten fried pyramids in Africa too haven t you Only once said the Baron calmly And I can t say I enjoyed them They are rather heavy for the digestion That s so said Ptolemy I ve had experience with pyramids myself You never ate one did you Ptolemy queried Bonaparte Not raw said Ptolemy with a chuckle Though I ve been tempted many a time to call for a second joint of the Sphinx There was a laugh at this in which all but Baron Munchausen joined I think it is too bad said the Baron as the laughter subsided I think it is very much too bad that you shades have brought mundane prejudice with you into this sphere Just because some people with finite minds profess to disbelieve my stories you think it well to be sceptical yourselves I don t care however whether you believe me or not The fact remains that I have eaten one fried pyramid and countless stewed icicles and the stewed icicles were finer than any diamond back rat Confucius ever had served at a state banquet Where s Shakespeare to night asked Confucius seeing that the Baron was beginning to lose his temper and wishing to avoid trouble by changing the subject Wasn t he invited General Yes said Washington he was invited but he couldn t come He had to go over the river to consult with an autograph syndicate they ve formed in New York You know his autographs sell for about one thousand dollars apiece and they re trying to get up a scheme whereby he shall contribute an autograph a week to the syndicate to be sold to the public It seems like a rich scheme but there s one thing in the way Posthumous autographs haven t very much of a market because the mortals can t be made to believe that they are genuine but the syndicate has got a man at work trying to get over that These Yankees are a mighty inventive lot and they think perhaps the scheme can be worked The Yankee is an inventive genius It was a Yankee invented that tale about your not being able to prevaricate wasn t it George asked Diogenes Washington smiled acquiescence and Doctor Johnson returned to Shakespeare I d rather have a morning glory vine than one of Shakespeare s autographs said he They are far prettier and quite as legible Mortals wouldn t said Bonaparte What fools they be chuckled Johnson At this point the canvas back ducks were served one whole shade of a bird for each guest Fall to gentlemen said Washington gazing hungrily at his bird When canvas back ducks are on the table conversation is not required of any one It is fortunate for us that we have so considerate a host said Confucius unfastening his robe and preparing to do justice to the fare set before him I have dined often but never before with one who was willing to let me eat a bird like this in silence Washington here s to you May your life be chequered with birthdays and may ours be equally well supplied with feasts like this at your expense The toast was drained and the diners fell to as requested They re great aren t they whispered Bonaparte to Munchausen Well rather returned the Baron I don t see why the mortals don t erect a statue to the canvas back Did anybody at this board ever have as much canvas back duck as he could eat asked Doctor Johnson Yes said the Baron I did Once Oh you sneered Ptolemy You ve had everything Except the mumps retorted Munchausen But honestly I did once have as much canvas back duck as I could eat It must have cost you a million said Bonaparte But even then they d be cheap especially to a man like yourself who could perform miracles If I could have performed miracles with the ease which was so characteristic of all your efforts I d never have died at saint Helena What s the odds where you died said Doctor Johnson If it hadn t been at saint Helena it would have been somewhere else and you d have found death as stuffy in one place as in another Don t let s talk of death said Washington I am sure the Baron s tale of how he came to have enough canvas back is more diverting I ve no doubt it is more perverting said Johnson It happened this way said Munchausen I was out for sport and I got it I was alone my servant having fallen ill which was unfortunate since I had always left the filling of my cartridge box to him and underestimated its capacity I started at six in the morning and not having hunted for several months was not in very good form so no game appearing for a time I took a few practice shots trying to snip off the slender tops of the pine trees that I encountered with my bullets succeeding tolerably well for one who was a little rusty bringing down ninety nine out of the first one hundred and one and missing the remaining two by such a close margin that they swayed to and fro as though fanned by a slight breeze As I fired my one hundred and first shot what should I see before me but a flock of these delicate birds floating upon the placid waters of the bay Was this the Bay of Biscay Baron queried Columbus with a covert smile at Ptolemy I counted them said the Baron ignoring the question and there were just sixty eight Here s a chance for the record Baron said I to myself and then I made ready to shoot them Imagine my dismay gentlemen when I discovered that while I had plenty of powder left I had used up all my bullets Now as you may imagine to a man with no bullets at hand the sight of sixty eight fat canvas backs is hardly encouraging but I was resolved to have every one of those birds the question was how shall I do it I never can think on water so I paddled quietly ashore and began to reflect As I lay there deep in thought I saw lying upon the beach before me a superb oyster and as reflection makes me hungry I seized upon the bivalve and swallowed him As he went down something stuck in my throat and extricating it what should it prove to be but a pearl of surpassing beauty My first thought was to be content with my day s find A pearl worth thousands surely was enough to satisfy the most ardent lover of sport but on looking up I saw those ducks still paddling contentedly about and I could not bring myself to give them up Suddenly the idea came the pearl is as large as a bullet and fully as round Why not use it Then as thoughts come to me in shoals I next reflected Ah but this is only one bullet as against sixty eight birds immediately a third thought came why not shoot them all with a single bullet It is possible though not probable I snatched out a pad of paper and a pencil made a rapid calculation based on the doctrine of chances and proved to my own satisfaction that at some time or another within the following two weeks those birds would doubtless be sitting in a straight line and paddling about Indian file for an instant I resolved to await that instant I loaded my gun with the pearl and a sufficient quantity of powder to send the charge through every one of the ducks if perchance the first duck were properly hit To pass over wearisome details let me say that it happened just as I expected I had one week and six days to wait but finally the critical moment came It was at midnight but fortunately the moon was at the full and I could see as plainly as though it had been day The moment the ducks were in line I aimed and fired They every one squawked turned over and died My pearl had pierced the whole sixty eight Boswell blushed Ahem said Doctor Johnson It was a pity to lose the pearl That said Munchausen was the most interesting part of the story I had made a second calculation in order to save the pearl I deduced the amount of powder necessary to send the gem through sixty seven and a half birds and my deduction was strictly accurate It fulfilled its mission of death on sixty seven and was found buried in the heart of the sixty eighth a trifle discolored but still a pearl and worth a king s ransom Napoleon gave a derisive laugh and the other guests sat with incredulity depicted upon every line of their faces Do you believe that story yourself Baron asked Confucius Why not asked the Baron Is there anything improbable in it Why should you disbelieve it Look at our friend Washington here Is there any one here who knows more about truth than he does He doesn t disbelieve it He s the only man at this table who treats me like a man of honor He s host and has to said Johnson shrugging his shoulders Well Washington let me put the direct question to you said the Baron Say you aren t host and are under no obligation to be courteous Do you believe I haven t been telling the truth My dear Munchausen said the General don t ask me I m not an authority I can t tell a lie not even when I hear one If you say your story is true I must believe it of course but ah really if I were you I wouldn t tell it again unless I could produce the pearl and the wish bone of one of the ducks at least Whereupon as the discussion was beginning to grow acrimonious Washington hailed Charon and ordering a boat invited his guests to accompany him over into the world of realities where they passed the balance of the evening haunting a vaudeville performance at one of the London music halls CHAPTER IV HAMLET MAKES A SUGGESTION It was a beautiful night on the Styx and the silvery surface of that picturesque stream was dotted with gondolas canoes and other craft to an extent that made Charon feel like a highly prosperous savings bank Within the house boat were gathered a merry party some of whom were on mere pleasure bent others of whom had come to listen to a debate for which the entertainment committee had provided between the venerable patriarch Noah and the late eminent showman P T Barnum The question to be debated was upon the resolution passed by the committee that The Animals of the Antediluvian Period were Far More Attractive for Show Purposes than those of Modern Make and singular to relate the affirmative was placed in the hands of mister Barnum while to Noah had fallen the task of upholding the virtues of the modern freak It is with the party on mere pleasure bent that we have to do upon this occasion The proceedings of the debating party are as yet in the hands of the official stenographer but will be made public as soon as they are ready The pleasure seeking group were gathered in the smoking room of the club which was indeed a smoking room of a novel sort the invention of an unknown shade who had sold all the rights to the club through a third party anonymously preferring it seemed to remain in the Elysian world as he had been in the mundane sphere a mute inglorious Edison It was a simple enough scheme and for a wonder no one in the world of substantialities has thought to take it up The smoke was stored in reservoirs just as if it were so much gas or water and was supplied on the hot air furnace principle from a huge furnace in the hold of the house boat into which tobacco was shovelled by the hired man of the club night and day The smoke from the furnace carried through flues to the smoking room was there received and stored in the reservoirs with each of which was connected one dozen rubber tubes having at their ends amber mouth pieces Upon each of these mouth pieces was arranged a small meter registering the amount of smoke consumed through it and for this the consumer paid so much a foot The value of the plan was threefold It did away entirely with ashes it saved to the consumers the value of the unconsumed tobacco that is represented by the unsmoked cigar ends and it averted the possibility of cigarettes Enjoying the benefits of this arrangement upon the evening in question were Shakespeare Cicero Henry VIII Doctor Johnson and others Of course Boswell was present too for a moment with his note book and this fact evoked some criticism from several of the smokers You ought to be up stairs in the lecture room Boswell said Shakespeare as the great biographer took his seat behind his friend the Doctor Doesn t the Gossip want a report of the debate It does said Boswell but the Gossip endeavors always to get the most interesting items of the day and Doctor Johnson has informed me that he expects to be unusually witty this evening so I have come here Excuse me for saying it Boswell said the Doctor getting red in the face over this unexpected confession but really you talk too much That s good said Cicero Stick that down Boz and print it It s the best thing Johnson has said this week Boswell smiled weakly and said But Doctor you did say that you know I can prove it too for you told me some of the things you were going to say Don t you remember you were going to lead Shakespeare up to making the remark that he thought the English language was the greatest language in creation whereupon you were going to ask him why he didn t learn it Get out of here you idiot roared the Doctor You re enough to give a man apoplexy You re not going back on the ladder by which you have climbed are you Samuel queried Boswell earnestly The wha a t cried the Doctor angrily The ladder on which I climbed You Great heavens That it should come to this Leave the room instantly Ladder By all that is beautiful the ladder upon which I Samuel Johnson the tallest person in letters have climbed Go Do you hear Boswell rose meekly and with tears coursing down his cheeks left the room That s one on you Doctor said Cicero wrapping his toga about him I think you ought to order up three baskets of champagne on that I ll order up three baskets full of Boswell s remains if he ever dares speak like that again retorted the Doctor shaking with anger He my ladder why it s ridiculous Yes said Shakespeare dryly That s why we laugh You were a little hard on him Doctor said Henry VIII He was a valuable man to you He had a great eye for your greatness Yes If there s any feature of Boswell that s greater than his nose and ears it s his great I said the Doctor You d rather have him change his I to a U I presume said Napoleon quietly The Doctor waved his hand impatiently Let s drop him he said Dropping one s biographer isn t without precedent As soon as any man ever got to know Napoleon well enough to write him up he sent him to the front where he could get a little lead in his system I wish I had had a Boswell all the same said Shakespeare Then the world would have known the truth about me It wouldn t if he d relied on your word for it retorted the Doctor Hullo here s Hamlet As the Doctor spoke in very truth the melancholy Dane appeared in the doorway more melancholy of aspect than ever What s the matter with you asked Cicero addressing the new comer Haven t you got that poison out of your system yet Not entirely said Hamlet with a sigh but it isn t that that s bothering me It s Fate We ll get out an injunction against Fate if you like said Blackstone Is it persecution or have you deserved it I think it s persecution said Hamlet I never wronged Fate in my life and why she should pursue me like a demon through all eternity is a thing I can t understand Maybe Ophelia is back of it suggested Doctor Johnson These women have a great deal of sympathy for each other and candidly I think you behaved pretty rudely to Ophelia It s a poor way to show your love for a young woman running a sword through her father every night for pay and driving the girl to suicide with equal frequency just to show theatre goers what a smart little Dane you can be if you try Tisn t me does all that returned Hamlet I only did it once and even then it wasn t as bad as Shakespeare made it out to be I put it down just as it was said Shakespeare hotly and you can t dispute it Yes he can said Yorick You made him tell Horatio he knew me well and he never met me in his life I never told Horatio anything of the sort said Hamlet I never entered the graveyard even and I can prove an alibi And what s more he couldn t have made the remark the way Shakespeare has it anyhow said Yorick and for a very good reason I wasn t buried in that graveyard and Hamlet and I can prove an alibi for the skull too It was a good play just the same said Cicero Very put in Doctor Johnson It cured me of insomnia Well if you don t talk in your sleep the play did a Christian service to the world retorted Shakespeare But really Hamlet I thought I did the square thing by you in that play I meant to anyhow and if it has made you unhappy I m honestly sorry Spoken like a man said Yorick I don t mind the play so much said Hamlet but the way I m represented by these fellows who play it is the thing that rubs me the wrong way Why I even hear that there s a troupe out in the western part of the United States that puts the thing on with three Hamlets two ghosts and a pair of blood hounds It s called the Uncle Tom Hamlet Combination and instead of my falling in love with one crazy Ophelia I am made to woo three dusky maniacs named Topsy on a canvas ice floe while the blood hounds bark behind the scenes What sort of treatment is that for a man of royal lineage It s pretty rough said Napoleon As the poet ought to have said Oh Hamlet Hamlet what crimes are committed in thy name I feel as badly about the play as Hamlet does said Shakespeare after a moment of silent thought I don t bother much about this wild Western business though because I think the introduction of the bloodhounds and the Topsies makes us both more popular in that region than we should be otherwise What I object to is the way we are treated by these so called first class intellectual actors in London and other great cities I ve seen Hamlet done before a highly cultivated audience and by Jove it made me blush Me too sighed Hamlet I have seen a man who had a walk on him that suggested spring halt and locomotor ataxia combined impersonating my graceful self in a manner that drove me almost crazy I ve heard my To be or not to be soliloquy uttered by a famous tragedian in tones that would make a graveyard yawn at mid day and if there was any way in which I could get even with that man I d do it It seems to me said Blackstone assuming for the moment a highly judicial manner it seems to me that Shakespeare having got you into this trouble ought to get you out of it But how said Shakespeare earnestly That s the point Heaven knows I m willing enough Hamlet s face suddenly brightened as though illuminated with an idea Then he began to dance about the room with an expression of glee that annoyed Doctor Johnson exceedingly I wish Darwin could see you now the Doctor growled A kodak picture of you would prove his arguments conclusively Rail on O philosopher retorted Hamlet Rail on I mind your railings not for I the germ of an idea have got Well go quarantine yourself said the Doctor I d hate to have one of your idea microbes get hold of me What s the scheme asked Shakespeare You can write a play for me cried Hamlet Make it a farce tragedy Take the modern player for your hero and let me play him I ll bait him through four acts I ll imitate his walk I ll cultivate his voice We ll have the first act a tank act and drop the hero into the tank The second act can be in a saw mill and we can cut his hair off on a buzz saw The third act can introduce a spile driver with which to drive his hat over his eyes and knock his brains down into his lungs The fourth act can be at Niagara Falls and we ll send him over the falls and for a grand climax we can have him guillotined just after he has swallowed a quart of prussic acid and a spoonful of powdered glass Do that for me William and you are forgiven I ll play it for six hundred nights in London for two years in New York and round up with a one night stand in Boston It sounds like a good scheme said Shakespeare meditatively What shall we call it Call it Irving said Eugene Aram who had entered I too have suffered And let me be Hamlet s understudy said Charles the First earnestly Done said Shakespeare calling for a pad and pencil And as the sun rose upon the Styx the next morning the Bard of Avon was to be seen writing a comic chorus to be sung over the moribund tragedian by the shades of Charles Aram and other eminent deceased heroes of the stage with which his new play of Irving was to be brought to an appropriate close This play has not as yet found its way upon the boards but any enterprising manager who desires to consider it may address Hamlet The House Boat Hades on the Styx He is sure to get a reply by return mail unless Mephistopheles interferes which is not unlikely since Mephistopheles is said to have been much pleased with the manner in which the eminent tragedian has put him before the British and American public CHAPTER V THE HOUSE COMMITTEE DISCUSS THE POETS 
474-141425-0000	train-other-500	There s one thing this house boat needs wrote Homer in the complaint book that adorned the centre table in the reading room and that is a Poets Corner There are smoking rooms for those who smoke billiard rooms for those who play billiards and a card room for those who play cards
474-141425-0001	train-other-500	I do not smoke I can t play billiards and I do not know a trey of diamonds from a silver salver All I can do is write poetry Why discriminate against me By all means let us have a Poets Corner where a man can be inspired in peace
474-141425-0002	train-other-500	For four days this entry lay in the book apparently unnoticed
none	none	 On the fifth day the following lines signed by Samson appeared I approve of Homer s suggestion There should be a Poets Corner here Then the rest of us could have some comfort While playing vingt et un with Diogenes in the card room on Friday evening a poetic member of this club was taken with a most violent fancy and it required the combined efforts of Diogenes and myself assisted by the janitor to remove the frenzied and objectionable member from the room The habit some of our poets have acquired of giving way to their inspirations all over the club house should be stopped and I know of no better way to accomplish this desirable end than by the adoption of Homer s suggestion Therefore I second the motion Of course the suggestion of two members so prominent as Homer and Samson could not well he ignored by the house committee 
474-141425-0003	train-other-500	and it reluctantly took the subject in hand at an early meeting I find here said Demosthenes to the chairman as the committee gathered a suggestion from Homer and Samson that this house boat be provided with a Poets Corner
474-141425-0004	train-other-500	I do not know that I approve of the suggestion myself but in order to bring it before the committee for debate I am willing to make a motion that the request be granted Excuse me put in Doctor Johnson
none	none	 but where do you find that suggestion 
474-141425-0005	train-other-500	Here is not very definite Where is here In the complaint book which I hold in my hand returned Demosthenes putting a pebble in his mouth so that he might enunciate more clearly A frown ruffled the serenity of Doctor Johnson s brow
none	none	 In the complaint book eh he said slowly 
474-141425-0006	train-other-500	I thought house committees were not expected to pay any attention to complaints in complaint books I never heard of its being done before Well I can t say that I have either replied Demosthenes chewing thoughtfully on the pebble
474-141425-0007	train-other-500	but I suppose complaint books are the places for complaints You don t expect people to write serial stories or dialect poems in them do you That isn t the point as the man said to the assassin who tried to stab him with the hilt of his dagger
474-141425-0008	train-other-500	retorted Doctor Johnson with some asperity Of course complaint books are for the reception of complaints nobody disputes that
none	none	 What I want to have determined is whether it is necessary or proper for the complaints to go further 
474-141425-0009	train-other-500	I fancy we have a legal right to take the matter up said Blackstone wearily though I don t know of any precedent for such action
474-141425-0010	train-other-500	In all the clubs I have known the house committees have invariably taken the ground that the complaint book was established to guard them against the annoyance of hearing complaints This one however has been forced upon us by our secretary
474-141425-0011	train-other-500	and in view of the age of the complainants I think we cannot well decline to give them a specific answer Respect for age is de rigueur at all times like clean hands I ll second the motion
474-141425-0012	train-other-500	I think the Poets Corner entirely unnecessary said Confucius This isn t a class organization and we should resist any effort to make it or any portion of it so
none	none	 In fact I will go further and state that it is my opinion that if we do any legislating in the matter at all 
474-141425-0013	train-other-500	we ought to discourage rather than encourage these poets They are always littering the club up with themselves Only last Wednesday I came here with a guest no less a person than a recently deceased Emperor of China
474-141425-0014	train-other-500	and what was the first sight that greeted our eyes I give it up said Doctor Johnson It must have been a catacornered sight whatever it was if the Emperor s eyes slanted like yours
474-141425-0015	train-other-500	No personalities please Doctor said Sir Walter Raleigh the chairman rapping the table vigorously with the shade of a handsome gavel that had once adorned the Roman Senate chamber
474-141425-0016	train-other-500	He s only a Chinaman muttered Johnson What was the sight that greeted your eyes Confucius asked Cassius Omar Khayyam stretched over five of the most comfortable chairs in the library returned Confucius
474-141425-0017	train-other-500	and when I ventured to remonstrate with him he lost his temper and said I d spoiled the whole second volume of the Rubaiyat I told him he ought to do his rubaiyatting at home and he made a scene to avoid which I hastened with my guest over to the billiard room
474-141425-0018	train-other-500	and there stretched at full length on the pool table was Robert Burns trying to write a sonnet on the cloth with chalk in less time than Villon could turn out another with two lines start on the billiard table with the same writing materials
474-141425-0019	train-other-500	Now I ask you gentlemen if these things are to be tolerated Are they not rather to be reprehended whether I am a Chinaman or not What would you have us do then asked Sir Walter Raleigh a little nettled
none	none	 Exclude poets altogether I was one remember 
474-141425-0020	train-other-500	Oh but not much of one Sir Walter put in Doctor Johnson deprecatingly No said Confucius I don t want them excluded but they should be controlled You don t let a shoemaker who has become a member of this club
474-141425-0021	train-other-500	turn the library sofas into benches and go pegging away at boot making so why should you let the poets turn the place into a verse factory That s what I d like to know I don t know but what your point is well taken said Blackstone
474-141425-0022	train-other-500	though I can t say I think your parallels are very parallel A shoemaker my dear Confucius is somewhat different from a poet Certainly said Doctor Johnson Very different in fact different enough to make a conundrum of the question
474-141425-0023	train-other-500	what is the difference between a shoemaker and a poet One makes the shoes and the other shakes the muse all the difference in the world Still I don t see how we can exclude the poets It is the very democracy of this club that gives it life We take in everybody
none	none	 peer poet or what not 
474-141425-0024	train-other-500	To say that this man shall not enter because he is this or that or the other thing would result in our ultimately becoming a class organization which as Confucius himself says we are not and must not be
474-141425-0025	train-other-500	If we put out the poet to please the sage we ll soon have to put out the sage to please the fool and so on We ll keep it up once the precedent is established
none	none	 until finally it will become a class club entirely 
474-141425-0026	train-other-500	a Plumbers Club for instance and how absurd that would be in Hades No gentlemen it can t be done The poets must and shall be preserved What s the objection to class clubs anyhow asked Cassius I don t object to them
474-141425-0027	train-other-500	If we could have had political organizations in my day I might not have had to fall on my sword to get out of keeping an engagement I had no fancy for Class clubs have their uses No doubt said Demosthenes
474-141425-0028	train-other-500	Have all the class clubs you want but do not make one of this An Authors Club where none but authors are admitted is a good thing
none	none	 The members learn there that there are other authors than themselves 
474-141425-0029	train-other-500	Poets Clubs are a good thing
none	none	 they bring poets into contact with each other and they learn what a bore it is to have to listen to a poet reading his own poem 
474-141425-0030	train-other-500	Pugilists Clubs are good so are all other class clubs but so also are clubs like our own which takes in all who are worthy
none	none	 Here a poet can talk poetry as much as he wants but at the same time he hears something besides poetry 
474-141425-0031	train-other-500	We must stick to our original idea Then let us do something to abate the nuisance of which I complain said Confucius Can t we adopt a house rule
474-141425-0032	train-other-500	that poets must not be inspired between the hours of eleven A M and five P M or in the evening after eight that any poet discovered using more than five arm chairs in the composition of a quatrain will be charged two oboli an hour for each chair in excess of that number
474-141425-0033	train-other-500	and that the billiard marker shall be required to charge a premium of three times the ordinary fee for tables used by versifiers in lieu of writing pads That wouldn t be a bad idea said Sir Walter Raleigh
474-141425-0034	train-other-500	I as a poet would not object to that I do all my work at home anyhow There s another phase of this business that we haven t considered yet and it s rather important said Demosthenes
none	none	 taking a fresh pebble out of his bonbonniere 
474-141425-0035	train-other-500	That s in the matter of stationery This club like all other well regulated clubs provides its members with a suitable supply of writing materials
474-141425-0036	train-other-500	Charon informs me that the waste baskets last week turned out forty two reams of our best correspondence paper on which these poets had scribbled the first draft of their verses
474-141425-0037	train-other-500	Now I don t think the club should furnish the poets with the raw material for their poems any more than to go back to Confucius s shoemaker
none	none	 it should supply leather for our cobblers 
474-141425-0038	train-other-500	What do you mean by raw material for poems asked Sir Walter with a frown Pen ink and paper What else said Demosthenes Doesn t it take brains to write a poem said Raleigh
474-141425-0039	train-other-500	Doesn t it take brains to make a pair of shoes retorted Demosthenes swallowing a pebble in his haste They ve got a right to the stationery though put in Blackstone A clear legal right to it
none	none	 If they choose to write poems on the paper instead of boring people to death with letters as most of us do 
474-141425-0040	train-other-500	that s their own affair Well they re very wasteful said Demosthenes We can meet that easily enough observed Cassius Furnish each writing table with a slate I should think they d be pleased with that It s so much easier to rub out the wrong word
474-141425-0041	train-other-500	Most poets prefer to rub out the right word growled Confucius Besides I shall never consent to slates in this house boat The squeaking of the pencils would be worse than the poems themselves That s true
474-141425-0042	train-other-500	said Cassius I never thought of that If a dozen poets got to work on those slates at once a fife corps wouldn t be a circumstance to them Well it all goes to prove what I have thought all along said Doctor Johnson Homer s idea is a good one
474-141425-0043	train-other-500	and Samson was wise in backing it up The poets need to be concentrated somewhere where they will not be a nuisance to other people and where other people will not be a nuisance to them Homer ought to have a place to compose in where the vingt et un players will not interrupt his frenzies
474-141425-0044	train-other-500	and on the other hand the vingt et un and other players should be protected from the wooers of the muse I ll vote to have the Poets Corner and in it I move that Cassius s slate idea be carried out It will be a great saving
474-141425-0045	train-other-500	and if the corner we select be far enough away from the other corners of the club the squeaking of the slate pencils need bother no one I agree to that said Blackstone Only I think it should be understood that in granting the petition of the poets
474-141425-0046	train-other-500	we do not bind ourselves to yield to doctors and lawyers and shoemakers and plumbers in case they should each want a corner to themselves A very wise idea said Sir Walter Whereupon the resolution was suitably worded and passed unanimously
none	none	 Just where the Poets Corner is to be located the members of the committee have not as yet decided although Confucius is strongly in favor of having it placed in a dingy situated a quarter of a mile astern of the house boat and connected therewith by a slight cord which can be easily cut in case the squeaking of the poets slate pencils becomes too much for the nervous system of the members who have no corner of their own CHAPTER VI SOME THEORIES DARWINIAN AND OTHERWISE I observe said Doctor Darwin looking up from a perusal of an asbestos copy of the London Times I observe that an American professor has discovered that monkeys talk I consider that a very interesting fact It undoubtedly is observed Doctor Livingstone though hardly new I never said anything about it over in the other world but I discovered years ago in Africa that monkeys were quite as well able to hold a sustained conversation with each other as most men are And I too put in Baron Munchausen have frequently conversed with monkeys I made myself a master of their idioms during my brief sojourn in ah in well never mind where I never could remember the names of places The interesting point is that at one period of my life I was a master of the monkey language I have even gone so far as to write a sonnet in Simian which was quite as intelligible to the uneducated as nine tenths of the sonnets written in English or American Do you mean to say that you could acquire the monkey accent asked Doctor Darwin immediately interested In most instances returned the Baron suavely though of course not in all I found the same difficulty in some cases that the German or the Chinaman finds when he tries to speak French A Chinaman can no more say Trocadero for instance as the Frenchman says it than he can fly That peculiar throaty aspirate the Frenchman gives to the first syllable as though it were spelled trhoque is utterly beyond the Chinese and beyond the American too whose idea of the tonsillar aspirate leads him to speak of the trochedeero naturally falling back upon troches to help him out of his laryngeal difficulties You ought to have been on the staff of Punch Baron said Thackeray quietly That joke would have made you immortal I am immortal said the Baron But to return to our discussion of the Simian tongue as I was saying there were some little points about the accent that I could never get and as in the case of the German and Chinaman with the French language the trouble was purely physical When you consider that in polite Simian society most of the talkers converse while swinging by their tails from the limb of a tree with a sort of droning accent which results from their swaying to and fro you will see at once why it was that I deprived by nature of the necessary apparatus with which to suspend myself in mid air was unable to quite catch the quality which gives its chief charm to monkey talk I should hardly think that a man of your fertile resources would have let so small a thing as that stand in his way said Doctor Livingstone When a man is able to make a reputation for himself like yours in which material facts are never allowed to interfere with his doing what he sets out to do he ought not to be daunted by the need of a tail If you could make a cherry tree grow out of a deer s head I fail to see why you could not personally grow a tail or anything else you might happen to need for the attainment of your ends I was not so anxious to get the accent as all that returned the Baron I don t think it is necessary for a man to make a monkey of himself just for the pleasure of mastering a language Reasoning similarly a man to master the art of braying in a fashion comprehensible to the jackass of average intellect should make a jackass of himself cultivate his ears and learn to kick so as properly to punctuate his sentences after the manner of most conversational beasts of that kind Then you believe that jackasses talk too do you asked Doctor Darwin Why not said the Baron If monkeys why not donkeys Certainly they do All creatures have some means of communicating their thoughts to each other Why man in his conceit should think otherwise I don t know unless it be that the birds and beasts in their conceit probably think that they alone of all the creatures in the world can talk I haven t a doubt said Doctor Livingstone that monkeys listening to men and women talking think they are only jabbering They re not far from wrong in most cases if they do said Doctor Johnson who up to this time had been merely an interested listener I ve thought that many a time myself Which is perhaps in a slight degree a confirmation of my theory put in Darwin If Doctor Johnson s mind runs in the same channels that the monkey s mind runs in why may we not say that Doctor Johnson being a man has certain qualities of the monkey and is therefore in a sense of the same strain You may say what you please retorted Johnson wrathfully but I ll make you prove what you say about me I wouldn t if I were you said Doctor Livingstone in a peace making spirit It would not be a pleasant task for you compelling our friend to prove you descended from the ape I should think you d prefer to make him leave it unproved Have monkeys Boswells queried Thackeray I don t know anything about em said Johnson petulantly No more do I said Darwin and I didn t mean to be offensive my dear Johnson If I claim Simian ancestry for you I claim it equally for myself Well I m no snob said Johnson unmollified If you want to brag about your ancestors do it Leave mine alone Stick to your own genealogical orchard Well I believe fully that we are all descended from the ape said Munchausen There isn t any doubt in my mind that before the flood all men had tails Noah had a tail Shem Ham and Japheth had tails It s perfectly reasonable to believe it The Ark in a sense proved it It would have been almost impossible for Noah and his sons to construct the Ark in the time they did with the assistance of only two hands apiece Think however of how fast they could work with the assistance of that third arm Noah could hammer a clapboard on to the Ark with two hands while grasping a saw and cutting a new board or planing it off with his tail So with the others We all know how much a third hand would help us at times But how do you account for its disappearance put in Doctor Livingstone Is it likely they would dispense with such a useful adjunct No it isn t but there are various ways of accounting for its loss said Munchausen They may have overworked it building the Ark Shem Ham or Japheth may have had his caught in the door of the Ark and cut off in the hurry of the departure plenty of things may have happened to eliminate it Men lose their hair and their teeth why might not a man lose a tail Scientists say that coming generations far in the future will be toothless and bald Why may it not be that through causes unknown to us we are similarly deprived of something our forefathers had The only reason for man s losing his hair is that he wears a hat all the time said Livingstone The Derby hat is the enemy of hair It is hot and dries up the scalp You might as well try to raise watermelons in the Desert of Sahara as to try to raise hair under the modern hat In fact the modern hat is a furnace Well it s a mighty good furnace observed Munchausen You don t have to put coal on the modern hat Perhaps interposed Thackeray the ancients wore their hats on their tails Well I have a totally different theory said Johnson You always did have observed Munchausen Very likely said Johnson To be commonplace never was my ambition What is your theory queried Livingstone Well I don t know said Johnson if it be worth expressing It may be worth sending by freight interrupted Thackeray Let us have it Well I believe said Johnson I believe that Adam was a monkey He behaved like one ejaculated Thackeray I believe that the forbidden tree was a tender one and therefore the only one upon which Adam was forbidden to swing by his tail said Johnson Clear enough so far said Munchausen But that the possession of tails by Adam and Eve entailed a love of swinging thereby and that they could not resist the temptation to swing from every limb in Eden and that therefore while Adam was off swinging on other trees Eve took a swing on the forbidden tree that Adam returning caught her in the act and immediately gave way himself and swung said Johnson Then you eliminate the serpent queried Darwin Not a bit of it Johnson answered The serpent was the tail Look at most snakes to day What are they but unattached tails They do look it said Darwin thoughtfully Why it s clear as day said Johnson As punishment Adam and Eve lost their tails and the tail itself was compelled to work for a living and do its own walking I never thought of that said Darwin It seems reasonable It is reasonable said Johnson And the snakes of the present day queried Thackeray I believe to be the missing tails of men said Johnson Somewhere in the world is a tail for every man and woman and child Where one s tail is no one can ever say but that it exists simultaneously with its owner I believe The abhorrence man has for snakes is directly attributable to his abhorrence for all things which have deprived him of something that is good If Adam s tail had not tempted him to swing on the forbidden tree we should all of us have been able through life to relax from business cares after the manner of the monkey who is happy from morning until night Well I can t see that it does us any good to sit here and discuss this matter said Doctor Livingstone We can t reach any conclusion The only way to settle the matter it seems to me is to go directly to Adam who is a member of this club and ask him how it was That s a great idea said Thackeray scornfully You d look well going up to a man and saying Excuse me sir but ah were you ever a monkey To say nothing of catechising a man on the subject of an old and dreadful scandal put in Munchausen I m surprised at you Livingstone African etiquette seems to have ruined your sense of propriety I d just as lief ask him said Doctor Johnson Etiquette Bah What business has etiquette to stand in the way of human knowledge Conventionality is the last thing men of brains should strive after and I for one am not going to be bound by it Here Doctor Johnson touched the electric bell and in an instant the shade of a buttons appeared Boy is Adam in the club house to day asked the sage I ll go and see sir said the boy and he immediately departed Good boy that said Thackeray Yes but the service in this club is dreadful considering what we might have said Darwin With Aladdin a member of this club I don t see why we can t have his lamp with genii galore to respond It certainly would be more economical True but I for one don t care to fool with genii said Munchausen When one member can summon a servant who is strong enough to take another member and do him up in a bottle and cast him into the sea I have no use for the system Plain ordinary mortal shades are good enough for me As Munchausen spoke the boy returned mister Adam isn t here to day sir he said addressing Doctor Johnson And Charon says he s not likely to be here sir seeing as how his account is closed not having been settled for three months Good said Thackeray I was afraid he was here I don t want to have him asked about his Eden experiences in my behalf That s personality Well then there s only one other thing to do said Darwin Munchausen claims to be able to speak Simian He might seek out some of the prehistoric monkeys and put the question to them No thank you said Munchausen I m a little rusty in the language and besides you talk like an idiot You might as well speak of the human language as the Simian language There are French monkeys who speak monkey French African monkeys who talk the most barbarous kind of Zulu monkey patois and Congo monkey slang and so on Let Johnson send his little Boswell out to drum up information If there is anything to be found out he ll get it and then he can tell it to us Of course he may get it all wrong but it will be entertaining and we ll never know any difference Which seemed to the others a good idea but whatever came of it I have not been informed CHAPTER VII A DISCUSSION AS TO LADIES DAY I met Queen Elizabeth just now on the Row said Raleigh as he entered the house boat and checked his cloak Indeed said Confucius What if you did Other people have met Queen Elizabeth There s nothing original about that True but she made a suggestion to me about this house boat which I think is a good one She says the women are all crazy to see the inside of it said Raleigh Thus proving that immortal woman is no different from mortal woman retorted Confucius They want to see the inside of everything Curiosity thy name is woman Well I am sure I don t see why men should arrogate to themselves the sole right to an investigating turn of mind said Raleigh impatiently Why shouldn t the ladies want to see the inside of this club house It is a compliment to us that they should and I for one am in favor of letting them and I am going to propose that in the Ides of March we give a ladies day here Then I shall go South for my health in the Ides of March said Confucius angrily What on earth is a club for if it isn t to enable men to get away from their wives once in a while When do people go to clubs When they are on their way home that s when and the more a man s at home in his club the less he s at home when he s at home I suppose you ll be suggesting a children s day next and after that a parrot s or a canary bird s day I had no idea you were such a woman hater said Raleigh in astonishment What s the matter Were you ever disappointed in love I How absurd retorted Confucius reddening The idea of my ever being disappointed in love I never met the woman who could bring me to my knees although I was married in the other world What became of missus C I never inquired She may be in China yet for aught I know I regard death as a divorce Your wife must be glad of it said Raleigh somewhat ungallantly for to tell the truth he was nettled by Confucius s demeanor I didn t know however but that since you escaped from China and came here to Hades you might have fallen in love with some spirit of an age subsequent to your own Mary Queen of Scots or Joan of Arc or some other spook who rejected you I can t account for your dislike of women otherwise Not I said Confucius Hades would have a less classic name than it has for me if I were hampered with a family But go along and have your ladies day here and never mind my reasons for preferring my own society to that of the fair sex I can at least stay at home that day What do you propose to do throw open the house to the wives of members or to all ladies irrespective of their husbands membership here I think the latter plan would be the better said Raleigh Otherwise Queen Elizabeth to whom I am indebted for the suggestion would be excluded She never married you know Didn t she said Confucius No I didn t know it but that doesn t prove anything When I went to school we didn t study the history of the Elizabethan period She didn t have absolute sway over England then She had but what of that queried Raleigh Do you mean to say that she lived and died an old maid from choice demanded Confucius Certainly I do said Raleigh And why should I not tell you that For a very good and sufficient reason retorted Confucius which is in brief that I am not a marine I may dislike women my dear Raleigh but I know them better than you do gallant as you are and when you tell me in one and the same moment that a woman holding absolute sway over men yet lived and died an old maid you must not be indignant if I smile and bite the end of my thumb which is the Chinese way of saying that s all in your eye Betty Martin Believe it or not you poor old back number retorted Raleigh hotly It alters nothing Queen Elizabeth could have married a hundred times over if she had wished I know I lost my head there completely That shows Sir Walter said Dryden with a grin how wrong you are You lost your head to King James Hi Shakespeare here s a man doesn t know who chopped his head off Raleigh s face flushed scarlet Tis better to have had a head and lost it he cried than never to have had a head at all Mark you Dryden my boy it ill befits you to scoff at me for my misfortune for dust thou art and to dust thou hast returned if word from t other side about thy books and that which in and on them lies be true Whate er be said about my books said Dryden angrily be they read or be they not tis mine they are and none there be who dare dispute their authorship Thus proving that men thank Heaven are still sane ejaculated Doctor Johnson To assume the authorship of Dryden would be not so much a claim my friend as a confession Shades of the mighty Chow cried Confucius An will ye hear the poets squabble Egad A ladies day could hardly introduce into our midst a more diverting disputation We re all getting a little high flown in our phraseology put in Shakespeare at this point Let s quit talking in blank verse and come down to business I think a ladies day would be great sport I ll write a poem to read on the occasion Then I oppose it with all my heart said Doctor Johnson Why do you always want to make our entertainments commonplace Leave occasional poems to mortals I never knew an occasional poem yet that was worthy of an immortal That s precisely why I want to write one occasional poem I d make it worthy Shakespeare answered Like this for instance Most fair most sweet most beauteous of ladies The greatest charm in all ye realm of Hades Why my dear Doctor such an opportunity for rhyming Hades with ladies should not be lost That just proves what I said said Johnson Any idiot can make ladies rhyme with Hades It requires absolute genius to avoid the temptation You are great enough to make Hades rhyme with bicycle if you choose to do it but no you succumb to the temptation to be commonplace Bah One of these modern drawing room poets with three sections to his name couldn t do worse On general principles said Raleigh Johnson is right We invite these people here to see our club house not to give them an exhibition of our metrical powers and I think all exercises of a formal nature should be frowned upon Very well said Shakespeare Go ahead Have your own way about it Get out your brow and frown I m perfectly willing to save myself the trouble of writing a poem Writing real poetry isn t easy as you fellows would have discovered for yourselves if you d ever tried it To pass over the arrogant assumption of the gentleman who has just spoken with the silence due to a proper expression of our contempt therefor said Dryden slowly I think in case we do have a ladies day here we should exercise a most careful supervision over the invitation list For instance wouldn t it be awkward for our good friend Henry the Eighth to encounter the various missus Henrys here Would it not likewise be awkward for them to meet each other Your point is well taken said Doctor Johnson I don t know whether the King s matrimonial ventures are on speaking terms with each other or not but under any circumstances it would hardly be a pleasing spectacle for Katharine of Arragon to see Henry running his legs off getting cream and cakes for Anne Boleyn nor would Anne like it much if on the other hand Henry chose to behave like a gentleman and a husband to Jane Seymour or Katharine Parr I think if the members themselves are to send out the invitations they should each be limited to two cards with the express understanding that no member shall be permitted to invite more than one wife That s going to be awkward said Raleigh scratching his head thoughtfully Henry is such a hot headed fellow that he might resent the stipulation I think he would said Confucius I think he d be as mad as a hatter at your insinuation that he would invite any of his wives if all I hear of him is true and what I ve heard Wolsey has told me He knew a thing or two about Henry said Shakespeare If you don t believe it just read that play of mine that Beaumont and Fletcher er ah thought so much of You came near giving your secret away that time William said Johnson with a sly smile and giving the Avonian a dig between the ribs Secret I haven t any secret said Shakespeare a little acridly It s the truth I m telling you Beaumont and Fletcher did admire Henry the Eighth Thereby showing their conceit eh said Johnson Oh of course I didn t write anything did I cried Shakespeare Everybody wrote my plays but me I m the only person that had no hand in Shakespeare It seems to me that joke is about worn out Doctor I m getting a little tired of it myself but if it amuses you why keep it up I know who wrote my plays and whatever you may say cannot affect the facts Next thing you fellows will be saying that I didn t write my own autographs I didn t say that said Johnson quietly Only there is no internal evidence in your autographs that you knew how to spell your name if you did A man who signs his name Shixpur one day and Shikespeare the next needn t complain if the Bank of Posterity refuses to honor his check They d honor my check quick enough these days retorted Shakespeare When a man s autograph brings five thousand dollars or one thousand pounds in the auction room there isn t a bank in the world fool enough to decline to honor any check he ll sign under a thousand dollars or two hundred pounds I fancy you re right put in Raleigh But your checks or your plays have nothing to do with ladies day Let s get to some conclusion in this matter Yes said Confucius Let s Ladies day is becoming a dreadful bore and if we don t hurry up the billiard room will be full Well I move we get up a petition to the council to have it said Dryden I agree said Confucius and I ll sign it If there s one way to avoid having ladies day in the future it s to have one now and be done with it All right said Shakespeare I ll sign too As er Shixpur or Shikespeare queried Johnson Let him alone said Raleigh He s getting sensitive about that and what you need to learn more than anything else is that it isn t manners to twit a man on facts What s bothering you Dryden You look like a man with an idea It has just occurred to me said Dryden that while we can safely leave the question of Henry the Eighth and his wives to the wisdom of the council we ought to pay some attention to the advisability of inviting Lucretia Borgia I d hate to eat any supper if she came within a mile of the banqueting hall If she comes you ll have to appoint a tasting committee before I ll touch a drop of punch or eat a speck of salad We might recommend the appointment of Raleigh to look after the fair Lucretia and see that she has no poison with her or if she has to keep her from dropping it into the salads said Confucius with a sidelong glance at Raleigh He s the especial champion of woman in this club and no doubt would be proud of the distinction I would with most women said Raleigh But I draw the line at Lucretia Borgia And so a petition was drawn up signed and sent to the council and they after mature deliberation decided to have the ladies day to which all the ladies in Hades excepting Lucretia Borgia and Delilah were to be duly invited only the date was not specified Delilah was excluded at the request of Samson whose convincing muscles rather than his arguments completely won over all opposition to his proposition CHAPTER VIII A DISCONTENTED SHADE It seems to me said Shakespeare wearily one afternoon at the club that this business of being immortal is pretty dull 
2448-141428-0001	train-other-500	Didn t somebody once say he d rather ride fifty years on a trolley in Europe than on a bicycle in Cathay
none	none	 I never heard any such remark by any self respecting person 
2448-141428-0002	train-other-500	said Johnson I said something like it observed Tennyson Doctor Johnson looked around to see who it was that spoke You he cried And who pray may you be
2448-141428-0003	train-other-500	My name is Tennyson replied the poet
none	none	 And a very good name it is said Shakespeare I am not aware that I ever heard the name before 
2448-141428-0004	train-other-500	said Doctor Johnson Did you make it yourself I did said the late laureate proudly In what pursuit asked Doctor Johnson Poetry said Tennyson
2448-141428-0005	train-other-500	I wrote Locksley Hall and Come into the Garden Maude Humph said Doctor Johnson I never read em
none	none	 Well why should you have read them snarled Carlyle 
2448-141428-0006	train-other-500	They were written after you moved over here and they were good stuff
none	none	 You needn t think because you quit the whole world put up its shutters and went out of business 
2448-141428-0007	train-other-500	I did a few things myself which I fancy you never heard of Oh as for that retorted Doctor Johnson with a smile I ve heard of you
2448-141428-0008	train-other-500	you are the man who wrote the life of Frederick the Great in nine hundred and two volumes Seven snapped Carlyle Well seven then returned Johnson
2448-141428-0009	train-other-500	I never saw the work but I heard Frederick speaking of it the other day Bonaparte asked him if he had read it and Frederick said no he hadn t time Bonaparte cried Haven t time Why my dear king you ve got all eternity
2448-141428-0010	train-other-500	I know it replied Frederick but that isn t enough Read a page or two my dear Napoleon and you ll see why Frederick will have his joke said Shakespeare
2448-141428-0011	train-other-500	with a wink at Tennyson and a smile for the two philosophers intended no doubt to put them in a more agreeable frame of mind Why he even asked me the other day why I never wrote a tragedy about him
none	none	 completely ignoring the fact that he came along many years after I had departed 
2448-141428-0012	train-other-500	I spoke of that and he said Oh I was only joking I apologized I didn t know that said I And why should you said he You re English
2448-141428-0013	train-other-500	A very rude remark said Johnson As if we English were incapable of seeing a joke Exactly put in Carlyle It strikes me as the absurdest notion that the Englishman can t see a joke
2448-141428-0014	train-other-500	To the mind that is accustomed to snap judgments I have no doubt the Englishman appears to be dull of apprehension but the philosophy of the whole matter is apparent to the mind that takes the trouble to investigate
2448-141428-0015	train-other-500	The Briton weighs everything carefully before he commits himself and even though a certain point may strike him as funny he isn t going to laugh until he has fully made up his mind that it is funny
none	none	 I remember once riding down Piccadilly with Froude in a hansom cab Froude had a copy of Punch in his hand 
2448-141428-0016	train-other-500	and he began to laugh immoderately over something
none	none	 I leaned over his shoulder to see what he was laughing at 
2448-141428-0017	train-other-500	That isn t so funny said I as I read the paragraph on which his eye was resting No said Froude I wasn t laughing at that
none	none	 I was enjoying the joke that appeared in the same relative position in last week s issue Now that s the point 
2448-141428-0018	train-other-500	the whole point The Englishman always laughs over last week s Punch not this week s and that is why you will find a file of that interesting journal in the home of all well to do Britons It is the back number that amuses him
2448-141428-0019	train-other-500	which merely proves that he is a deliberative person who weighs even his humor carefully before giving way to his emotions What is the average weight of a copy of Punch
2448-141428-0020	train-other-500	drawled Artemas Ward who had strolled in during the latter part of the conversation Shakespeare snickered quietly but Carlyle and Johnson looked upon the intruder severely We will take that question into consideration
2448-141428-0021	train-other-500	said Carlyle Perhaps to morrow we shall have a definite answer ready for you Never mind returned the humorist You ve proved your point Tennyson tells me you find life here dull Shakespeare Somewhat
2448-141428-0022	train-other-500	said Shakespeare I don t know about the rest of you fellows but I was not cut out for an eternity of ease I must have occupation and the stage isn t popular here The trouble about putting on a play here
2448-141428-0023	train-other-500	is that our managers are afraid of libel suits The chances are that if I should write a play with Cassius as the hero Cassius would go to the first night s performance with a dagger concealed in his toga
2448-141428-0024	train-other-500	with which to punctuate his objections to the lines put in his mouth There is nothing I d like better than to manage a theatre in this place but think of the riots we d have Suppose for an instant that I wrote a play about Bonaparte
none	none	 He d have a box and when the rest of you spooks called for the author at the end of the third act 
2448-141428-0025	train-other-500	if he didn t happen to like the play he d greet me with a salvo of artillery instead of applause
none	none	 He wouldn t if you made him out a great conqueror from start to finish 
2448-141428-0026	train-other-500	said Tennyson No doubt returned Shakespeare sadly but in that event Wellington would be in the other stage box and I d get the greeting from him
none	none	 Why come out at all 
2448-141428-0027	train-other-500	asked Johnson Why come out at all echoed Shakespeare What fun is there in writing a play if you can t come out and show yourself at the first night That s the author s reward If it wasn t for the first night business though
2448-141428-0028	train-other-500	all would be plain sailing
none	none	 Then why don t you begin it the second night drawled Ward 
2448-141428-0029	train-other-500	How the deuce could you put in Carlyle A most extraordinary proposition sneered Johnson Yes said Ward but wait a week you ll see the point then
2448-141428-0030	train-other-500	There isn t any doubt in my mind said Shakespeare reverting to his original proposition
none	none	 that the only perfectly satisfactory life is under a system not yet adopted in either world 
2448-141428-0031	train-other-500	the one we have quitted or this There we had hard work in which our mortal limitations hampered us grievously here we have the freedom of the immortal with no hard work in other words
2448-141428-0032	train-other-500	now that we feel like fighting cocks there isn t any fighting to be done The great life in my estimation would be to return to earth and battle with mortal problems but equipped mentally
2448-141428-0033	train-other-500	and physically with immortal weapons Some people don t know when they are well off said Beau Brummel This strikes me as being an ideal life There are no tailors bills to pay we are ourselves nothing but memories
2448-141428-0034	train-other-500	and a memory can clothe himself in the shadow of his former grandeur
none	none	 I clothe myself in the remembrance of my departed clothes 
2448-141428-0035	train-other-500	and as my memory is good I flatter myself I m the best dressed man here The fact that there are ghosts of departed unpaid bills haunting my bedside at night doesn t bother me in the least
2448-141428-0036	train-other-500	because the bailiffs that in the old life lent terror to an overdue account
none	none	 thanks to our beneficent system here 
2448-141428-0037	train-other-500	are kept in the less agreeable sections of Hades
none	none	 I used to regret that bailiffs were such low people 
2448-141428-0038	train-other-500	but now I rejoice at it If they had been of a different order they might have proven unpleasant here You are right my dear Brummel interposed Munchausen
2448-141428-0039	train-other-500	This life is far preferable to that in the other sphere Any of you gentlemen who happen to have had the pleasure of reading my memoirs must have been struck with the tremendous difficulties that encumbered my progress
2448-141428-0040	train-other-500	If I wished for a rare liqueur for my luncheon a liqueur served only at the table of an Oriental potentate
none	none	 more jealous of it than of his 
2448-141428-0041	train-other-500	one thousand queens
none	none	 I had to raise armies charter ships and wage warfare in which feats of incredible valor 
2448-141428-0042	train-other-500	had to be performed by myself alone and unaided to secure the desired thimbleful I have destroyed empires for a bon bon at great expense of nervous energy That s very likely true said Carlyle
2448-141428-0043	train-other-500	I should think your feats of strength would have wrecked your imagination in time Not so said Munchausen On the contrary continuous exercise served only to make it stronger But
2448-141428-0044	train-other-500	as I was going to say in this life we have none of these fearful obstacles it is a life of leisure and if I want a bird and a cold bottle at any time instead of placing my life in peril and jeopardizing the peace of all mankind to get it
none	none	 I have only to summon before me the memory of some previous bird and cold bottle 
2448-141428-0045	train-other-500	dine thereon like a well ordered citizen and smoke the spirit of the best cigar my imagination can conjure up You miss my point said Shakespeare
2448-141428-0046	train-other-500	I don t say this life is worse or better than the other we used to live What I do say is that a combination of both would suit me In short I d like to live here and go to the other world every day to business
none	none	 like a suburban resident who sleeps in the country and makes his living in the city For instance why shouldn t I dwell here and go to London every day 
2448-141428-0047	train-other-500	hire an office there and put out a sign something like this WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE DRAMATIST Plays written while you wait I guess I d find plenty to do Guess again said Tennyson
2448-141428-0048	train-other-500	My dear boy you forget one thing You are out of date People don t go to the theatres to hear you they go to see the people who do you That is true said Ward
2448-141428-0049	train-other-500	And they do do you my beloved William It s a wonder to me you are not dizzy turning over in your grave the way they do you Can it be that I can ever be out of date asked Shakespeare
2448-141428-0050	train-other-500	I know of course that I have to be adapted at times but to be wholly out of date strikes me as a hard fate You re not out of date interposed Carlyle the date is out of you
2448-141428-0051	train-other-500	There is a great demand for Shakespeare in these days but there isn t any stuff Then I should succeed said Shakespeare No I don t think so returned Carlyle You couldn t stand the pace
2448-141428-0052	train-other-500	The world revolves faster to day than it did in your time men write three or four plays at once This is what you might call a Type writer Age
none	none	 and to keep up with the procession you d have to work as you never worked before 
2448-141428-0053	train-other-500	That is true observed Tennyson
none	none	 You d have to learn to be ambidextrous so that you could keep two type writing machines going at once 
2448-141428-0054	train-other-500	and to be perfectly frank with you I cannot even conjure up in my fancy a picture of you knocking out a tragedy with the right hand on one machine
none	none	 while your left hand is fashioning a farce comedy on another 
2448-141428-0055	train-other-500	He might do as a great many modern writers do said Ward
none	none	 go in for the Paper doll Drama 
2448-141428-0056	train-other-500	Cut the whole thing out with a pair of scissors As the poet might have said if he d been clever enough Oh bring me the scissors And bring me the glue And a couple of dozen old plays
2448-141428-0057	train-other-500	I ll cut out and paste A drama for you That ll run for quite sixty two days Oh bring me a dress Made of satin and lace And a book say Joe Miller s of wit
2448-141428-0058	train-other-500	And I ll make the old dramatists Blue in the face With the play that I ll turn out for it So bring me the scissors And bring me the paste And a dozen fine old comedies
2448-141428-0059	train-other-500	A fine line of dresses And popular taste I ll make a strong effort to please You draw a very blue picture it seems to me said Shakespeare sadly Well it s true
2448-141428-0060	train-other-500	said Carlyle The world isn t at all what it used to be in any one respect and you fellows who made great reputations centuries ago
none	none	 wouldn t have even the ghost of a show now I don t believe Homer could get a poem accepted by a modern magazine and while the comic papers are still printing Diogenes jokes 
2448-141428-0061	train-other-500	the old gentleman couldn t make enough out of them in these days to pay taxes on his tub let alone earning his bread That is exactly so said Tennyson I d be willing to wager too that in the line of personal prowess
2448-141428-0062	train-other-500	even D Artagnan and Athos and Porthos and Aramis couldn t stand London for one day Or New York either said mister Barnum who had been an interested listener A New York policeman could have managed that quartet with one hand
2448-141428-0063	train-other-500	Then said Shakespeare in the opinion of you gentlemen we old time lions would appear to modern eyes to be more or less stuffed That s about the size of it said Carlyle
2448-141428-0064	train-other-500	But you d draw said Barnum his face lighting up with pleasure You d drive a five legged calf to suicide from envy If I could take you and Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte and Nero
2448-141428-0065	train-other-500	over for one circus season we d drive the mint out of business There s your chance William said Ward You write a play for Bonaparte and Caesar and let Nero take his fiddle and be the orchestra

everything in general and the shade of a very excellent luncheon in particular We are in great luck to day said Burns as he cut a ruddy duck in twain This bird is done just right I agree with you returned Homer drawing his chair a trifle closer to the table Compared to the one we had here last Thursday this is a feast for the gods I wonder who it was that cooked this fowl originally I give it up but I suspect it was done by some man who knew his business said Burns with a smack of his lips It s a pity I think my dear Homer that there is no means by which a cook may become immortal Cooking is as much of an art as is the writing of poetry and just as there are immortal poets so there should be immortal cooks See what an advantage the poet has he writes something it goes out and reaches the inmost soul of the man who reads it and it is signed His work is known because he puts his name to it but this poor devil of a cook where is he He has done his work as well as the poet ever did his it has reached the inmost soul of the mortal who originally ate it but he cannot get the glory of it because he cannot put his name to it If the cook could sign his work it would be different You have hit upon a great truth said Homer nodding as he sometimes was wont to do And yet I fear that ingenious as we are we cannot devise a plan to remedy the matter I do not know about you but I should myself much object if my birds and my flapjacks and other things digestible and otherwise that I eat here were served with the cook s name written upon them An omelette is sometimes a picture I ve seen omelettes that looked like one of Turner s sunsets acquiesced Burns Precisely and when Turner puts down in one corner of his canvas Turner fecit you do not object but if the cook did that with the omelette you wouldn t like it No said Burns but he might fasten a tag to it with his name written upon that That is so said Homer but the result in the end would be the same The tags would get lost or perhaps a careless waiter dropping a tray full of dainties would get the tags of a good and bad cook mixed in trying to restore the contents of the tray to their previous condition The tag system would fail There is but one other way that I can think of said Burns and that would do no good now unless we can convey our ideas into the other world that is for a great poet to lend his genius to the great cook and make the latter s name immortal by putting it into a poem Say for instance that you had eaten a fine bit of terrapin done to the most exquisite point you could have asked the cook s name and written an apostrophe to her Something like this for instance Oh Dinah Rudd oh Dinah Rudd Thou art a cook of bluest blood Nowhere within This world of sin Have I e er tasted better terrapin Do you see I do but even then my dear fellow the cook would fall short of true fame Her excellence would be a mere matter of hearsay evidence said Homer Not if you went on to describe in a keenly analytical manner the virtues of that particular bit of terrapin said Burns Draw so vivid a picture of the dish that the reader himself would taste that terrapin even as you tasted it You have hit it cried Homer enthusiastically It is a grand plan but how to introduce it that is the question We can haunt some modern poet and give him the idea in that way suggested Burns He will see the novelty of it and will possibly disseminate the idea as we wish it to be disseminated Done said Homer I ll begin right away I feel like haunting to night I m getting to be a pretty old ghost but I ll never lose my love of haunting At this point as Homer spoke a fine looking spirit entered the room and took a seat at the head of the long table at which the regular club dinner was nightly served Why bless me said Homer his face lighting up with pleasure Why Phidias is that you I think so said the new comer wearily at any rate it s all that s left of me Come over here and lunch with us said Homer You know Burns don t you Haven t the pleasure said Phidias The poet and the sculptor were introduced after which Phidias seated himself at Homer s side Are you any relation to Burns the poet the former asked addressing the Scotchman I am Burns the poet replied the other You don t look much like your statues said Phidias scanning his face critically No thank the Fates said Burns warmly If I did I d commit suicide Why don t you sue the sculptors for libel asked Phidias You speak with a great deal of feeling Phidias said Homer gravely Have they done anything to hurt you They have said Phidias I have just returned from a tour of the world I have seen the things they call sculpture in these degenerate days and I must confess who shouldn t perhaps that I could have done better work with a baseball bat for a chisel and putty for the raw material I think I could do good work with a baseball bat too said Burns but as for the raw material give me the heads of the men who have sculped me to work on I d leave them so that they d look like some of your Parthenon frieze figures with the noses gone You are a vindictive creature said Homer These men you criticise and whose heads you wish to sculp with a baseball bat have done more for you than you ever did for them Every statue of you these men have made is a standing advertisement of your books and it hasn t cost you a penny There isn t a doubt in my mind that if it were not for those statues countless people would go to their graves supposing that the great Scottish Burns were little rivulets and not a poet What difference does it make to you if they haven t made an Adonis of you You never set them an example by making one of yourself If there s deception anywhere it isn t you that is deceived it is the mortals And who cares about them or their opinions I never thought of it in that way said Burns I hate caricatures that is caricatures of myself I enjoy caricatures of other people but You have a great deal of the mortal left in you considering that you pose as an immortal said Homer interrupting the speaker Well so have I said Phidias resolved to stand by Burns in the argument and I m sorry for the man who hasn t I was a mortal once and I m glad of it I had a good time and I don t care who knows it When I look about me and see Jupiter the arch snob of creation and Mars a little tin warrior who couldn t have fought a soldier like Napoleon with all his alleged divinity I thank the Fates that they enabled me to achieve immortality through mortal effort Hang hereditary greatness I say These men were born immortals You and I worked for it and got it We know what it cost It was ours because we earned it and not because we were born to it Eh Burns The Scotchman nodded assent and the Greek sculptor went on I am not vindictive myself Homer he said Nobody has hurt me and on the whole I don t think sculpture is in such a bad way after all There s a shoemaker I wot of in the mortal realms who can turn the prettiest last you ever saw and I encountered a carver in a London eating house last month who turned out a slice of beef that was cut as artistically as I could have done it myself What I object to chiefly is the tendency of the times This is an electrical age and men in my old profession aren t content to turn out one chef d oeuvre in a lifetime They take orders by the gross I waited upon inspiration To day the sculptor waits upon custom and an artist will make a bust of anybody in any material desired as long as he is sure of getting his pay afterwards I saw a life size statue of the inventor of a new kind of lard the other day and what do you suppose the material was Gold Not by a great deal Ivory Marble even Not a bit of it He was done in lard sir I have seen a woman s head done in butter too and it makes me distinctly weary to think that my art should be brought so low You did your best work in Greece chuckled Homer A bad joke my dear Homer retorted Phidias I thought sculpture was getting down to a pretty low ebb when I had to fashion friezes out of marble but marble is more precious than rubies alongside of butter and lard Each has its uses said Homer I d rather have butter on my bread than marble but I must confess that for sculpture it is very poor stuff as you say It is indeed said Phidias For practice it s all right to use butter but for exhibition purposes bah Here Phidias to show his contempt for butter as raw material in sculpture seized a wooden toothpick and with it modelled a beautiful head of Minerva out of the pat that stood upon the small plate at his side and before Burns could interfere had spread the chaste figure as thinly as he could upon a piece of bread which he tossed to the shade of a hungry dog that stood yelping on the river bank Heavens cried Burns Imperious Caesar dead and turned to bricks is as nothing to a Minerva carved by Phidias used to stay the hunger of a ravening cur Well it s the way I feel said Phidias savagely I think you are a trifle foolish to be so eternally vexed about it said Homer soothingly Of course you feel badly but after all what s the use You must know that the mortals would pay more for one of your statues than they would for a specimen of any modern sculptor s art yes even if yours were modelled in wine jelly and the other fellow s in pure gold So why repine You d feel the same way if poets did a similarly vulgar thing retorted Phidias you know you would If you should hear of a poet to day writing a poem on a thin layer of lard or butter you would yourself be the first to call a halt No I shouldn t said Homer quietly in fact I wish the poets would do that We d have fewer bad poems to read and that s the way you should look at it I venture to say that if this modern plan of making busts and friezes in butter had been adopted at an earlier period the public places in our great cities and our national Walhallas would seem less like repositories of comic art since the first critical rays of a warm sun would have reduced the carven atrocities therein to a spot on the pavement The butter school of sculpture has its advantages my boy and you should be crowning the inventor of the system with laurel and not heaping coals of fire upon his brow That said Burns is after all the solid truth Phidias Take the brass caricatures of me for instance Where would they be now if they had been cast in lard instead of in bronze Phidias was silent a moment Well he said finally as the value of the plan dawned upon his mind from that point of view I don t know but what you are right after all and to show that I have spoken in no vindictive spirit let me propose a toast Here s to the Butter Sculptors May their butter never give out The toast was drained to the dregs and Phidias went home feeling a little better CHAPTER X STORY TELLERS NIGHT It was Story tellers Night at the house boat and the best talkers of Hades were impressed into the service Doctor Johnson was made chairman of the evening Put him in the chair said Raleigh That s the only way to keep him from telling a story himself If he starts in on a tale he ll make it a serial sure as fate but if you make him the medium through which other story tellers are introduced to the club he ll be finely epigrammatic He can be very short and sharp when he s talking about somebody else Personality is his forte Great scheme said Diogenes who was chairman of the entertainment committee The nights over here are long but if Johnson started on a story they d have to reach twice around eternity and halfway back to give him time to finish all he had to say He s not very witty in my judgment said Carlyle who since his arrival in the other world has manifested some jealousy of Solomon and Doctor Johnson That s true enough said Raleigh but he s strong and he s bound to say something that will put the audience in sympathy with the man that he introduces and that s half the success of a Story tellers Night I ve told stories myself If your audience doesn t sympathize with you you d be better off at home putting the baby to bed And so it happened Doctor Johnson was made chairman and the evening came The Doctor was in great form A list of the story tellers had been sent him in advance and he was prepared The audience was about as select a one as can be found in Hades The doors were thrown open to the friends of the members and the smoke furnace had been filled with a very superior quality of Arcadian mixture which Scott had brought back from a haunting trip to the home of The Little Minister at Thrums Friends and fellow spooks the Doctor began when all were seated on the visionary camp stools which by the way are far superior to those in use in a world of realities because they do not creak in the midst of a fine point demanding absolute silence for appreciation I do not know why I have been chosen to preside over this gathering of phantoms it is the province of the presiding officer on occasions of this sort to say pleasant things which he does not necessarily endorse about the sundry persons who are to do the story telling Now I suppose you all know me pretty well by this time If there is anybody who doesn t I ll be glad to have him presented after the formal work of the evening is over and if I don t like him I ll tell him so You know that if I can be counted upon for any one thing it is candor and if I hurt the feelings of any of these individuals whom I introduce to night I want them distinctly to understand that it is not because I love them less but that I love truth more With this ah blanket apology as it were to cover all possible emergencies that may arise during the evening I will begin The first speaker on the programme I regret to observe is my friend Goldsmith Affairs of this kind ought to begin with a snap and while Oliver is a most excellent writer as a speaker he is a pebbleless Demosthenes If I had had the arrangement of the programme I should have had Goldsmith tell his story while the rest of us were down stairs at supper However we must abide by our programme which is unconscionably long for otherwise we will never get through it Those of you who agree with me as to the pleasure of listening to my friend Goldsmith will do well to join me in the grill room while he is speaking where I understand there is a very fine line of punches ready to be served Modest Noll will you kindly inflict yourself upon the gathering and send me word when you get through if you ever do so that I may return and present number two to the assembly whoever or whatever he may be With these words the Doctor retired and poor Goldsmith pale with fear rose up to speak It was evident that he was quite as doubtful of his ability as a talker as was Johnson I m not much of a talker or as some say speaker he said Talking is not my forte as Doctor Johnson has told you and I am therefore not much at it Speaking is not in my line I cannot speak or talk as it were because I am not particularly ready at the making of a speech due partly to the fact that I am not much of a talker anyhow and seldom if ever speak I will therefore not bore you by attempting to speak since a speech by one who like myself is as you are possibly aware not a fluent nor indeed in any sense an eloquent speaker is apt to be a bore to those who will be kind enough to listen to my remarks but will read instead the first five chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield Who suggested any such night as this anyhow growled Carlyle Five chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield for a starter Lord save us we ll need a Vicar of Sleepfield if he s allowed to do this I move we adjourn said Darwin Can t something be done to keep these younger members quiet asked Solomon frowning upon Carlyle and Darwin Yes said Douglas Jerrold Let Goldsmith go on He ll have them asleep in ten minutes Meanwhile Goldsmith was plodding earnestly through his stint utterly and happily oblivious of the effect he was having upon his audience This is awful whispered Wellington to Bonaparte Worse than Waterloo replied the ex Emperor with a grin but we can stop it in a minute Artemas Ward told me once how a camp meeting he attended in the West broke up to go outside and see a dog fight Can t you and I pretend to quarrel A personal assault by you on me will wake these people up and discombobulate Goldsmith Say the word only don t hit too hard I m with you said Wellington Whereupon with a great show of heat he roared out You Never I m more afraid of a boy with a bean snapper that I ever was of you and followed up his remark by pulling Bonaparte s camp chair from under him and letting the conqueror of Austerlitz fall to the floor with a thud which I have since heard described as dull and sickening The effect was instantaneous Compared to a personal encounter between the two great figures of Waterloo a reading from his own works by Goldsmith seemed lacking in the elements essential to the holding of an audience Consequently attention was centred in the belligerent warriors and by some odd mistake when a peace loving member of the assemblage realizing the indecorousness of the incident cried out Put him out put him out the attendants rushed in and taking poor Goldsmith by his collar hustled him out through the door across the deck and tossed him ashore without reference to the gang plank This accomplished a personal explanation of their course was made by the quarrelling generals and peace having been restored a committee was sent in search of Goldsmith with suitable apologies The good and kindly soul returned but having lost his book in the melee much to his own gratification as well as to that of the audience he was permitted to rest in quiet the balance of the evening Is he through said Johnson poking his head in at the door when order was restored Yes sir said Boswell that is to say he has retired permanently from the field He didn t finish though Fellow spooks began Johnson once more now that you have been delighted with the honeyed eloquence of the last speaker it is my privilege to present to you that eminent fabulist Baron Munchausen the greatest unrealist of all time who will give you an exhibition of his paradoxical power of lying while standing The applause which greeted the Baron was deafening He was beyond all doubt one of the most popular members of the club Speaking of whales said he leaning gracefully against the table Nobody has mentioned em said Johnson True retorted the Baron but you always suggest them by your apparently unquenchable thirst for spouting speaking of whales my friend Jonah as well as the rest of you may be interested to know that I once had an experience similar to his own and strange to say with the identical whale Jonah arose from his seat in the back of the room I do not wish to be unpleasant he said with a strong effort to be calm but I wish to ask if Judge Blackstone is in the room I am said the Judge rising What can I do for you I desire to apply for an injunction restraining the Baron from using my whale in his story That whale your honor is copyrighted said Jonah If I had any other claim to the affection of mankind than the one which is based on my experience with that leviathan I would willingly permit the Baron to introduce him into his story but that whale your honor is my stock in trade he is my all I think Jonah s point is well taken said Blackstone turning to the Baron It would be a distinct hardship I think if the plaintiff in this action were to be deprived of the exclusive use of his sole accessory The injunction prayed for is therefore granted The court would suggest however that the Baron continue with his story using another whale for the purpose It is impossible said Munchausen gloomily The whole point of the story depends upon its having been Jonah s whale Under the circumstances the only thing I can do is to sit down I regret the narrowness of mind exhibited by my friend Jonah but I must respect the decision of the court I must take exception to the Baron s allusion to my narrowness of mind said Jonah with some show of heat I am simply defending my rights and I intend to continue to do so if the whole world unites in considering my mind a mere slot scarcely wide enough for the insertion of a nickel That whale was my discovery and the personal discomfort I endured in perfecting my experience was such that I resolved to rest my reputation upon his broad proportions only to sink or swim with him and I cannot at this late day permit another to crowd me out of his exclusive use Jonah sat down and fanned himself and the Baron with a look of disgust on his face left the room Up to his old tricks he growled as he went He queers everything he goes into If I d known he was a member of this club I d never have joined We do not appear to be progressing very rapidly said Doctor Johnson rising So far we have made two efforts to have stories told and have met with disaster each time I don t know but what you are to be congratulated however on your escape Very few of you I observe have as yet fallen asleep The next number on the programme I see is Boswell who was to have entertained you with a few reminiscences I say was to have done so because he is not to do so I m ready said Boswell rising No doubt retorted Johnson severely but I am not You are a man with one subject myself I admit it s a good subject but you are not the man to treat of it here You may suffice for mortals but here it is different I can speak for myself You can go out and sit on the banks of the Vitriol Reservoir and lecture to the imps if you want to but when it comes to reminiscences of me I m on deck myself and I flatter myself I remember what I said and did more accurately than you do Therefore gentlemen instead of listening to Boswell at this point you will kindly excuse him and listen to me Ahem When I was a boy Excuse me said Solomon rising about how long is this ah this entertaining discourse of yours to continue Until I get through returned Johnson wrathfully Are you aware sir that I am on the programme asked Solomon I am said the Doctor With that in mind for the sake of our fellow spooks who are present I am very much inclined to keep on forever When I was a boy Carlyle rose up at this point I should like to ask he said mildly if this is supposed to be an audience of children I for one have no wish to listen to the juvenile stories of Doctor Johnson Furthermore I have come here particularly to night to hear Boswell I want to compare him with Froude I therefore protest against There is a roof to this house boat said Doctor Johnson If mister Carlyle will retire to the roof with Boswell I have no doubt he can be accommodated As for Solomon s interruption I can afford to pass that over with the silent contempt it deserves though I may add with propriety that I consider his most famous proverbs the most absurd bits of hack work I ever encountered and as for that story about dividing a baby between two mothers by splitting it in two it was grossly inhuman unless the baby was twins When I was a boy As the Doctor proceeded Carlyle and Solomon accompanied by the now angry Boswell left the room and my account of the Story tellers Night must perforce stop because though I have never heretofore confessed it all my information concerning the house boat on the Styx has been derived from the memoranda of Boswell It may be interesting to the reader to learn however that according to Boswell s account the Story tellers Night was never finished but whether this means that it broke up immediately afterwards in a riot or that Doctor Johnson is still at work detailing his reminiscences I am not aware and I cannot at the moment of writing ascertain for Boswell when I have the pleasure of meeting him invariably avoids the subject CHAPTER XI AS TO SAURIANS AND OTHERS It was Noah who spoke I m glad he said that when I embarked at the time of the heavy rains that did so much damage in the old days there weren t any dogs like that fellow Cerberus about If I d had to feed a lot of three headed beasts like him the Ark would have run short of provisions inside of ten days That s very likely true observed mister Barnum but I must confess my dear Noah that you showed a lamentable lack of the showman s instinct when you selected the animals you did A more commonplace lot of beasts were never gathered together and while Adam is held responsible for the introduction of sin into the world I attribute most of my offences to none other than yourself The members of the club drew their chairs a little closer The conversation had opened a trifle spicily and furthermore they had retained enough of their mortality to be interested in animal stories Adam who had managed to settle his back dues and delinquent house charges and once more acquired the privileges of the club nodded his head gratefully at mister Barnum I m glad to find some one said he who places the responsibility for trouble where it belongs I m round shouldered with the blame I ve had to bear I didn t invent sin any more than I invented the telephone and I think it s rather rough on a fellow who lived a quiet retiring pastoral life minding his own business and staying home nights to be held up to public reprobation for as long a time as I have It ll be all right in time said Raleigh just wait be patient and your vindication will come Nobody thought much of the plays Bacon and I wrote for Shakespeare until Shakespeare d been dead a century Humph said Adam gloomily Wait What have I been doing all this time I ve waited all the time there s been so far and until mister Barnum spoke as he did I haven t observed the slightest inclination on the part of anybody to rehabilitate my lost reputation Nor do I see exactly how it s to come about even if I do wait You might apply for an investigating committee to look into the charges suggested an American politician just over Get your friends on it and you ll be all right Better let sleeping dogs lie said Blackstone I intend to said Adam The fact is I hate to give any further publicity to the matter Even if I did bring the case into court and sue for libel I ve only got one witness to prove my innocence and that s my wife I m not going to drag her into it She s got nervous prostration over her position as it is and this would make it worse Queen Elizabeth and the rest of these snobs in society won t invite her to any of their functions because they say she hadn t any grandfather and even if she were received by them she d be uncomfortable going about It isn t pleasant for a woman to feel that every one knows she s the oldest woman in the room Well take my word for it said Raleigh kindly It ll all come out all right You know the old saying History repeats itself Some day you will be living back in Eden again and if you are only careful to make an exact record of all you do and have a notary present before whom you can make an affidavit as to the facts you will be able to demonstrate your innocence I was only condemned on hearsay evidence anyhow said Adam ruefully Nonsense you were caught red handed said Noah my grandfather told me so And now that I ve got a chance to slip in a word edgewise I d like mightily to have you explain your statement mister Barnum that I am responsible for your errors That is a serious charge to bring against a man of my reputation I mean simply this that to make a show interesting said mister Barnum a man has got to provide interesting materials that s all I do not mean to say a word that is in any way derogatory to your morality You were a surprisingly good man for a sea captain and with the exception of that one occasion when you ah you allowed yourself to be stranded on the bar if I may so put it I know of nothing to be said against you as a moral temperate person That was only an accident said Noah reddening You can t expect a man six hundred odd years of age Certainly not said Raleigh soothingly and nobody thinks less of you for it Considering how you must have hated the sight of water the wonder of it is that it didn t become a fixed habit Let us hear what it is that mister Barnum does criticise in you His taste that s all said mister Barnum I contend that compared to the animals he might have had the ones he did have were as ant hills to Alps There were more magnificent zoos allowed to die out through Noah s lack of judgment than one likes to think of Take the Proterosaurus for instance Where on earth do we find his equal to day You ought to be mighty glad you can t find one like him put in Adam If you d spent a week in the Garden of Eden with me with lizards eight feet long dropping out of the trees on to your lap while you were trying to take a Sunday afternoon nap you d be willing to dispense with things of that sort for the balance of your natural life If you want to get an idea of that experience let somebody drop a calf on you some afternoon I am not saying anything about that returned Barnum It would be unpleasant to have an elephant drop on one after the fashion of which you speak but I am glad the elephant was saved just the same I haven t advocated the Proterosaurus as a Sunday afternoon surprise but as an attraction for a show I still maintain that a lizard as big as a cow would prove a lodestone the drawing powers of which the pocket money of the small boy would be utterly unable to resist Then there was the Iguanadon He d have brought a fortune to the box office Which you d have immediately lost retorted Noah paying rent When you get a reptile of his size that reaches thirty feet up into the air when he stands on his hind legs the ordinary circus wagon of commerce can t be made to hold him and your menagerie room has to have ceilings so high that every penny he brought to the box office would be spent storing him Mischievous too said Adam that Iguanadon You couldn t keep anything out of his reach We used to forbid animals of his kind to enter the garden but that didn t bother him he d stand up on his hind legs and reach over and steal anything he d happen to want I could have used him for a fire escape said mister Barnum and as for my inability to provide him with quarters I d have met that problem after a short while I ve always lamented the absence too of the Megalosaurus Which simply shows how ignorant you are retorted Noah Why my dear fellow it would have taken the whole of an ordinary zoo such as yours to give the Megalosaurus a lunch Those fellows would eat a rhinoceros as easily as you d crack a peanut I did have a couple of Megalosaurians on my boat for just twenty four hours and then I chucked them both overboard If I d kept them ten days longer they d have eaten every blessed beast I had with me and your Zoo wouldn t have had anything else but Megalosaurians Papa is right about that mister Barnum said Shem The whole Saurian tribe was a fearful nuisance About four hundred years before the flood I had a pet Creosaurus that I kept in our barn He was a cunning little devil full of tricks and all that but we never could keep a cow or a horse on the place while he was about They d mysteriously disappear and we never knew what became of em until one morning we surprised Fido in Surprised who asked Doctor Johnson scornfully Fido returned Shem That was my Creosaurus s name Lord save us Fido cried Johnson What a name for a Creosaurus Well what of it asked Shem angrily You wouldn t have us call a mastodon like that Fanny would you or Tatters Go on said Johnson I ve nothing to say Shall I send for a physician put in Boswell looking anxiously at his chief the situation was so extraordinary Solomon and Carlyle giggled and the Doctor having politely requested Boswell to go to a warmer section of the country Shem resumed I caught him in the act of swallowing five cows and Ham s favorite trotter sulky and all Baron Munchausen rose up and left the room If they re going to lie I m going to get out he said as he passed through the room What became of Fido asked Boswell The sulky killed him returned Shem innocently He couldn t digest the wheels Noah looked approvingly at his son and turning to Barnum observed quietly What he says is true and I will go further and say that it is my belief that you would have found the show business impossible if I had taken that sort of creature aboard You d have got mightily discouraged after your Antediluvians had chewed up a few dozen steam calliopes and eaten every other able bodied exhibit you had managed to secure I d have tried to save a couple of Discosaurians if I hadn t supposed they were able to take care of themselves A combination of sea serpent and dragon with a neck twenty two feet long it seemed to me ought to have been able to ride out any storm or fall of rain but there I was wrong and I am free to admit my error It never occurred to me that the sea serpents were in any danger so I let them alone with the result that I never saw but one other and he was only an illusion due to that unhappy use of stimulants to which with shocking bad taste you have chosen to refer I didn t mean to call up unpleasant memories said Barnum I never believed you got half seas over anyhow but to return to our muttons why didn t you hand down a few varieties of the Therium family to posterity There were the Dinotherium and the Megatherium either one of which would have knocked spots out of any leopard that ever was made and along side of which even my woolly horse would have paled into insignificance That s what I can t understand in your selections with Megatheriums to burn why save leopards and panthers and other such every day creatures What kind of a boat do you suppose I had cried Noah Do you imagine for a moment that she was four miles on the water line with a mile and three quarters beam If I d had a pair of Dinotheriums in the stern of that Ark she d have tipped up fore and aft until she d have looked like a telegraph pole in the water and if I d put em amidships they d have had to be wedged in so tightly they couldn t move to keep the vessel trim I didn t go to sea my friend for the purpose of being tipped over in mid ocean every time one of my cargo wanted to shift his weight from one leg to the other It was bad enough with the elephants wasn t it papa said Shem Yes indeed my son returned the patriarch It was bad enough with the elephants We had to shift our ballast half a dozen times a day to keep the boat from travelling on her beam ends the elephants moved about so much and when we came to the question of provender it took up about nine tenths of our hold to store hay and peanuts enough to keep them alive and good tempered On the whole I think it s rather late in the day considering the trouble I took to save anything but myself and my family to be criticised as I now am You ought to be much obliged to me for saving any animals at all Most people in my position would have built a yacht for themselves and family and let everything else slide That is quite true observed Raleigh with a pacificatory nod at Noah You were eminently unselfish and while with mister Barnum I exceedingly regret that the Saurians and Therii and other tribes were left on the pier when you sailed I nevertheless think that you showed most excellent judgment at the time He was the only man who had any at all for that matter suggested Shem and it required all his courage to show it Everybody was guying him Sinners stood around the yard all day and every day criticising the model one scoffer pretended he thought her a canal boat and asked how deep the flood was likely to be on the tow path and whether we intended to use mules in shallow water and giraffes in deep another asked what time allowance we expected to get in a fifteen mile run and hinted that a year and two months per mile struck him as being the proper thing It was far from pleasant said Noah tapping his fingers together reflectively I don t want to go through it again and if as Raleigh suggests history is likely to repeat herself I ll sublet the contract to Barnum here and let him get the chaff It was all right in the end though dad said Shem We had the great laugh on hoi polloi the second day out We did indeed said Noah When we told em we only carried first class passengers and had no room for emigrants they began to see that the Ark wasn t such an old tub after all and a good ninety per cent of them would have given ten dollars for a little of that time allowance they d been talking to us about for several centuries Noah lapsed into a musing silence and Barnum rose to leave I still wish you d saved a Discosaurus he said A creature with a neck twenty two feet long would have been a gold mine to me He could have been trained to stand in the ring and by stretching out his neck bite the little boys who sneak in under the tent and occupy seats on the top row Well for your sake said Noah with a smile I m very sorry but for my own I m quite satisfied with the general results And they all agreed that the patriarch had every reason to be pleased with himself CHAPTER XII THE HOUSE BOAT DISAPPEARS Queen Elizabeth attended by Ophelia and Xanthippe was walking along the river bank It was a beautiful autumn day although owing to certain climatic peculiarities of Hades it seemed more like midsummer The mercury in the club thermometer was nervously clicking against the top of the crystal tube and poor Cerberus was having all he could do with his three mouths snapping up the pestiferous little shades of by gone gnats that seemed to take an almost unholy pleasure in alighting upon his various noses and ears Ophelia was doing most of the talking I am sure I have never wished to ride one of them she said positively In the first place I do not see where the pleasure of it comes in and in the second it seems to me as if skirts must be dangerous If they should catch in one of the pedals where would I be In the hospital shortly methinks said Queen Elizabeth Well I shouldn t wear skirts snapped Xanthippe If a man s wife can t borrow some of her husband s clothing to reduce her peril to a minimum what is the use of having a husband When I take to the bicycle which in spite of all Socrates can say I fully intend to do I shall have a man s wheel and I shall wear Socrates old dress clothes If Hades doesn t like it Hades may suffer I don t see how Socrates clothes will help you observed Ophelia He wore skirts himself just like all the other old Greeks His toga would be quite as apt to catch in the gear as your skirts Xanthippe looked puzzled for a moment It was evident that she had not thought of the point which Ophelia had brought up strong minded ladies of her kind are apt sometimes to overlook important links in such chains of evidence as they feel called upon to use in binding themselves to their rights The women of your day were relieved of that dress problem at any rate laughed Queen Elizabeth The women of my day retorted Xanthippe in matters of dress were the equals of their husbands in my family particularly now they have lost their rights and are made to confine themselves still to garments like those of yore while man has arrogated to himself the sole and exclusive use of sane habiliments However that is apart from the question I was saying that I shall have a man s wheel and shall wear Socrates old dress clothes to ride it in if Socrates has to go out and buy an old dress suit for the purpose The Queen arched her brows and looked inquiringly at Xanthippe for a moment A magnificent old maid was lost to the world when you married she said Feeling as you do about men my dear Xanthippe I don t see why you ever took a husband Humph retorted Xanthippe Of course you don t You didn t need a husband You were born with something to govern I wasn t How about your temper suggested Ophelia meekly Xanthippe sniffed frigidly at this remark I never should have gone crazy over a man if I d remained unmarried forty thousand years she retorted severely I married Socrates because I loved him and admired his sculpture but when he gave up sculpture and became a thinker he simply tried me beyond all endurance he was so thoughtless with the result that having ventured once or twice to show my natural resentment I have been handed down to posterity as a shrew I ve never complained and I don t complain now but when a woman is married to a philosopher who is so taken up with his studies that when he rises in the morning he doesn t look what he is doing and goes off to his business in his wife s clothes I think she is entitled to a certain amount of sympathy And yet you wish to wear his persisted Ophelia Turn about is fair play said Xanthippe I ve suffered so much on his account that on the principle of averages he deserves to have a little drop of bitters in his nectar You are simply the victim of man s deceit said Elizabeth wishing to mollify the now angry Xanthippe who was on the verge of tears I understood men fortunately and so never married I knew my father and even if I hadn t been a wise enough child to know him I should not have wed because he married enough to last one family for several years You must have had a hard time refusing all those lovely men though sighed Ophelia Of course Sir Walter wasn t as handsome as my dear Hamlet but he was very fetching I cannot deny that said Elizabeth and I didn t really have the heart to say no when he asked me but I did tell him that if he married me I should not become missus Raleigh but that he should become King Elizabeth He fled to Virginia on the next steamer My diplomacy rid me of a very unpleasant duty Chatting thus the three famous spirits passed slowly along the path until they came to the sheltered nook in which the house boat lay at anchor There s a case in point said Xanthippe as the house boat loomed up before them All that luxury is for men we women are not permitted to cross the gangplank Our husbands and brothers and friends go there the door closes on them and they are as completely lost to us as though they never existed We don t know what goes on in there Socrates tells me that their amusements are of a most innocent nature but how do I know what he means by that Furthermore it keeps him from home while I have to stay at home and be entertained by my sons whom the Encyclopaedia Britannica rightly calls dull and fatuous In other words club life for him and dulness and fatuity for me I think myself they re rather queer about letting women into that boat said Queen Elizabeth But it isn t Sir Walter s fault He told me he tried to have them establish a Ladies Day and that they agreed to do so but have since resisted all his efforts to have a date set for the function It would be great fun to steal in there now wouldn t it giggled Ophelia There doesn t seem to be anybody about to prevent our doing so That s true said Xanthippe All the windows are closed as if there wasn t a soul there I ve half a mind to take a peep in at the house I am with you said Elizabeth her face lighting up with pleasure It was a great novelty and an unpleasant one to her to find some place where she could not go Let s do it she added So the three women tiptoed softly up the gang plank and silently boarding the house boat peeped in at the windows What they saw merely whetted their curiosity I must see more cried Elizabeth rushing around to the door which opened at her touch Xanthippe and Ophelia followed close on her heels and shortly they found themselves open mouthed in wondering admiration in the billiard room of the floating palace and Richard the ghost of the best billiard room attendant in or out of Hades stood before them Excuse me he said very much upset by the sudden apparition of the ladies I m very sorry but ladies are not admitted here We are equally sorry retorted Elizabeth assuming her most imperious manner that your masters have seen fit to prohibit our being here but now that we are here we intend to make the most of the opportunity particularly as there seem to be no members about What has become of them all Richard smiled broadly I don t know where they are he replied but it was evident that he was not telling the exact truth Oh come my boy said the Queen kindly you do know Sir Walter told me you knew everything Where are they Well if you must know ma am returned Richard captivated by the Queen s manner they ve all gone down the river to see a prize fight between Goliath and Samson See there cried Xanthippe That s what this club makes possible Socrates told me he was coming here to take luncheon with Carlyle and they ve both of em gone off to a disgusting prize fight Yes ma am they have said Richard and if Goliath wins I don t think mister Socrates will get home this evening Betting eh said Xanthippe scornfully Yes ma am returned Richard More club cried Xanthippe Oh no ma am said Richard Betting is not allowed in the club they re very strict about that But the shore is only ten feet off ma am and the gentlemen always go ashore and make their bets During this little colloquy Elizabeth and Ophelia were wandering about admiring everything they saw I do wish Lucretia Borgia and Calpurnia could see this I wonder if the Caesars are on the telephone Elizabeth said Investigation showed that both the Borgias and the Caesars were on the wire and in short order the two ladies had been made acquainted with the state of affairs at the house boat and as they were both quite as anxious to see the interior of the much talked of club house as the others they were not long in arriving Furthermore they brought with them half a dozen more ladies among whom were Desdemona and Cleopatra and then began the most extraordinary session the house boat ever knew A meeting was called with Elizabeth in the chair and all the best ladies of the Stygian realms were elected members Xanthippe amid the greatest applause moved that every male member of the organization be expelled for conduct unworthy of a gentleman in attending a prize fight and encouraging two such horrible creatures as Goliath and Samson in their nefarious pursuits Desdemona seconded the motion and it was carried without a dissenting voice although missus Caesar with becoming dignity merely smiled approval not caring to take part too actively in the proceedings The men having thus been disposed of in a summary fashion Richard was elected Janitor in Charon s place and the club was entirely reorganized with Cleopatra as permanent President The meeting then adjourned and the invaders set about enjoying their newly acquired privileges The smoking room was thronged for a few moments but owing to the extraordinary strength of the tobacco which the faithful Richard shovelled into the furnace it developed no enduring popularity Xanthippe with a suddenly acquired pallor being the first to renounce the pastime as revolting So fast and furious was the enjoyment of these thirsty souls so long deprived of their rights that night came on without their observing it and with the night was brought the great peril into which they were thrown and from which at the moment of writing they had not been extricated and which to my regret has cut me off for the present from any further information connected with the Associated Shades and their beautiful lounging place Had they not been so intent upon the inner beauties of the House boat on the Styx they might have observed approaching under the shadow of the westerly shore a long rakish craft propelled by oars which dipped softly and silently and with trained precision in the now jet black waters of the Styx Manning the oars were a dozen evil visaged ruffians while in the stern of the approaching vessel there sat a grim faced weather beaten spirit armed to the teeth his coat sleeves bearing the skull and cross bones the insignia of piracy This boat stealing up the river like a thief in the night contained Captain Kidd and his pirate crew and their mission was a mission of vengeance To put the matter briefly and plainly Captain Kidd was smarting under the indignity which the club had recently put upon him He had been unanimously blackballed even his proposer and seconder who had been browbeaten into nominating him for membership voting against him I may be a pirate he cried when he heard what the club had done but I have feelings and the Associated Shades will repent their action The time will come when they ll find that I have their club house and they have its debts It was for this purpose that the great terror of the seas had come upon this the first favorable opportunity Kidd knew that the house boat was unguarded his spies had told him that the members had every one gone to the fight and he resolved that the time had come to act He did not know that the Fates had helped to make his vengeance all the more terrible and withering by putting the most attractive and fashionable ladies of the Stygian country likewise in his power but so it was and they poor souls while this fiend relentless and cruel was slowly approaching sang on and danced on in blissful unconsciousness of their peril In less than five minutes from the time when his sinister craft rounded the bend Kidd and his crew had boarded the house boat cut her loose from her moorings and in ten minutes she had sailed away into the great unknown and with her went some of the most precious gems in the social diadem of Hades The rest of my story is soon told The whole country was aroused when the crime was discovered but up to the date of this narrative no word has been received of the missing craft and her precious cargo Raleigh and Caesar have had the seas scoured in search of her Hamlet has offered his kingdom for her return but unavailingly and the men of Hades were cast into a gloom from which there seems to be no relief Socrates alone was unaffected They ll come back some day my dear Raleigh he said as the knight buried his face weeping in his hands So why repine I ll never lose my Xanthippe permanently that is I know that for I am a philosopher and I know there is no such thing as luck And we can start another club Very likely sighed Raleigh wiping his eyes I don t mind the club so much but to think of those poor women Oh they re all right returned Socrates with a laugh Caesar s wife is along and you can t dispute the fact that she s a good chaperon Give the ladies a chance They ve been after our club for years now let em have it and let us hope that they like it Order me up a hemlock sour and let s drink to their enjoyment of club life Which was done and I in spirit drank with them for I sincerely hope that the New Women of Hades are having a good time END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HOUSE BOAT ON THE STYX This file should be named twenty six eighteen txt or twenty six
