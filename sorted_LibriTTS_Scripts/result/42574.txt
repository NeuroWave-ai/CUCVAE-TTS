8009-282531-0000	train-other-500	had some funny adventures with Baby Bunty and when he found that his rheumatism did not hurt him so much as he hopped on his red white and blue striped barber pole crutch the bunny uncle wished he might have some strange and wonderful adventures
none	none	 I think I ll just hop along and look for a few 
8009-282531-0001	train-other-500	said Uncle Wiggily to himself one morning He twinkled his pink nose and then he was all ready to start Good bye Nurse Jane Good bye he called to his muskrat lady housekeeper with whom he lived in a hollow stump bungalow
none	none	 I m going to look for some wonderful adventures 
8009-282531-0002	train-other-500	He hopped down the front steps with his red white and blue striped crutch under one paw and his tall silk hat on his head Good bye Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy Good bye answered Nurse Jane
8009-282531-0003	train-other-500	I hope you have some nice adventures Thanks I wish you the same answered Uncle Wiggily and away he went over the fields and through the woods
8009-282531-0004	train-other-500	He had not hopped very far looking this way and that before all of a sudden he came to a queer little place near an old rail fence Down in one corner was a hole partly underground
8009-282531-0005	train-other-500	Ha That s queer said Uncle Wiggily to himself
none	none	 That looks just like the kind of an underground house or burrow where I used to live I wonder if this can be where I made my home before I moved to the hollow stump bungalow I must take a look Nurse Jane would like to hear all about it 
8009-282531-0006	train-other-500	So Uncle Wiggily folding back his ears in order that they would not get bent over and broken began crawling down the rabbit hole for that is what it really was
8009-282531-0007	train-other-500	It was dark inside but the bunny uncle did not mind that being able to see in the dark Besides he could make his pink nose twinkle when he wanted to
8009-282531-0008	train-other-500	and this gave almost as much light as a firefly No this isn t the burrow where I used to live said Uncle Wiggily to himself when he had hopped quite a distance into the hole
8009-282531-0009	train-other-500	But it s very nice Perhaps I may have an adventure here Who knows
none	none	 And just as he said that to himself Uncle Wiggily saw 
8009-282531-0010	train-other-500	lying under a little table
none	none	 in what seemed to be a room of the underground house a small glass box Ha My adventure begins 
8009-282531-0011	train-other-500	cried Uncle Wiggily I ll open that glass box and see what is in it So the bunny uncle raised the cover and in the glass box was a little cake made of carrots and cabbage
8009-282531-0012	train-other-500	and on top spelled out in pink raisins were the words EAT ME
none	none	 Ha That s just what I ll do cried jolly Uncle Wiggily and never stopping to think 
8009-282531-0013	train-other-500	anything might be wrong the bunny gentleman ate the cake And then all of a sudden he began to feel very funny Oh my exclaimed Uncle Wiggily
8009-282531-0014	train-other-500	I hope that cake didn t belong to my nephew Sammie Littletail
none	none	 or Johnnie or Billie Bushytail the squirrel brothers One of them may have lost it out of his lunch basket on his way to school I hope it wasn t any of their cake But there is surely something funny about it 
8009-282531-0015	train-other-500	for I feel so very queer And no wonder For Uncle Wiggily had suddenly begun to grow very large
none	none	 His ears grew taller so that they lifted his tall silk hat right off his head His legs seemed as long as bean poles and as for his whiskers and pink twinkling nose they seemed so far away from his eyes that he wondered if he would ever get them near enough to see to comb the one 
8009-282531-0016	train-other-500	or scratch the other when it felt ticklish This is certainly remarkable cried Uncle Wiggily I wonder what made me grow so large all of a sudden
none	none	 Could it have been the cake which gave me the indyspepsia It was the cake 
8009-282531-0017	train-other-500	cried a sudden and buzzing voice
none	none	 and looking around the hole Uncle Wiggily saw a big mosquito It was the cake that made you grow big 
8009-282531-0018	train-other-500	went on the bad biting bug
none	none	 and I put it here for you to 
8009-282531-0019	train-other-500	eat What for asked the bunny uncle puzzled like
none	none	 So you would grow so big that you couldn t get out of this hole 
8009-282531-0020	train-other-500	was the answer And now you can t This is how I have caught you Ha Ha and the mosquito buzzed a most unpleasant laugh Oh dear thought Uncle Wiggily
none	none	 I wonder if I am caught Can t I get out as I got in Quickly he hopped to the front of the hole But alas Likewise sorrowfulness He had grown so big from eating the magical cake that he could not possibly squeeze out of the hole through which he had crawled into the underground burrow Now I have caught you cried the mosquito Since we could not catch you at your soldier tent or in the trenches near your hollow stump bungalow I thought of this way Now we have you and we ll bite you and the big mosquito who with his bad friends had dug the hole on purpose to get Uncle Wiggily in a trap began to play a bugle tune on his wings to call the other biting bugs Oh dear thought Uncle Wiggily I guess I am caught And I haven t my talcum powder pop gun that shoots bean bag bullets Oh if I could only get out of here You can get out Uncle Wiggily said a soft little voice down toward the end of his pink twinkling nose You can get out Oh no I can t the bunny said I am much too large to squeeze out of the hole by which I came in here Much too large Oh dear 
8009-282531-0021	train-other-500	Here drink some of this and you ll grow small just as I did
none	none	 when I drank from it before I fell into the pool of tears 
8009-282531-0022	train-other-500	the soft and gentle voice went on and to Uncle Wiggily s surprise there stood a nice little girl with long flaxen hair
8009-282531-0023	train-other-500	She was holding out to him a bottle with a tag that read DRINK ME Am I really to drink this asked the bunny You are
none	none	 said the little girl 
8009-282531-0024	train-other-500	Uncle Wiggily took a long drink from the bottle It tasted like lollypop ice cream soda and no sooner had he taken a good sip than all of a sudden he found himself shutting up small like a telescope
8009-282531-0025	train-other-500	Smaller and smaller he shrank until he was his own regular size and then the little girl took him by the paw and cried Come on Now you can get out And surely enough Uncle Wiggily could
8009-282531-0026	train-other-500	But who are you he asked the little girl
none	none	 Oh I m Alice from Wonderland she said and I know you very well though you never met me before I m in a book but this is my holiday so I came out Come on now before the mosquitoes catch us We ll have a lot of funny adventures with some friends of mine 
8009-282531-0027	train-other-500	Come on And away ran Uncle Wiggily with Wonderland Alice who had saved him from being bitten So everything came out all right you see And
8009-282531-0028	train-other-500	if the teacup doesn t lose its handle and try to do a foxtrot waltz with the soup tureen
none	none	 I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the March Hare CHAPTER II UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MARCH HARE Well Uncle Wiggily you certainly did have quite a time didn t you said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper for the rabbit gentleman as they both sat on the porch of the hollow stump bungalow one morning It was the day after the bunny rabbit had been caught in the mosquito hole 
8009-282532-0000	train-other-500	where he swelled up too big to get out after eating cake from the glass box as I told you in the first story Then Alice from Wonderland happened along
none	none	 and gave Uncle Wiggily a drink from a magical little bottle 
8009-282532-0001	train-other-500	so that he grew small enough to crawl out of the hole again Yes I had a wonderful time with Alice said the rabbit gentleman It was quite an adventure
none	none	 What do you s pose was in the cake to make you swell up so large 
8009-282532-0002	train-other-500	asked Nurse Jane Cream puffs answered Uncle Wiggily They re very swell like you know Of course agreed Nurse Jane And what was in the bottle to make you grow smaller
8009-282532-0003	train-other-500	Alum water Uncle Wiggily made reply That s very shrinking you know and puckery Of course spoke Nurse Jane again I might have guessed it Now I suppose you re off again
none	none	 Off to have another adventure went on Uncle Wiggily with a jolly laugh 
8009-282532-0004	train-other-500	I hope I meet Alice again I wonder where she lives Why she s out of a book said Nurse Jane I used to read about her to Sammie Littletail when he was quite a little rabbit chap Oh yes to be sure
8009-282532-0005	train-other-500	said Uncle Wiggily Alice from Wonderland is like Mother Goose Sinbad the Sailor and my other Arabian Night friends
none	none	 Well I hope I meet some of them and have another adventure now 
8009-282532-0006	train-other-500	and away he hopped down the front steps of his bungalow as spry as though he never had had the rheumatism
none	none	 The bad mosquitoes that used to live over in the swamp had gone away on their summer vacation and so they did not bother the bunny rabbit just at present 
8009-282532-0007	train-other-500	He no longer had to practice being a soldier and stand on guard against them Pretty soon as Uncle Wiggily hopped along he came to a little place in the woods all set around with green trees
8009-282532-0008	train-other-500	and in the center was a large doll s tea table all ready for a meal Ha This looks like an adventure already said the bunny uncle to himself And there s a party
none	none	 he went on as he saw the little girl named Alice a March Hare 
8009-282532-0009	train-other-500	which is a sort of spring rabbit a hatter man with a very large hat much larger than Uncle Wiggily s on his head and a dormouse A dormouse or doormouse is one that crawls out under a door you know to get away from the cat
8009-282532-0010	train-other-500	Oh here s Uncle Wiggily cried Alice
none	none	 Come right along and sit down We didn t expect you Then if I m unexpected perhaps there isn t room for me 
8009-282532-0011	train-other-500	spoke Uncle Wiggily looking at the March Hare Oh yes there s plenty of room more room than there is to eat said the spring rabbit Besides we really knew you were coming
none	none	 As this was just different from what Alice had said Uncle Wiggily did not know what to believe You see it s the unexpected that always happens went on the March Hare and of course being unexpected you happened along so we re glad to see you Only there isn t anything to eat 
8009-282532-0012	train-other-500	said Alice You see the Hatter s watch only keeps one kind of time That s what I do when I dance interrupted Uncle Wiggily We haven t come to that yet Alice spoke gently But
8009-282532-0013	train-other-500	as the Hatter s watch only keeps tea time we re always at the tea table and the cake and tea were eaten long ago
none	none	 And we always have to sit here hoping the Hatter s watch will start off again and bring us to breakfast or dinner on time said the March Hare who Uncle Wiggily noticed 
8009-282532-0014	train-other-500	began to look rather mad and angry He s greased it with the best butter
none	none	 but still his watch has stopped the hare added It s on account of the hard crumbs that got in the wheels said the Hatter 
8009-282532-0015	train-other-500	dipping his watch in the cream pitcher I dare say they ll get soaked in time But pass Uncle Wiggily the buns he added and Alice passed an empty plate which once had dog biscuits on only Jackie
none	none	 and Peetie Bow Wow had eaten them all up I should say down for they swallowed them that way Uncle Wiggily was beginning to think this was a very queer tea party indeed when all of sudden out from the bushes jumped a great big pink striped Wabberjocky cat who began singing London Bridge is falling up On Yankee Doodle Dandy As we go round the mulberry bush To buy a stick of candy Well what do you want asked the Mad March Hare of the Wabberjocky If you ve come to wash the dishes you can t for it s still tea time and it never will be anything else as long as he keeps dipping his watch in the molasses jug That s what makes it so sticky slow and he tossed a tea biscuit at the Hatter who caught it in his hat just like a magician in the theater and turned it into a lemon meringue pie I ve come for Uncle Wiggily cried the Wabberjocky I ve come to take him off to my den and then Uncle Wiggily was just going to hide under the table which he noticed was growing smaller and smaller 
8009-282532-0016	train-other-500	and he was wondering if it would be large enough to cover him when All of a sudden the Mad March Hare caught up the bunny uncle s red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch and cried You ve come for Uncle Wiggily have you Well we ve no time for that
none	none	 and with this the March Hare 
8009-282532-0017	train-other-500	smashed the crutch down on the Hatter s watch Bang breaking it all to pieces
none	none	 There I guess it ll go now cried the March Hare and indeed the wheels of the watch went spinning 
8009-282532-0018	train-other-500	while the spring suddenly uncurled and one end catching around Uncle Wiggily s left hind leg flew out and tossed him safely away over the trees until he fell down on his soft soldier tent right
8009-282532-0019	train-other-500	in front of his own hollow stump bungalow So he was saved from the Wabberjocky
none	none	 Well That was an adventure 
8009-282532-0020	train-other-500	cried the bunny uncle I wonder what happened to the rest of them I must find out
none	none	 And if the laundry man doesn t let the plumber take the bath tub away for the gold fish to play tag in I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Cheshire Cat CHAPTER III UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHESHIRE CAT Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman was hopping along through the woods one day wondering what sort of an adventure he would have and he was thinking about Alice in Wonderland and what a queer tea party he had been to the day before when the Mad March Hare smashed the Hatter s watch because the hands always stayed at five o clock tea time If anything like that is going to happen to me today said the bunny uncle to himself I ought to have brought Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy along so she could enjoy the fun I ll just hop along and if anything queer starts I ll go back after her So he went on a little farther and all of a sudden he saw lying on the woodland path a piece of cheese Ha cried Uncle Wiggily I wonder if Jollie or Jillie Longtail the mouse children dropped that out of their trap I ll take it to them I guess He picked up the bit of cheese thinking how glad the mousie boy and girl would be to have it back when all at once he heard behind him a voice asking Oh did you find it I m so glad thank you and from under a bush out stepped a cat wearing a large smile on the front of its face The cat stretched out its claw and took the bit of cheese from Uncle Wiggily Oh Is that yours asked the bunny gentleman in surprise It s Cheshire cheese isn t it asked the cat I I believe so answered the bunny Yes he added as he looked and made sure it is Cheshire cheese Then as I m the Cheshire cat it s mine Cheshire cat meet your cheese Cheese meet your cat How do you do So glad to see you and the cat shook paws with the cheese just as if Uncle Wiggily had introduced them I dare say it s all right went on the bunny uncle Of course it is laughed the cat smiling more than ever I m so glad you found my cheese I was afraid the March Hare had taken it for that silly five o clock tea party But I m glad he didn t At first I took you for the March Hare You look like him being a rabbit My birthday is not in March it is in April said Uncle Wiggily bowing That s better spoke the Cheshire cat You have done me a great favor by finding my cheese and I hope to be able to do you one some day Pray do not mention it spoke the bunny uncle modest like and shy as he always was He was just going to ask about Alice in Wonderland when the cat ran away with the cheese Never mind thought Uncle Wiggily That was the beginning of an adventure anyhow I wonder what the next part will be He did not have long to wait All of a sudden as he was walking along through the woods sort of leaning on his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch there was a rustling in the bushes and out popped a whole lot of hungry rats Ah there IT is cried one rat seizing hold of Uncle Wiggily by his ears Yes and just in time too cried another grabbing the bunny by his paws Into our den with IT before the mouse trap comes along and takes IT away from us With that the rats of which there were about five hundred and sixteen began hustling Uncle Wiggily down a hole in the ground and the first he knew they had him inside a wooden room in an underground house and they locked the door taking the key out What does this mean cried the bunny uncle Why do you treat me this way Why IT can speak cried several of the rats in surprise Of course I can cried Uncle Wiggily his pink nose twinkling But why do you call me IT Because you are a piece of cheese said one rat and we always call cheese IT Cheese I cheese asked astonished Uncle Wiggily Of course cried the biggest rat of all You re Cheshire cheese Why you perfume the whole room We re so hungry for you We thought the grocer had forgotten to send you But it s all right now Oh what a delightful meal we shall have We love Cheshire cheese and the rats in the room with mister Longears looked very hungrily at the bunny uncle very hungrily indeed Oh what shall I do thought Uncle Wiggily I see what has happened When I picked up the Cheshire cat s piece of Cheshire cheese some of the perfume from it must have stuck to my paws The rats smelled that and think I m it IT murmured the bunny gentleman As if I were a game of tag IT The rats in the locked room were very busy getting out their cheese knives and plates and poor Uncle Wiggily hardly knew what to do with this most unpleasant adventure happening to him when all of a sudden right in the middle of the room there appeared a big smiling mouth with a cheerful grin spread all over it Just a smile it was and nothing more Oh cried Uncle Wiggily in surprise Oh With that all the rats looked up and seeing the smile one exclaimed I smell a cat Oh woe is me I smell a cat Then all of a sudden the smile grew larger and larger Then a nose seemed to grow out of nothing then some whiskers then a pair of blazing eyes and then ears a head legs claws and a body and finally there stood the Cheshire cat in the midst of the rats Scat rats meaouwed the Cheshire cat Scat How did you get in here asked one rat Yes tell us ordered another How did you get in past the locked door Through the keyhole said the Cheshire cat I sent my smile in first and then it was easy for my body to follow Now you scat and leave Uncle Wiggily alone and with that the cat grinned larger than ever showing such sharp teeth that the rats quickly unlocked the door and ran away leaving the bunny uncle quite safe Alice in Wonderland most magically knew of the trouble you were in said the Cheshire cat so she sent me to help you which I was glad to do as you had helped me My Cheshire cheese that you found for me when I had lost it was very good Then Uncle Wiggily hopped back to his bungalow and the cat went to see Alice and if the paper cutter doesn t slice the bread board all up into pieces of cake for the puppy dog s party I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Dormouse CHAPTER IV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DORMOUSE Tap Tap Tap came a knock on the door of the hollow stump bungalow one morning Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman who lived in the woods called out Please come in In hopped Dickie Chip Chip the sparrow boy postchap with a letter for the bunny gentleman Ha That s nice explained Uncle Wiggily as he took the envelope I hope it s a valentine A valentine this time of year laughed Dickie This is June Uncle Wiggily Oh so it is However I ll read it And when Dickie flew on to deliver the rest of his letters Uncle Wiggily read his own It was very short and said If you want a new hat come to the green meadow as soon as you read this Ha If I want a new hat thought the bunny uncle Well I do need one But who knew that I did This is very strange and mysterious Ha I have it This must be from Alice in Wonderland She is giving me a little surprise So telling Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy his muskrat lady housekeeper that he was going out to get a new hat away hopped Uncle Wiggily over the fields and through the woods until he came to the green meadow In the middle of the meadow was a little grove of trees and half way there Uncle Wiggily heard a sad little voice saying Oh dear What trouble I m in Trouble cried the bunny gentleman twinkling his pink nose Ha That sounds like old times Let me help some one But who is it It is I The little Dormouse was the answer and looking down Uncle Wiggily saw the tiny creature who had been at the queer tea party when the Mad March Hare smashed the Hatter s five o clock watch The tail of the poor little Dormouse was caught fast in between two stones and she could not move but Uncle Wiggily quickly loosened it for her and she was very thankful to get out I was afraid I d be late said the Dormouse I have to hurry on to help the Queen of Hearts put sugared cheese on the blackberry tarts for the King s birthday I ll see you again Uncle Wiggily I hope so spoke the bunny uncle as he hurried away to get his new hat all the while wondering whether or not he would see Alice from Wonderland Uncle Wiggily reached the green meadow trees but no one else was there He looked up and down and all around but there was not even an old hat in sight to say nothing of a new one I wonder if this letter is an April fool joke thought the bunny uncle taking from his pocket the envelope Dickie had given him No if it s the month of June it can t be April Fool s Day any more than it can be time for valentines said the bunny But I wonder where my hat is Hardly had Uncle Wiggily said this out loud than all of a sudden a voice cried Here s your hat With that something seemed to drop down from the clouds or maybe it was from one of the trees But whatever it was it completely covered Uncle Wiggily out of sight It was just as if you took a large bowl and turned it upside down over a grasshopper only of course Uncle Wiggily was not a grasshopper though he did jump around a lot And at first in the sudden darkness the rabbit gentleman thought it was a bowl that perhaps the circus elephant s little boy had turned over on him just for fun Then making his pink nose twinkle very fast so that it shone in the dark like a firefly lantern Uncle Wiggily was able to see that he was inside a large tall silk hat When it had dropped over him it had shut out all the sunlight making it quite dark inside where the bunny was Yes this is a hat said Uncle Wiggily to himself But what a funny way to give it to me And it s so large Instead of my new hat going outside my head my head is inside the hat This will never do I must get out and see what the trouble is This must be the elephant s hat it s so large But when Uncle Wiggily tried to lift up one edge of the hat to crawl out he found he could not Some one seemed to be sitting on top of the hat which was shaped like the silk stovepipe one Uncle Wiggily always wore And a voice cried Hold it tight and he can t get out Oh I m holding it tight was the answer Then Uncle Wiggily knew what had happened Some one had played a sad trick on him And it was two bad old skillery scalery alligators They had borrowed the Wonderland Hatter s hat which was very large Nor had they told the Hatter what they wanted of it for if they had he never would have let them borrow it to make trouble for Uncle Wiggily The alligators had climbed up the tree with the big hat and after sending Uncle Wiggily the note they had waited until he came to the field Then from the branches above they dropped the hat down over him and sat on it And I can t get out cried Uncle Wiggily That s the worst of it I can t get out and those bad alligators will reach under and grab me and No they won t cried a little squeaky voice down low on the ground just outside the hat Why not asked Uncle Wiggily hopeful like Because I am the Dormouse whom you helped was the answer Now listen With my sharp teeth I am going to cut a door in the side of the hat where the alligators sitting up on top can t see it Then you can get out So the Dormouse being made for just such work as you can tell by its name gnawed a door in the side of the Hatter s hat and out crawled the bunny rabbit gentleman before the alligators could grab him And the bunny and the Dormouse got safely away mister Longears being very thankful indeed for having been helped by the little creature So the alligators had nothing for dinner but stewed pears and if our dog doesn t leave his tail on the wrong side of the fence so the cat can use it for a dusting brush I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Gryphon CHAPTER V UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GRYPHON Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman had just finished shaving his whiskers in his hollow stump bungalow one morning when Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy his muskrat lady housekeeper came to his door knocked gently by flapping her tail against it and said If you please mister Longears there s a young lady to see you Of course I m pleased answered Uncle Wiggily I always like to see young ladies especially if they have light fluffy hair Has this one that kind Very much so answered Nurse Jane Here she is now and with that in came a nice young lady or rather a tall girl with flaxen hair I m afraid you don t remember me she said as Uncle Wiggily wiped the soap lather off the end of his pink twinkling nose where it had splashed by mistake making it look like part of a frosted chocolate cake Oh yes I do remember you cried the bunny gentleman in his most jolly voice You re Alice from Wonderland and you were very kind to help me grow smaller that time the big mosquito got me into his cave and I swelled up from eating cake Oh I m so glad you remember me laughed Alice for it was indeed she I ve come to ask you to do me a bit of a favor I have to go see the Gryphon and I thought maybe you d come with me for I m afraid he ll be real cross to me You have to go see the Gryphon exclaimed Uncle Wiggily Who in the world is he Oh he s a funny animal who lives in the same story book with me explained Alice He s something between a dragon a lion an elephant a flying fish and an alligator Whew whistled Uncle Wiggily He must be a curious creature He is Alice said And sometimes he s very cross especially if the wind blows his veil up If the wind blows his veil up asked Uncle Wiggily In the first place why does he wear a veil and in the second place why should he be angry if the wind blows it There isn t any first or second place about it spoke Alice for you never can tell in which place the Gryphon will be found But he wears a veil because he is so ugly that every one runs away when one sees him and he doesn t like that And of course he doesn t like the wind to blow up his veil so folks can see how he really looks Ah ha I understand remarked the bunny But if he is so cross why do you want to go to see him I don t want to replied Alice but I have to because it s that way in the book You see to make everything come out right the Gryphon takes me to the Mock Turtle who tells me a funny story and so now I ve come to see if you ll take me to the Gryphon I will promised Uncle Wiggily washing the soap lather out of his ears But where shall we find him Oh that s the question laughed Alice just as though Uncle Wiggily had asked a riddle You have three guesses she went on The bunny gentleman twinkled his pink nose so that he might think better and then he said I ll tell you what we ll do We ll go for a walk and make believe I m looking for an adventure Then I may find the Gryphon for you Fine cried Alice and Uncle Wiggily having finished shaving he and Alice set out together over the fields and through the wood her hand holding the bunny s paw Now we must keep a sharp watch for the Gryphon said Alice who had had so many adventures in Wonderland that it took a whole book to tell of them You never know whether he ll appear like an elephant a dragon a lion or a big bird for he has wings she said Has he indeed asked Uncle Wiggily Then I think I hear him coming now he went on Listen do you hear the buzzing And surely enough the air seemed filled with the buzzing and fluttering of wings And then the sun appeared to be hidden by a cloud That must be the Gryphon said Uncle Wiggily Alice looked and then she cried Oh no It s a big cloud of bad biting mosquitoes It is the buzzing of their wings we hear Oh Uncle Wiggily you haven t your talcum powder bean shooter gun with you and here come a billion million mosquitoes That s right cried the bunny uncle as he too saw them We must hide or they will bite even our shoes off So he and Alice looked for a place to hide but there was none and the buzzing mosquitoes cried Ah ha Now we have that Uncle Wiggily Longears rabbit He can t get away now for he isn t a soldier today And we ll get Alice from Wonderland too Well the mosquitoes were just going to grab the bunny gentleman and the nice little young lady girl with the fluffy flaxen hair when a voice out of the air cried Oh ho No you re not going to get them either Who says we are not asked the captain mosquito I do And who are you I am the Gryphon was the answer And I have on my mosquito net veil I ll catch all you bad biting bugs in my net just as a professor catches butterflies Whoop Swoop Here I come And with that the Gryphon raising his veil which hung down from his big ears as from around a lady s big hat made a net of it and flying around soon caught all the mosquitoes that would have bitten Uncle Wiggily and Alice And the mosquitoes that were not caught were so frightened at the fierce look on the Gryphon s face that they fainted and couldn t bite even as much as a spoonful of mustard So the Gryphon drove the mosquitoes away and then he took Alice to see the Mock Turtle while Uncle Wiggily hopped on home to his bungalow And if the rubber doll doesn t bounce off the clothes horse when she rides to the candy store for some cornstarch pudding I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the blue caterpillar CHAPTER VI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CATERPILLAR Uncle Wiggily Oh Uncle Wiggily called Alice from Wonderland as she stood one day just outside the hollow stump bungalow where the rabbit gentleman had just finished his breakfast of carrot oatmeal with parsnip sauce sprinkled over the top Do you want to come for another walk with me asked Alice as she ran up the bungalow front steps Are you going to have the Gryphon take you to the Mock Turtle again the bunny gentleman wanted to know If you are I ll bring my talcum powder gun along this time to keep away the mosquitoes No I don t have to see the Gryphon today replied Wonderland Alice with a laugh But the Duchess has sent me to find the Blue Caterpillar The Duchess has sent you to find the Blue Caterpillar questioned Uncle Wiggily wondering if he had heard rightly But who is the Duchess Oh she s some relation to the Queen of Hearts Alice answered She s in the book with me the Duchess is In the book picture she always has a lot of trimming on her big hat and she doesn t care whether or not she holds the baby upside down Oh yes now I remember Uncle Wiggily said laughing as he thought of the baby And now about the Blue Caterpillar Oh he s a sort of long fuzzy bug who sits on a toadstool smoking a pipe explained Alice The Duchess wants him to come and smoke some hams for her Smoke hams cried the bunny rabbit Why the very idonical idea I ve heard of men smoking tobacco but hams Oh you don t smoke hams in a pipe said Alice with a laugh They take a ham before it is cooked and hang it up in a cloud of smoke or blow smoke on it or do something to it with smoke so it will dry and keep longer What do they want to keep it for asked Uncle Wiggily I thought ham was to eat with eggs Oh dear laughed Alice I wish you wouldn t ask me so many questions You re like the Dormouse or the Cheshire Cheese Cat or the Hatter They were always asking the curiousestest questions like Who threw stones at the cherry tree or How did the soft egg get inside the hard shell without cracking it All things like that I can t answer them Very well said Uncle Wiggily smiling at Alice I ll not ask you any more questions Come on We ll go find the Blue Caterpillar So off they started the bunny rabbit gentleman and Wonderland Alice who had a day s vacation from the book with her name on it Now and then she could slip out of the book covers and go off to have a real adventure with Uncle Wiggily The bunny uncle and the little girl with the pretty flaxen hair had not gone very far over the fields and through the woods before all of a sudden as they were walking under some trees something long and twisty and rubbery like a big fire hose reached out and grabbed them Oh my cried Alice trying to get loose which she could not do A big snake has us No said Uncle Wiggily looking around as best he could for he too was held fast as was Alice This isn t a snake What is it asked Alice It s a bad circus elephant said the bunny and he has caught us in his trunk Oh dear Please let us go he begged the big animal No sadly answered the circus elephant for it was indeed he I can t let you go for if I do they will all sit on my back and bite me Who will asked Uncle Wiggily curious like The mosquitoes was the answer You see they have tried in so many ways to catch you and haven t done it Uncle Wiggily that they finally came to me About a million billion of them swarmed around me and they said they d bite me until I had the shiv ivers if I did not help them catch you So I had to promise that I would though I did not want to for I like you Uncle Wiggily If I hadn t promised though the mosquitoes would have bitten me and though I seem to have a very thick skin I am very tender not to say ticklish when it comes to mosquito bites So I hid here to catch you and I ll have to hold you until the mosquitoes come to get you I m very sorry and the elephant wound his rubbery nose of a trunk still more tightly around Uncle Wiggily and Alice Oh dear said Alice What shall we do I don t know I m sure answered the bunny This is quite too bad If only the Blue Caterpillar Hush exclaimed a fuzzy voice down in the grass near the elephant s left front foot Don t say a word I ll help you and along came crawling a big Blue Caterpillar with a folded toadstool umbrella and a long stemmed pipe on his back That elephant is very ticklish said the Blue Caterpillar Watch me make him squirm And when he squirms he ll have to uncurl his trunk to scratch himself and when he does that We ll get away whispered Uncle Wiggily Exactly said the Blue Caterpillar So he crawled up the elephant s leg and tickled the big animal on its ear Oh dear cried the elephant How itchy I am and he uncurled his trunk to scratch himself and then Uncle Wiggily and Alice could run away safely and the mosquitoes didn t get them after all Then Alice told the Blue Caterpillar about the Duchess wanting the hams smoked and the crawling creature said he d attend to it and puff smoke on them from his pipe So everything came out all right I m glad to say and if the starch doesn t all come out of the collar so it has to lie down instead of standing up straight at the moving picture show I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Hatter CHAPTER VII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE HATTER Oh Uncle Wiggily called Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as mister Longears the rabbit gentleman started to hop out of his hollow stump bungalow one morning Oh Uncle Wiggily Well what is it asked the bunny with a polite bow Do you want anything from the store Some carrot coffee if you please answered the muskrat lady When you finish your walk and have had a nice adventure bring home some coffee I ll do it promised Uncle Wiggily and then as he hopped along over the fields and through the woods he thought perhaps he had better buy the carrot coffee first For said he to himself I might have such a funny adventure that I d forget all about what Nurse Jane told me Now you just wait and see what happens if you please It did not take the bunny long to get the coffee the monkey doodle gentleman who kept the store wrapping it up for him in a paper that had been twisted around a lollypop candy It s a bit sticky and sweet said the monkey doodle store keeper speaking of the lollypop paper but that will stop the coffee from falling out Fine laughed Uncle Wiggily and then he hopped on to look for an adventure He had not gone very far before when all of a sudden he heard a voice saying Well I don t know what to do about it that s all I never saw such trouble The idea of wanting me to get ready for it this time of day Ha Trouble thought Uncle Wiggily This is where I come in What is it you can t get ready for this time of day and who are you asked the bunny for he saw no one Oh it s you is it called a voice and out from under a mulberry bush stepped a little man with such a large hat that it covered him from head to foot Oh excuse me said Uncle Wiggily You are The Hatter Exactly You have guessed it said the little man opening a window which was cut in the side of his hat The window was just opposite his face which was inside so he could look out at the bunny gentleman I m the Hatter from Alice in Wonderland went on the little man The bunny hadn t quite really guessed it though he might if he had had time And what is the trouble asked Uncle Wiggily Oh I ve just been ordered by the Queen of Hearts to get up a tea party right away for Alice who is expected any minute went on the Hatter And here it is ten o clock in the morning and the tea s at five and I haven t even started You have lots of time said Uncle Wiggily Hours and hours Yes but I haven t the tea cried the Hatter Don t mind me but I m as mad as mad as as lollypops and there s nothing madder than them he said sort of grinding his teeth This grinding made Uncle Wiggily think of the coffee in his pocket So holding out the package he said I don t s pose this would do would it What asked the Hatter It s coffee went on the bunny but The very thing cried the Hatter who was now smiling It will be just the thing for the five o clock tea We ll have it right here I ll set the table and opening two little doors lower down in his big hat he stuck his arms through them and began brushing off a broad flat stump near Uncle Wiggily The stump will do for a table said the Hatter This is great Uncle Wiggily We ll have tea for Alice after all and make things happen as they do in the book Don t mind me saying I was as mad as lollypops I have to be mad make believe you know or things won t come out right I see said Uncle Wiggily remembering that it was quite stylish to be as mad as a hatter though he never before knew what it meant But you see my dear sir the rabbit went on I have only coffee to give you and not tea It doesn t matter said the Hatter I ll boil it in a cocoanut shell and it will do her very well and with that he took out from somewhere inside his hat half a cocoanut shell This he set on top of the stump on a little three legged stool and built a fire under it But you need water to make coffee I mean tea said Uncle Wiggily I have it cried the Hatter and picking up an umbrella plant growing near by he squeezed some water from it into the cocoanut shell kettle Uncle Wiggily poured some of the ground coffee into the cocoanut shell of umbrella water which was now boiling and then the bunny exclaimed But we have no sugar We ll sweeten it with the paper that came off the lollypop said the Hatter tearing off a bit of it and tossing it into the tea coffee What about milk asked Uncle Wiggily Alice may want cream in her coffee I mean tea Here we are cried the Hatter With that he picked a leaf from a milkweed plant growing near the flat stump and from that he squeezed out some drops of milk into a cup he made from a Jack in the pulpit flower Now we re all ready for five o clock tea cried the Hatter and just then along came Alice from Wonderland with the March Hare and they sat down to the stump table with Uncle Wiggily who happened to have a piece of cherry pie in his pocket so they had a nice little lunch after all And the carrot coffee with milkweed cream in it tasted like catnip tea so everything came out all right And if the white shoes don t go down in the coal bin to play with the fire shovel and freeze their toes so they can t parade on the Board Walk I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Duchess CHAPTER VIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DUCHESS Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman was hopping along through the woods one day looking for an adventure when all of a sudden he came to a door standing up between two trees It was a regular door with a knob hinges and all but the funny part of it was there didn t seem to be a room on either side of it This is remarkable exclaimed Wiggily remarkable meaning the same thing as queer It is very odd Here is a door and the jamb Where s the jamb asked a little katydid who was sitting on a leaf in the sun I m very fond of jam I didn t say j a m the kind you eat on bread spoke Uncle Wiggily I was talking about the j a m b with a b Bees make honey said the katydid and honey s almost as good as jam I m not so fussy as all that Jam or honey honey or jam it s all the same to me No there isn t any honey either said the bunny The jamb of the door is the wooden frame that goes around it to hold it in place Then I don t want any door jamb I want bread and jam said the katydid hopping off to find her sister Katydidn t leaving Uncle Wiggily to stare at the lone door Well said the rabbit gentleman to himself I may as well see what s on the other side Though a door standing all by itself in the woods is the strangest thing I ve ever seen However he turned the knob opened the door and stepped through and to his surprise he found himself in a big kitchen which seemed magically to have appeared the moment he entered the very surprising place At one end was a big stove with a hot fire in it and on the stove was a boiling kettle of soup which was being stirred by a big fat cook lady who was shaped like a ham without the string in the end of course For the cook could stand up and didn t need to be hung on a nail as a ham is hung before it s cooked In front of the fire was another large lady with a bonnet on almost as big as the Hatter s hat Over the bonnet was a fluffy flowing veil Now please be quiet do exclaimed the sitting down lady to something in her lap and Uncle Wiggily saw that it was a baby Come cook she cried Is that hot soup ready yet for the baby Not yet mum But it soon will be answered the cook and Uncle Wiggily was just going to say something about not giving a little baby hot soup when the door opened again and in came Alice from Wonderland Oh I m so glad you re here Uncle Wiggily cried Alice Now it will be all right What will asked the bunny What will be right My left shoe said Alice You see I just came from the Pool of Tears and everything got all mixed up When I came out I had two left shoes instead of one being a right but now you are here it s all right I mean one is right and the other is left as it should be and with that Alice put on one shoe she had been carrying in her hand and smiled But who is this asked Uncle Wiggily pointing with his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch at the big lady holding the baby which was now squirming like an angle worm It s the Duchess a friend of the Queen of Hearts answered Alice I ll introduce you to her in a minute Are you fond of sneezing Only when I have a cold answered Uncle Wiggily Why do you ask and he began to think he was having a very funny adventure indeed Why should I be fond of sneezing Because you ll have to whether you like it or not answered Alice The Duchess is going to talcum powder the baby now it s just had a bath With that the duchess who is the wife of a duke you know called Here cook Never mind the soup Give me the pepper Goodness me sakes alive and some horseradish lollypops cried Uncle Wiggily She isn t going to talcum powder the baby with pepper is she Of course answered Alice It s that way in the book from which I came to have an adventure with you so of course pepper it has to be Look out here come the sneezes and Alice got out her handkerchief Uncle Wiggily saw the duchess with a funny smile on her big face take the pepper box the cook gave her and start to sprinkle the black stuff over the baby in her lap The baby was cooing and gurgling as all babies do after their bath and didn t seem at all to mind her being peppered They season chickens and turkeys with salt and pepper so why not babies asked Alice of Uncle Wiggily The bunny gentleman was just going to say he did not know the answer to that riddle when the door suddenly opened again and in came a great big dodo bird which is something like a skillery scalery alligator only worse with a beak like that of a mosquito Illustration Ah ha chirped the dodo At last I have found him and he made a dart with his big beak for Uncle Wiggily The dodo was just going to grab the bunny gentleman in his claws and mister Longears was so shivery he didn t know what to do when the duchess suddenly tossing the baby to the cook cried Ha No you don t I guess it s you I want to pepper instead and with that she shook the box of pepper at the dodo who began sneezing as hard as he could sneeze Aker choo Aker choo Aker choo sneezed the dodo Keer zoo Keer zoo Keer zoo sneezed the duchess Goo snitzio Goo snitzio Goo snitzio sneezed Alice Fizz buzzy wuzz Fizz buzzy wuzz Fizz buzzy wuzz sneezed Uncle Wiggily and then the dodo himself gave another very large special five and ten cent store sale sneeze and blew himself backward out of the door So he didn t get Uncle Wiggily after all And now we are all right said Alice when they had all finished sneezing including the baby Have some soup Uncle Wiggily So the bunny did finding it very good and made from cabbage and pretzels and then he went home to his stump bungalow And if the lollypop stick doesn t have to go out and help the wash lady hold up the clothesline when it goes fishing for apple pie I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the cook CHAPTER IX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE COOK Well mister Longears I shall have to leave you all alone today said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she gave Uncle Wiggily the bunny rabbit gentleman his breakfast in the hollow stump bungalow one morning Leave me all alone how does that happen asked Uncle Wiggily sort of sad and sorrowful like Do you mean you are going to leave me for good Oh no I m just going to be busy all day sewing mosquito shirts for the animal boy soldiers who are going off to war Since you taught them how to shoot their talcum powder guns at the bad biting bugs Sammie Littletail your rabbit nephew and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrels Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppy dogs and all the other Woodland chaps have been bothered with the mosquitoes They made war enough on me said Uncle Wiggily And since they could not catch you they are starting war against your friends went on Nurse Jane so I am making mosquito shirts for the animal boys I ll be away sewing all day and you ll have to get your own lunch I m afraid I m not afraid laughed brave Uncle Wiggily If I could get away from the bad biting mosquitoes I guess I can get my own lunch Besides maybe Alice from Wonderland will come along and help me Maybe spoke Nurse Jane Then the muskrat lady tying her tail up in a pink blue hair ribbon scurried off while Uncle Wiggily hopped over the fields and through the woods looking for an adventure But adventures or things that happen to you seemed to be scarce that day and it was noontime before the bunny gentleman hardly knew it Well he exclaimed I m getting hungry and as I didn t bring any cherry pie with me I ll have to skip along to my hollow stump bungalow for something to eat Nurse Jane had left some things on the table for the bunny gentleman to eat for his lunch There were cold carrot sandwiches cold cabbage tarts cold turnip unsidedowns which are like turnovers only different and cold lettuce pancakes But it seems to me said Uncle Wiggily it seems to me that I would like something hot I think I ll make a soup of all these things as I saw the cook doing when I went through the funny little door and met Alice from Wonderland in the kitchen of the Duchess So getting a large soup kettle Uncle Wiggily put into it the cold carrot sandwiches the cold lettuce pancakes the cold cabbage tarts and so on Then he built a fire in the stove For said he if those things are good cold they are better hot I shall have a fine hot lunch Then Uncle Wiggily sat down to wait for the things to cook and every once in a while he would look at the kettle on the stove and say Yes I shall have a fine hot lunch And then all of a sudden after the bunny rabbit gentleman had said this about five and ten cent store times a voice cried Indeed you will have a hot lunch and all of a sudden into the kitchen of the hollow stump bungalow came the red hot flamingo bird eager to burn the rabbit gentleman Oh exclaimed Uncle Wiggily I I don t seem to know you very well You ll know me better after a bit said the red flamingo bird clashing its beak like a pair of tailor s shears I m the bird that Alice from Wonderland used for a croquet mallet when she played with the Queen of Hearts Oh now I know said the bunny Won t you have lunch with me he asked trying to be polite I m having a hot lunch though Nurse Jane left me a cold one and You are going to have a much hotter lunch than you imagine said the red flamingo bird Look out I m getting sizzling hot And indeed he was which made him such a red color I suppose I m going to burn you cried the bird to Uncle Wiggily sticking out his red tongue Burn me Why asked the poor bunny gentleman Oh because I have to burn somebody and it might as well be you said the flamingo Look out now Ha Indeed And it s you who had better look out cried a new voice And with that the cook the same big lady shaped like a ham whom Uncle Wiggily had last seen in the kitchen of the Duchess this cook hopped nimbly in through a window of the hollow stump bungalow I ll fix him she cried catching up the flatirons from the shelf over the stove and throwing them at the flamingo Get out Scat Sush Run away And she threw the fire shovel the dustpan the sink shovel the stove lifter the broom and the coal scuttle at the flamingo My but that cook was a thrower She didn t hit the red flamingo bird with any of the things she threw but she tossed them so very hard and seemingly with such anger that the bird was frightened This is no place for me cried the flaming red bird drawing in his red tongue I ll go make it hot for mister Whitewash the polar bear He might like some heat for a change from his cake of ice Then the red flamingo bird not burning Uncle Wiggily at all flew away and the cook after she had picked up all the kitchen things she had thrown came in and had a hot lunch with Uncle Wiggily who thanked her very much I m glad you came said the bunny but I didn t know you cooks threw things Oh I m from the Wonderland Alice book which makes me different the cook answered And she was queer But everything came out all right you see and if the trolley car conductor doesn t punch the transfer so hard that it falls off the seat I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Baby CHAPTER X UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BABY Well said Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman to himself as he stood in the middle of the woods and looked around I don t seem to be going to have any adventures today at all I wonder what s the matter Something was wrong that is certain The bunny uncle had been hopping along all the morning and part of the afternoon and not a single adventure had he found Almost always something happened to him but this time was different He had not met Alice from Wonderland nor any of her queer relations and Uncle Wiggily had not seen any of his animal boy or girl friends so the rabbit gentleman was beginning to feel a bit lonesome Then all of a sudden before you could count a million providing you had time and wanted to Uncle Wiggily saw fluttering from a tree what he thought was a flag That s queer he said to himself only out loud I wonder if any of my mosquito enemies have made a camp there under the trees and are flying the flag before they come to bite me I ll go closer and see Uncle Wiggily was very brave you know even if he only had his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch instead of the talcum powder popgun that shot bean bag bullets So up he went to where he thought he saw the mosquito enemy s flag fluttering and my goodness me sakes alive and some chocolate cake ginger snaps It wasn t the mosquito flag at all which shows that we ought never to be afraid until we are sure what a thing is and sometimes not then Why it s a lady s veil cried Uncle Wiggily as he looked at the fluttering thing And as he said that someone who was sitting on an old log turned around and there was the Wonderland Duchess herself the queer stout lady who looked like a barrel of flour very rich you know Illustration Oh hello Uncle Wiggily called the Duchess who is a sort of princess grown up I m glad to see you I have a friend of yours here with me Do you mean Alice asked the bunny No this time it s the Baby answered the Duchess and then Uncle Wiggily saw that she had a live baby in her arms upside down I mean the baby was upside down not the arms of the Duchess though perhaps it would have been better that way Bless me cried Uncle Wiggily That s no way to hold the child Oh indeed said the Duchess sort of sniffing proud like Then if you know so much about holding babies take this one I have to go make a rice pudding and before Uncle Wiggily could stop her she tossed the baby to him as if it were a ball and ran away crying Rice Rice Who has the rice pudding Oh my Uncle Wiggily started to say but that was all he had time for as he had to catch Baby which he managed to do right side up This was a good thing I think You poor little dear cried the bunny uncle as he smoothed out the Baby s clothes and looked around for a nursing bottle or a rattle box And as he was doing this and while the Baby was trying to close its lips which it had opened to cry with when it found itself skedaddling through the air while this was going on some one gave a loud laugh and Uncle Wiggily looking around in surprise saw Alice from Wonderland Well said the bunny I m glad to see you but what is there to laugh at The the baby said Alice sort of choking like for she was trying to talk and laugh at the same time Why should you laugh at a poor baby whom no one seems to know how to care for asked Uncle Wiggily Why I ask you Oh But look what it s turning into said Alice pointing The bunny uncle looked at what he held in his paws It was wiggling twisting and squirming in such a funny way squee geeing its dress all up around its face that for a moment Uncle Wiggily could not get a good look but when he did he cried My goodness me sakes alive and some bacon gravy It s a little pig And so it was As he held it the baby had turned into a tiny pig with a funny nose and half shut eyes Bless my rheumatism crutch cried Uncle Wiggily What made it do that Because it s that way in the book where I came from said Alice You read and you ll see that the baby which the Duchess gives me to hold turns into a little pig But she gave it to ME to hold cried Uncle Wiggily It s much the same thing spoke Alice As long as it s a pig it doesn t matter But dear me hum suz dud cried the bunny I don t want to be carrying around a little pig Of course I like pigs and I m very fond of my friends Curley and Floppy Twisty tail the little grunters But this baby pig And just as Uncle Wiggily said that who should come along but a bad old skillery scalery hump tailed alligator walking on his hind legs with his two front claws stretched out in front of him Ah ha cried the bad alligator who had promised to be good but who had not kept his word Ah ha At last I have caught you Uncle Wiggily and Wonderland Alice too He was just going to grab them when the little Baby Pig who had been squirming very hard all the while finally squirmed out of Uncle Wiggily s paws fell to the ground and then running right between the legs of the alligator as pigs always do run the squealing chap upset the bad unpleasant creature knocking him over in a frontward somersault and also backward peppersault down the steps Oh my goodness cried the skillery scalery alligator I m killed Which he wasn t at all but he thought so and this frightened him so much that he ran away and didn t catch Uncle Wiggily or Alice after all for which I m glad And if the puppy dog doesn t take all the bark off the sassafras tree and leave none for the pussy cat to polish her claws on I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Mock Turtle CHAPTER XI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MOCK TURTLE Oh Uncle Wiggily Will you please take me with you this morning asked a little voice somewhere down near the lower or floor end of the old rabbit gentleman s rheumatism crutch as mister Longears sat at the breakfast table in his hollow stump bungalow Please take me with you Well who are you and where do you want to be taken asked the bunny Oh I m Squeaky Eeky the little cousin mouse was the answer and I want you to take me with you on one of your walks so I can have an adventure as you do with Alice in Wonderland But perhaps I may not see Alice in Wonderland spoke Uncle Wiggily I do not always have that pleasure Well then perhaps we ll see the Baby or the Duchess or the Gryphon or some of the funny folk who make such jolly fun with you went on Squeaky Eeky I have a holiday from school today because they are painting the blackboards white and I d like to come with you Come along then cried Uncle Wiggily giving the little cousin mouse a bit of cheese cake with some lettuce sugar sprinkled over the top We ll see what sort of adventure happens today So calling good bye to Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper Uncle Wiggily and Squeaky Eeky started off over the fields and through the woods They had not gone very far before all at once as they walked along a little path under the trees they saw a funny thing lying near a clump of ferns It looked like a mud turtle at first but after peering at it through his glasses Uncle Wiggily saw that the larger part was made of a half round stone In front of that was part of a broken rubber ball and sticking out at the four corner places were four pieces of wood like little claws while at the back was a piece of an old leather boot My I wonder what in the world this can be said Uncle Wiggily surprised like Maybe it s something from Alice in Wonderland spoke Squeaky Eeky the cousin mouse You are right I am exclaimed a voice I am the Mock Turtle and I have just gotten out of the soup Oh I m so glad to meet you cried Squeaky I ve always wanted to see what a real mock turtle looked like ever since I read the book about Alice Hum grunted the queer creature There s no such thing as a real mock turtle any more than there is a make believe toothache I hope you never have that said Squeaky Eeky politely Thank you I don t care for any answered the Mock Turtle just as if the little cousin mouse had passed the cakes And then the turtle began to sing Speak gently to your toothache drops And do not let them fall And when you have the measle mumps They ll scarcely hurt at all Mine did said Squeaky Eeky wondering if this was what Alice would have answered But the Mock Turtle kept right on with Once a tramp was seated on A chair made out of cheese He ate the legs and then he fell Down with a terrible sneeze That isn t right said Squeaky Eeky It s a trap that was baited with a piece of cheese and Hush suddenly exclaimed the Mock Turtle Here he comes Who asked the little cousin mouse Do you mean the tramp Before the Mock Turtle could answer along came shuffling a big shaggy bear At first Uncle Wiggily and the little cousin mouse thought perhaps it was Neddie or Beckie Stubtail one of the good bear children but instead it was a bad old tramp sort of a bear the kind that goes about taking honey out of beehives Ah ha growled the bear A rabbit and a mouse That s fine for me I shall have a good dinner I m sure and he smacked his red tongue against his teeth Where will you get your dinner asked Uncle Wiggily curious like There is no restaurant or kitchen around here went on Squeaky Eeky Never you mind about that cried the bear I ll attend to you at dessert Just now I want Uncle Wiggily to come here and count how many teeth I have and he opened his mouth real wide the bear did Oh but I don t want to count your teeth said the poor bunny gentleman for well he knew what the bear s trick would be The bear wanted to bite Uncle Wiggily You must count my teeth growled the shaggy creature coming close to Uncle Wiggily No let me do it suddenly cried the Mock Turtle I am good at counting Well it doesn t make any difference who does it said the bear Then going close over to where the Mock Turtle sat on the path the bear opened wide his mouth And then just as he would have done to the rabbit gentleman the bear made a savage bite for the Mock Turtle But you know what happened Instead of biting on something good like a lollypop the bear bit on the hard stone of which the top part of Mock or Make Believe Turtle was made and the stone was so gritty and tough that the bear s teeth all broke off and then he couldn t bite even a jelly fish Oh wow Oh woe is me cried the bear as he ran to see if he could find a dentist to make him some false teeth And he didn t hurt me a bit laughed the Mock Turtle made of stone wood and leather who was built that way on purpose to fool bad bears and such like I don t mind in the least being bitten said the pretend turtle But you saved my life and Squeaky Eeky s too said Uncle Wiggily I thank you Then the Mock Turtle crawled away and the bunny and mousie girl had a fine time together And if the milk wagon doesn t go swimming down on the board walk with the watering cart and make the ice cream jump over the lollypop I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Lobster CHAPTER XII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOBSTER You ll be home to supper won t you asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she saw her friend Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman hopping down off the front porch of the hollow stump bungalow one morning Oh yes I ll be home he answered I m just going to look for a little adventure Then not having been on the board walk in quite a while Uncle Wiggily went down to the ocean seashore beach For said the old rabbit gentleman to himself I have not had a seashore adventure in some time And perhaps my friend Alice from Wonderland may be down there I know in her story book there are many curious things that happen near the sea So down to the shore went Uncle Wiggily and as he was walking along looking at the funny marks his feet made in the wet sand all of a sudden he came to a pile of damp green seaweed and from underneath it he heard a voice calling Oh help me out Please help me out Ha That sounds like some one in trouble Uncle Wiggily said I must help them Then with his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a lollypop stick the bunny poked away the seaweed and underneath it all tangled up so he could hardly move was a Lobster gentleman Oh it was so good of you to get me out said the Lobster as he gave a flip flap with his tail An old crab who doesn t like me piled the seaweed over my back as I was taking a nap in the sun My long thin legs were all tangled in it and even with my big pinching claws I could not get loose and I was so afraid I d be late Late for what asked Uncle Wiggily wondering where the Lobster was going To the dance the quadrille of course was the answer Oh now I remember said the bunny It s in the Wonderland Alice book You have to go to a dance don t you Exactly said the Lobster I d be pleased to have you come with me I will promised Uncle Wiggily thinking maybe he would have an adventure there So down the beach started the Lobster gentleman and the bunny uncle On and on they went for a long long time it seemed to Uncle Wiggily and it was getting quite late as he could tell by the star fish which were twinkling on the beach and still they had seen no signs of a dance I can t understand it said the Lobster Alice said I was to walk until I met her and she d take me to the party And we certainly have been walking a long time We have agreed Uncle Wiggily It is so late I m afraid I ll have to leave you and go home to supper as I promised Nurse Jane That s too bad went on the Lobster I wanted you to see how well I can dance on the end of my tail But I can t understand why we don t get to the quadrille We certainly have walked down the beach haven t we We have answered the bunny But Ah I have it Uncle Wiggily suddenly cried You have been walking BACKWARD and I have been following you We have been going away from the dance instead of toward it Of course cried the Lobster in a cold and clammy voice Why didn t I think of that before I always have to go backward on account of my claws being so heavy I have to pull them after me instead of pushing them ahead And so of course going backward as I do and as all Lobsters do when I want to get anywhere I always turn my back toward it and get to it that way This time I forgot to do that But what can we do now Uncle Wiggily wanted to know How can we get to the dance I ll just turn around and back up to it spoke the Lobster I m sorry to have mixed things up for you especially as you were so kind as to get me from under the pile of seaweed Oh don t worry laughed Uncle Wiggily jolly like I dare say it will be all right Come on So the lobster turned around and began to back toward where he hoped to find the dance It grew darker and darker and the star fish were twinkling more than ever and then all of a sudden they came to the hollow stump bungalow where Uncle Wiggily lived Hurray cried the Lobster Here we are at the quadrille Now I ll explain to Alice No this isn t the dance said Uncle Wiggily This is where I live But I d be pleased to have you come in to supper and we can go to the dance tomorrow I will cried the Lobster after thinking about it Into the hollow stump bungalow they went the Lobster backing in of course and Uncle Wiggily cried Supper for two if you please Nurse Jane Right away answered the muskrat lady And she began to set the table And then while Uncle Wiggily and the Lobster were talking together Nurse Jane called Oh dear I ve lost the can opener and I can t open this tin of peaches What shall I do Let me try begged Uncle Wiggily But his paws were not big enough I ll do it said the Lobster And with his strong pinching claws he punched open the can of peaches as easily as you can eat a chocolate cream drop It was no trouble at all for him So it was a good thing Uncle Wiggily brought the Lobster home for supper you see And if the stairs don t stand on their heads and with their toes tickle all the holes out of the lawn tennis nets I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Father William CHAPTER XIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND FATHER WILLIAM One morning soon after he had finished his breakfast having taken his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch down from behind the clock Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman started out from his hollow stump bungalow There were quite a few friends of the little girl named Alice in Wonderland whom he had not yet met and he hoped to have an adventure with one of them So tossing up in the air his tall silk stovepipe hat and letting it bounce three times on the end of his pink nose Uncle Wiggily hurried off The rabbit gentleman had not gone very far over the fields and through the woods before he saw something very strange indeed This something was what seemed to be a funny sort of flower vase with two things sticking up in it and on the end of them were two shoes My goodness me sakes alive and some chocolate cake pudding cried the surprised bunny uncle What s this Then as he looked again he saw a funny face and a pair of bright eyes looking at him from the bottom part of what seemed to be a flower vase Why it s a man cried Uncle Wiggily Of course I m a man was the jolly answer But don t be afraid of me I m not a hunter man And you you re standing on your head went on Uncle Wiggily more surprised than ever Of course I m standing on my head said the funny man I have to do that to make things come out as they do in the Alice in Wonderland book I m Father William you know and with that he gave a nimble spring turned a back somersault putting himself right side up and began to recite this verse You are old Father William the Young Man said And your hair has become very white But yet you incessantly stand on your head Do you think at your age that is right But is it asked Uncle Wiggily quickly as soon as funny Father William had ceased speaking Of course it is was the answer Otherwise it wouldn t be in the book and I wouldn t do it At first it came very hard to me but now I can easily manage And you ll find you get quite a different view of things looking at them upside down as I do every now and then he went on I wonder if I could stand on my head spoke Uncle Wiggily Try it said Father William I d like to went on the bunny uncle But I might crush my tall silk hat Take it off suggested Father William Yes I could do that But suppose some one were to see me asked the bunny It would look sort of queer No one will see you here behind the trees spoke Father William Besides if they do learning to stand on one s head is very useful There is no telling when you may want to do it at home That s so agreed Uncle Wiggily Well I ll try At first he couldn t stand up on his head at all just turning over in a sort of flip flop every time he tried But at last Father William held up the bunny rabbit by the heels and then Uncle Wiggily did it better After a while he could stand straight right side up on his hind paws give a little wiggle and then suddenly with a funny twist and a somersault flop there he was standing on his head with his silk hat twirling around on his upper paws And Father William could do the same thing If you had happened to walk through the woods when Uncle Wiggily and Father William who had a little holiday from the Alice book were standing on their heads surely you would have laughed And now that I have learned a new trick I must go look for an adventure said the bunny I ll go with you spoke Father William Together they went along through the woods and over the fields and all of a sudden from behind a currant jam bush out jumped a bad old double jointed skillery scalery alligator Ah ha cried the alligator At last I have caught some one to whom I can do it Ah ha Do what asked Uncle Wiggily while Father William looked around for a place to hide What are you going to do Tickle your feet was the surprising answer I am the ticklish alligator and feet I must tickle Get ready now here I come Oh dear cried Father William I never can bear to have my feet tickled For when that happens I laugh and then I sneeze and then I catch cold and have to go to bed Oh dear I don t want my feet tickled Hush whispered Uncle Wiggily as the gator was hopping toward them You won t have to suffer that Quick Stand on your head as you taught me to and hold your feet up in the air And in the twinkle of a spiced pear Uncle Wiggily and Father William were standing on their heads The surprised alligator saw them and after trying to reach their feet with his claws which he couldn t do as they were up in the air he cried Ah ha Thought you d fool me didn t you by standing on your heads Well I ll tickle your feet after all I ll climb a tree and reach down to them Oh dear He ll make me catch cold no matter what I do sighed Father William No he won t said Uncle Wiggily The alligator is very good at climbing up trees but it takes him ever so long to climb down As soon as he climbs up we ll stop standing on our heads We ll flip flop to our feet and run away And that s exactly what the bunny and Father William did As soon as the alligator was up in the tree branches they turned a flip flop stood up straight and away they ran and the alligator was all day getting down out of the tree So he didn t tickle their feet after all but he might have if Uncle Wiggily had not learned to stand on his head And if the ice wagon doesn t slide down hill and throw snowballs at the potato pudding in the parlor I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the magic bottles CHAPTER XIV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MAGIC BOTTLES Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman was hopping along through the woods one morning after having eaten breakfast in his hollow stump bungalow when just as he reached a nice grassy place near a spring of water he saw the little flaxen haired girl Alice from Wonderland coming toward him Oh I m so glad to see you cried Alice You are just in time to win the first prize She handed the gentleman rabbit a little bottle filled with what seemed to be water and stoppered with a blue cork First prize for what asked Uncle Wiggily For getting here early answered Alice And you also get second prize too and she handed him another bottle stoppered with a red cork Why do I get second prize asked the bunny For not being late answered Alice with a smile It is very simple First prize for being early second prize for not being late Hum said Uncle Wiggily sort of scratching his pink twinkling nose thoughtful like It s much the same thing it seems to me Not at all said Alice quickly The prizes are very different Those bottles are magical They are filled with water from the pool of tears If you drink a few drops from the one with the blue cork you will grow very small And if you take some of the water from the red stoppered bottle you will grow very large Be careful of your prizes I will promised Uncle Wiggily Are there any others coming he asked looking about through the trees Any others coming where inquired Alice Here I mean might they have gotten prizes too No only you said the flaxen haired girl You were the only one expected But spoke the puzzled bunny rabbit if I was the only one expected what was the use of giving prizes No one else could have gotten here ahead of me could they Please don t ask me begged Alice All I know is that it s one of the riddles like those the March Hare asks such as What makes the mirror look crooked at you The answer is it doesn t if you don t In this case you get the prizes because there is no one else to give them to So take them and have an adventure I have to go see what the Duchess wants With that Alice faded away like the Cheshire Cat beginning at her head and ending up at her feet the last things to go being the buttons on her shoes Well said Uncle Wiggily to himself I have two prizes it seems of magic bottles I wonder what I am to do with them He looked at the red and blue corked bottles holding one in each paw and he was wondering whether it would be best to grow small or large when all at once he felt himself caught from behind by a pair of big claws and looking over his shoulder as best he could Uncle Wiggily saw that he was held fast by a big alligator a skillery scalery chap with a double jointed tail that he could swing back and forth like a pantry door Ah ha I have you gurgled the gator Yes I see you have said Uncle Wiggily sadly You thought you and Father William would fool me by standing on your heads so I couldn t tickle your feet went on the gator as I call him for short But I got down out of the tree and here I am I have you now and you can t get away from me Indeed it did seem so for he held Uncle Wiggily very tight and fast in his claws What are you going to do with me asked the rabbit Take you home to my den and my dear little foxes Eight Nine and Ten said the alligator Foxes cried Uncle Wiggily Have you foxes I have answered the alligator I am keeping them until their father gets back from a hunting trip and they are very hungry Their father is the fox who went out in a hungry plight and he begged of the moon to give him light for he d many miles to go that night before he could reach his den O Oh now I remember said Uncle Wiggily It s in Mother Goose Yes and so is the rest of it went on the alligator At last the fox reached home to his den and his dear little foxes Eight Nine Ten Those are their names though they sound like numbers said the gator I ll soon introduce you to them Come along Now Uncle Wiggily did not like this at all He wanted to get away from the alligator but he did not know how he could do it At last he thought of the magical bottles Alice had given him Ah ha thought Uncle Wiggily I ll give the alligator a drink from the blue corked one and we ll see what happens So Uncle Wiggily slyly said to the gator Before you take me off to your den would you not like a drink from this bottle to refresh you Yes I would said the skillery scalery creature not at all politely I was going to take some anyhow whether you asked me or not With that he took the blue corked bottle from the paw of the bunny rabbit gentleman pulled out the stopper with his teeth and drank a few drops And no sooner had he done that than the alligator began to shrink First he became as small as a dog then as little as a cat then as tiny as a kitten then no larger than a bird and finally he was no bigger than a baby angle worm And when the alligator became that size Uncle Wiggily was not afraid and easily got away from him taking the two magic bottles Oh dear cried the gator in a baby angle worm voice which was about as loud as the head of a pin How foolish I was to drink from the magic bottle and grow small But it served him right I think and the bunny uncle was safe And if the head of the table doesn t step on the front door mat and make it slide off the porch I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the croquet ball CHAPTER XV UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CROQUET BALL Why in the world are you taking those bottles with you asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as she saw Uncle Wiggily the bunny rabbit gentleman hopping off the front porch of his hollow stump bungalow one morning These are the prizes which Alice from Wonderland gave me answered mister Longears as he looked at the blue and red corked bottles The red one makes things grow larger and the blue one makes them smaller I am going to take them with me as I go looking for an adventure today as there is no telling when I might need them I did yesterday when the alligator caught me I gave him a drink from the blue bottle and he shrunk until he was no larger than a baby angle worm The rabbit gentleman had not gone very far twinkling his pink nose as he hopped before all of a sudden he came to a place where a big stone grew out of the ground and near it he heard a voice saying Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear Ha That sounds like trouble exclaimed the bunny Who are you and what is the matter he asked kindly Oh I am a Lady Bug was the answer and I am so small that I either get lost all the while or all the other animals and bugs in the forest step on me Oh I wish I were larger so I could be more easily seen Indeed you are rather hard to see said Uncle Wiggily and he had to look twice through his glasses before he could notice the Lady Bug At the first look he only half saw her but the second time he saw her fully I d like to be about as large as a June Beetle said the Lady Bug But I don t s pose I ever shall be Oh yes you will cried jolly Uncle Wiggily I will How asked the Lady Bug eagerly I have here some water in a magic bottle said the bunny I ll give you a few drops of it and it will make you grow larger So he took some water from the red corked flask and let the Lady Bug sip it Instantly she grew as large as a turkey Oh now I m too big she said I see you are said Uncle Wiggily I ll have to give you some from the other bottle and make you grow smaller So he did but he must have given a little too much for the Lady Bug suddenly grew as small as the point of a baby pin Oh this is worse and worse she said sadly I know it agreed Uncle Wiggily Wait I ll give you a little of both kinds and he did so the Lady Bug grew to the size of a small potato which was just right so she would not get lost or stepped on After the Lady Bug had thanked him Uncle Wiggily with his two magical bottles hopped on through the woods He had not gone very far before he saw Alice of Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts playing croquet on a grassy place Come on Uncle Wiggily called Alice You re just in time for the game Fine said the bunny uncle taking a mallet and round wooden ball which the Queen handed him Three strikes and you go out warned the Queen What does she mean asked Uncle Wiggily of Alice This isn t baseball She means explained the little flaxen haired girl that if you miss striking the croquet ball three times with your mallet you have to go out and bring in some ice cream Oh I shan t mind that the bunny rabbit said In fact I shall rather like it Now what do I do Play ball suddenly cried the Queen of Hearts and she struck with her mallet the croquet ball near her such a hard blow that it sailed through the air and hit Uncle Wiggily in the coat tails And then something cracked All at once the croquet ball began growing larger Bigger and bigger it grew like a snowball which you roll in the yard and then it began to roll after Uncle Wiggily Down the croquet ground the big wooden ball chased after him rolling closer and closer Oh my cried the Queen of Hearts What have I done The ball cracked the magical red stoppered bottle that was in my coat tail pocket cried Uncle Wiggily over his shoulder as he ran Some of the magic big growing water spilled on the ball and now it has turned into a giant Oh it will crush me And really it did seem as though the big croquet ball would for now it was as large as a house and still growing so strong was the water in the magical bottle that had been broken Larger and larger grew the croquet ball and faster and faster it rolled after Uncle Wiggily It was almost on his heels now and the bunny gentleman was running so fast that his tall silk hat flew off Oh what shall I do he cried Alice thought for a minute then she called Quick Uncle Wiggily Take out the blue corked bottle and sprinkle some of that water on the croquet ball Hurry now Uncle Wiggily did As he ran he turned and threw back over his shoulder some of the blue bottle water on the big rolling croquet ball And all at once just as the alligator had done the croquet ball shrank and shrank until it was no larger than a boy s marble and then it couldn t hurt Uncle Wiggily even if it did roll on him But it is a good thing he had that bottle of shrinking water with him isn t it And if the expressman doesn t take the baby carriage to ride the trunk down to the five and ten cent store to buy a new piano I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Do do CHAPTER XVI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DO DO I declare exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper for Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman I declare I ll never get it done never What asked Uncle Wiggily What won t you get done All this housework answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy You see going over to call on missus Bushytail the squirrel lady last night I didn t wash the supper dishes and now I have them to do and also the breakfast dishes and the sweeping and dusting and I ought to bake a cake and mend some of your socks and Whoa called Uncle Wiggily with a jolly laugh as though he had spoken to Munchie Trot the pony That s enough Don t say any more You have too much work to do And I m worried about it said Nurse Jane Don t be advised the rabbit gentleman I ll stay and help you do it No said Nurse Jane Thank you just the same but I d rather you wouldn t stay around the hollow stump bungalow when there is so much to do You might get in my way and I d step on you That would give me the fidgets It is very kind of you but if you ll go off and have an adventure I think that will be best Just as you say agreed Uncle Wiggily But I d like to help Can t I bring you a diamond dishpan or a gold wash rag from the five and ten cent store No Hop along with you laughed Nurse Jane I dare say I ll manage somehow So Uncle Wiggily hopped along over the fields and through the woods and then he suddenly said to himself I know what I ll do I ll play a little trick on Nurse Jane She shouldn t spend so much time in the kitchen A little is all right but there is too much trouble about housework Here I go off and have an adventure and she has to slop around in dishwater It isn t right Then the rabbit gentleman hopped along until he came to a woodland telephone made from a trumpet vine flower and into that he called speaking right into his own hollow stump bungalow and to Nurse Jane Oh Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy called Uncle Wiggily Can you come over to missus Wibblewobble s duck house right away Why yes I can answered the muskrat lady though I have a lot of work to do What is the matter I ll tell you when you get there said the voice of Uncle Wiggily pretending he was missus Wibblewobble the duck lady Then he called up missus Wibblewobble herself told her how he had fooled Nurse Jane and asked the duck lady when the muskrat lady housekeeper came to keep her talking and visiting as long as she could And while Nurse Jane is at your house missus Wibblewobble said Uncle Wiggily over the trumpet vine telephone I ll run around the back way to the hollow stump bungalow and do all the work That will be a nice surprise for Nurse Jane the duck lady said Uncle Wiggily guessed so too and when he thought Nurse Jane was safely at missus Wibblewobble s house he went to the bungalow He took off his tall silk hat laid aside his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch and began with the dishes There was a large pile of them but Uncle Wiggily was brave When I was a soldier I fought a great many more mosquitoes than there are dishes here he said I will make believe the plates cups and saucers are the enemy and I will charge on them and souse them And Uncle Wiggily did with a cake of soap for a gun and washing powder to fire with But still and with all there were many dishes and when he thought of the beds to make the sweeping and dusting to be done and the socks to mend Uncle Wiggily said Oh dear What s the matter asked a voice behind him and turning he saw Alice from Wonderland With her was a queer bird which had a tail like that of a mouse Oh I m glad to see you said Uncle Wiggily But I can t go and have an adventure with you Alice as I have to do all these dishes Then I have to do the sweeping and do the dusting and do That s enough laughed Alice There are too many Do dos I am just in time I see My friend will help you and she pointed to the queer bird What cried Uncle Wiggily Can he do dishes He can do anything laughed Alice He is the Do do bird and all I have to do is to pinch his tail and he will work very fast Doesn t it hurt him asked Uncle Wiggily What to work fast Alice wanted to know No to pinch his tail Not in the least answered Alice He s used to it The only trouble is I have to keep on pinching it to make him do things and that means I have to keep my finger and thumb on his tail all the while and follow him around Now we ll begin to do things dear Do do and she pinched the bird s tail At once the bird began to wash dishes and soon they were all done and then when the Do do started to do the beds Uncle Wiggily thought of a new plan As long as you have to pinch his tail said the bunny to Alice I ll get Nurse Jane s hair curlers You can snap them on his tail and they ll keep pinching on it and pinching on it all the while and you and I can go take a walk Fine cried Alice So with the hair curlers pinching his tail the Do do bird quickly did all the bungalow housework and Uncle Wiggily and Alice had a fine walk And when Nurse Jane came home from missus Wibblewobble s and found the work all done she was very happy And so was the Do do for he loved to do dishes And if the teacup doesn t try to hide in the milk pitcher where the bread crumbs can t tickle it when they play tag with the butter knife I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Lory CHAPTER XVII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LORY Once upon a time the skillery scalery alligator was out walking in the fields near the muddy river where he lived and he happened to meet a big spider Good morning mister Alligator said mister Spider Have you caught that Uncle Wiggily Longears bunny yet I have not I am sorry to say answered the alligator chap I ve tried every way I know how but something always happens so that he gets away Either he is helped by that funny book girl Alice from Wonderland or by some of her friends I m afraid I ll never catch Uncle Wiggily Oh yes you will said mister Spider I ll help you How asked the gator which was his short name though he was rather long I ll crawl through the woods and over the fields until I find him asleep said mister Spider And when I do I ll spin a strong web around and over him so he cannot get loose Then I ll come and tell you and you can get him Very good spoke mister Alligator Please do it So the alligator went back to sleep in the mud to wait until mister Spider should bring him word that Uncle Wiggily was held fast in the web And now let us see what happens to the bunny gentleman As he always did he started out from his hollow stump bungalow one morning to look for an adventure There had been a little accident at breakfast time Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper had boiled the eggs too long and they were as hard as bullets You can t eat them she said to Uncle Wiggily I ll boil you some fresh ones All right laughed the bunny I don t want to get indyspepsia by eating hard bullet eggs But I ll take them with me and give them to Johnnie or Billie Bushytail the squirrel boys They can crack hard nuts so they must be able to crack hard boiled eggs So it was that Uncle Wiggily after having eaten the newly boiled soft eggs started from his hollow stump bungalow with the hard boiled eggs in his pocket He had not traveled very far before he heard from behind a big log a voice crying Oh dear It isn t hard enough It isn t half hard enough What isn t asked Uncle Wiggily as he saw a funny looking bird with a very large bill like a parrot s What isn t hard enough This log of wood was the answer I need something hard to bite on to sharpen my beak but this wood is too soft You are a funny bird laughed the bunny gentleman Who might you be I am the Lory bird was the answer I belong in the book with Alice of Wonderland but I m out for a day s pleasure and as I can t tell what I might have to eat I thought I d sharpen my bill But I can t find anything hard enough to use as a grindstone Suppose you try these said Uncle Wiggily taking the hard boiled eggs out of his pocket The very thing cried the Lory These will be fine for my bill With that he champed his beak down on the hard eggs and he had all he could do to bite them Now I ll get my beak good and sharp said Lory You have done me a great favor Uncle Wiggily and I hope some day to do you one Pray do not mention it said the bunny rabbit modest like and shy Then having found a good use for the hard boiled eggs even if he didn t give them to the Bushytail squirrel boys Uncle Wiggily hopped along and the Lory kept on biting the shells for practice Now it was a warm day and as Uncle Wiggily felt tired he sat down in a shady place in the fields and soon fell fast asleep And no sooner was he in Dreamland than along came mister Spider Ah ha said the spider Now s my chance to catch this bunny for the alligator I ll spin a strong web around him so strong that he cannot break loose Then I ll go get my friend the gator So while Uncle Wiggily slept mister Spider spun a strong web about the bunny a very extra strong web with such big strands that Uncle Wiggily never could have broken them himself And when the web was all finished and the bunny was helpless he awakened just as mister Spider was going off to call mister Alligator Oh what has happened to me cried the bunny as he found he could not move his paws or even twinkle his pink nose Oh what is it Let me go No you can t go said the spider You are going to stay there until I bring mister Alligator and away he crawled Uncle Wiggily tried to get loose but he could not Oh if only some one would come who s good and strong and would cut this web then I would be free said the bunny And then all of a sudden out from behind the bush came the Four and Twenty Tailors from Mother Goose They had their big scissors with them and they were led by Alice of Wonderland I told these silly tailors I d help them hunt the snail because they are so timid that they even fear her tail laughed Alice but we ll stop and help you first dear Uncle Wiggily Then the Four and Twenty Tailors with their shears sniped and snapped the strong spider s web until it was all in pieces and the bunny could easily get loose And when the alligator fetched by the spider came to get the bunny he wasn t there But the strong billed Lory bird was there He had heard about Uncle Wiggily s trouble from the Do do bird and had come with his strong bill to bite the spider web into little pieces But I am too late I see said the Lory The Mother Goose Tailors got here first However as I want to bite something hard and mean I ll bite the alligator And he did and the alligator said Ouch and I m glad of it And if the telephone bell doesn t ring at the front door and make believe it s the milkman looking for old rags I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the puppy CHAPTER XVIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PUPPY Oh Uncle Wiggily Oh Uncle Wiggily Oh Uncle Wiggily called Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the two doggie boys as they ran barking up to the hollow stump bungalow one morning Well well What s the matter now asked Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman as he came out on the porch Oh we ve got a baby over at our house cried Jackie Come and see it barked Peetie A baby At your house exclaimed Uncle Wiggily Well a little puppy dog said Jackie That s the same to us as a real baby is to real persons To be sure agreed the bunny uncle I ll come over and see the new baby puppy and putting on his tall silk hat and taking down his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch from the electric light mister Longears started away over the fields to the kennel house where the Bow Wow dog family lived There s the new baby puppy cried Jackie as he poked away the straw from the bed where something was moving about I why bless my spectacles I can hardly see him said Uncle Wiggily taking off his glasses to polish them for he thought maybe he had splashed some carrot oatmeal on them at breakfast and that they were clouded over He s so small that s why you can t see him spoke Peetie But he ll soon grow big like us Uncle Wiggily Let us hope so spoke the bunny uncle He s so small now I d be afraid of stepping on him if I lived here He s got awful cute eyes said Peetie They aren t open yet but I can pull em apart a little bit to show you they re going to be blue color I guess and Peetie began opening the shut eyes of his little baby brother puppy Of course the puppy whined and missus Bow Wow called Now what are you boys doing to that baby Nothing ma answered Jackie We re jest pokin open his eyes so Uncle Wiggily can see em answered Peetie Oh you doggie boys cried missus Bow Wow You mustn t do that I m glad Uncle Wiggily came to see our baby but now you run out and play Peetie and Jackie while I visit with mister Longears So the doggie boys ran out to play with Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrels and missus Bow Wow told Uncle Wiggily what a nice baby Wuff Wuff was Wuff Wuff was the new puppy s name I m sure he ll grow up to be a fine dog said the bunny Just then the telephone bell in the kennel house rang and when missus Bow Wow answered she said after listening awhile Oh dear This is your friend Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy talking to me She wants me to come over to show her how to make a strawberry longcake as there is a lot of company coming for supper A short cake won t be large enough Are you going to my hollow stump bungalow asked Uncle Wiggily I d like to only I can t leave Baby Wuff Wuff said missus Bow Wow Oh I ll stay and take care of him said the bunny uncle I think I can do it and it may be an adventure for me Trot along missus Bow Wow Very well I will If Wuff Wuff gets hungry just give him some milk from this bottle and she handed a nursing one to Uncle Wiggily So missus Bow Wow went over to help Nurse Jane the muskrat lady housekeeper make the longcake and the bunny man stayed with the puppy baby Uncle Wiggily sat in the kennel house while the little doggie nestled in the straw The bunny rabbit was just wondering who the company could be that were coming to his bungalow when all of a sudden there was a big noise outside the kennel and a big voice cried Now I know you re in there Uncle Wiggily for I saw you hop in with Jackie and Peetie And I know they re gone for I saw them go out And I know missus Bow Wow is out So you re there all alone and I m going to get you And Uncle Wiggily saw the big skillery scalery alligator standing outside the door Oh my thought the bunny rabbit gentleman He ll surely get me this time for he can knock the kennel house apart with one flip flap of his double jointed tail But maybe if I keep real still he will think I m gone So Uncle Wiggily snuggled down in the straw with the baby puppy but the alligator cried Oh I know you re there and I m going to get you Oh if only this puppy was a big strong dog like Nero thought Uncle Wiggily he could save me from the alligator Just then the puppy began to whine and the bunny rabbit said Oh don t do that Wuff Wuff Don t whine and make a noise or the alligator will get you too But the puppy baby still whined for he was hungry Uncle Wiggily picked up a bottle and put the end of it in Wuff Wuff s mouth Here drink that said the bunny Then you won t be hungry The puppy baby did so and then something very strange happened The little puppy suddenly began growing very large First he was the size of mister Bow Wow and then he swelled up until he was as big as a horse and had to get out of the kennel house for fear of bursting off the roof And when the alligator saw the great big puppy dog like the one in Alice of Wonderland suddenly standing in front of him mister Gator just gave one flip of his tail and away he ran crying Oh my I didn t know an elephant was there to save Uncle Wiggily But there wasn t It was only the puppy who had suddenly grown big For by mistake instead of giving him the bottle of milk the bunny rabbit gave him some of the water from the magical red stoppered big growing bottle that Alice from Wonderland had sent the bunny It had been mended after the croquet ball broke it And after the puppy had scared away the alligator Uncle Wiggily gave Wuff Wuff some water from the magical blue stoppered bottle and shrunk him to his regular baby size and everybody was happy And if the fairy tale doesn t waggle itself all around the book case and scare all the big words out of the dictionary I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Unicorn CHAPTER XIX UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE UNICORN Well you look just as if you were going somewhere Uncle Wiggily said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper as the rabbit gentleman whizzed around the corner of his hollow stump bungalow in his automobile with the bologna sausage tires one morning I am going somewhere he answered and really he was for the wheels were whizzing around like anything And going where may I ask politely inquired the muskrat lady I am going to give Alice a ride answered Uncle Wiggily Alice from Wonderland I mean She never has ridden in an automobile She never has cried Nurse Jane in surprise Never You see when she was put in that nice book which tells so much about her there weren t any autos and of course she never could have had a ride in one But she had ever so many other nice adventures such as going down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass However I promised her a ride in my auto and here I go to give it to her and with that Uncle Wiggily sprinkled some pepper and salt on the sausage tires of his auto s wheels to make them go faster The rabbit gentleman found Alice the little book girl in the White Queen s garden having a make believe tea party with the Mock Turtle who soon would have to go into the five o clock soup Oh how kind of you to come for me Uncle Wiggily cried Alice and she jumped up so quickly that she overturned the multiplication table at which she and the Mock Turtle had been sitting and ran to jump in the auto Well I don t call that very nice said the Mock Turtle Here she s gone and mixed up the seven times table with the three times six and goodness knows when I ll ever get them straightened out again I m sorry called Alice waving her hand as she rode off with Uncle Wiggily I ll help you when I come back And I ll help too promised the bunny uncle mister Longears and Wonderland Alice rode over the fields and through the woods and they were having a fine time when all of a sudden as the automobile came near a place where some oak trees grew in a thick cluster Alice cried Hark They re fighting Who asked Uncle Wiggily Please don t tell me it is the mosquito enemy coming after me to bite me No it s the Lion and the Unicorn Alice answered Don t you remember how it goes in my book The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the Crown The Lion beat the Unicorn all around the town Some gave them white bread some gave them brown And then the funny Unicorn jumped right up and down That last line isn t just right explained Alice to the bunny uncle but I couldn t properly think of it I m so frightened Frightened At what asked Uncle Wiggily At the Unicorn answered Alice Here he comes and as she said that Uncle Wiggily saw a funny animal like a horse with a big long horn sticking out of the middle of his head straight in front of him galloping out of the clump of trees Hurray I beat him cried the Unicorn Come on now quick I must get away from here before they catch me You beat him Do you mean beat the Lion asked Uncle Wiggily for he was not frightened as was Alice Sure I beat him answered the Unicorn as he jumped into the back seat of the automobile Drive on he ordered just as if the bunny uncle gentleman were the coachman Did you beat him very hard with a broomstick asked Alice putting out her head from behind Uncle Wiggily s tall silk hat where she had hidden herself Beat him with a broomstick Ha Ha I should say not laughed the Unicorn We re too jolly good friends for that and he spoke like an English chap I beat him playing hop Scotch and Jack straws I was two hops and three straws ahead of him when I stopped and ran away because they were after me Who were after you asked Alice The lion s friends No the straws that show which way the wind blows When the wind blows the straws against me they tickle and I can t bear to be tickled I m worse than a soap bubble that way So I ran to get in the auto I hope you don t mind and the Unicorn leaned back on the seat cushions Mind Not in the least cried Uncle Wiggily I m glad to give you a ride with Alice and he made the auto go very fast On and on they went over the fields and through the woods and then all of a sudden out from behind a tree jumped the big skillery scalery alligator walking on his hind legs and the end of his double jointed tail Halt he cried like a sentry soldier and Uncle Wiggily stopped the auto At last I have caught you said the alligator in a nutmeg grater sort of a voice I want you Uncle Wiggily and that Alice girl also As for your friend in the back seat he may go Oh may I Thank you cried the Unicorn and with that he leaned forward And as he did so the long sharp horn in his head reached over Uncle Wiggily s shoulder and began to tickle the alligator right under his soft ribs Oh stop Stop it I tell you giggled the gator Stop tickling me and he laughed and wiggled and squirmed like an angle worm going fishing Stop Stop he begged I will when you let my friends Uncle Wiggily and Alice alone said the Unicorn still tickling away Yes Yes I ll let them alone promised the alligator and he laughed until the tears ran down his tail And then he had to run off by himself through the woods and so he didn t get the bunny uncle nor Wonderland Alice either And he never could have gotten the Unicorn because of his long ticklish horn So it is sometimes a good thing to take one of these stickery chaps along when you go for an automobile ride And if the skyrocket doesn t fall down and stub its nose when it tries to jump over the moon with the crumpled horn cow I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Humpty Dumpty CHAPTER XX UNCLE WIGGILY AND HUMPTY DUMPTY Excuse me spoke a gentle voice behind Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper who was cleaning the steps of the hollow stump bungalow one morning Excuse me but can Uncle Wiggily be out to play Be out to play repeated Nurse Jane Do you mean play with you and the muskrat lady turned to see a little girl with flaxen hair standing at the foot of the steps Yes play with me if you please said the little girl I m Alice from Wonderland you know and Uncle Wiggily and I had such a jolly time yesterday when the Unicorn tickled the alligator and made him laugh that I d like to go off with him again With whom the alligator asked Nurse Jane No with Uncle Wiggily laughed Alice Where is he Here I am Alice I ve just finished breakfast answered the bunny rabbit gentleman himself as he came out on the front bungalow steps Are you ready for another auto ride Indeed I am thank you And as tomorrow is a holiday I don t have any school today That s funny said Uncle Wiggily twinkling his pink nose What holiday is it The Fourth of July answered Alice Have you forgotten Even though I am an English girl I know what it means Your boys and girls shoot off lollypops bang ice cream cones and light red white and blue candy Candy I guess you mean candles laughed Uncle Wiggily However you re right It is the Fourth of July tomorrow and whereas years ago we used to shoot off firecrackers when many children were burned now we have a nicer holiday We go off in the woods and gather flowers Why do you know cried the bunny uncle there are flowers just right for Fourth of July There are puff balls that are as good as torpedoes and snap dragons that open their mouths and make believe bite you and there are dogwood flowers that bark and red sumach which is just the color of firecrackers Then let s go off in the woods and have Fourth of July there proposed Alice and soon she and the bunny uncle were in the automobile And then along came Sammie and Susie Littletail the rabbit children and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrels and Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the puppy dogs Oh Uncle Wiggily cried these animal boys and girls Take us with you for Fourth of July Of course I shall promised the bunny gentleman so they all got in the automobile with him and Wonderland Alice and away they went They had not gone very far before all of a sudden they came to a stone wall and when Alice saw something on top of it she cried Why there s my old friend Humpty Dumpty I must stop and speak to him or he ll think I m proud and she waved her hands Why that that s nothing but an egg said Sammie It s like the ones I colored for Easter when the skilli gimink dye splashed all over me That isn t Humpty Dumpty at all it s an egg Hush whispered Susie Humpty Dumpty is an egg of course but he doesn t like to be told of it Don t you know the little verse Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall All the King s horses and all the King s men Couldn t put Humpty Dumpty together again That s right said Alice from Wonderland Only don t speak of the fall before Humpty He doesn t like to be reminded of it I don t see why spoke Jackie Bow Wow He can t hear a word we say He s only an egg he hasn t any ears He really isn t dressed yet said Alice It s a bit early But I ll soon make him look more human With that she jumped out of the auto and taking two ears of corn from a field nearby she fastened them with silk from the cob one on each side of the egg Now he can hear said Alice Then with tulip flowers she made Humpty a mouth and from a potato she took two eyes so the egg could see A comb made him as nice teeth as one could wish for and they never ached and for a nose she took out a cute little bottle of perfumery I think that s a queer nose said Johnnie Bushytail frisking his tail Well a bottle of perfumery smells doesn t it asked Alice and that s what a nose is especially for smells Indeed it is cried Humpty Dumpty in his jolly voice speaking through the tulips I m all made now I only hope And then he suddenly turned pale for he nearly fell off the wall Has any one any powder he asked I think I d like to clean my teeth I have some talcum spoke Lulu Wibblewobble the duck girl coming along just then That will do spoke Humpty Dumpty It will be just fine And with a brush made from the end of a soft fern he began to clean his teeth with the talcum powder which Lulu gave him And then all of a sudden there was a loud noise a puff of smoke and Humpty Dumpty the egg man was seen sailing off through the air like a big white balloon Well this is better than falling off the wall he cried in a faint voice Oh my What happened asked Sammie Littletail trying to make his pink nose twinkle as Uncle Wiggily did his Humpty Dumpty was blown up instead of falling down said Alice I guess your talcum powder was too strong for him Lulu my dear And it being the Fourth of July tomorrow Humpty wanted to give us some fireworks So he s gone but I m glad he wasn t broken for if he was the way the book has it when he falls off the wall all the King s horses and all the King s men couldn t put him together again Maybe it is best as it is But after a while Humpty Dumpty sailed back again not hurt a bit and he sat on the wall as well as ever Then Alice and Uncle Wiggily and the animal boys and girls had fun in the woods And if the pink pills don t hide in the green bottle and pretend they re peppermint candy for the rag doll I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the looking glass CHAPTER XXI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOOKING GLASS A package came for you while you were out adventuring today said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat lady housekeeper to Uncle Wiggily Longears the bunny rabbit gentleman as he hopped down the stairs of the hollow stump bungalow to breakfast one morning I wonder what s in it asked the bunny as he put a slice of carrot jam on his bread and held it over the lettuce coffee to have it flavored I don t know You ll have to open it to find out answered Nurse Jane It is marked Glass With Care Uncle Wiggily was so eager and excited like that he could not wait to finish his breakfast but quickly opened the package which mister Hummingbird the lightning express messenger had left at the bungalow early that morning It s a looking glass exclaimed the bunny uncle when he saw what it was And it s from Alice in Wonderland at least she used to live in Wonderland before she came to Woodland to have adventures with me And there s a note with it spoke Nurse Jane as she saw a piece of white birch bark with writing on it the letters having been made with a burned stick which marks black like a lead pencil Yes it s a little letter said Uncle Wiggily as he read it And it s from Alice It says Dear Uncle Wiggily I send you the Looking Glass I once went through and on the other side I had many adventures I wish you the same That s queer said the bunny as he turned the glass over and looked at the back I don t see any hole where Alice went through Maybe it closed up after her the same as fairy doors always close once you pass through explained Nurse Jane I believe you are right said Uncle Wiggily But this is a very small glass for a girl like Alice to get through and indeed the glass was one of the kind you hold in your hand Maybe the glass was larger when Alice went through it said Nurse Jane or else perhaps she had taken some drops from the magic bottle and grew small like a rubber doll I guess that was it agreed Uncle Wiggily Anyhow it is very kind of her to send me the looking glass I may have an adventure with it I ll take it out on the front steps and then we ll see what happens next So having finished his breakfast the bunny went out on the bungalow porch and sat with the looking glass in his paw waiting for something to happen He sat there and sat there and sat there and he was just beginning to wonder if anything would happen when all of a sudden there was a rustling in the bushes and up on the porch popped a bad old skillery scalery alligator with bumps all down the middle of his back like the buttons on a lady s dress Ah ha I am just in time I see exclaimed the gator For what asked Uncle Wiggily suddenly awakening for he had fallen into a little sleep while he waited for an adventure to happen with the looking glass In time for what To go away with you answered the alligator But I am not going away said the bunny At least I did not know I was going and he looked around rather sad and lonesome for he did not like the bad alligator and he wanted to see Uncle Wiggily did if brave Nurse Jane Fuzzy would not come out and throw cold water on him on the alligator I mean to drive him away But the muskrat lady had gone to the store to get some cheese for supper I am not going away said Uncle Wiggily again Oh yes you are exclaimed the alligator and he smiled in such a way that it seemed as though the whole top of his head would pop off so large was the smile You may not know it but you are going away Uncle Wiggily With whom asked the bunny With me answered the gator We are going away together I came on purpose to fetch you Come along and with that the bad alligator wound his double jointed tail around the bunny uncle s ears lifted him out of the rocking chair and started to walk off the bungalow porch with him Oh stop it cried Uncle Wiggily Let me go Let me go No No barked the alligator like a dog I ll not let you go now I have you and he started to drag the bunny uncle off to the dark damp dismal swamp where the mosquitoes lived with the tent caterpillars Oh please don t take me away begged the bunny I wish some one would help me and as he said that the alligator gave him a sudden twist and the looking glass which Uncle Wiggily still held in his paw came around in front of the alligator s face And no sooner had the gator looked in the glass than he gave a loud cry and unwinding his tail from Uncle Wiggily away the bad creature scurried leaving the bunny alone and safe And the alligator cried Oh excuse me I didn t mean anything I ll be good I won t hurt Uncle Wiggily Well I wonder what frightened him away asked Uncle Wiggily out loud Seeing himself in the looking glass was the answer and there stood Alice from Wonderland That is a magical mirror I sent you Uncle Wiggily she explained It shows the reflection of anything and anybody just as they are and not as they d like to be And the alligator is such a mean looking and ugly chap that never before having seen himself this time when he did in the looking glass he was frightened seeing himself as others see him He thought he was looking at a Chinese dragon who would bite him So he ran away leaving you alone And I m so glad he did said Uncle Wiggily It s a good thing I had your looking glass Then Alice and Uncle Wiggily had a good time and if the clothes pin doesn t pinch the pillow case so hard that it tickles the bedspread and makes it sneeze all the feathers out I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the White Queen CHAPTER XXII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WHITE QUEEN Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was hopping along through the woods one day wondering if he would have an adventure with Alice of Wonderland or some of her friends when all of a sudden coming to a place where a rail fence ran along among the trees he saw caught in a crack of one of the rails by its legs a white butterfly The poor butterfly was fluttering its wings trying to pull out its legs but it had to pull very gently for a butterfly s leg you know is very tender and easily broken like a piece of spider web Oh my cried kind Uncle Wiggily when he saw what was the matter You are in trouble aren t you I m glad I happened to come along Why are you glad to see me in trouble asked the white butterfly No indeed exclaimed the bunny uncle But I want to help you Well I wish you would went on the fluttering creature I ve tried and tried again to get my poor leg loose but I can t And I m on my way oh but I forgot That part is a secret quickly said the butterfly Well then don t tell me spoke Uncle Wiggily with a laugh for I might not be very good at keeping secrets But I ll soon have your leg loose With that he took the small end of his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk and putting the little end of his crutch in the crack of the rail fence Uncle Wiggily gave a hard push opened the crack wider and soon the butterfly s leg was loose and she could fly away But first I must thank you Uncle Wiggily she said And as you did me so great a favor I want to do you one in return Not now perhaps as I am in a hurry but later So if ever you find you want something you can t get just come to these woods and say a little verse Then you shall have your wish What verse shall I say asked Uncle Wiggily This answered the butterfly Then she recited When the wind blows in the trees Making perfume for the breeze Will you grant to me this boon That my wish may come true soon And what then asked the bunny Then answered the butterfly you must whisper your wish to a green leaf and well we ll see what happens next Thank you said Uncle Wiggily and then he hopped on through the woods while the butterfly fluttered away Uncle Wiggily had no adventure that day but when he reached home to his hollow stump bungalow he found his muskrat lady housekeeper in the kitchen looking quite sad and blue Well Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy cried the jolly bunny uncle Whatever is the matter Oh I have broken my nice gold and diamond dishpan and I can t do any more kitchen work until it is mended I can t wash the dishes nor get you any supper Oh never mind about that said Uncle Wiggily I ll take the diamond dishpan down to the five and ten cent store and have them mend it for you Where is it Nurse Jane gave it to him The pan had a big crack right across the middle The muskrat lady said it had fallen to the floor and had broken when she went to get Jackie Bow Wow the little puppy dog boy a slice of bread and jam I ll soon have it fixed for you said Uncle Wiggily But it was more easily said than done The five and ten cent store was closed because every one was on a picnic and no one else could mend the dishpan Never mind I ll buy Nurse Jane a new one and say nothing about it said Uncle Wiggily I ll surprise her But this too was more easily said than done In all Woodland where Uncle Wiggily and the animal folk lived there was not another gold and diamond dishpan to be had They were all sold Oh dear What shall I do thought Uncle Wiggily Nurse Jane will be so unhappy Then he happened to think of the white butterfly and what she had told him So taking the dishpan he went to the wood where he had helped the fluttering creature and whispered to a leaf the little verse When the wind blows in the trees Making perfume for the breeze Will you grant to me this boon That my wish may come true soon Well what is your wish asked a sudden voice I wish Nurse Jane s gold and diamond dishpan to be mended said Uncle Wiggily Instantly something white came fluttering down out of a tree and the bunny saw it was the white butterfly And then all of a sudden before he could count up to sixteen thousand the white butterfly seemed to fade away and in its place was a beautiful White Queen seated on a golden throne with a diamond crown on her head You shall have your wish Uncle Wiggily she said Give me the dishpan Why why exclaimed the bunny You are you are I am the White Queen from Alice in Wonderland was the answer and I will ask you a riddle When you take the dishes out of the pan what remains Nothing answered the bunny Wrong answered the White Queen The water does Now I ll mend this for you And she did taking some gold from her throne and some diamonds from her crown to mend the broken dishpan Soon Nurse Jane s pan was as good as ever and she could wash the dishes in it Thank you said Uncle Wiggily But how is it you are a queen and a butterfly too Oh we Queens lead a sort of butterfly existence said the White Queen But I must go now for I have to find the tarts for the Queen of Hearts who is always losing hers Then changing herself into a white butterfly again the Queen flew away and Uncle Wiggily with the mended dishpan hopped on to his hollow stump bungalow where he and Nurse Jane were soon having a nice supper and were very happy And if the potato masher doesn t go to the moving pictures and step on the toes of the egg beater I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the Red Queen Illustration CHAPTER XXIII UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED QUEEN Once upon a time when Uncle Wiggily Longears the rabbit gentleman was out walking in the woods he stopped beside a little hole in the ground near a pile of oak tree leaves and listening when the wind stopped blowing he heard a little voice saying Oh but where can she be I fear she is lost Little Crawlie is lost My That s too bad thought Uncle Wiggily Somebody s little girl is lost I must ask if I cannot help find her So he called Oh ho there May I have the pleasure of helping you in your trouble whoever you are But who are you asked a voice that seemed to come out of the little hole in the ground I am Uncle Wiggily Longears answered the bunny You can easily see me but I can t see you And who is this Crawlie who is lost She is my little girl was the answer and up the hole in the ground came crawling a red ant lady who was crying tear drops about as large as that part of a pin point which you can t see but can only feel Oh my exclaimed Uncle Wiggily I couldn t imagine who would live in such a little house but of course ants can And now what about Crawlie She is my little girl answered the red ant I sent her to the store about an hour ago to get a loaf of sand bread but she hasn t come back and I m sure something has happened to her Let us hope not spoke Uncle Wiggily softly I ll go at once and look for her Have no fear missus Ant I ll find Crawlie for you It is rather a queer name Crawlie is called that because she crawls in such a funny way said missus Ant Oh dear I hope she is all right If she should happen to have fallen down a crack in a peach stone she d never get out I ll find her said Uncle Wiggily bravely So off started the bunny uncle hopping on his red white and blue striped rheumatism crutch over the fields and through the woods looking for Crawlie He had not gone very far before he heard a small voice calling Help Help Oh will no one help me Yes of course I will answered the bunny and then he saw an acorn which seemed to be moving along the ground in a queer way Ha Can it be that this acorn is alive asked Uncle Wiggily And can that acorn want help he cried No it is I Crawlie the ant girl under the acorn was the answer and I want help for I m in such trouble What kind asked Uncle Wiggily What s the trouble Why I m caught under this acorn here and I can t get out was the answer and Crawlie s voice sounded as though she had gone down cellar to get a crumb of apple and couldn t find her way back again I went under the acorn shell which is empty said the little ant girl and though it was nicely propped up on one side when I crawled in it was blown over by the wind and I was held beneath it Oh dear I can t get out and go to the store for the loaf of sand bread Oh yes you can cried jolly Uncle Wiggily I ll lift the acorn shell off you and let you out So he did easily picking up the empty oak tree acorn from where it was covering Crawlie and then the little ant girl who was red just like her mother could walk about Oh thank you Uncle Wiggily she said If ever we ants can do you a favor we will Oh pray do not mention it spoke Uncle Wiggily modest like and shy Then Crawlie hurried on to the sand bread store and the bunny hopped along over the fields and through the woods He had not gone very far before he met a poor old June bug gentleman and the June bug seemed very sad and unhappy What is the matter asked Uncle Wiggily Lots was the answer You see it is now time being July for June bugs like myself to get in their winter wood so we will not freeze in the cold weather But I hurt my legs banging into an electric light one night and I m so lame and stiff that I can t gather any wood at all I shall freeze I know I shall and the June bug gentleman was more sad than ever Oh cheer up cried Uncle Wiggily There is plenty of wood under these trees I ll help you gather it There is no need to do that said another voice and looking up Uncle Wiggily and the June bug saw sitting on a green mossy log a Red Queen wearing a golden crown Oh exclaimed Uncle Wiggily in surprise You are I am the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland interrupted the lady on the log I was also the red ant lady who was crying and also Crawlie the red ant girl You were so kind to me when you thought I was only a crawling insect that now when I have changed myself into a Red Queen I want to help you And I know I can best help you by helping this June bug friend of yours Indeed you can said Uncle Wiggily thankful like I thought so spoke the Red Queen Watch With that she waved her magic wand and instantly ten million red white and black ants came crawling out of old logs from holes in the ground and from under piles of leaves and each ant took up a little stick of wood and carried it into the June bug s house for him so he had plenty of wood for all winter and couldn t freeze There you are Uncle Wiggily laughed the Red Queen One kindness you see makes another and then she got in her golden chariot and drove away and when the June bug gentleman had thanked him and the ants had crawled home the bunny himself went to his hollow stump bungalow very happy And if the looking glass doesn t make faces at the hairbrush and knock the teeth out of the comb so it can t have fun and bite the talcum powder I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Tweedledum CHAPTER XXIV UNCLE WIGGILY AND TWEEDLEDUM Are you in Uncle Wiggily asked a voice at the hollow stump bungalow one morning and the rabbit gentleman looked up to see Alice from Wonderland standing on the door sill Yes of course I m in my dear he answered Can t you see me I can t be sure of anything I see answered the little girl with flaxen hair especially since I ve been having so many queer adventures I used to think I saw the Cheshire cat when it was only his grin smiling at me And maybe now I m only looking at your ears or tall silk hat and thinking it s you No I m here all right answered the bunny Is there anything I can do for you Yes answered Alice I d like you to come for a walk with me I haven t much longer time to stay with you and I want to have all the fun I can Are you going away asked Uncle Wiggily I have very soon to go back in the book where I belong answered Alice But no matter Come now and we ll go look for an adventure So Alice and Uncle Wiggily started off over the fields and through the woods and they had not gone very far before they suddenly heard among the trees some voices crying You did it No I didn t Yes you did you know you did No I didn t I know I didn t Well we ll have to have a battle anyhow And then came a sound as if some one was beating a carpet with a fishing pole and voices cried Oh Oh dear Ouch Oh how it hurts My what in the world can that be asked Uncle Wiggily It sounds like an adventure all right I think it is answered Alice It s probably Tweedledum and Tweedledee fighting Fighting Tweedledee and Tweedledum asked the surprised bunny Oh it s only in fun laughed Alice and they have to do it because it s that way in the book for if they didn t things wouldn t come out right Yes there they are And she pointed off through the trees where Uncle Wiggily saw two round fat little boys dressed exactly the same and looking so like one another that no one could tell them apart except when they were together just like twins you know Oh I m so glad to see you called Alice to the two queer fat chaps They were as round as barrels both of them Uncle Wiggily noticed that on the collar of one was the word DUM while on the other was the word DEE Tweedle the rest of their name is on the back of their collars Alice explained As it s the same for both they didn t need it in front Then the fat boys turned around like tops slowly spinning and surely enough on the back of the white collar of each were letters spelling TWEEDLE I m glad to see you spoke Uncle Wiggily I heard you sort of er well you know he went on diffident like not wishing to say he had heard the brothers quarreling Oh it s all right we do that every day said Tweedledee And contrariwise twice on Sunday added Tweedledum We have to for the verse about us says Tweedledum and Tweedledee Agreed to have a battle For Tweedledum said Tweedledee Had spoiled his nice new rattle Just then down flew a monstrous crow As black as a tar barrel Which frightened both the heroes so They quite forgot their quarrel Only we weren t really frightened said Tweedledee We just made believe so and laughed at the crow And I didn t really spoil Tweedledum s nice new rattle for here it is now and taking his arm down from around his brother s neck he took the rattle from his pocket and shook it making a noise like a drum And just as he did that all of a sudden out from behind a big stump came not a monstrous crow but the bad old skillery scalery alligator who cried Ah ha At last I have him Now I ll get that Uncle Wiggily Longears chap Ah ha and he made a grab for the gentleman bunny Oh dear exclaimed Alice Please don t hurt Uncle Wiggily Yes I shall snapped the gator I ll bumble him and mumble him that s what I ll do Oh no you won t exclaimed Tweedledum wabbling toward the alligator as Jimmie Wibblewobble the boy duck waddled when he walked I won t what asked the gator You won t bumble or mumble Uncle Wiggily First you have to catch me Pooh That s easily done snapped the alligator You are so fat that you can t run any more than a rubber ball Will you promise to let Uncle Wiggily alone until you catch me asked Tweedledum eagerly I promise said the alligator smiling to himself for he thought he could easily catch the fat twin and his promise wouldn t count Then here I go Catch me suddenly cried Tweedledum And with that he stretched out on the ground and began to roll down hill in the woods And as he was fat and round he rolled as fast as a rubber ball and he rolled so fast ever so much faster than if he had run that when the alligator raced after him as he had promised he would do why the bad double jointed skillery scalery creature got all out of breath and couldn t bumble or mumble a strawberry to say nothing of Uncle Wiggily And the gator didn t catch the fat boy either So Tweedledum rolling down hill that way which he could do much better than walking or running saved the bunny uncle from the alligator and mister Longears was very glad and so was Alice And if the knife and fork don t go to the candy store just when supper is ready and make the spoon holder wait for them before eating the ice cream I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Tweedledee CHAPTER XXV UNCLE WIGGILY AND TWEEDLEDEE Oh Uncle Wiggily cried a voice as the old rabbit gentleman started out from his hollow stump bungalow one morning to walk in the woods and look for an adventure Oh Uncle Wiggily be careful Be careful of what if you please and who are you if I may ask politely inquired the bunny I am your friend Alice from Wonderland was the answer and I want you to be careful and not get hurt today I always am careful answered Uncle Wiggily I look for cabbage and turnip traps wherever I go and I never pick up a bit of carrot on the Woodland path without first making sure there is no string fast to it to catch me What do you mean Alice he asked the little flaxen haired girl as she came out of the bushes and sat down on the stoop of the hollow stump bungalow What do you mean I don t know just what I do mean Uncle Wiggily said Alice But last night I dreamed you were in trouble and I could not help you I felt so sorry As soon as I woke up this morning I hurried over to tell you to be careful Oh I ll be careful promised the bunny gentleman But in your dream did no one help me Yes after a while two funny little fat boys did answered Alice But I don t remember that part of my dream However if you are going for a walk I ll go with you and do what I can in case the Jabberwocky or the Hop Scotch bird try to chase you The Hop Scotch isn t a bird said Uncle Wiggily with a laugh that made his pink nose twinkle like the strawberry on top of a cheese cake It s a bit of candy Oh Uncle Wiggily It s a game cried Susie Littletail the rabbit girl coming out from behind a stump just then It s a game where you jump around on the pavement and if you and Alice are going to play it please may I watch you We aren t going to play said Alice It s long past play time I am going to look for an adventure said Uncle Wiggily Then please may I come begged Susie I ll help look Come along cried jolly Uncle Wiggily and soon the three of them were on their way through the woods They had not gone very far over the paths with the big green ferns on either side when all of a onceness out from behind a big log jumped the two bad old skillery scalery alligators one with the humps on his tail and the other with his tail all double jointed so he could wiggle it seven ways from Sunday Ah ha cried the hump tailed gator Ha ha cried the double jointed one At last we have caught you and they both made a grab for the rabbit gentleman one catching him on the left side and the other on the right and holding him fast Oh cried Uncle Wiggily Oh dear Please let me go No snapped the first gator And No snapped the second both flapping their tails Oh this is my dream This is my dream said Alice sadly But where are the two fat boys that saved Uncle Wiggily Where are they Here is one if you please answered a voice and out stepped Tweedledee the queer little fat chap from the Alice in Wonderland book I ll help you Uncle Wiggily Thank you very much spoke the rabbit gentleman If you would kindly make these alligators let me go Pooh Huh Humph What Him make us let you go Well I should say NOT sniffed the first alligator The very idea sneered the second It will take a great deal more than one fat boy to make us let go of a nice fat juicy rabbit once we have caught him Certainly NOT Ahem How about TWO fat boys suddenly asked another voice and there stood another beside Tweedledee a fat boy who looked just the same exactly even as you seem to yourself when you peek at your reflection in the bath room mirror No we won t let you go for two fat boys either said the double jointed alligator while Alice murmured Oh this is my dream This is my dream I wish I could remember how it came out Was Uncle Wiggily saved asked Susie Littletail in a whisper Yes said Alice Then it s all right spoke the rabbit girl Let Uncle Wiggily go cried Tweedledee in his most grown up sort of voice Yes let him go at once added Tweedledum No indeed snapped both alligators together like twins only of course they weren t Well then went on Tweedledee don t you dare to take away or hurt him unless you guess which are our names Now tell me truly who am I And remember if you don t guess right you can t have Uncle Wiggily You are Tweedledum said the hump tailed gator No he is Tweedledee said the other gator The one standing next to him is Tweedledum I guess I ought to know You re wrong said the hump tailed gator The one I saw first is Tweedledum I guess I ought to know I know better the double jointed alligator declared He is Tweedledee Tweedledum shouted the other gator Tweedledee snapped his chum And then they both began disputing calling each other names and throwing mud at one another until finally they were so mixed up about Tweedledum and Tweedledee that they let go of Uncle Wiggily and began shaking their claws at one another so the rabbit gentleman and Alice and Susie as well as the two fat boys who looked exactly alike ran safely away and the bunny was saved just as Alice had dreamed And to think if the alligators had only looked at our collars they would have seen our right names Tweedledum laughed Of course said Tweedledee But everything came out all right and the alligators only had sawdust for supper And if the wash lady doesn t take my best collar button to fasten the tablecloth to the ironing board in the clothes basket I ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the pool of tears CHAPTER XXVI UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TEAR POOL Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice rabbit gentleman was out walking in the woods one day wondering what sort of an adventure he would have when he saw a little path leading away from his hollow stump bungalow and it seemed to go through a part of the forest in which he had never before been I ll take that path and see where it leads said the bunny gentleman to himself So taking a piece of ribbon grass which grew near a clump of ferns he tied his tall silk hat firmly on his head leaving his ears sticking out of the holes at the top and tucking under his paw his red white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy his muskrat lady housekeeper had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk away started Uncle Wiggily It was a nice warm summer day and before the old gentleman bunny had gone very far he began to feel thirsty just as you do when you go on a picnic and eat pickles only I hope you don t eat too many of them I wonder if there is not a spring of water around here thought Uncle Wiggily and he began to look about under the low branches of the trees and bushes at the same time listening for the laughing murmur of a brook flowing over green mossy stones Then Uncle Wiggily sniffed with his pink twinkling nose until it looked like a chicken picking up corn Ah ha cried the bunny uncle I smell water for you know animals and birds can smell water when they cannot see it in which they are more gifted than are we So Uncle Wiggily sniffed and sniffed and then holding his pink twinkling nose straight in front of him and letting it go on ahead instead of lagging behind he followed it until it led him straight to a little pool of water that was sparkling in the sun while green moss ferns and bushes grew all around Oh what a fine spring cried the bunny And how thirsty I am mister Longears which I call him when first I introduce him to any strangers mister Longears was just going to take a long drink from the pool or spring when he happened to notice a little piece of white birch bark tied with a bit of grass to a fern that grew near the water Ha I wonder if that is a notice not to trespass or not to fish or hunt and to keep off the grass or no admittance except on business or something like that thought Uncle Wiggily as he put on his glasses to see if there was any writing on the birch bark which animal folk use as we use paper And there was some writing on the bark It read Please do not jump in or drink until I come Alice from Wonderland Ha That is strange thought Uncle Wiggily Alice must have been here and put up that sign But I wonder why she did it If she knew how warm and thirsty I was she would not make me wait until she came to get a drink Perhaps it is all a joke and not her writing at all One of the bad skillery scalery alligators or the fuzzy fox may have put up the sign to fool me But when the rabbit gentleman took a second look at the birch bark sign he saw that it really was Alice s writing Well she must have some reason for it said the bunny with a sigh She dreamed right about two fat boys Tweedledum and Tweedledee saving me from the alligators so she must have some reason for asking me to wait until she comes But I am very thirsty Uncle Wiggily sat down on the green mossy bank beside the spring of water and looked at it And it seemed so cool and wet and he was so thirsty that it was all he could do to keep from jumping in and having a bath as well as drinking all he wanted The sun grew hotter and more hot and the rabbit gentleman more and more thirsty and he didn t know what to do when all of a sudden out from the bushes jumped a bad old black bear Ah ha growled the bear I am just in time I see and he ran his red tongue over his white teeth as though giving it a trolley ride in a baby carriage In time for what asked Uncle Wiggily casual like and make believe indifferent In time for lunch answered the bear I was afraid I d be a little late I hope I haven t kept you waiting For my lunch asked Uncle Wiggily No For MINE and once more the bear smacked his lips hungry like I am just in time I see Oh I thought you meant you were just in time to take a drink of this water said the bunny pointing at the pool If you did you aren t If I did I aren t What kind of talk is that asked the bear curious like I mean we can t have a drink until Alice comes the sign says so spoke Uncle Wiggily politely Pooh I don t believe in signs snapped the bear I m thirsty and I m going to have a drink and with that he took a long one from the woodland pool And then a funny thing happened The bear began to grow smaller and smaller First he was the size of a dog then of a cat then of a kitten then he shrank to the littleness of a mouse and next he was like a June bug Then he became a July bug next he was no larger than a little black ant and finally he became a microbe and Uncle Wiggily couldn t see him at all Well thank goodness he s gone said the bunny But what made him so shrinking like I wonder It was the pool of tears said a voice behind the bunny and there stood Alice from Wonderland This pool is sour alum water Uncle Wiggily she said and if you drink it you shrink and shrivel up and blow away That s why I put up the sign so nothing would happen to you I knew about the pool as it s in my story book And now we can go have some funny adventures And away they went over the hills and far away and that bear was never seen again But if your cat doesn t catch the ice cream cone in the mosquito net and feed it to the gold fish I ll tell you more of Uncle Wiggily s adventures in a little while For the old gentleman rabbit had many surprising things happen to him You may read about them in another book to be called Uncle Wiggily In Fairyland which tells of some of the Genii and Gnomes of the Arabian Nights So until I have that book ready for you I ll just wish you a Good night and many many happy dreams THE END Uncle Wiggily Picture Books Three stories in each book By Howard R Garis Illustration
