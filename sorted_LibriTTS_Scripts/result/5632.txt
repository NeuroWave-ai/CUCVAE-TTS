none	none	my what a pie that shall be exclaimed the cook shutting up one eye to look through the other in a spasm of delight at an imaginary pie so it s for Miss Mary is it Yes said Phronsie it is Oh Jefferson I m so glad you like to have me make one she clasped her hands in silent rapture and sat down on the lowest stair to think it over a bit Jefferson looking at her forgetful that the under cook was fuming in the deserted domains over his delay to return At last he said bowing respectfully If you please Miss it s about time to begin Such a pie ain t done without a deal of care and we d best have it a baking as soon as may be Yes said Phronsie getting off from her stair and surrendering her hand to his big black palm we ought to go right this very minute But I must get my apron on she stopped and looked down at her red dress Oh you can take one of my aprons said the cook they re as fine and big and white and I ll just put you in one of em and tie you up as snug you ll come out as clean and sweet when we re through as you are now Miss Tie me up laughed Phronsie in glee Oh how nice Jefferson Do you know I love you very much Jefferson you re so very good to me The big fellow drew a long breath No Miss I m big and black and just fit to stay downstairs he managed to say But I love you better because you are black Jefferson insisted Phronsie a great deal better You are not like everybody else but you are just yourself clinging to his hand Well Miss I ain t just fit for a lily to touch and that s the truth looking down at his palm that the small white hand grasped closely It s clean Miss he added with pardonable pride but it s awful black I like it better black Jefferson said Phronsie again really and truly I do because then it s your very very own in a tone that thrilled him much as if a queen had knighted him on the spot This important declaration over the two set forth on their way toward the kitchen Phronsie clinging to his hand and chatting merrily over the particular pie in prospect with varied remarks on pies in general that by and by would be ventured upon if this present one were a success and very soon tied up in one of the cook s whitest aprons she was seated with due solemnity at the end of the baking table the proper utensils and materials in delightful confusion before her and the lower order of kitchen satellites revolving around her and Jefferson the lesser sphere Now all go back to your work said that functionary when he considered the staring and muttered admiration had been indulged in long enough and leave us I want you said his assistant touching his elbow Clear out said Jefferson angrily his face turned quite from Phronsie But she caught the tone and immediately laid down the bit of dough she was moulding Do go she begged and come back quickly smiling up into his face See I m going to pat and pat and pat oh ever so much before you come back So Jefferson followed the under cook the scullery boy went back to cleaning the knives Susan the parlor maid who was going through the kitchen with her dustpan and broom hurried off with a backward glance or two and Phronsie was left quite alone to hum her way along in her blissful culinary attempt Bless me exclaimed a voice close to her small ear as she was attempting for the fifth time to roll out the paste quite as thin as she had seen Jefferson do what is this Bless my soul it s Phronsie Phronsie set down the heavy rolling pin and turned in her chair with a gleeful laugh Dear dear Grandpapa she cried clasping her floury hands oh I m so glad you ve come to see me make a pie all by myself It s for Polly and it s to be full of plums Jefferson let me make it Jefferson And where is he pray cried mister King irately Pretty fellow to bring you down to these apartments and then go off and forget you Jefferson he called sharply here where are you Oh Grandpapa exclaimed Phronsie in dire distress I sent him Jefferson didn t want to go Grandpapa dear really and truly he went because I asked him If you please sir began Jefferson hurrying up I only stepped off a bit to the cellar Bassett sent down a lot of turnips they ain t first rate and All right said mister King cutting him short with a wave of his hand if Miss Phronsie sent you off it s all right I don t want to hear any more elaborate explanations Little Miss hasn t been alone but a few minutes said Jefferson in a worried way And see said Phronsie turning back to her efforts while one hand grasped the old gentleman s palm I ve almost got it to look like Jefferson s Almost haven t I she asked regarding it anxiously It will be the most beautiful pie cried mister King a hearty enthusiasm succeeding his irritability that ever was baked I wish you d make me one sometime Phronsie Do you she cried in a tremor of delight and will you really have it on the table and cut it with Aunt Whitney s big silver knife That I will declared mister King solemnly Then some day I ll come down here again Jefferson cried Phronsie in a transport and bake one for my dear Grandpapa That is if this one is good Oh you do suppose it will be good don t you appealingly at him It shall said Jefferson stoutly and seizing the rolling pin with extreme determination You want a bit more butter worked in here a dab with skillful fingers and a little manipulation with the flour a roll now and then most deftly and the paste was laid out before Phronsie Now Miss you can put it in the dish But is isn t my pie said Phronsie and big girl as she felt herself to be she sat back in her chair her lower lip quivering Not your pie repeated the cook bringing himself up straight to gaze at her No said Phronsie shaking her yellow head gravely it isn t my pie now Jefferson You put in the things and rolled it Leave your fingers off from it can t you cried mister King sharply Goodness this pie isn t to have a professional touch about it Get some more flour and stuff whatever it is you make a pie of and let her begin again There I ll sit down and watch you then there ll be some chance of having things straight So he drew up a chair to the side of the table first calling off Pete the scullery boy from his knives to come and wipe it off for him and missus Tucker who was in kitchen dialect Tucker to see that the boy did his work well Lor bless you sir said Tucker bestowing a final polish with her apron twas like satin before sir not a wisp of dust I don t want any observations from you said the old gentleman depositing himself in the chair There you can go back to your work missus Tucker and you too Pete Now I ll see that this pie is to your liking Phronsie But Phronsie still sat back in her chair thoughtfully surveying Jefferson Grandpapa she said at last slowly I think I d rather have the first pie I really would Grandpapa

none	none	She brought her yellow head forward by a sudden movement and looked deep into his keen eyes Bless my soul Rather have the first pie repeated the old gentleman in astonishment why I thought you wanted to make one all yourself I think I d rather do part of it said Phronsie with great deliberateness then Polly ll like it and eat it and I ll do yours Grandpapa dear just as Jefferson fixed mine all alone Please let me She held him fast with her eyes and waited for his answer So you shall cried mister King in great satisfaction make mine all alone This one would better go as it is Put away the flour and things Jefferson Miss Phronsie doesn t want them Phronsie gave a relieved little sigh And Jefferson if you hadn t showed me how I couldn t ever in all this world make Grandpapa s Now give me the little plate do Here tis Miss said the cook all his tremor over the blunder he had made disappearing since after all things were quite satisfactory And the little plate forthcoming Phronsie tucked away the paste lovingly in its depths and began the important work of concocting the mixture with which the pie was to be filled mister King sitting by with the gravity of a statue even to the deliberate placing of each plum Where s Phronsie called a voice above in one of the upper halls Oh she s coming Polly is cried Phronsie deserting a plum thrust in endwise in the middle of the pie to throw her little sticky fingers around Jefferson s neck oh do take off my apron and let me go She ll see my pie Stop cried mister King getting up somewhat stiffly to his feet I ll take off the apron myself There Phronsie there you are Whew how hot you keep your kitchen Jefferson and he wiped his face Now we ll run said Phronsie softly and not make a bit of noise Grandpapa dear and Jefferson please put on my top to the pie and don t let it burn and I ll come down very very soon again and bake one all alone by myself for Grandpapa The old gentleman kept up very well with the soft patter of her feet till they reached the foot of the staircase There there child he said there s not the least need of

none	none	now But she will come down said Phronsie in gentle haste pulling at his hand then if she should see it Grandpapa To be sure that would indeed be dreadful said mister King getting over the stairs very creditably There here we are now Whew it s terribly warm in this house But there was no danger from Polly she was at this very instant not being able to find Phronsie hurrying off toward the library in search of missus Whitney We want to do the very loveliest thing she cried rushing in her cheeks aflame Oh pray excuse me She stopped short blushing scarlet Don t feel badly Polly dear said missus Whitney over in the dim light where the divan was drawn up in the east window and she held out her hand and smiled the other lady whose tete a tete was thus summarily disturbed was elderly and very tall and angular She put up her eyeglass at the intrusion and murmured Ah This is Polly Pepper said missus Whitney as Polly feeling unusually awkward and shy stumbled across the library to get within the kind arms awaiting her One of the children that your kindness received in this house said the tall lady making good use of the eyeglass The color mounted steadily on Polly s already rosy cheek at the scrutiny now going on with the greatest freedom One of the dear children who make this house a sunny place for us all said missus Whitney distinctly Ah I see You are extremely good to put it in that way A low well bred laugh followed this speech Its sound irritated the young girl s ear unspeakably and the brown eyes flashed and though there was really no occasion to feel what was not addressed to her Polly was quite sure she utterly disliked the lady before her My dear missus Chatterton said missus Whitney in the gentlest of accents you do not comprehend it is not possible for you to understand how very happy we all are here The house is quite another place I assure you from the abode you saw last before you went abroad missus Chatterton gave another low unpleasant laugh and this time shrugged her shoulders Polly dear said missus Whitney with a smile say good morning to missus Chatterton and then run away I will hear your wonderful plan by and by I shall be glad to child she was guilty of whispering in the small ear Good morning missus Chatterton said Polly slowly the brown eyes looking steadily into the traveled and somewhat seamed countenance before her Good morning and Polly found herself once more across the floor and safely out in the hall the door closed between them Who is she she cried in an indignant spasm to Jasper who ran up and she lifted her eyes brimming over with something quite new to him He stopped aghast Who he cried Oh Polly what has happened missus Chatterton And she looked at me oh I can t tell you how she looked as if I were a bug or a hateful worm beneath her cried Polly quite as much aghast at herself It makes me feel horridly Jasper you can t think Oh that old He stopped pulling himself up with quite an effort Has she come back what brought her pray tell so soon I don t know I am sure said Polly laughing at his face I was only in the room a moment I think but it seemed an age with that eyeglass and that hateful little laugh Oh she always sticks up that thing in her eye said Jasper coolly and she s everlastingly ventilating that laugh on everybody She thinks it high bred and elegant but it makes people want to kill her for it He looked and spoke annoyed To think you fell into her clutches he added Well who is she cried Polly smoothing down her ruffled feathers when she saw the effect of her news on him I should dearly love to know Cousin Algernon s wife said Jasper briefly And who is he cried Polly again experiencing a shock that this dreadful person was a relative to whom due respect must be shown Oh a cousin of father s said Jasper He was nice but he s dead Oh said Polly She s been abroad for a good half dozen years and why she doesn t stay there when everybody supposed she was going to astonishes me said Jasper after a moment Well it will not be for long I presume that we shall have the honor she ll be easily tired of America and take herself off again She doesn t stay in this house does she Jasper cried Polly in a tone of horror No that is unless she chooses to then we can t turn her off She s a relative you know Hasn t she any home asked Polly or any children Home Yes an estate down in Bedford County Dunraven Lodge but it s all shut up and in the hands of agents who have been trying for the half dozen years she was abroad to sell it for her She may have come back to settle down there again there s no telling what she will do In the meantime I fancy she ll make her headquarters here he said gloomily Oh Jasper exclaimed Polly seizing his arm feeling that here was need of comfort indeed how very dreadful Don t you suppose something will happen to take her away I don t see what can said Jasper prolonging the gloom to feel the comfort it brought You see she has nobody who wants her to step in and relieve us She has two nephews but oh you ought to see them fight Fight repeated Polly aghast Yes you can t dignify their skirmishes by any other name said Jasper in disgust So you see our chances for keeping her as long as she condescends to stay are really very good Polly clung to his arm in speechless dismay Meanwhile conversation fast and brisk was going on between the two shut up in the library It is greatly to your discredit Marian said missus Chatterton in a high cold voice that you didn t stop all this nonsense on your father s part before the thing got to such a pass as to install them in this house On the contrary said missus Whitney with a little laugh I did everything I could to further the plan that father wisely made Wisely cried missus Chatterton in scorn Oh you silly child don t you see what it will all tend to I see that it has made us all very happy for five years said missus Whitney preserving her composure so I presume the future doesn t hold much to dread on that score The future is all you have to dread declared missus Chatterton harshly The present may be well enough though I should think existence with that low underbred family here would be a You may pause just where you are missus Chatterton said Marian still with the gentlest of accents but with a determination that made the other look down at her in astonishment not another word shall you utter in that strain nor will I listen to it And with fine temper undisturbed in her blue eyes she regarded her relative Dear me Marian I begin to notice your age more now You shouldn t fly into such rages they wear on one fearfully and especially for a stranger too and against your own people how can you missus Chatterton drew out a vinaigrette then a fan from a silken bag with clasps that she was always glad to reflect were heirlooms It s trying I must confess she declared alternately applying the invigorating salts and waving the combination of gauze and sandalwood to come home to such a reception But and a heavy sigh I must bear it You ought to see father cried missus Whitney rising I must go at once and tell him of your arrival Oh I don t know that I care about seeing Cousin Horatio yet said missus Chatterton carelessly He will probably fall into one of his rages and my nerves have been upset quite enough by you I think I ll go directly to my apartments She rose also Father must at once be informed of your arrival repeated Marian quietly I ll send him in to see you And I shall go to my apartments declared missus Chatterton determinedly Hoity toity exclaimed mister King s voice and in he came with Phronsie fresh from the kitchen clinging to his hand II COUSIN EUNICE CHATTERTON Phronsie dropped one small hand by her side and stood quite still regarding the visitor Oh my goodness me ejaculated missus Chatterton startled out of her elegance and not pausing to adjust the glass but using her two good eyes to the best advantage Hoity toity So you are back again exclaimed mister King by way of welcome Well and if I may ask what brought you now Eunice missus Chatterton gathered herself up and smiled in a superior way Never mind my reasons Cousin Horatio What a fine child you have there now the glass came into play pray tell me all about her You have well said observed mister King seating himself with the utmost deliberateness and drawing Phronsie to her accustomed place on his knee where she nestled regardless of his immaculate linen and fine waistcoat Phronsie Pepper is indeed a fine child a very fine child Madam Oh my and Oh my cried missus Chatterton holding up her hands to think that you can so demean yourself why she s actually mussing your shirt front with her dirty little hands Phronsie Pepper s hands are never dirty Madam said the old gentleman gravely Sit still child as Phronsie in a state of alarm struggled to slip down from his lap thrusting the two members thus referred to well out before her missus Chatterton burst into a loud laugh To think I have come to see Horatio King in such a state Jasper Horatio King she repeated scornfully I heard about it through the Bascombs letters but I wouldn t believe it till I used my eyes It s positively dreadful mister King put back his head and laughed also so heartily that Phronsie ceased to struggle and turned to regard him in silent astonishment and missus Whitney charmed that the rage usually produced by conversation with Cousin Algernon s wife was not forthcoming began to laugh too so that the amusement of the tall lady was quenched in the general hilarity What you can find in my words to cause such an unseemly outburst I cannot see she cried in a passion I m under the impression that you led off the amusement yourself said mister King wiping his eyes Phronsie it s all very funny isn t it looking down into the little wondering face Is it really funny asked Phronsie Does the lady like it Not particularly I suspect said mister King carelessly And that you can talk with that chit ignoring me your cousin s wife is insufferable missus Chatterton now arose speedily from the divan and shook out a flounce or two with great venom I had intended to make you a visit Now it is quite impossible As you like said the old gentleman also rising and placing Phronsie on her feet observing ostentatious care to keep her hand My house is open to you Eunice with a wave of his disengaged hand in old time hospitality but of course you must suit yourself It s rather hard upon a person of sensibility to come home after a six years absence said Cousin Eunice with a pathetic sniff and once more seeking her vinaigrette in the depths of the silken bag to meet only coldness and derision In fact it is very hard No doubt no doubt said the old gentleman hastily I can imagine such a case but it has nothing to do with you Now if you are going to stay Eunice say so at once and proceed to your room If not why you must go and understand it is no one s fault but your own He drew himself up and looked long and hard into the thin pale face before him Phronsie pulled at his hand I want to ask the lady to stay Grandpapa dear She doesn t need urging said old mister King quite distinctly and not moving a muscle But Grandpapa dear she isn t glad about something No more am I Grandpapa cried Phronsie moving off a bit though not deserting his hand and standing on her tiptoes I want her to stay to see me Perhaps she hasn t any little girls To see you cried mister King irately Say no more child say no more She s been abusing you right and left like a pick pocket What is a pick pocket asked Phronsie getting down from her tiptoes Oh a scoundrel who puts his hands into pockets picks out what doesn t belong to him in fact Phronsie stood quite still and shook her head gravely at the tall figure That was not nice she said soberly Now do you want her to stay cried the old gentleman Insufferable repeated missus Chatterton between her teeth to mix me up with that chit Yes I do said Phronsie decidedly I do Grandpapa Now I know she hasn t any little girls if she had little girls she wouldn t say such very unnice things I want the poor lady to stay with me missus Chatterton turned and went abruptly off to the door hesitated and looked back I see your household is in a very chaotic state Cousin Horatio Still I will remain a few days with extreme condescension on condition that these Peppers are not thrust upon my attention I make no conditions said the old gentleman coolly If you stay you must accept my household as you find it Come Marian said missus Chatterton holding out her hand to missus Whitney You may help me to my apartments if you like I am quite unstrung by all this and she swept out without a backward glance Has she gone cried Jasper hurrying in with Polly running after It s stay isn t it father as he saw the old gentleman s face Yes said mister King grimly it is stay indeed Jasper Well now then you ve a piece of work on your hands about the biggest you ever did yet Polly Pepper cried Jasper to make things comfortable in this house I shall be just as cross as can be imagined to begin with You cross cried Polly Cross as a bear Marian will fight against the prevailing ill wind but it will finally blow her down to a state of depression where her best friend wouldn t recognize her and You don t mention me my boy said mister King dryly Jasper looked into his father s eyes and they both laughed And if you Polly Pepper don t keep things bright why we shall all go to the dogs said the old gentleman sobering down So mind you do and we ll try to bear Cousin Algernon s relict I will said Polly stoutly though relict sounded very dreadful to begin with Give us your hand then said Jasper s father putting out his palm There releasing it now I m much more comfortable about matters And give me your hand Polly cried Jasper his own brown hand flying to meet hers There and now I m comfortable too So it s a compact and a sure one And I want to give my hand cried Phronsie very much aggrieved Here Jasper Bless my soul so you must cried old mister King to think we didn t ask you first There and there And Phronsie darling cried Polly in a rapture you must promise with me after you have with the others I couldn t ever get along in all this world without that So the ceremony of sealing the compact having been observed with great gravity Phronsie drew a long breath and now felt that the poor lady might come down at any time to find all things prepared for her Now tell our plan cried Jasper to Polly and put this disagreeable business out of our heads It s a fine one he added to his father Of course it is cried the old gentleman Well you know Joel and Davie and Van and Percy are coming home from school next week for the Christmas holidays began Polly trying to still the wild beating of her heart Bless me so they are said mister King How time flies to be sure Well go on Polly And we ought to do something to celebrate said Polly at least don t you think so she asked anxiously looking up in his face To be sure I do cried the old gentleman heartily Well what would you do Polly child to show the youngsters we re proud of them and glad to get them back hey We want to get up a little play said Polly Jasper and I and act it And have music cried Jasper Polly shall play on the piano The boys will be so delighted to see how she has improved And Jasper will play too cried Polly eagerly Oh Jasper will you play that concerto the one you played when Mary Gibbs was here at tea last week Do Jasper do That nearly floored me said Jasper No you said it was Mary s watching you like a lynx you know you did said Polly laughing merrily Never mind said the old gentleman What next Polly The play is all right I should think it was cried Jasper It s the Three Dragons and the Princess Clotilde Oh my goodness exclaimed mister King What a play for Christmas Eve Well you ll say it s a splendid hit cried Jasper when you see it from the private box we are going to give you So you are intending to honor me are you cried his father vastly pleased to find himself as ever the central figure in their plans Well well I dare say it will all be as fine as can be to welcome these young scapegraces home What next Polly It must be kept a perfect surprise cried Polly clasping her hands while the color flew over her face No one must even whisper it to each other the day before Christmas when the boys get here for Joel is so very dreadful whenever there is a secret His capacity certainly is good said mister King dryly We will all be very careful And Phronsie is to be Princess Clotilde cried Jasper seizing her suddenly to prance around the room just like old times Oh Jasper I m eight years old she cried struggling to free herself Nonsense What of it you are the baby of this household But he set her on her feet nevertheless one hand still patting the soft yellow waves over her brow Go on Polly do and lay the whole magnificence before father He will be quite overcome That would be disastrous said mister King better save your effects till the grand affair comes off Jasper is to be one of the dragons announced Polly quite in her element that is the head dragon Ben is to be another and we haven t quite decided whether to ask Archy Hurd or Clare to take the third one Clare has the most go in him said Jasper critically Then I think we ll decide now to ask him said Polly don t you Jasper A dragon without go in him would be most undesirable I should fancy Well what next do you propose to do Polly asked mister King Now that we know that you will allow us to have it cried Polly in a rapture why we can think up splendid things We ve only the play written so far sir Polly wrote the most said Jasper Oh no Jasper I only put in the bits said Polly He planned it every single bit Jasper did Well she thought up the dragons and the cave and Oh that was easy enough said Polly guilty of interrupting because you see something has to carry off the Princess Clotilde Oh now you are not going to frighten my little girl cried mister King I protest against the whole thing if you do and he put out his hand Come Phronsie when as of old she hurried to his side obediently Oh we are going to show her the boys and how we dress them up just like dragons cried Polly and while they are prancing around and slashing their tails at rehearsal I m going to keep saying That s nothing but Jasper and Ben and Clare you know Phronsie till I get her accustomed to them You won t be frightened will you pet at those dear sweet old dragons she ended and getting on her knees she looked imploringly into Phronsie s brown eyes N no said Phronsie slowly not if they are really Jasper and Ben and Clare They really will be cried Polly enchanted at her success Jasper and Ben and Clare and they will give you a ride and show you a cave oh and perfect quantities of things you can t think how many Phronsie clapped her hands and laughed aloud in glee Oh I don t care if they are true dragons Polly I don t she cried dreadfully excited Make em real big live ones do do make them big and let me ride on their backs These will be just as real said Polly comfortingly that is they ll act real only there will be boys inside of them Oh we ll have them nice dear don t you fear But I d really rather have true ones sighed Phronsie III THE REHEARSAL Now Phronsie said Polly on her knees before the Princess who was slowly evolving into a thing of beauty do hold still just a minute dear There as she thrust in another pin then turned her head critically to view her work I do hope that is right Phronsie sighed May I just stretch a wee little bit Polly she asked timidly before you pin it up Just a very little bit To be sure you may said Polly looking into the flushed little face I ll tell you you may walk over to the window and back once that ll rest you and give me a chance to see what is the matter with that back drapery So Phronsie well pleased gathered up the embyro robe of the Princess and moved off a bewildering tangle of silver spangles and floating lace drawn over the skirt of one of missus Whitney s white satin gowns There ought to be a dash of royal purple somewhere said Polly sitting on the floor to see her go and resting her tired hands on her knees Now where shall I get it and where shall I put it when I do have it She wrinkled up her eyebrows a moment lost in thought over the momentous problem Oh I know and she sprang up exultingly Phronsie won t this be perfectly lovely we can take that piece of tissue paper Auntie gave you and I can cut out little knots and sashes It is so soft that in the gaslight they will look like silk How fine Can t I be a Princess unless you sew up that purple paper asked Phronsie pausing suddenly to look over her shoulder in dismay at Polly Why yes you can be of course said Polly but you can t be as good a one as if you had a dash of royal purple about you What s a bit of tissue paper to the glory of being a Princess she cried with sparkling eyes Dear me I wish I could be one Well you may have it Polly said Phronsie with a sigh and then afterwards I ll rip it all off and smooth it out and it will be almost as good as new I think there won t be much left of it when the play is over cried Polly with a laugh why the dragons are going to carry you off to their cave you know and you are to be rescued by the knight just think Phronsie You can t expect to have such perfectly delightful times and come out with a quantity of tissue paper all safe Something has to be scarified to royalty child Phronsie sighed again But as Polly approved of royalty so highly she immediately lent herself to the anticipations of the pleasure before her smothering all lesser considerations When you get your little silver cap on with one of Auntie s diamond rings sewed in it why you ll be too magnificent for anything said Polly now pulling and patting with fresh enthusiasm since the purple dash was forthcoming Princesses don t wear silver caps with diamond rings sewed in them observed Phronsie wisely Of course not they have diamonds by the bushel and don t need to sew rings in their caps to make them sparkle said Polly plaiting and pinning rapidly but in dressing up for a play we have to take a poetic license There turn just one bit to the right Phronsie dear What s poetic license demanded Phronsie wrenching her imagination off from the bushel of diamonds to seize practical information Oh when a man writes verses and says things that aren t so said Polly her mind on the many details before her But he ought not to cried Phronsie with wide eyes say things that are not so I thought poets were always very good Polly Oh well people let him said Polly carelessly because he puts it into poetry It would never do in prose that would be quite shocking Oh said Phronsie finding the conversation some alleviation to the fitting on process Now this left side said Polly twisting her head to obtain a good view of the point in question is just right I couldn t do it any better if I were to try a thousand times Why won t this other one behave and fall into a pretty curve I wonder Phronsie yawned softly as the brown eyes were safely behind her I shall gather it up anyway so and Polly crushed the refractory folds recklessly in one hand that s the way Mary Gibbs s hat trimmings look and I m sure they re a complete success Oh that s lovely cried Polly at the effect Now that s the treatment the whole drapery needs she added in the tone of an art connoisseur Oh A rushing noise announced the approach of two or three boys together with the barking of Prince as they all ran down the wide hall O dear dear exclaimed Polly hurriedly pulling and pinning there come the boys to rehearse It can t be four o clock as the door opened and three members of the cast entered It s quarter past four said Jasper laughing and pulling out his watch we gave you an extra fifteen minutes as you had such a lot to do Dear me but you are fine Phronsie I make my obeisance to Princess Clotilde and he bowed low to the little silver and white figure as did the other two boys and then drew off to witness the final touches It s a most dreadful thing cried Polly pushing back the brown waves from her brow as she also fell off to their point of view to get up a princess I had no idea it was such a piece of work You have scored an immense success said Jasper enthusiastically Oh Phronsie you will make the hit of the season You ll think it is even much nicer when it is done said Polly vastly relieved that Jasper had given such a kind verdict It s to have a dash of royal purple on that right side and in one of the shoulder knots and to catch up her train That will be very pretty I don t doubt said Jasper trying to resolve himself into the cold critic but it seems to me it is almost perfect now Polly Oh thank you so much she cried with blooming cheeks How do you like it Clare and Bensie I can t tell said Ben slowly regarding the Princess on all sides it s so transforming It s tiptop cried Clare It out princesses any princess I ve ever imagined Well it s a perfect relief said Polly to have you boys come in I ve been working so over it that I was ready to say it was horrid It s too bad isn t it that Dick can t be here to day to rehearse his part To be sure exclaimed Jasper looking around where is the Princess s page He s gone to the dentist s said Polly making a wry face Auntie had to make the appointment for this afternoon and we couldn t put off the rehearsal Clare can t come any other time you know Phronsie turned an anxious face to the window I hope he s not being hurt very much she said slowly I don t believe he is Polly made haste to answer most cheerfully it was only one tooth you know Phronsie to be filled Auntie says doctor Porter told her the rest are all right But a cloud rested on the Princess s face One tooth is something she said Just think how nice it will be when it is all over and Dick comes scampering in cried Jasper with great hilarity Do climb up on the sofa Phronsie urged Polly looking into the pale little face you must sit down and rest a bit you re so tired I will read the prologue while she rests said Jasper So you can said Polly Take care child in alarm you mustn t curl up in the corner like that princesses don t ever do so Don t they said Phronsie flying off from the lovely corner to straighten out again into the dignity required not when they are little girls Polly No indeed said Polly with a rescuing hand among the silver spangles and lace they must never forget that they are princesses Phronsie There now you re all right Oh said Phronsie sitting quite stiffly glad if she could not be comfortable she could be a princess Gentle ladies and brave sirs began Jasper in a loud impressive tone from the temporary stage the large rug in front of the crackling hearth fire Clare burst into a laugh See here now cried Jasper brandishing his text at him if you embarrass me like that you may leave you old dragon You ought to see your face cried Clare Jap you are anything but a hit You ll be yet declared Jasper with a pretended growl and another flourish of the manuscript Go on do implored Polly I think it is lovely Clare you really ought to be ashamed and she shook her brown head severely at him If I don t quench such melodrama in the outset said Clare he ll ruin us all Fair ladies and brave sirs mimicking to perfection Jasper s tones Thank you for a hint cried Jasper pulling out his pencil I didn t say fair that s better than gentle I wish critics would always be so useful as to give one good idea Heigho here goes again Fair ladies and brave sirs The player s art is to amuse Instruct or to confuse By too much good advice But poorly given That no one follows because forsooth Tis thrown at him neck and heels The drama pure and simple is forgot In tugging in the moral I thought you were going to alter tugging in to something more elegant said Polly Lugging in suggested Clare with another laugh Morals are always tugged in by the head and shoulders said Jasper Why not say so We should have pretty much the whole anatomy of the human form divine if you had your way cried Clare Listen Because forsooth tis thrown at him neck and heels and Tugging in the moral head and shoulders Now just add by the pricking of my thumbs et cetera and you have them all Jasper joined as well as Polly and Ben in the laugh at the prologue s expense but Phronsie sat erect winking hard her royal hands folded quite still in her lap You re bound for a newspaper office my boy said Jasper at length How you will cut into the coming poet and maul the fledgling of the prose writer Well I stand corrected The drama pure and simple Is forgot in straining at the moral Is that any better To the audience Yes I think it is said Polly but I do believe it s time to talk more elegantly Jasper It is due to the people in the private boxes you know Oh the boxes are to have things all right before the play is over never you fear Polly said Jasper A poor presentment You will say we give But cry you mercy Sirs and I don t like cry you mercy announced Ben slowly because it doesn t seem to mean anything Oh don t cut that out exclaimed Polly clasping her hands and rushing up to Ben That s my pet phrase you mustn t touch that Bensie But it doesn t mean anything reiterated Ben in a puzzled way Who cares cried Jasper defiantly A great many expressions that haven t the least significance are put in a thing of this sort Padding you know my dear sir Oh said Ben literally I didn t know as you needed padding All right if it is necessary It s antique and perfectly lovely and just like Shakespeare cried Polly viewing Ben in alarm Oh let the Bard of Avon have one say in this production cried Clare Go on do with your cry you mercy What s next Jap Are you willing Ben asked Jasper with a glance at Polly Ye es said Ben also gazing at the rosy face and anxious eyes it can go as padding I suppose Oh I am so glad exclaimed Polly in glee and dancing around the room And you won t be sorry I know Bensie the audience will applaud that very thing I m almost sure which made Jasper sternly resolve something on the spot Well I shall never be through at this rate he said whirling over the manuscript to find his place Oh here I am But cry you mercy Sirs and ladies fair We aim but to be dragons Not mortals posing for effect We have a princess to be sure I should think we have interrupted Clare with a glance over at the sofa Goodness me she s fast asleep Poor little thing she is tired to death cried Polly remorsefully while they all rushed over to the heap of lace and spangles blissfully oblivious of prologues Do let her sleep through this piece of stupidity said Jasper bundling up another satin skirt that missus Whitney had loaned for Polly to make a choice from There putting it under the yellow head we ll call her when the dragons come on Take care cried Polly with intercepting hand that s Auntie s lovely satin gown Beg pardon said Jasper relinquishing it speedily Here s the sofa pillow after all dragging it from its temporary retirement under the theatrical debris Now let s get back to work time is going fast In a lowered voice We have a princess to be sure A sweet and gracious Clotilde And a knight who does her homage But the rest of us Are fishy scaly Horny and altogether horrid And of very low degree Who scarce know why we are upon the boards Except for your amusement So prithee Hold cried Clare what stuff Give me an inch of time cried Jasper hurrying on and I ll end the misery So prithee be amused We re undone if you are not And all our labor lost Pray laugh and shake your sides And say tis good I faith tis very good And we shall say Your intellects do you credit And so we bid you a fond adieu And haste away to unshackle the dragons Who even now do roar without Clare threw himself into the part of the dragons and forgetful of Phronsie gave a loud roar Polly clapped her hands and tossed an imaginary bouquet as Jasper bowed himself off Hush said Ben you ll wake up Phronsie but it was too late there she sat rubbing her eyes in astonishment Oh you darling cried Polly running over to her to clasp her in her arms I m so sorry I tired you all out Phronsie dear do forgive me I m not tired said Phronsie with dewy eyes Has Jasper got through reading What was it all about Polly Indeed and I have finished he cried with a yawn and throwing the manuscript on the table and I don t know in the least what it is all about Phronsie Just a lot of dreadful words said Clare over in the corner pulling at a heap of costumes on the floor Never mind the horrible spell is broken come on you fellows and tumble into your dragon skins With that the chief dragon deserted Phronsie and presently there resounded the rattle of the scales the clanking of chains and the dragging about of the rest of their paraphernalia Now Phronsie said Jasper coming back half within his dragon skin and gesticulating you see that it s only I in this thing Look dear here goes in my head and he pulled on the scaly covering observing great care to smile reassuringly the last thing before his countenance was obscured Phronsie screamed with delight and clapped her hands Oh Jasper let me have one on do Jasper I d much rather be a dragon than a princess Really and truly I would Jasper I don t agree with you said Jasper in a muffled voice Phew this is no end stuffy fellows I can t stand it long I m all coming to pieces said Ben turning around to regard his back where the scales yawned fearfully I ll run and ask Mamsie to come and sew you up cried Polly flying off She said she would help if we wanted her IV WELCOME HOME Marian said old mister King putting his head in at the door of her little writing room can t you get her comfortably out of the way this morning I want your services without interruption She s going down to Pinaud s said missus Whitney looking up from the note she was writing Capital when she once gets there she ll stay the morning declared mister King greatly pleased Now then after she s cleverly off you may come to me I will father said Marian going back with a smile to her correspondence Half an hour later Thomas with the aid of the horses and the shopping coupe having carried off missus Chatterton missus Whitney pushed aside her notes and ran down to her father s study She found him in his velvet morning gown seated before his table busy with a good sized list of names that was rapidly growing longer under his pen Oh I forgot he said looking up I intended to tell you to bring some of your cards and envelopes I want some invitations written Are you going to give a dinner asked Marian looking over his shoulder Oh no I see by the length of your list it s an evening affair or a musicale You run along daughter said the old gentleman and get what I tell you This is my affair it s a musicale and something else combined I don t just know myself And he laughed at the sight of her face If father is only pleased I don t care what it is said missus Whitney to herself hurrying over the stairs and back again never once thinking of Polly s and Jasper s surprise for the boys You see Marian said mister King as she sat down by the table and laid the cards and envelopes in front of him that I m going to help out that affair that Jasper and Polly are getting up Oh father how good of you exclaimed missus Whitney in a delighted tone which immensely pleased the old gentleman to begin with They ve been working very hard those two at their studies this autumn I ve seen them cried mister King with a shrewd air and I m going now to give them a little pleasure Marian said nothing but let him have the comfort of doing all the talking which he now enjoyed to his heart s content Whether the other chaps have done well I don t know Davie may have kept at it but I suspect the rest of the boys haven t killed themselves with hard study But they shall have a good home coming at any rate missus Whitney smiled and he proceeded Now I m going to send out these invitations he pushed the list toward her I shall have the drawing room and music room floors covered and all extra seats arranged give Turner carte blanche as to flowers if he can t furnish enough out of our own conservatories and the evening will end with a handsome spread as Jasper calls it In short I shall recognize their attempt to make it pleasant for the boys holiday by helping them out on the affair all I can The old gentleman now leaned back in his big chair and studied his daughter s face And you ll never regret it father she cried with an enthusiasm that satisfied him for these young people will all repay you a thousand fold I do believe in the time to come Don t I know it cried mister King getting out of his chair hastily to pace the floor Goodness me they repay me already They re fine young things every one of them Whitneys Peppers and my boy as fine as they are made And whoever says they re not doesn t know a good piece of work when it s before his eyes Bless me pulling out his handkerchief to mop his face violently I don t want to see any finer I hope I shall have a sight of Jasper s and Polly s faces when you tell them what you intend to do said missus Whitney where are your cards father Tell them I shan t tell them at all cried the old gentleman I m going to have a surprise too No one must know it but you and missus Pepper Oh said missus Whitney It was very stupid in me not to understand that It will be all right father missus Pepper and I will keep our secret you needn t fear If you can only keep HER out of the way exclaimed mister King pointing irascibly in the direction of missus Chatterton s apartments all will be well But I doubt if you can her meddlesome ears and tongue will be at work as usual he added in extreme vexation Here comes Jasper exclaimed missus Whitney which had the satisfactory result of bringing her father out of his irritation into a flutter over the concealment of the party preparations Jasper cried Polly that evening as they ran into the music room to play a duet we re all right about everything now as your father says we may invite the girls and your friends And he said when I asked him if we ought not to have cake and coffee I ll attend to that said Jasper so everything is all straight as far as I can see Polly The private boxes trouble me I must confess said Polly drumming absently on the keys while Jasper spread the sheet of music on the rack You know there must be two one for dear mister King and one for the boys as guests of honor Now how shall we manage them She took her hand off suddenly from the keys and folded it over its fellow on her knee to study his face anxiously It s pretty hard to get them up that s a fact said Jasper truthfully but then you know Polly we ve always found that when a thing had to be done it was done You know the little brown house taught us that So it did said Polly brightening up Dear little old brown house how could I ever forget it Well I suppose with a sigh it will come to us as an inspiration when it s time to fix them I suppose so too said missus Pepper passing the door as usual with her mending basket and when two people start to play a duet I think they much better put their minds on that and not waste precious time on all sorts of questions that will take care of themselves when the time comes You are right missus Pepper cried Jasper with a laugh and seating himself before the piano Come Polly Mamsie is always right isn t she Jasper cried Polly with pride putting her hands down for the first chords Indeed she is responded the boy heartily Here now Polly remember you slipped up a bit on that first bar Now The twenty first of December came all too soon for Polly and Jasper whose school duties had engrossed them till two days before but after hard work getting up the stage properties and the many rehearsals everything was at last pronounced ready the drawing room and music room locked the keys given to missus Whitney who promised faithfully to see that no one peeped in who should not and Polly hurried into her hat and jacket to go to the station with Jasper to meet the boys Thomas drove furiously as they were a bit late and they arrived only a minute before the train puffed in Here they are cried Polly and Here they are cried Jasper together in great excitement on the platform Halloo Polly cried Joel prancing out of the car first and How d ye do Polly as they all hurried after Halloo Jasper Oh Polly it s good to see you This from Davie not ashamed to set a kiss on her red lips Van and Percy looked as if they wanted to but contented themselves with wringing her hand nearly off while Joel declared he would look after the luggage No I will cried Van dropping Polly s hand You forget said Percy quietly I hold the checks I ll attend to it myself He unclosed his brown traveling glove and Van at sight of them turned back Go along do then he cried I don t want to I m sure I d much rather stay with Polly How d ye do Thomas he called carelessly to the coachman on his box who was continually touching his hat and indulging in broad smiles of content Polly was tiptoeing in very delight holding Davie s hand closely while her eyes roved from one to the other of the boys and her tongue ran fast indeed A group of girls who had also come down to the station to meet friends stopped a bit as they came laughing and chatting by How d ye boys they said carelessly to the three home comers Oh Polly won t it be entrancing to night cried one of them seizing her arm as she spoke Hush said Polly as she tried to stop her May I bring Elsie Fay she s come on the train to stay over Christmas with her aunt May I Polly begged another girl eagerly Yes yes said Polly in a paroxysm of fear lest Joel who was crowding up between them should catch a word do be still she whispered Bring anybody only stop Alexia He won t hear said Alexia carelessly that boy doesn t mind our talking his head s full of skating and coasting You re going to have something to night that you don t want me to know about declared Joel his chubby face set defiantly and crowding closer so there now I m going to find out what it is If we don t want you to know you ought not to try to find out Joel Pepper cried Alexia And you shan t either There now you see cried Polly unable to keep still while her face grew red too O dear what shall we do You are you are cried Joel capering up and down the platform his black eyes shining with delight Now I know for certain and it s at our house too for you asked Polly if you might bring some other girl Elsie somebody or other so Oh I ll soon know Joel exclaimed Jasper suddenly clapping him on the shoulder I m going round to the gymnasium want to go with me Joel stopped his capering at once this new idea thrusting out the old one Don t I though he cried with a nod at Polly and her friends But I ll find out when I do get home the nod declared plainly But Jasper also nodded He said He won t get home till late depend on me And then Come on Joe he cried I m going to walk and they were off Alexia pinched Polly s gray woolen jacket sleeve convulsively What an escape she breathed Here comes Percy cried Polly nervously and she broke away from her and the other girls and ran to meet him and the two boys following Where s Jasper asked Percy rendered quite important in air and step from his encounter with the baggage officials Oh he isn t going home with us said Polly Come do let us get in and she scampered off to the carriage and climbed within That s funny said Percy jumping in after Van opened his lips to tell where Jasper had gone but remembering Percy s delight in such an expedition he closed them quickly and added himself to the company in the carriage Davie followed and closed the door quickly Stop where s Joel asked Percy Thomas we ve forgotten Joe rapping on the glass to the coachman No we haven t he isn t going to drive said Polly Oh and Percy thinking that Joel had stolen a march on them on his good strong legs now cried lustily Go on Thomas get ahead as fast as you can and presently he was lost in the babel of laughter and chatter going on in the coach I ve a piece of news presently cried Van in a lull Davie s bringing home a prize first in classics you know Oh Davie screamed Polly and she leaned over to throw her arms around him Mamsie will be so glad Davie you can t think how glad she ll be Davie s brown cheek glowed It isn t much he said simply there were so many prizes given out Well you ve taken one cried Polly saying the blissful over and over How perfectly elegant Van drummed on the carriage window discontentedly I could have taken one if I d had the mind to Hoh oh shouted Percy over in his corner Well you didn t have the mind that s what was wanting You keep still cried Van flaming up and whirling away from his window You didn t take any either Polly his head was under water all the time unless some of the boys tugged him along every day We hardly got him home at all No such thing contradicted Percy flatly his face growing red Polly he tells perfectly awful yarns You mustn t believe him Polly You won t will you He leaned over appealingly toward her Oh don t don t cried Polly quite dismayed talk so to each other Well he s so hateful cried Van and the airs he gives himself I can t stand them Polly you know And he s just as mean cried Percy vindictively Oh you can t think Polly Here we are as Thomas gave a grand flourish through the stone gateway and up to the steps I ll help you out and he sprang out first No I will declared Van opening the door on the other side jumping out and running around the carriage Here Polly take my hand do No I got here first said Percy eagerly his brown glove extended quite beyond Van s hand I don t want any one to help me who speaks so to his brother said Polly in a low voice and with her most superb air stepping down alone she ran up the steps to leave them staring in each other s faces Here everybody came hurrying out to the porch and they were soon drawn into the warm loving welcome awaiting them Oh Felicie I don t want that dress said Polly as she ran into her room after dinner to missus Whitney s French maid I m going to wear my brown cashmere Oh Mademoiselle remonstrated Felicie adjusting the ruffle in the neck of the white nun s veiling over her arm Oh no Polly I wouldn t began missus Pepper coming in the white one is better for to night Mamsie cried Polly breaking away from the mirror where she was pulling into place the bright brown waves over her forehead how lovely you ve put on your black silk and your hair is just beautiful Madame has ze fine hair said Felicie only I wish zee would gif it to me to prepaire Yes I have good hair said missus Pepper and I m thankful for it No one looks dressed up in my opinion with a ragged head The finer the gown the worse it makes careless hair look No Polly I wouldn t wear the brown dress to night Why Mamsie exclaimed Polly in surprise I thought you d say it was just the thing when only the girls and Jappy s friends are coming to the play Besides I don t want to look too dressed up the Princess ought to be the only one in a white gown You won t be too conspicuous said her mother adding slowly you might wear the nun s veiling well enough as you haven t any part in the play Polly and she scanned the rosy face keenly I don t want any part cried Polly they all play better than I do Somebody must see that everything goes off well behind the scenes that s my place Mamsie Besides you forget I am to play my sonata I don t forget said her mother all the more reason you should wear the white gown then All right cried Polly merrily dashing across the room to Felicie put it over my head do Well I m glad you think it is right to wear it Mamsie as the soft folds fell around her I just love this dress Oh Auntie how perfectly exquisite missus Whitney came in smilingly and put a kiss on the tall girl s cheek Do I look nicely she asked naively turning around under the chandelier Nicely exclaimed Polly lifting her hands why you are fresh from fairyland You are so good to put on that lovely blue moire and your diamond cross just for the boys and girls I am glad you like it said missus Whitney hastily Now Polly don t you worry about anything I ll see that the last things are done Well I am worrying confessed Polly quite in a tremble I must see to one corner of the private box for the boys You know the last India shawl you lent me wasn t pinned up straight and I couldn t fix it for Van wanted me just then and I couldn t get away without his suspecting something Oh Auntie if you would see to that I will said missus Whitney not daring to look at missus Pepper and to all the other things don t give a thought to them Polly How good you are cried Polly with a sigh of relief Oh Auntie we couldn t do anything without you And you don t need to go into the drawing room at all said missus Whitney going to the door Just keep behind the scenes and get your actors and Phronsie ready and your mother and I will receive your friends Come missus Pepper That is splendid cried Polly left behind with the maid now I can get ready without flying into a flurry Felicie and then for Phronsie and the rest There is a dreadful commotion in there among the audience said Jasper out in the green room I imagine every one who had an invite has come But I don t see how they can make such a noise Oh a few girls and boys make just about as much confusion as a good many observed Polly Jasper wouldn t you like to see Joel s eyes when Aunt Whitney leads him into the private box she allowed herself time to exclaim Yes laughed Jasper pulling out his watch from beneath his dragon skin well we have only five minutes more Polly We must have the curtain up sharp O dear dear cried Polly flying here and there to bestow last touches on the different members of her cast Now Clare you must remember not to give such a shriek when you go on mustn t he Jappy Just a dull sullen roar your part is Well I m nearly dead under here cried Clare glaring beneath his dragon face I ll shriek or roar just as I like so Very well said Polly I don t know but it s as well after all that you are cross you ll be more effective she added coolly Let me see oh the door of the cave wants a bit more of gray moss it looks thin where it hangs over You get it will you Hannah to one of the maids who was helping And just one thing more scanning hastily the stage setting another Chinese lantern is needed right here going toward the front of the stage and that green bush is tumbling over do set it straight somebody there now I believe everything is all ready Now let us peep out of the curtain and get one good look at the audience Come Phronsie here s a fine place come boys The different members of the cast now applied their eyes to as many cracks in the curtain as could be hastily managed There was a breathing space What what cried Polly gazing into the sea of faces and the dragons nearly knocked the Princess over as mister King gave the signal for the band stationed in the wide hall to send out their merriest strains V AFTER THE PLAY It was all over Phronsie had been swept off a vision of loveliness to the cave the dragons had roared their loudest and the gallant knight had covered himself with glory in the brilliant rescue of the Princess the little page had won the hearts of all the ladies mister King had applauded himself hoarse especially during the delivery of the prologue when I cry you mercy sirs and ladies fair rang out the musical efforts of Polly and Jasper in the Wait between the two acts were over and the crowded house in every way possible had expressed itself delighted with all things from beginning to end Phronsie Phronsie they re calling you whispered Polly excitedly out in the green room Come Princess The head dragon held out his hand Hurry dear See the flowers They can t be for me said Phronsie standing quite still Polly has done all the work they re hers Nonsense child cried Polly giving her a gentle push forward Go on and take them Polly you come too begged Phronsie refusing to stir and holding her by the gown I can t Phronsie cried Polly in distress don t you see they haven t called me Go on child if you love me she implored Phronsie not being able to resist this dropped Polly s gown and floated before the footlights Thank you she said bowing gravely to the sea of faces as her hands were filled with roses but I shall give these to Polly because we couldn t any of us have done it without her And so she brought them back to put into dismayed Polly s lap The authors the authors of the play cried a strong voice privately urged on by mister King There now s your turn cried Clare to Polly And go ahead old dragon to Jasper make your prettiest bow So the chief dragon led up blushing Polly to the front of the stage to hear a neat little speech from mister Alstyne thanking them for the pleasure of the evening and congratulating them on its success and the band played again the camp chairs were folded up and removed the green room and stage were deserted and actors and audience mingled in a gay confusing throng Phronsie in her little silver and white gown and gleaming cap began to wander among the guests unconscious that she had not on the red cashmere dress she had worn all day Groups stopped their conversation to take her into their midst passing her on at last as one might hand over a precious parcel to the next waiting hands Polly seeing that she was well cared for gave herself up to the enjoyment of the evening Well sir how did you like it asked Jasper with a small pat on Joel s back Well enough said Joel but why didn t you make more of it You could have crawled up on top of the cave and slashed around there and you old dragons were just three muffs in the last act I d rather have had Polly in the play she s twice the go in her So would we all have preferred Polly cried Jasper bursting into a laugh but she wouldn t act she directed everything she was all the play in fact Polly meanwhile was saying to Pickering Dodge No not to night you must dance with one of the other girls But I don t choose to dance with anybody but you said Pickering holding out his hand Come Polly you can t refuse they re forming the Lancers Hurry Polly s feet twitched nervously under her white gown and she longed more than ever after the excitement she had passed through to lose herself in the witching music and the mazy dance She hesitated a bit but just then glancing across the room Come she said I want you to dance with Ray Simmons You can t refuse using his own words and before he was conscious how it was done he was by Ray s side and asking for the pleasure of the dance Polly stood quite still and saw them go away and take the last places in the set and a sorry little droop fell upon the curves of the laughing mouth She was very tired and the elation that had possessed her over the success of the evening was fast dropping out now that everybody was enjoying themselves in their own way leaving her alone She felt left out in the cold and though she fought against it a faint feeling of regret stole over her for what she had done She almost wished she was standing there by the side of Pickering Dodge one of the bright group on whom the eyes of the older people were all turned as they waited for the first figure to begin Well Polly it was mister Alstyne who spoke and he acted as if he had come to stay by her side you ve covered yourself with glory this evening Have I sir asked Polly absently wishing there had been less of the glory and a little more fun Yes indeed said mister Alstyne his keen eyes searching her face Well now Polly your dragons although not exactly like any living ones extant made me think of some I saw at the Zoo in London Do you want me to tell you how Oh if you please cried Polly her color coming back and beginning to forget the dance and the dancers Let us sit down here then said mister Alstyne drawing her off to two chairs in a corner and you shall have the tale No pun Polly you know And he plunged into it at once Yes Alstyne has her all right mister King was saying at the further end of the drawing room to missus Pepper he spied the whole thing he ll take care of her you may depend And two more people had seen one was Jasper Nevertheless his partner Alexia Rhys thought it necessary to enlighten him Just think Polly s given up her chance with the best dancer in the room and sent Pickering Dodge off with that horrid Ray Simmons Jasper pretended not to hear This is our figure he said hastily and they whirled off finished it and were back again Isn t she a goose as he fanned her and tried to introduce another subject I suppose she best pleases herself said the boy indifferently Why should any one else interfere in the matter But some one else ought to interfere cried Alexia with a little pout provoked at his indifference that s just the way she does in school all the time Oh I m vexed at her I can tell you She s so silly dear me it s our turn again By the next interim she had forgotten all about Polly and whether she was having a nice time or the stupidest one imaginable for Joel who held dancing in great contempt sauntered up Aren t you glad now that you didn t find out about the secret cried Alexia radiantly Oh you are such a nuisance Joey she added frankly Phooh exclaimed Joel it wasn t worth finding out that old secret But it s as good as girls ever get up he finished with a supercilious air It was a perfectly splendid play cried Alexia and much too good for a lot of boys Goodness Joey I wouldn t celebrate if you four were coming home from school to our house I d have the jollification the night before you went back I wouldn t go home if twas to your house declared Joel with equal candor I d run off to sea first Come come you two stop sparring cried Jasper holding out his hand its our turn again Alexia Joel take yourself off Alexia flashing Joel a bright making up smile dashed off into the figure Good by said Joel with a smile as cheery for he really liked her the best of all Polly s girl friends After the dance supper was announced and everybody marched out to the supper room the dancers with their partners following Will you allow me mister Alstyne seeing the movement got out of his chair and offered his arm to Polly with a courtly bow Oh don t think of me sir she began blushing very hard Joel will look out for me I much prefer waiting upon Miss Polly Pepper to any other lady in the room said mister Alstyne with another bow courtlier than the first since missus Alstyne is provided for See Polly mister King is taking her out And your mother has her cavalier in mister Cabot and missus Whitney has already gone out with mister Fairfax So if you don t accept my services I shall be entirely left out in the cold He stood offering his arm and Polly laughing merrily put her hand within it It s very good of you sir she said simply as they fell into step and joined the procession I m afraid if you had trusted to Joel s tender mercies you would have fared hardly said mister Alstyne laughing Look Polly over yonder in the corner They were just passing into the supper room and now caught sight of Joel chatting away to a very pretty little creature in blue and white as busily and unconcernedly as if he had done that sort of thing for years Why cried Polly quite aghast that can t be Joel He just hates girls you know mister Alstyne and never goes to parties He seems to be able to endure it all very well to night said her companion dryly Shall I get you an ice Miss Polly Yes thank you said Polly absently not being able to take her eyes from Joel and his friend At last by the force of attraction he turned and looked at her But instead of showing self consciousness his round eyes surveyed her coolly while he went on talking and laughing with the little blue and white thing Polly Polly exclaimed Alexia Rhys hurrying up while Jasper was storming the supper table for her do look at Joel Pepper He actually brought in a girl to supper I see said Polly gazing at the two in a fascinated way On the other hand said Alexia sending swift bird like glances around the supper room there are Van and Percy moping off by themselves as if they hadn t a friend in the world What a pity they used to be so lively at parties Polly wrenched her gaze away from the astonishing sight on which it had been fixed and following Alexia s glance took a keen look over at the young Whitneys Oh oh I must go to them she cried remorsefully Tell mister Alstyne please when he comes back where I am and without another word she dashed back of some gaily dressed ladies just entering the supper room and was out of the door If I ever did cried Alexia irritably to herself see anything so queer Now she thinks she must race after those boys I wish I d kept still Jasper she s just as funny as ever as he came up with a plate of salad and some oysters Who said the boy is this right Alexia offering the plate Why Polly said Alexia yes that s lovely with a comforted glance at the plate and its contents Oh she s gone off mister Alstyne to that gentleman approaching with Polly s ice You can t expect her to stay for the goodies beginning to nibble at her own Where is she cried mister Alstyne laughing and sweeping the room with his brown eyes Oh I see his glance lighting on the Whitney boys corner Yes she told me to tell you said Alexia between her mouthfuls of salad and oyster where she is as he started Oh Percy and Van Polly was whispering hurriedly I m sorry I hurt your feelings only it was so very dreadful you know to hear you go on so to each other We didn t mean anything said Percy pushing one foot back and forth in an embarrassed way and looking as if he did not know what to do with his hands which confused him more than anything else as he had been quite sure of them on all previous occasions Van thrust his into his pockets and seemed on the point of whistling but remembering where he was took his lips speedily out of their curves and looked the other way Just then mister Alstyne came up Oh cried Polly suddenly the color rushing over her face Could you mister Alstyne give that to some one else Percy and Van are going to wait upon me Yes indeed said mister Alstyne in a flash nothing easier and he disappeared as suddenly as he came Now boys said Polly turning back to them and whispering busily I know you won t ever say such perfectly dreadful things to each other again And so I m going to ask you both to get me something to eat will you How do you know we won t cried Percy slowly He was sorry enough for the episode in the coach yet couldn t resist the temptation to show he was not to be driven Because I shall then have nothing whatever to eat said Polly merrily for of course I can t take a bit from anybody else after refusing mister Alstyne s kindness Don t you see Oh Percy you wouldn t quite do that Van laughed She s got us Percy he said quite fast You know you won t fight and I won t again we both said so a little while back so what s the good of holding out now Percy drew himself up very slowly and decidedly I won t trouble you so again Polly holding out his hand Now would you like oysters all in the same breath And here s mine cried Van extending his brown one Can t I bring you some salad Yes yes cried Polly gaily and she released their hands after a cordial grasp You may bring me everything straight through boys as they rushed off heads erect to the crowded supper table You ve had a good time asked missus Pepper slowly with a keen glance into the flushed face and sparkling eyes as they turned up the gas in Polly s bedroom Dear me it is half past eleven Splendid said Polly shaking herself free from the white gown and beginning to braid her hair for the night Percy and Van were perfectly lovely and mister Alstyne was so good to me And oh Mamsie isn t dear mister King just the dearest dear to give all this to the boys We haven t thanked him half enough He is indeed said missus Pepper heartily Why where is Phronsie looking around the room She was right back of you said Polly She wanted to take off her things herself Did you ever see such a sweet she began but missus Pepper did not stop to hear hurrying out to the adjoining room shared by the mother and her baby She isn t here Polly heard her say in bewildered tones So Polly her long hair blown about her face ran in brush in hand Why where she began laughingly She wouldn t go downstairs I don t think said missus Pepper peering in all the corners and even meditating a look under the bed No no cried Polly the lights are all turned out investigating all possible and impossible nooks that a mouse could creep into Where can she be Phronsie Phronsie Well of course she is downstairs declared missus Pepper at last hurrying out of the room Take a candle Mamsie you ll fall cried Polly and throwing on her bath wrapper she seized the light from the mantel and hurried after her Half way down she could hear Phronsie s gay little laugh and catch the words Good night my dear Grandpapa and then she came slowly out from mister King s sitting room and softly closed the door Phronsie exclaimed Polly sitting down on the middle of the stairs the candle shaking ominously how could Hush said missus Pepper who had fumbled her way along the hall Don t say anything Oh Phronsie dear so you went down to bid Grandpapa good night did you Phronsie turned a glance of gentle surprise on her mother and then looked up at Polly No not exactly to bid him good night she said slowly I was afraid he was sick I heard him coughing so I went down He is quite well isn t he asked missus Pepper Here give me your hand child we must get up to bed Oh yes he is quite really and truly all well declared Phronsie breaking into another glad little laugh He said he never had such a beautiful time in his life and he is just as well as he can be Oh Polly as she picked up her Princess gown and prepared to ascend the stairs how funny you look sitting there Funny said Polly grimly I dare say and I feel funny too Phronsie VI THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE They were all sitting around the library fire Polly under the pretext of holding Phronsie s head in her lap was sitting on the rug beside her the boys on either hand old mister King was marching up and down the long room and looking at them The merriest of stories had been told Polly urging on all the school records of jolly times and those not so enjoyable songs had been sung and all sorts of nonsense aired At last Joel sprang up and ran over to pace by the old gentleman s side Christmas was good enough said the boy by way of beginning conversation Hey responded the old gentleman looking down at him I should think it was Well and how about the wonderful play on the twenty first And that was good enough too I dare say That was well enough said Joel indifferently I don t care for such stuff though Tut tut cried mister King in pretended anger now I won t have anything said against that wonderful production Not a thing sir do you hear Joel laughed his chubby face twinkling all over in secret amusement Well I know something better if you ll only let us do it sir than a hundred old plays And pray what is it demanded mister King let s have it at once But the idea of surpassing the play Oh no no it can t be done sir It s to go and see the little brown house said Joel standing up on his tiptoes to a level with the old gentleman s ear and one eye looking backward to see that nobody heard mister King started pulled his handsome moustache thoughtfully looked at Joel sharply and then over at the group in the firelight They don t know anything about it cried the boy in a whisper don t tell them It s my secret and yours he added generously Oh if we might only go and look at it It s winter observed the old gentleman and stepping to the window he put aside the draperies to peer out into the black evening Yes it really is winter he added with a shiver to the boy who was close behind and as if no longer in doubt about it he added most emphatically it really is winter Joel Well but you never saw anything like it how magnificent winter is in Badgertown cried Joel in an excited whisper Such hills to coast down the snow is always crisp there sir not like this dirty town mud And the air is as dry as punk he added artfully Oh twould be such a lark he actually clasped his hands Badgertown isn t so very far off said mister King thoughtfully I ll think about it and see if we can manage it Ugh ow squealed Joel utterly forgetful of his caution of secrecy we can we can we can open the little brown house and build great fires there and But he got no further Into the midst of Van s liveliest sally came the words little brown house bringing all the young people to their feet Phronsie running to the old gentleman s side with What is it Grandpapa He said the little brown house Get away cried Joel crossly to the besiegers each and all wildly clamoring What is it What are you talking about It s my secret he cried and his pointing with a dismayed finger to mister King Well it isn t a secret any longer cried Polly flushing with excitement You said little brown house we heard you just as plainly and you re getting up something I know you are People don t usually select a roomful of listeners and then shout out their secrets said Jasper You are in for it now Joe and no mistake Go ahead old fellow and give us the rest of it Joel whirled away from them all in desperation You might as well laughed the old gentleman the mischief is done now and no mistake So Joel thus set upon allowed the whole beautiful plan to be wrung from him by slow and torturing installments how they all were to go to Badgertown open the little brown house and stay there here he glanced at mister King perhaps a week he brought out suddenly filling the time with all sorts of frolics and playing they were there again and really and truly living in the old home At last it was all out to be received in different ways by the listeners Oh Joe cried Davie with shining eyes We never could come away again if we once get there never Polly stood quite still a mist gathering before her glad eyes out of which she dimly saw the little brown house arise and beckon to her Phronsie jumped up and down and clapped her hands in glee Oh Grandpapa Grandpapa she screamed please take us to the little brown house please That settled it I do not think we need to consider it longer said mister King glancing at Ben whose face told what he thought children we will go that is if missus Pepper says yes I will ask her cried Joel with a howl springing off Come on cried Jasper let s all be in at the death And the library was deserted in a twinkling But mother was nowhere to be found Upstairs downstairs and in the lady s chamber they sought her wildly Oh I forgot exclaimed Polly when at last they gathered in the wide hall disposing themselves on the chairs and along the stairs all tired out She has gone to evening meeting with Auntie How stupid of me not to remember that Well I declare cried a voice above them and looking up they met the cold blue eyes of missus Chatterton regarding them over the railing Cousin Horatio do you keep a menagerie or a well ordered house I beg to inquire A menagerie said mister King coolly leaning on the balustrade at the foot of the stairs and looking up at her All sorts of strange animals wander in here Cousin Hum I understand I m not so dull as you think Well you ve changed let me tell you vastly and not for the better either in the last six years Who would ever suppose I see before me fastidious Horatio King she exclaimed lifting her long thin hands to show him their horror stricken palms I dare say I dare say Cousin Eunice assented mister King carelessly but I consider all you say as a compliment Compliment she repeated disdainfully and added with a rising note of anger forgetting herself there s no fool like an old fool So I think said mister King in the same tone as before Children come into my room now and close the door And Cousin Eunice was left to air further opinions to her own ear But when Mother Pepper and missus Whitney did come home from the meeting oh what a time there was They all fell upon her as soon as the door opened and the whole air was filled with little brown house May we may we A whole week Two days Mamsie do say yes and Phronsie s glad little chirp Grandpapa wants to go he does ending every other exclamation What a babel cried missus Pepper her black eyes roving over the excited group Now what is it all about Baby you tell mother first Phronsie was not too big to jump into the comfortable lap and while her fingers played with the bonnet strings she laid the whole delightful plan open the others hanging over them in ill suppressed excitement Well you see Mamsie she began deliberately Oh you are so slow Phronsie exclaimed Polly do hurry Let her take her own time said mister King go on child Dear Grandpapa proceeded Phronsie turning her yellow head to look at him her hand yet among the bonnet strings is going to take us all every single one to see the little brown house and just touch it once and be sure it s there and peek in the doors and windows and No no roared Joel we re going to stay and a week too hopping confidently up and down Oh Joe not a week corrected Polly with glowing cheeks perhaps two days we don t know yet Three three begged Van pushing his head further into the center of the group missus Pepper do say you want to stay three days he begged I haven t said I wanted to go yet she answered with a smile Now every one of you keep quiet commanded mister King raising his hand or you ll spoil the whole thing Phronsie shall tell her story as she likes Thereupon the rest with the shadow of his warning that the whole might be spoiled fell back to a vigorous restraint once more Perhaps cried Phronsie with shining eyes and grasping the strings tighter she leaned forward and pressed her red lips on the mother s mouth we ll go in and stay Oh Mamsie That Oh Mamsie carried the day and every one hanging on the conversation knew as soon as they heard it that a victory had been won It s no use to contend against the Fates said missus Whitney laughing missus Pepper you and I know that That s so cried old mister King and whoever finds it out early in life is the lucky one Now children off with you and talk it over he cried dismissing them as if they were all below their teens I want to talk with missus Pepper now And in two days they were ready to go missus Chatterton with nose high in the air and plentiful expressions of disgust at such a mid winter expedition taking herself off to make a visit of corresponding length to some distant relatives I hope and pray this may not get into a society paper she cried at the last as she was seated in the carriage but of course it will outre things always do And we shall be disgraced for life One comfort remains to me I am not in it mister King holding the carriage door laughed long and loudly No Cousin Eunice he said you are not in it Take comfort in that thought Good by and the carriage rolled off Mother Pepper and the five little Peppers were going back to the little brown house Really and truly we are as Phronsie kept saying over and over again with every revolution of the car wheels in a crooning fashion and making it impossible for mister King to shiver in apprehension at the step he was taking Were not two cases of blankets and household comforts safely packed away in the luggage car It s not such a dreadful risk said the old gentleman gruffly to himself it s quite a common occurrence nowadays to take a winter outing in the country We re all right and he re enforced himself further by frequent glances at missus Pepper s black bonnet two seats off It was to be a three days frolic after all Not that the whole party were to stay in the little brown house O dear no how could they It was only big enough for the Peppers So missus Whitney and her three boys with mister King and Jasper who concealed many disappointed feelings planned to settle down in the old hotel at Hingham And before anybody imagined they could reach there so soon there they were at Badgertown Center to find mister Tisbett waiting there on his stage box as if he had not stirred from it for five years Sho now he called out from his elevated position to missus Pepper as she stepped down from the car it s good to see you though Land how many of ye be there And is that Phronsie Sho now Did you get my letter exclaimed Mother Pepper to missus Henderson who was pressing up to grasp her hand and preparing to fall on the young folks separately The parson stood just back biding his time with a smile Is it possible he exclaimed are these tall boys and girls the five little Peppers It can t be missus Pepper as at last he had her hand You are imposing on us And then the village people who had held back until their pastor and his wife paid their respects rushed up and claimed their rights and it was high holiday indeed for Badgertown My goodness exclaimed mister King at a little remove and viewing the scene with great disfavor this is worse than the danger of taking cold Have they no sense to carry on like this They re so glad to see the Peppers again father said missus Whitney with bright eyes You took them away from all these good people you know it s but fair to give them up for one day The old gentleman fumed and fretted however in a subdued fashion at last wisely turning his back he began to stalk down the platform under pretense of examining the landscape Your friends will stay with us missus Henderson was saying in a gently decisive manner the old parsonage is big enough she added with a laugh Oh you are so good and thoughtful dear missus Henderson cried missus Pepper with delight at the thought of the homelike warmth of the parsonage life awaiting the old gentleman for whom she was dreading the dreary hotel I m good to ourselves declared the parson s wife gaily Jasper gave a shout when the new arrangement was declared as it presently was by Percy and Van who flung themselves after him as he was seeing to the luggage with Ben and his face glowed with the greatest satisfaction That is jolly he exclaimed and that s a fact Now Ben we re but a stone s throw apart Rather different isn t it old fellow from the time when I used to race over from Hingham with Prince at my heels doctor Fisher s little thin wiry figure was now seen advancing upon the central group and everybody fell away to let him have his chance to welcome the Peppers I couldn t get here before he cried his eyes glowing behind his spectacles I ve left a very sick patient This is good he took them all in with a loving glance but his hand held to Polly Now I m going to drive you down in my gig he said to her at last Will you come Yes indeed cried Polly in delight as her mother smiled approval and she ran off to let him help her in It s only yesterday since you took me to drive doctor Fisher and you gave me my stove is it And so she rambled on the little doctor quite charmed to hear it all But mister Tisbett had a truly dreadful time placing his party in the old stage as the townsfolk fearful that so good a chance for seeing the Peppers would not happen during the three days stay insisted on crowding up close to the ancient vehicle and getting in everybody s way thereby calling forth some exclamations from mister King that could not be regarded as exactly complimentary And quite sure that he was a frightful tyrant they fell back with many a pitying glance at the Pepper family whom he was endeavoring to assist into their places At last it was all accomplished in some way and mister Tisbett cracked his whip missus Pepper and Phronsie leaned out of the window to bow right and left into smiling faces Ben and Davie did the same over their heads Good by sang out Joel whom the stage driver had taken up beside him Here we are off for the little brown house G lang VII OLD TIMES AGAIN Don t let me look oh don t let me look cried Polly in the old gig and twisting around she hid her face against the faded green cloth side I ought not to see the little brown house before Mamsie and the others do I ll turn down the lane said the little doctor so and suiting the action to the word Polly could feel that they were winding down the narrow little road over toward Grandma Bascom s She could almost smell the violets and anemones under the carpet of snow and could scarcely restrain herself from jumping out for a riotous run Don t go too far away she cried in sudden alarm We must be there by the time the stage does And she applied her eye to the little circular glass in the back of the gig Will it never come oh here it is here it is dear doctor Fisher And with a quick flourish around of the old horse they were soon before the little brown house and helping out the inmates of the stage who with more speed than grace were hurrying over the steps Joel was down before mister Tisbett had fairly drawn up in front of the gate Hold on roared the stage driver I don t want you to break your neck with me It s really here cried Phronsie with wide eyes standing quite still on a hummock of frozen snow with her eyes riveted on the house It really is Polly had raced up the winding path and over the flat stone to drop a kiss on the little old door Oh oh Mamsie do come she cried to missus Pepper on the path Hum I think Jasper you and I will let them alone for a few moments said mister King who was still within the stage Here my good fellow to mister Tisbett you say it s all comfortable in there for them Yes yes sir said mister Tisbett heartily Good land Mis Henderson had her boys come down airly this mornin and make the fires and there s a mighty sight of things to eat The stage driver put one foot on the hind wheel to facilitate conversation and smacked his lips All very well Now you may drive us down the road a bit said mister King withdrawing his head to the depths of the lumbering old vehicle again Ain t goin in cried mister Tisbett opening his round eyes at him in astonishment Get up and drive us on I say commanded the old gentleman and cease your talking which had the effect to send honest mister Tisbett clambering expeditiously up to the box where he presently revenged himself by driving furiously over all the hard frozen ruts he could quickly select determined not to stop till he was obliged to Goodness exclaimed mister King within holding to the strap at the side as well as to the leather band of the swinging seat in front What an abominable road The road is well enough said Jasper who couldn t bear to have a word uttered against Badgertown it s the fellow s driving that makes it rough Here can t you be a little more careful to keep the road he called thrusting his head out of the window But he only narrowly escaped losing his brown traveling cap for his pains as the stage gave a worse lurch than before to introduce a series of creakings and joltings hitherto unparalleled I cannot endure this much longer said old mister King growing white around the mouth and wishing he had strength for one half the exclamations he felt inwardly capable of Outside honest mister Tisbett was taking solid comfort in the reflection that he was teaching a rich city man that he could not approach with anything less than respect a citizen of Badgertown Ain t I as good as he cried mister Tisbett to himself with an extra cut to the off horse as he spied a sharp ragged edge of ice along the cart track in front of him Now that s good that ll shake him he added cheerfully Land but I hain t been spoke to so since I was sassed at school by Jim Bently and then I licked him enough to pay twice over G lang there easy The first thing he knew one of the glass windows was shivered to fragments the bits flying off along the quiet road to fall a gleaming shower upon the snow Whoa called mister Tisbett to his smoking horses and leaning over he cried What s the matter in there The matter is said Jasper putting his face out that as I could not possibly make you hear my calls I chose to break the window Have the goodness to let my father and me at once out of this vehicle mister Tisbett got down slowly over the wheel Beg your pardon he said awkwardly pulling open the door ain t you goin to ride back Heavens cried mister King He was glad to find he could ejaculate so much as he tremblingly worked his way out to terra firma Nothing on earth would tempt me to step foot inside there again Here is the money for your window said Jasper putting a bill into the fur mitten covering mister Tisbett s brawny right hand Kindly bring our traps to the little brown house here father take my arm and he ran after the tall figure picking its way along the frozen road Hey what s this exclaimed mister Tisbett looking into the center of his fur mitten five dollars Gee thumps I ain t a goin to take it after shaking that old party almost to pieces He stood staring at the bill in stupid perplexity till the uneasy movements of his horses warned him that his position was not exactly the proper one for a stage driver who was on his box from morning till night so he clambered over the wheel full of vexed thoughts and carefully tucked the bill under the old cushion before he took his seat Ill give it back to him that s cert in he said picking up the reins and p raps they ve had enough walkin so they ll let me pick em up which raised him out of his depression not a little But the stern faces of the old gentleman and the tall boy smote him with a chill long before he passed them and he drove by silently well knowing it would not do to broach the subject by so much as a look Not daring to go near the little brown house without the occupants of the stage who had driven down the road with him mister Tisbett drew up miserably to a convenient angle and waited till the two came up Then without trusting himself to think he sprang to the ground and with shame written all over his honest face called out See here you young chap I want to speak to you when you ve got him in the house I will see you then said Jasper as the two hurried on to meet the Peppers rushing out from the little brown house and down the small path I ve made an awful mess for em all and they just come home groaned mister Tisbett drawing his fur mitten across his eyes and leading his horses he followed at a funeral pace careful not to stop at the gate until the door was closed when he began furiously to unload A footstep crunching the snow broke into the noise he was making Hoh well he exclaimed pausing with a trunk half off the rack it s a mighty awkward thing for a man to say he s sorry but you bet I be as cert in as my name s John Tisbett His face became so very red that Jasper hastened to put his young shoulder under the trunk a movement that only added to the stage driver s distress It don t pay to get mad now I tell you declared mister Tisbett dumping the trunk down on the snow and then drawing himself to his full height fust place your pa sassed me and He didn t intend to cried Jasper eagerly and I ll apologize for him if that s what you want He laid his strong right hand in the old fur mitten Good land Tain t what I want cried honest John but he gripped the hand nevertheless a fact that the boy never forgot I say I m sorry I shook up your pa His age ought to have protected him said the boy simply Sho that s a fact cried mister Tisbett sinking in deeper distress but how is anybody to remember he s so old when he steps so almighty high as if he owned all Badgertown say I think we shall be good friends mister Tisbett said Jasper cordially as he turned to wave his hand toward the little brown house simultaneously the door opened and all the young Peppers and Whitneys rushed out to help in the delightful unloading It was well along in the afternoon The dusk of the December twilight shut down speedily around the little brown house and its happy occupants but no one wanted the candles lighted till the last moment Oh Polly cried Joel who was prancing as of old over the kitchen floor don t you remember that night when you said you wished you had two hundred candles and you d light them all at once I said a good many silly things in those days said Polly meditatively and smoothing Phronsie s yellow hair that was lying across her lap Some silly ones and a good many wise ones observed Mother Pepper over in her little old rocker in the west window where she used to sit sewing up coats and sacks for the village storekeeper You kept us together many a time Polly when nothing else could Oh no I didn t Mamsie protested Polly guilty of contradicting you and Bessie did I just washed dishes and swept up and Baked and brewed and fussed and stewed finished Joel afraid of being too sentimental Polly was just lovely in those days said Davie coming across the room to lay a cool cheek against her rosy one I liked the rainy days best when we all could stay in the house and hear her sing and tell stories while she was working She was cross sometimes cried Joel determined not to let reminiscences become too comfortable she used to scold me just awfully I know Polly broke into a merry laugh yet she exclaimed You poor Joey I suppose I was dreadful You didn t catch one half as bad scoldings as belonged to you put in Ben thrusting another stick in the stove You were a bad lot Joe in those days And not over good in these cried old mister King ensconced in the snuggest corner in the seat of honor the high backed rocker that comforted Phronsie after her little toe was hurt There now my boy how s that with a grim smile Do you remember when the old stove used to plague you Polly cried Joel suddenly changing the conversation And how Ben s putty was everlastingly tumbling out Hoh hoh And you two boys were always stuffing up the holes for me when Ben was away cried Polly with affectionate glances at Davie and Joel I didn t so much said Joel honestly Dave was always giving boot tops and such things Boot tops repeated mister King in astonishment Bless me I didn t know that they had anything in common with stoves Oh that was before we knew you said Joel ready in advance of any one else with the explanation it wasn t this stove doctor Fisher gave Polly this one after she had the measles but it was a lumbering old affair that was full of holes that had to be stopped up with anything we could get And leather was the best and Davie saved all the old boot heels and tops he could find you know Oh said the old gentleman wondering if other revelations would come to light about the early days of the Peppers Isn t doctor Fisher lovely cried Polly with sparkling eyes just the same as ever Mamsie I ought to do something for him He is as good as gold assented missus Pepper heartily You ve done something I m sure Polly The medical books you bought out of your pocket money and sent him pleased him more than anything you could give him But I want to do something now said Polly Oh just think how good he was to us May we never forget it exclaimed missus Pepper wiping her eyes But he s very unwise said mister King a trifle testily not to take up with my offer to establish him in the town A man like him could easily hold a good practice because the fellow s got ability Oh doctor Fisher wouldn t leave Badgertown cried all the Peppers in a bunch And what would the poor people here do without him finished Polly Well well never mind he won t come to town and that s enough said the old gentleman quickly Aside from that he s a sensible chap and one quite to my liking Oh Polly cried Phronsie suddenly and lifting her head she fastened her brown eyes on the face above her wasn t Mamsie s birthday cake good The flowers were pretty but the cake was heavy don t you remember said Polly who hadn t recovered from that grief even yet I thought it was just beautiful cried missus Pepper hastily No one could have baked it better in the old stove you had I m sure we ate it all up every crumb We kept it in the old cupboard cried Joel rushing over to the corner to swing the door open And we never once peeked Mamsie so afraid you d suspect You kept staring at the cupboard door all the evening Joe you know you did cried Ben you were just within a hair s breadth of letting the whole thing out ever so many times Polly and I had to drag you away We were glad enough when you went to bed I can tell you You were always sending me off to bed in those days said Joel taking his head out of the cupboard to throw vindictive glances over to the group around the stove I wish we could do so now said Ben And those two Joel went on pointing to Polly and Ben used to go whispering around a lot of old secrets that they wouldn t tell us Oh it was perfectly awful wasn t it Dave bestowing a small pinch on that individual s shoulder I liked the secrets best not to know them till Polly and Ben got ready to tell us said David slowly then they were just magnificent Phronsie had laid her head back in the waiting lap and was crooning softly to herself I want to go and see dear good mister Beebe she said presently and nice missus Beebe can I Mamsie looking over at her To be sure cried missus Pepper you shall indeed child Beebe Beebe and who is he pray demanded mister King Oh he keeps the shoe shop over in the Center explained three or four voices and Phronsie s new shoes were bought there you know And he gave me pink and white candy sticks said Phronsie and he was very nice and I like him very much And missus Beebe gave us doughnuts all around communicated Joel I don t know but that I liked those best There was more to them So you always bought your new shoes of the Beebes asked the old gentleman a question that brought all the five Peppers around his chair at once We didn t ever have new shoes that I can remember said Joel quickly except Phronsie s and once Ben had a new pair He had to because he was the oldest you know Oh said mister King You see said Phronsie shaking her head gravely while she laid one hand on his knee we were very poor Grandpapa dear Don t you understand Yes yes child said old mister King there get up here and he took her within his arms No no you re not going to talk yet seeing Percy and Van beginning violent efforts to join in the conversation Let the Peppers have a chance to talk over old times first See how good Jasper is to wait I would much prefer to hear the Peppers talk forever said Jasper smiling down on the two Whitneys than to have the gates opened for a general flood Go on do Polly and Ben and the rest of you Oh there is so much said Polly despairingly clasping her hands we shouldn t get through if we talked ten years should we Ben Mamsie and she rushed over to her can we have a baking time to morrow just as we used to in the old days Oh do say yes Yes do say yes echoed Jasper also rushing to the side of the little rocking chair You will won t you missus Pepper Hoh hoh cried the two Whitneys derisively I thought you could hear the Peppers talk forever That s great Jasper Well when it comes to hearing a proposal for a baking frolic my principles are thrown to the wind said Jasper recklessly Why boys that s the first thing I remember about the little brown house Do say yes missus Pepper VIII SOME BADGERTOWN CALLS Well I declare exclaimed Grandma Bascom opening the door and looking in I never Come in cried mister King sociably His night over at the parsonage had been a most fortunate experiment I haven t slept so finely in ten years he confided to missus Whitney as they met at breakfast at the minister s table So now his face wreathed with smiles he repeated his invitation Come in do missus Bascom we re glad to see you I never said Grandma Bascom once more for want of something better to say and coming close to the center of operations Jasper attired in one of missus Pepper s long aprons which was fastened in the style of the old days by the strings around his neck was busily engaged in rolling out under Polly s direction a thin paste expected presently under the genial warmth of the waiting stove to evolve into most toothsome cakes Ben was similarly attired and similarly employed while Joel and David were in a sticky state preparing their dough after their own receipt over at the corner table their movements closely followed by the three Whitneys Phronsie before a board laid across two chairs was enlightening old mister King who sat by her into the mysteries of baking day Do bake a gingerbread boy he begged I never had anything half so good as the one you sent over to Hingham You were my poor sick man then observed Phronsie with slow even pats on her bit of dough Please the rolling pin now Grandpapa dear To be sure cried the old gentleman here Jappy my boy be so good as to hand us over that article And you see continued Phronsie receiving the rolling pin and making the deftest of passes with it over the soft mass I couldn t send you anything better though I wanted to Grandpapa dear Better cried mister King I should think not you couldn t have made me anything that pleased me more had you tried a thousand times Phronsie never tired of hearing this and now humming a soft note of thanks proceeded with her task declaring that she would make the best gingerbread boy that could possibly be achieved Grandma Bascom was still reiterating I never and going slowly from one group to another to inspect operations When she came to Phronsie she stopped short raising her hands in surprise Seems as ef twas only yesterday when the Peppers went away though land knows I ve missed em all most dretfully an there sets that blessed child baking as big as any of em I never Have you any more raisins to give us Grandma shouted Joel across the kitchen They were terribly hard he added in his natural voice almost broke our teeth Hey called Grandma back again Raisins Grandma or peppermints cried Joel Oh Joe for shame called Ben I m going to have the fun of going after them declared Joel throwing down his dough pat and wiping his sticky fingers on his apron just like old times so there I ll go over and get em said Grandma you come along with me looking admiringly up at the tall boy so the two Joel laughing and hopping by her side as if he were five years younger disappeared well pleased with each other Now I shall take his dough declared Dick rushing around the end of the table to Joel s deserted place No such thing declared Van flying out of his chair Leave your hands off youngster that s to be mine Polly looked up from the little cookies she was cutting with the top of a tin baking powder box and their eyes met I didn t promise not to have it out with Dicky said Van stoutly He s a perfect plague and always under foot I never thought of such a thing as not making him stand around Polly But the brown eyes did not return to their task as Polly mechanically stamped another cooky I only promised not to have a bout with Percy Van proceeded uncomfortably And in the same breath Go ahead If you want it Dicky I don t care I do want it declared Dick clambering into Van s chair while Van returned to his own and I m going to have it too I guess you think you d better give it up now sir I m getting so big Softly there Dicky said missus Whitney over in the window seat with her fancy work if Van gives up you should thank him I think he is very good to do it And the bigger boy s heart warmed with the radiant smile she sent him Dick gave several vicious thrusts to his dough and looked up at last to say very much against his will Thank you and adding brightly but you know I m getting big sir and you d better give up All right said Van with that smile in his heart feeling equal to anything Now cried Jasper with a flourish of his baking apron mine are ready Here goes and he opened the oven door and pushed in a pan of biscuit Jappy s always ahead in everything grumbled Percy laboring away at his dough How in the world do you make the thing roll out straight Mine humps up in the middle Put some more flour on the board said Polly running over to him There now see Percy if that doesn t roll smooth It does with you said Percy taking the rolling pin again to send it violently over the long suffering dough and I declare it s going to do with me he cried in delight at the large flat cake staring up at him from the board Now says I I ll beat you Jappy And presently the whole kitchen resounded with a merry din as the several cakes and biscuits were declared almost ready for their respective pans But I can tell you this gingerbread boy is going in next declared mister King from Phronsie s baking board It s almost done isn t it child Not quite Grandpapa said Phronsie this eye won t stay in just like the other It doesn t look the same way don t you see pointing to the currant that certainly showed no inclination to do its duty as any well bred eye should Wait just a moment please I ll pull it out and stick it in again Take another advised the old gentleman fumbling over the little heap of currants on the saucer There here s a good round one and very expressive too Phronsie That s lovely hummed Phronsie accepting the new eye with very sticky fingers Now he s all ready as she set it in its place and took the boy up tenderly Give me a pan do Polly Did you cut that out cried Dick turning around in his chair and regarding her enviously all alone by yourself Didn t Grandpapa help you just one teeny bit to make the legs and the hands No she made it all herself said the old gentleman with justifiable pride There Phronsie here s your pan as Polly set it down before her with a You precious dear that s perfectly elegant Phronsie placed the boy within the pan and gave it many a loving pat Grandpapa sat here and looked at it and smiled she said turning her eyes gravely on Dick and that helped ever so much I couldn t ever have made it so nice alone Good by now bake like a good boy Let me put it in the oven all by myself do Polly she begged So Phronsie the old gentleman escorting her in mortal dread that she would be burned safely tucked her long pan into the warmest corner shut the door and gravely consulted the clock If I look at it in twenty one minutes I think it will be done she said quite brown In twenty one minutes the whole kitchen was as far removed from being the scene of a baking exploit as was possible Everything was cleared away and set up primly in its place leaving only a row of fine little biscuits and cookies with Phronsie s gingerbread boy in the midst to tell the tale of what had been going on Outside there was a great commotion Deacon Brown s old wagon stood at the gate for the Peppers and their friends and oh joy not the old horse between the shafts but a newer and much livelier beast And on the straw laid in the bottom of the wagon the seats being removed disported all the merry group mister King alone having the dignity of a chair Deacon Brown delighted with his scheme of bringing the wagon over as a surprise for the Peppers to take a drive in was on the side of the narrow foot path chuckling and rubbing his hands together You won t have to drive so easy as you used to Ben he called out this fellow s chirk give him his head Sho what you goin that way for as Ben turned off down the lane To Grandma Bascom s shouted two or three voices Joel s over there sang out Polly We couldn t go without him you know chirped Phronsie poking a distressed little face up from the straw heap Twould serve him just right if we did said Van He s a great chap to stay over there like this No no cried Dick in terror don t go without Joel I d rather have him than any of you he added not over politely Phronsie began to cry piteously at the mere thought of Joel s being left behind He wanted to see mister Beebe she managed to say and dear missus Beebe Oh don t go without him So mister King made them hand her up to him and at the risk of their both rolling out he held her in his lap until the wagon stopping at the door of Grandma Bascom s cottage brought Joel bounding out with a whoop Jolly where d you get that and where are you going all in one breath as he swung himself up behind Deacon Brown brought it over just now cried Polly As a surprise furnished Percy Isn t he a fine old chap Here s for the very jolliest go We re going to see dear mister Beebe and dear missus Beebe announced Phronsie smiling through her tears and leaning out of the old gentleman s lap to nod at him Hurrah screamed Joel Good by Grandma to the old lady whose cap frills were framed in the small window I ve had a fine time in there he condescended to say but nothing further as to the details could they extract from him and so at last they gave it up and lent their attention to the various things to be seen as the wagon spun along And so over and through the town and to the very door of the little shoe shop and there to be sure was mister Beebe the same as ever to welcome them and Joel found to his immense satisfaction that the stone pot was as full of sugary doughnuts as in the old days and Phronsie had her pink and white sticks and missus Beebe Oh ed and Ah ed over them all and couldn t bear to let them go when at last it was time to say good by And at last they all climbed into the old wagon and were off again on their round of visits It was not till the gray dusk of the winter afternoon settled down unmistakably so that no one could beg to stay out longer that they turned Deacon Brown s horse toward the little brown house It s going to snow to morrow I think observed Jasper squinting up at the leaden sky isn t it father Whoop exclaimed Joel then we will have sport I tell you It certainly looks like it said old mister King wrapping his fur lined coat closer Phronsie are you sure you are warm enough Yes Grandpapa dear she answered curling up deeper in the straw at his feet Do you remember how you would carry the red topped shoes home with you Phronsie cried Polly and then away they rushed again into Oh don t you remember this and you haven t forgotten that Jasper as wildly reminiscent now as the others for hadn t he almost as good as lived at the little brown house pray tell So the Whitneys looked curiously on without a chance to be heard in all the merry chatter and then they drew up at the gate of the parsonage where they were all to have supper When Phronsie woke up in the big bed by the side of her mother the next morning Polly was standing over her and looking down into her face Oh Phronsie she exclaimed in great glee the ground is all covered with snow O oh screamed Phronsie her brown eyes flying wide open do give me my shoes and stockings Polly do I ll be dressed in just one minute and thereupon ensued a merry scramble as she tumbled out of the big bed and commenced operations Polly running out to help Mamsie get the breakfast Mush seems good now we don t have to eat it cried Joel as they all at last sat around the board Twas good then said missus Pepper her black eyes roving over the faces before her How funny cried Percy Whitney who had run over from the parsonage to breakfast this yellow stuff is And he took up a spoonful of it gingerly You don t like it Percy don t try to eat it I ll make you a slice of toast cried Polly springing out of her chair in just one moment No you mustn t cried Dick bounding in in time to catch the last words Mamma said no one was to have anything different if we came to breakfast from what the Peppers are going to eat I like the yellow stuff give me some do and he slid into a chair and passed his plate to missus Pepper So you shall Dicky she said hastily And you will never taste sweeter food than this giving him a generous spoonful Grandpapa is eating ham and fried eggs over at the minister s house contributed Dick after satisfying his hunger a bit Ham and fried eggs exclaimed Mother Pepper aghast Why he never touches them You must be mistaken my boy No I m not said Dick obstinately The minister s wife said it was and she asked me if I wouldn t have some and I said I was going over to the Peppers to breakfast I d rather have some of theirs And Grandpapa said it was good the ham and fried eggs was and he took it twice he did missus Pepper Took it twice she repeated faintly with troubled visions of the future Well well the mischief is done now so there is no use in talking about it but I m worried all the same Hurry up Percy called Joel across the table and don t dawdle so We re going to make a double ripper four yards long to go down that hill there He laid down his spoon to point out the window at a distant snow covered slope Percy shivered but recalling himself in time said Splendid and addressed himself with difficulty to his mush Well you ll never be through at that speed declared Joel See I ve eaten three saucerfuls and he handed his plate up And now for the fourth Mamsie Oh baked potatoes cried Ben rolling one around in his hand before he took off its crackling skin Weren t they good though with a little salt I tell you they helped us to chop wood in the old times I really think I shall have to try one said Percy who deeply to his regret was obliged to confess that Indian meal mush had few charms for his palate There s real milk in my mug now cried Phronsie with long deep draughts Polly did I ever have anything but make believe in the little brown house ever Polly Polly was saved from answering by a stamping of snowy boots on the flat doorstone Hurrah there cried Van rushing in followed by Jasper Hoh you slow people in the little brown house come on for the double ripper IX A SUDDEN BLOW Mamsie cried Polly suddenly and resting her hands on her knees as she sat on the floor before the stove do you suppose there is any one poor enough in Badgertown to need the little brown house when we lock it up to morrow Not a soul replied missus Pepper quickly no more than there was when we first locked it up five years ago Polly I ve been all over that with the parson last evening and he says there isn t a new family in the place and all the old ones have their homes the same as ever So we can turn the key and leave it with a clear conscience Polly drew a long breath of delight and gazed long at the face of the stove that seemed to crackle out an answering note of joy as the wood snapped merrily then she slowly looked around the kitchen It s so perfectly lovely Mamsie she broke out at length to see the dear old things and to know that they are waiting here for us to come back whenever we want to And to think it isn t wicked not to have them used because everybody has all they need oh it s so delicious to think they can be left to themselves She folded her hands now across her knees and drew another long breath of content Phronsie stole out of the bedroom and came slowly up to her mother s side pausing a bit on the way to look into Polly s absorbed face I don t think Mamsie she said quietly that people ought to be so very good who ve never had a little brown house never in all their lives Oh yes they had child said missus Pepper briskly places don t make any difference It s people s duty to be good wherever they are But Phronsie s face expressed great incredulity I m always going to live here when I am a big grown up woman she declared slowly gazing around the kitchen and I shall never never go out of Badgertown Oh Phronsie exclaimed Polly turning around in dismay why you couldn t do that Just think child whatever in the world would Grandpapa do or any of us pray tell Grandpapa would come here declared Phronsie decidedly and shaking her yellow head to enforce her statement Of course Grandpapa would come here Polly We couldn t live without him That s it said Polly with a corresponding shake of her brown head of course we couldn t live without Grandpapa and just as of course he couldn t leave his own dear home He never would be happy Phronsie to do that Phronsie took a step or two into the sunshine lying on the middle of the old kitchen floor Then I d rather not come Polly she said But she sighed and Polly was just about saying We ll run down now and then perhaps Phronsie as we have done now when the door was thrown open suddenly and Joel burst in his face as white as a sheet and working fearfully Oh Polly you must tell missus Whitney I can t Polly sprang to her feet missus Pepper who had just stepped into the pantry was saying I think Polly I ll make some apple dumplings the boys like them so much What is it Joe cried Polly hoarsely and standing quite still Phronsie with wide eyes went up and took the boy s cold hand and gazed into his face as he leaned against the door Dick groaned Joel oh oh I can t bear it and covering his face with one hand he would have pulled the other from Phronsie s warm little palm but she held it fast Tell me at once Joe commanded Polly Hush mother but missus Pepper was already out of the pantry Joel said missus Pepper whatever it is tell us immediately The look in her black eyes forced him to gasp in one breath Dick fell off the double ripper and both of his legs are broken may be not he added in a loud scream Phronsie still held the boy s hand He was conscious of it and that she uttered no word and then he knew no more Leave him to me Polly said missus Pepper through drawn lips and then do you run as you have never run before to the parsonage Oh if they should bring him there before the mother hears Phronsie dropped the hand she held and running on unsteady little feet into the bedroom came back with Polly s hood and coat Let me go cried Polly wildly rushing away from the detaining hand to the door I don t want those things on Let me go Phronsie You ll be cold said Phronsie With all her care her little white lips were quivering as she held out the things Please Polly she said piteously The child is right put them on commanded missus Pepper for one instant taking her thought from her boy and Polly obeyed and was gone In the parsonage best room sat missus Whitney Her rocking chair was none of the easiest being a hair cloth affair its cushion very much elevated in the world just where it should have been depressed so that one was in constant danger of slipping off its surface moreover the arms and back of the chair were covered with indescribable arrangements made and presented by loving parishioners and demanding unceasing attention from the occupant But the chair was drawn up in the sunshine pouring into the window and missus Whitney s thoughts were sunny too for she smiled now and then as she drew her needle busily in and out through the bright wools How restful it all is here and so quaint and simple She glanced up now to the high backed mantel with its wealth of daguerreotypes and surprising collection of dried leaves in tall china vases and over the walls adorned with pine cone framed pictures to the center table loaded with Annuals and one or two volumes of English poetry and then her gaze took in the little paths the winter sunshine was making for itself along the red and green ingrain carpet I am so glad father thought to bring us all Dear father it is making a new man of him this winter frolic Why She was looking out of the window now and her hands fell to her lap as Polly Pepper came running breathlessly down the village street her hood untied and the coat grasped with one hand and held together across her breast But it was the face that terrified missus Whitney and hurrying out of her chair she ran out to the veranda as the girl rushed through the gateway Polly child cried missus Whitney seizing her with loving arms and drawing her on the steps oh what is it dear Polly s lips moved but no words came Oh at last don t hate us for bringing you to the little brown house Why did we come And convulsively she threw her young arms around the kind neck Oh Auntie Dicky is hurt but we don t know how much his legs Joel says but it may not be as bad as we think dear Auntie missus Whitney trembled so that she could scarcely stand Around them streamed the same winter sunshine that had been so bright a moment since How long ago it seemed And out of gathering clouds in her heart she was saying Polly dear God is good We will trust him She did not know her own voice nor realize when Polly led her mercifully within as a farmer s wagon came slowly down the street to stop at the parsonage gate nor even when Dick was brought in white and still could she think of him as her boy It was some other little figure and she must go and help them care for him Her boy would come bounding in presently happy and ruddy with a kiss for mamma and a world of happy nonsense just as usual It was only when missus Henderson came in and took her hand to lead her into the next room that it all came to her Oh Dick and she sprang to the side of the sofa where he lay My child my child And then came doctor Fisher and the truth was known One of Dick s legs was broken below the knee the other badly bruised Only Jasper and the mother remained in the room while the little doctor set the limb and after what seemed an age to the watchers the boy came out He bore it like a Trojan declared Jasper wiping his forehead I tell you Dick s our hero after this Now I should like to know how all this happened demanded mister King The old gentleman had remained at the parsonage to get a good morning nap while the snow frolic was in progress And he had been awakened by the unusual bustle below stairs in time to hear the welcome news that Dicky was all right since doctor Fisher was taking care of him He now presented himself in his dressing gown with his sleeping cap awry over a face in which anger distress and impatience strove for the mastery Speak up my boy to Jasper and tell us what you know about it Well the first thing I knew of any danger ahead said Jasper was hearing Dick sing out Hold up I supposed the double ripper all right didn t you Ben Yes said Ben sturdily and it was all right just exactly as we used to make them we boys there wasn t a weak spot anywhere in her sir Who was steering demanded old mister King almost fiercely I was said Van beginning boldly enough to let his voice die out in a tremulous effort Humph humph responded mister King grimly A bad business shaking his head Van would began Percy but his eye meeting Polly s he added We d none of us done any better I don t believe sir than Van Van was now choking so badly that the greatest kindness seemed to be not to look at him Accordingly the little company turned their eyes away and regarded each other instead Well so Dick rolled off proceeded the old gentleman Oh no he didn t said all three boys together he stuck fast to the double ripper we ran into a tree and Dick was pitched off head first But honestly and truly father said Jasper I do not think that it was the fault of the steerer Indeed it was not declared Ben stoutly there was an ugly little gully that we hadn t seen under the snow We d been down four or five times all right but only missed it by a hair breadth this time the ripper struck into it I suppose Dick felt it bump as it was on his side and sang out and as quick as lightning we were against that tree It was as much my fault as any one s and more because I ought to have known that old hill thoroughly I share the blame Ben broke in Jasper old fellow if you pitch into yourself you ll have to knock me over too Come here Vanny said old mister King holding out his hand Why you needn t be afraid my boy aghast at the tears that no power on earth could keep back Now all leave the room please Where s Polly asked Ben on the other side of the door She s run home said David I guess She isn t here And that s where I must be too cried Ben bounding off When Van was next seen he was with old mister King and wearing all signs of having received his full share of comfort Phronsie just tying on her little hood to go down to the parsonage to ask after Dicky looked out of the window to exclaim in pleased surprise Why here comes dear Grandpapa and then she rushed out to meet him Here s my little girl cried the old gentleman opening his arms when she immediately ran into them Now we re all right Is Dicky all right asked Phronsie anxiously as she fell into step by his side Yes indeed as well as a youngster can be who s broken his leg Phronsie shivered But then that s nothing mister King hastened to add I broke my own when I was a small shaver no bigger than Dick and I was none the worse for it Boys always have some such trifling mishaps Phronsie Ben never broke his leg nor Joel nor Davie said Phronsie Must they yet Grandpapa O dear no declared mister King hastily that isn t necessary I only meant they must have something Now you see Ben had the measles you know Yes he did said Phronsie quite relieved to think that this trial could take the place of the usual leg breaking episode in a boy s career And so did Joel and Davie all of them Grandpapa dear Exactly well and then Ben had to work hard and Joel and Davie too for that matter So you see it wasn t as essential that they should break their legs child But Jasper and Percy and Van don t have to work hard oh I don t want them to break their legs said Phronsie in a worried tone You don t think they will Grandpapa dear do you Please say they won t I don t think there is the least danger of it said mister King especially as I shall put an end to this double ripper business though not because this upset was anybody s fault remember that Phronsie Van s head which had dropped a bit at the last words came up proudly Van here has acted nobly he put his hand on the boy s shoulder and would have saved Dicky if he could It was a pure accident that nobody could help except by keeping off from the abominable thing Well here we are at the little brown house and there s your mother Phronsie waiting for us in the doorway Halloo cried Van rushing over the flat stone and past missus Pepper where s Joel Oh here you old chap Well missus Pepper said the old gentleman coming up to the step Phronsie hanging to his hand this looks like starting for town to morrow doesn t it Oh what shall we do sir cried missus Pepper in distress To think you have come down here in the goodness of your heart to be met with such an accident as this What shall we do she repeated Goodness of my heart repeated mister King nevertheless well pleased at the tribute I ve had as much pleasure out of it all as you or the young people I want you to realize that So does any one who does a kind act replied missus Pepper wiping her eyes well sir now how shall we manage about going back That remains to be seen said mister King slowly and he took a long look at the winter sky and the distant landscape before he ventured more It very much looks as if we all should remain for a few days to see how Dick is to get on all but the four boys they must pack off to school to morrow and then probably missus Whitney will stay over with the boy till he can be moved doctor Fisher will do the right thing by him Oh everything is all right missus Pepper missus Pepper sighed and led the way into the house She knew in spite of the reassuring words that the extreme limit of the outing ought to be passed on the morrow X THE PARTY SEPARATES Good by to the little brown house Joel and David Percy and Van sang out in doleful chorus from the old stage coach two of the boys on the seat shared by John Tisbett the other two within as companions to missus Pepper and Jasper who were going home to start the quartette off to school Ben and I will take good care of everything Mamsie said Polly for the fiftieth time and climbing up on the steps to tuck the traveling shawl closer Thereupon Phronsie climbed up too to do the same thing Don t you worry we ll take care of things she echoed I shan t worry said missus Pepper in a bright assured way Mother knows you ll both do just right And Phronsie ll be a good girl too with a long look into the bright eyes peering over the window casing of the old coach I ll try said Phronsie Good by Mamsie and she tried to stand on tiptoe to reach her mouth up Goodness me cried Polly you nearly tumbled off the steps Throw her a kiss Phronsie Mamsie ll catch it If that child wants to kiss her ma agen she shall do it declared mister Tisbett and throwing down the reins he sprang to the ground seized Phronsie and swung her lightly over the window edge There you be went through just like a bird And there she was sure enough in missus Pepper s lap I should like to go with you Phronsie was whispering under missus Pepper s bonnet strings Mamsie I should Oh no Phronsie missus Pepper made haste to whisper back You must stay with Polly Why what would she ever do without you Be mother s good girl Phronsie you re all coming home except Auntie and Dick in a few days Phronsie cast one look at Polly Good by she said slowly Take me out now holding her arms towards mister Tisbett Here you be exclaimed mister Tisbett merrily reversing the process and setting her carefully on the ground Now says I up I goes his foot on the wheel to spring to the box Stay a peremptory hand was laid on his shaggy coat sleeve and he turned to face old mister King When I meet a man who can do such a kind thing it is worth my while to say that I trust no words of mine gave offense Bless you man added the old gentleman abruptly changing the tone of his address as well as its form it s my way that s all John Tisbett had no words to offer but remained his foot on the wheel stupidly staring up at the handsome old face We shall be late for the train called Jasper within the coach if you don t start Get up do cried Joel who had seized the reins or I ll drive off without you mister Tisbett which had the effect to carry honest John briskly up to his place When there he took off his fur cap without a word and bowed to mister King cracked his whip and they were off leaving the four on the little foot path gazing after them till the coach was only a speck in the distance Mamma dear said Dick one afternoon three weeks later the little brown house had been closed a fortnight and all the rest of the party back in town when are we going home Next week said missus Whitney brightly the doctor thinks if all goes well you can be moved from here Dick leaned back in the big chintz covered chair Mamma he said your cheeks aren t so pink and not quite so round but I think you are a great deal nicer mamma than you were Do you Dick she said laughing Well we have had a happy time together haven t we The fortnight hasn t been so long for you as I feared when the others all went away It hasn t been long at all said Dick promptly and burrowing deeper into the chair back it s just flown mamma I like Polly and Phronsie but I d rather have you than any girl I know I had really mamma I m very glad to hear it Dick said missus Whitney with another laugh And when I grow up I m just going to live with you forever and ever Do you suppose papa will be always going to Europe then I trust not said missus Whitney fervently Dicky would you like to have a secret she asked suddenly The boy s eyes sparkled Wouldn t I mamma he cried springing forward in the chair ugh Take care darling warned his mother You must remember the poor leg Dick made a grimace but otherwise took the pain pluckily Tell me do mamma he begged the secret Yes I thought it would be a pleasant thing for you to have it to think of darling while you are getting well Dicky papa is coming home soon Right away shouted Dick so lustily that missus Henderson popped her head in the door Oh beg your pardon she said I thought you wanted something Isn t it lovely cried missus Whitney to have a boy who is beginning to find his lungs Indeed it is cried the parson s wife laughing I always picked up heart when my children were able to scream It s good to hear you Dicky as she closed the door Is he is he is he cried Dick in a spasm of excitement coming right straight away mamma Next week said mamma with happy eyes he sails in the Servia Next week Dicky my boy we will see papa And here is the best part of the secret Listen it has all been arranged that mister Duyckink shall live in Liverpool so that papa will not have to go across any more but he can stay at home with us Oh Dicky That Oh Dicky told volumes to the boy s heart Mamma he said at last isn t it good that God didn t give boys and girls to mister Duyckink Because you see if he had why then mister Duyckink wouldn t like to live over there mister Duyckink might not have felt as your father does Dicky dear about having his children educated at home and missus Duyckink wants to go to England she hasn t any father as I have Dicky dear who clings to the old home Only I wish God had made mister Duyckink and missus Duyckink a little sooner said Dick reflectively I mean made them want to go to England sooner don t you mamma I suppose we ought not to wish that said his mother with a smile for perhaps we needed to be taught to be patient Only now Dicky just think we can actually have papa live at home with us Your cheeks are pink now observed Dick just the very pink they used to be mamma missus Whitney ran to the old fashioned looking glass hanging in its pine stained frame between the low windows and peered in Do I look just as I did when papa went away six months ago Dicky she asked anxiously Yes said Dick just like that only a great deal nicer he added enthusiastically His mother laughed and pulled at a bright wave on her forehead dodging a bit to avoid a long crack running across the looking glass front Here s doctor Fisher shouted Dick suddenly Now you old fellow you and shaking his small fist at his lame leg you ve got to get well I tell you I won t wait much longer sir And as the doctor came in I ve a secret Well then you would better keep it said doctor Fisher Good morning to missus Whitney Our young man here is getting ahead pretty fast I should think How s the leg Dicky sitting down by him The leg is all right cried Dick I m going to step on it trying to get out of the chair Dicky cried his mother in alarm Softly softly now young man said doctor Fisher I suppose you want me to cure that leg of yours and make it as good as the other one don t you Why of course replied Dick that s what you are a doctor for Well I won t agree to do anything of the sort said the little doctor coolly if you don t do your part Do you know what patience means I ve been patient exclaimed Dick in a dudgeon forever and ever so many weeks and now papa is coming home and I And then he realized what he had done and he turned quite pale and looked at his mother Her face gave no sign but he sank back in his chair feeling disgraced for life and ready to keep quiet forever And he was so good while doctor Fisher was attending to his leg that when he was through the little doctor turned to him approvingly Well sir I think that I can promise that you can go home Saturday You ve improved beyond my expectation But Dick didn t hurrah nor even smile Dicky said missus Whitney smiling into his downcast face how glad we are to hear that just think good doctor Fisher says we may go next Saturday I m glad mumbled Dick in a forlorn little voice and till after the door closed on the retreating form of the doctor it was all that could be gotten out of him Then he turned and put out both arms to his mother I didn t mean I didn t mean I truly didn t mean to tell mamma he sobbed as she clasped him closely I know you didn t dear she soothed him It has really done no harm papa didn t want the home people to know as he wants to surprise them But it was a secret said Dick between his tears feeling as if he had lost a precious treasure entrusted to him Oh mamma I really didn t mean to let it go Mamma feels quite sure of that said missus Whitney gently You are right Dicky in feeling sorry and ashamed because anything given to you to keep is not your own but belongs to another but my boy the next duty is to keep back those tears all this is hurting your leg Dick struggled manfully but still the tears rolled down his cheeks At last he said raising his head You would much better let me have my cry out mamma it s half way and it hurts to send it back Well I don t think so said missus Whitney with a laugh I ve often wanted to have a cry out as you call it But that s weak Dicky and should be stopped for the more one cries the more one wants to You ve often wanted to have a cry out repeated Dick in such amazement that every tear just getting ready to show itself immediately rushed back again Why you haven t anything to cry for mamma Indeed I have she declared often and often I do many things that I ought not to do Oh never never cried Dick clutching her around the neck to the detriment of her lace trimmed wrapper My sweetest dearingest mamma is ever and always just right Indeed Dick said missus Whitney earnestly the longer I live I find that every day I have something to be sorry for in myself But God you know is good she whispered softly Dick was silent And then when papa goes continued missus Whitney why then my boy it is very hard not to cry Here was something that the boy could grasp and he seized it with avidity And you stop crying for us he cried I know now why you always put on your prettiest gown and play games with us the evening after papa goes I know now Here are three letters cried the parson hurrying in and tossing them over to the boy And Polly Pepper has written to me too Dick screamed with delight Two for me one from Ben and one from Grandpapa And mine is from Phronsie said missus Whitney seizing an epistle carefully printed in blue crayon But although there were three letters from home none of them carried the news of what was going on there None of them breathed a syllable that Cousin Eunice Chatterton was ill with a low fever aggravated by nervous prostration and that missus Pepper and Polly were having a pretty hard time of it On the contrary every bit of news was of the cheeriest nature Jasper tucked on a postscript to his father s letter in which he gave the latest bulletin of his school life And Polly did the same thing to Ben s letter Even Phronsie went into a long detail concerning the new developments of a wonderful kitten she had left at home to take her visit to Badgertown so the two recipients never missed the lack of information in regard to the household life from which they were shut out Only once missus Whitney said thoughtfully as she folded her letter and slipped it back into its envelope They don t speak of missus Chatterton I presume she has changed her plans and is going to remain longer at her nephew s I hope she ll live there always declared Dick looking up savagely from Ben s letter What an old guy she is mamma Dick Dick said his mother reprovingly she is our guest you know Not if she is at her nephew s said Dick triumphantly turning back to his letter Polly at this identical minute was slowly ascending the stairs a tray in one hand the contents of which she was anxiously regarding on the way I do hope it is right now she said and presently knocked at missus Chatterton s door Come in said that lady s voice fretfully And Do close the door before Polly and her tray were well within Polly shut the door gently and approached the bedside I am so faint I do not know that I can take any said missus Chatterton Whether it was her white cashmere dressing robe and her delicate lace cap that made her face against the pillows seem wan and white Polly did not know But it struck her that she looked more ill than usual and she said earnestly I am so sorry I wasn t quicker There is no call for an apology from you said missus Chatterton coldly Set the tray down on the table and get a basin of water I need to be bathed Polly stood quite still even forgetting to deposit the tray Set the tray down I told you repeated missus Chatterton sharply and then get the basin of water I will call Hortense said Polly quietly placing the tray as desired Hortense has gone to the apothecary s said missus Chatterton and I will not have one of the other maids they are too insufferable And indeed Polly knew that it would be small use to summon one of them as Martha the most obliging had airily tossed her head when asked to do some little service for the sick woman that very morning declaring I will never lift another finger for that Madame Chatterton My neck aches and my side and my head said missus Chatterton irritably why do you not do as I bid you For one long instant Polly hesitated then she turned to rush from the room a flood of angry bitter feelings surging through her heart more at the insufferable tone and manner than at what she was bidden to do Only turned and she was back by the side of the bed and looking down into the fretful dictatorial old face I will bathe you missus Chatterton she said gently I ll bring the water in a minute XI POOR POLLY You are very awkward child observed missus Chatterton to Polly on her knees and abrupt Move the sponge more slowly there that is better Polly shifted her position from one aching knee to another set her lips closer together and bent all her young energies to gentler effects But missus Chatterton cried out irritably Have you never taken care of a sick person pray tell or is it all your back country training that makes you so heavy handed I helped mother take care of Phronsie when she had the measles and Ben and Joel said Polly five years ago we haven t been sick lately Humph ejaculated missus Chatterton not very elegantly But what was the use of a fine manner when there was nobody but a little back country maiden to see it I shall have to endure it till Hortense returns she said with a sigh besides it is my duty to give you something useful to do in this house You should be thankful that I allow you to bathe me Polly s eyes flashed and the hand holding the sponge trembled Nothing but the fear of troubling Mamsie and dear old mister King whose forbearance was worn to the finest of threads kept her at her post Now get the violet water said missus Chatterton with an air she would never have dared employ towards Hortense it is the bottle in the lower left hand corner of the case Polly got up from her knees and stiffly stumbled across the room to the case of silver mounted toilet articles in her tumult bringing away the upper right hand corner vial Stupide exclaimed missus Chatterton among her pillows Go back and do as I bid you girl the lower left hand corner bottle Without a word Polly returned and bringing the right vial set about its use as directed in a rapidly growing dismay at the evil feelings surging through her warning her it would not be safe to stay in the room much longer Do you understand presently began missus Chatterton fastening her cold blue eyes upon her what your position is in this house Everybody else appears to be blind and idiotic to the last degree you seem to have a little quickness to catch an idea As Polly did not answer the question was repeated very sharply Do you understand what your position is in this house Yes said Polly in a low voice and dashing out the violet water with a reckless hand I do Take care impatiently cried missus Chatterton Then she pushed her pillow into a better position and returned to the charge What is it pray since you understand it so well I understand that I am here in this house said Polly quite cold and white because dear mister King wants me to be here DEAR mister King echoed missus Chatterton in shrill disdain Stuff and nonsense and she put her head back for an unpleasant cackle it could hardly be called a laugh What an idiot the man is to have the wool pulled over his eyes in this fashion I ll tell you Polly and she raised herself up on her elbow the soft lace falling away from the white and yet shapely arm This member had been one of her strongest claims to beauty and even in her rage missus Chatterton paused a second to glance complacently at it in its new position you are when all is said about your dear mister King and your absurd assumption of equality with refined people who frequent this house exactly the same underbred country girl as you were in your old brown house goodness knows wherever that is I m glad I am declared Polly And she actually laughed merrily while she squared her sturdy shoulders Nothing could be sweeter than to hear it said she was worthy of the dear little old brown house and didn t disgrace Mamsie s bringing up The laugh was the last feather that overthrew missus Chatterton s restraint She was actually furious now that she widow of Algernon Chatterton who was own cousin to Jasper Horatio King should be faced by such presumption and her words put aside with girlish amusement And I ll tell you more she went on sitting quite erect now on the bed your mother thinks she is doing a fine thing to get all her family wormed in here in this style but she ll Polly Pepper the girlish gladness gone from heart and face waited for no more OUR MOTHER she cried stormily unable to utter another word oh oh Her breath came in quick short gasps the hot indignant blood mounting to the brown waves of hair on her brow while she clasped her hands so tightly together the pain at any other time would have made her scream missus Chatterton aghast at the effect of her words leaned back once more against her pillows Don t try to work up a scene she endeavored to say carelessly But she might as well have remonstrated with the north wind The little country maiden had a temper as well as her own and all the more for its long restraint now on breaking bounds it rushed at the one who had provoked it utterly regardless that it was the great missus Algernon Chatterton For two minutes so breathlessly did Polly hurl the stinging sentences at the figure on the bed Cousin Eunice was obliged to let her have her own way Then as suddenly the torrent ceased Polly grew quite white What have I done oh what have I done she cried and rushed out of the room Polly Polly called Jasper s voice below She knew he wanted her to try a new duet he had gone down town to purchase but how could she play with such a storm in her heart and worse than all else was the consciousness that she had spoken to one whose gray hairs should have made her forget the provocation received words that now plunged her into a hot shame to recall She flew over the stairs up away from every one s sight to a long dark lumber room partially filled with trunks and a few articles of furniture prized as heirlooms but no longer admissible in the family apartments Polly closed the door behind her and sank down in the shadow of a packing box half filled with old pictures in a distress that would not even let her think She covered her face with her hands too angry with herself to cry too aghast at the mischief she had done to even remember the dreadful words missus Chatterton had said to her For of course now she will complain to Mamsie and I m really afraid mister King will find it out and it only needs a little thing to make him send her off He said yesterday doctor Valentine told him there was nothing really the matter with her and dear I don t know what will happen To poor Polly crouching there on the floor in the dim and dusty corner it seemed as if her wretchedness held no hope Turn whichever way she might the dreadful words she had uttered rang through her heart They could not be unsaid they were never to be forgotten but must always stay and rankle there Oh oh she moaned clasping her knees with distressed little palms and swaying back and forth why didn t I remember what Mamsie has always told us that no insult can do us harm if only we do not say or do anything in return Why why couldn t I have remembered it How long she stayed there she never knew But at last realizing that every moment there was only making matters worse she dragged herself up from the little heap on the floor and trying to put a bit of cheerfulness into a face she knew must frighten Mamsie she went slowly out and down the stairs But no one looked long enough at her face to notice its change of expression Polly the moment she turned towards the household life again could feel that the air was charged with some intense excitement Hortense met her on the lower stairs the maid was startled out of her usual nonchalance and was actually in a hurry What is the matter cried Polly Oh the Madame is eel said the maid the doctaire says it is not a lie dees time and she swept past Polly Polly clung to the stair railing her face whitening and her gaze fastened upon missus Chatterton s door where Hortense was now disappearing Inside was a sound of voices and that subdued stir that gives token of a sick room I have killed her cried Polly s heart For one wild moment she was impelled to flight anywhere she did not care where to shake off by motion in the free air this paralysis of fear But the next she started and rushing down the stairs and into mister King s room cried out Oh dear Grandpapa will missus Chatterton die No no I think not replied the old gentleman surprised at her feeling Cousin Eunice never did show much self control but then I don t believe this piece of bad news will kill her Bad news gasped Polly hanging to the table where mister King was writing letters Oh Grandpapa what do you mean Bless me where have you been Polly Pepper said mister King settling his eyeglass to regard her closely not to hear the uproar in this house Yes missus Chatterton received a telegram a half hour since that her nephew the only one that she was very fond of among her relatives was drowned at sea and she has been perfectly prostrated by it till she really is quite ill Polly waited to hear no more but on the wings of the wind flew out and up the stairs once more Where have you been Polly cried Jasper coming out of a side passage in time to catch a dissolving view of her flying figure Polly Polly and he took three steps to her one and gained her side Oh don t stop me begged Polly flying on don t Jasper He took a good look at her face Anything I can help you about he asked quickly She suddenly stopped her foot on the stair above Oh Jasper she cried with clasped hands you don t know she may die and I said horribly cruel things to her Who missus Chatterton said the boy opening his dark eyes why you couldn t have said cruel things to her Polly Don t be foolish child He spoke as he would to Phronsie s terror and smiled into her face But it did not reassure Polly Jasper you don t know you can t guess what dreadful things I said cried poor overwhelmed Polly clasping her hands tightly together at the mere thought of the words she had uttered Then she must have said dreadful things to you said the boy She but oh Jasper that doesn t make it any better for me said Polly Don t stop me I am going to see if they won t let me do something for her There are ever so many people up there now said Jasper Your mother and Hortense and two or three maids What in the world could you do Polly Come down into the library and tell us all about it But Polly broke away from him with an Oh I must do something for her speeding on until she softly worked her way into the sick room missus Pepper was busy with the doctor in the further part of the room and Polly stood quite still for a moment wishing she were one of the maids to whom a bit of active service was given She could not longer endure her thoughts in silence and gently going up to her mother s side with a timorous glance at the bed as she passed it she begged Mamsie can t I do something for her missus Pepper glanced up quickly No yes you can take this prescription down to Oakley s to be prepared Polly seized the bit of paper from doctor Valentine s hand and hurried out Again she glanced fearfully at the bed but the curtain on that side was drawn so that only the outline of the figure could be seen She was soon out on the street the movement through the fresh air bringing back a little color to her cheek and courage to her heart Things did not seem quite so bad if she only might do something for the poor sick woman that could atone for the wretched work she had done at least it would be some comfort if the invalid could be helped by her service Thus revolving everything in her mind Polly did not hear her name called nor rapid footsteps hurrying after Wait at last cried a voice O dear me what is the matter Polly Alexia Rhys drew herself up flushed and panting at Polly s side I m on the way to the apothecary s said Polly without looking around So I should suppose said Alexia O dear I m so hot and tired Do go a bit slower Polly I can t said Polly She s very sick and I must get this just as soon as I can She waved the prescription at her and redoubled her speed Who gasped Alexia stumbling after as best she could missus Chatterton said Polly a lump in her throat as she uttered the name O dear me that old thing cried Alexia her enthusiasm over the errand gone Hush said Polly hoarsely she may die She has had bad news What asked Alexia the uncomfortable walk might be enlivened by a bit of stray gossip what is it Polly What news A telegram said Polly Her favorite nephew was drowned at sea Oh I didn t know she had any favorite nephew Doesn t she fight with everybody Do be quiet begged Polly No that is perhaps other people are not kind to her Oh said Alexia in a surprised voice Well I think she s perfectly and all through and through horrid so Don t race like this through the streets Polly You ll get there soon enough But Polly turned a deaf ear and at last the prescription was handed over the counter at Oakley s and after what seemed an endless time to Polly the medicine was given to her Now as soon as you carry that thing home observed Alexia glancing at the white parcel in Polly s hand I hope you ll come with us girls That s what I ran after you for What girls asked Polly Why Philena and the Cornwalls we are going to have a sleighing party to night and a supper at Lilly Drexell s missus Cornwall chaperones the thing Polly was surprised to feel her heart bound It hadn t seemed as if it could ever be moved by any news of girlish frolics but that its dull ache must go on forever Oh I can t she cried the next moment I must stay at home and help take care of missus Chatterton Nonsense exclaimed Alexia in a provoked tone you are not wanted there Polly Pepper the idea with that great house full of servants Well I shall not go declared Polly sharply you needn t ask me Alexia I shall stay home till she gets well You little idiot cried Alexia thoroughly out of temper But as this produced no effect on Polly she began to wheedle and coax Now Polly do be reasonable You know we can t go without you you wouldn t spoil the whole thing you know you wouldn t I shall just tell the Cornwalls that you are coming and she turned off to the corner of the avenue Indeed you will not called Polly after her Don t you dare do that Alexia Rhys she said with flashing eyes You are the most uncomfortable girl I ever saw cried Alexia stopping to come slowly back You spoil every bit of fun with your absurd notions I m quite quite put out with you Polly I m sorry said poor Polly fairly longing for the snow revel and dismayed at disappointing the girls No you re not pouted Alexia and I shall tell them all so and she broke away and ran off in the opposite direction Polly was met at the door by missus Pepper who grasped the packet of medicine quickly Isn t there anything else I can do Mamsie begged Polly No sit down and rest you re hot and tired you ve run so I m not tired said Polly not daring to ask Is she better Well you must be said missus Pepper hurrying off going all the way down to Oakley s So Polly had nothing to do but to sit out in the hall and listen and watch all the movements in the sick room every one of which but increased her terror At least she could bear it no longer and as doctor Valentine came out putting on his gloves she rushed after him Oh will she die she begged please do tell me sir Die no indeed I hope not said doctor Valentine She has had a severe shock to her nerves and her age is against her but she is coming around all right I trust Why Polly I thought better things of you my girl He glanced down into the distressed face with professional disfavor I m so glad she won t die breathed Polly wholly lost to his opinion of her and her face gleamed with something of her old brightness I didn t know you were so fond of her observed doctor Valentine grimly indeed to speak truthfully I have yet to learn that anybody is fond of her Polly Now if you really want to help her he continued thoughtfully pulling his beard as Polly did not answer I can give you one or two hints that might be of use Oh I do I do cried Polly with eagerness It will be tiresome work said doctor Valentine but it will be a piece of real charity and perhaps Polly it s as well for you to begin now as to wait till you can belong to forty charity clubs and spend your time going to committee meetings And he laughed not altogether pleasantly How was Polly to know that missus Valentine was immersed up to her ears in a philanthropic sea with the smallest possible thought for the doctor s home Now that maid said the physician dropping his tone to a confidential one is as well as the average but she s not the one who is to amuse the old lady It s that she needs more than medicine Polly She actually requires diversion Poor Polly stood as if turned to stone Diversion And she had thrown away all chance of that She is suffering for the companionship of some bright young nature doctor Valentine proceeded attributing the dismay written all over the girl s face to natural unwillingness to do the service After she gets over this attack she needs to be read to for one thing to be told the news to be made to forget herself But of course Polly he said hastily buttoning his top coat and opening the outer door it s too much to ask of you so think no more about it child XII NEW WORK FOR POLLY It was Saturday morning and Polly ran upstairs with a bright face the morning Journal in her hand I m going to stay with missus Chatterton Hortense she announced to that functionary in the dressing room And a comfairte may it gif to you said Hortense with a vicious shake of the silk wrapper in her hand before hanging it in its place Madame has the tres diablerie cross as de two steeks what you call it dis morning Polly went softly into the room closing the door gently after her In the shadow of one corner of the large apartment sat missus Chatterton under many wrappings in the depths of an invalid s chair Polly went up to her side Would you like to have me read the news missus Chatterton she asked gently missus Chatterton turned her head and looked at her No she was about to say shortly just as she had repulsed many little offers of Polly s for the past few days but somehow this morning the crackling of the fresh sheet in the girl s hand suggestive of crisp bits of gossip was too much for her to hear indifferently especially as she was in a worse state of mind than usual over Hortense and her bad temper You may sit down and read a little if you like she said ungraciously So Polly happy as a queen at the permission slipped into a convenient chair and began at once She happened fortunately on just the right things for the hungry ears a description of a large church wedding the day before two or three bits about society people that missus Chatterton had lost sight of and a few other items just as acceptable Polly read on and on from one thing to another not daring to look up to see the effect until at last everything in the way of gossip was exhausted Is that all asked missus Chatterton hungrily Polly hunting the columns for anything even a murder account if it was but in high life turned the paper again disconsolately obliged to confess it was Well do put it by then said missus Chatterton sharply and not whirl it before my face it gives me a frightful headache I might get the Town Talk suggested Polly as a bright thought struck her It came yesterday I saw it on the library table So it is Saturday missus Chatterton looked up quickly Yes you may Polly her mouth watering for the revel she would have in its contents So Polly ran over the stairs with delighted feet and into the library beginning to rummage over the papers and magazines on the reading table Where is it she exclaimed turning them with quick fingers O dear it was right here last evening What is it asked Phronsie from the depths of a big arm chair and looking up from her book Then she saw as soon as she had asked the question that Polly was in trouble so she laid down her book and slid out of the chair What is it Polly Let me help you do Why the Town Talk that hateful old society thing said Polly throwing the papers to right and left You know Phronsie it has a picture of a bottle of ink and a big quill for a heading O dear do help me child for she will get nervous if I am gone long Oh I know where that is said Phronsie deliberately laying a cool little hand on Polly s hot one Where demanded Polly feverishly Oh Phronsie where Jack Rutherford has it Polly threw down the papers and started for the door He has gone said Phronsie he went home almost an hour ago Polly turned sharply at her What did he want Town Talk for He said it was big and he asked Grandpapa if he might have it and Grandpapa said Yes I don t know what he wanted it for said Phronsie And he took other newspapers too Polly oh ever so many Well I don t care how many he took nor what they were cried Polly only that very identical one O dear me Well I ll ask Jasper And rushing from the library Phronsie following in a small panic over Polly s distress she knocked at the door of Jasper s den a little room in the wing looking out on the east lawn Oh I am so glad you are here she exclaimed as Come in greeted her and both Phronsie and she precipitated themselves with no show of ceremony in front of his study table O Jasper could you get me a copy of Town Talk Jack Rutherford has gone off with ours Town Talk repeated Jasper raising his head from his hands to stare at her Yes Jack has taken ours off Grandpapa gave it to him Can you Jasper Will it break up your study much she poured out anxiously No that is never mind said Jasper pushing the book away and springing from his chair But whatever in the world do you want that trash for He turned and looked at her curiously missus Chatterton will let me read it to her she said so cried Polly clasping her hands nervously but if I don t get the paper soon why I m afraid she ll change her mind Jasper gave a low whistle as he flung himself into his coat Inestimable privilege he exclaimed at last tossing on his cap Oh Jasper you are so good cried Polly in a small rapture I m so sorry to have to ask you I ll go for you Jasper declared Phronsie Mamsie will let me I almost know she will No no Phronsie said Jasper as she was flying off it isn t any place for you to go to I shall get one at the hotel the Allibone I ll be back in a trice Polly Polly went out and sat down in one of the big oaken chairs in the hall to seize it as it came and Phronsie deposited herself in an opposite chair and watched Polly And presently in came Jasper waving the desired journal Polly with a beaming face grasped it and rushed off upstairs Polly called the boy looking after her it isn t too late now for you to go with them Lucy Bennett met me at the corner and she said they will take the twelve o clock train instead of the eleven and she wanted me to beg you to come No no tossed back Polly rushing on I am quite determined to stay at home Then she went into missus Chatterton s room and closed the door But she couldn t so easily shut out the longings that would rise in her heart for the Saturday outing that the other girls were to have How lovely it would be the run out to Silvia Horne s charming house some ten miles distant the elegant luncheon they would have followed by games and a dance in the ball room upstairs that Silvia s older sisters used for their beautiful parties Then the merry return before dusk of the twelve girls all capital friends at school Oh oh You ve been an unconscionable time exclaimed missus Chatterton in a sharp high key just to get a paper Well do sit down I am quite tired waiting for you Polly sat down and resolutely plunged into the column where the news items promised the most plentiful yield but in between the lines ran the doings of the girls how they were all assembling by this time at Lucy Bennett s how they were hurrying off to the train and all the other delightful movements of the outing flashed before her eyes as she finished item after item of her dreary task But how missus Chatterton gloated over it At last Polly feeling as if she could not endure another five minutes of it glanced up to see the old lady s eyes actually sparkling her mouth had fallen into contented curves and the jeweled hand resting on the chair arm was playing with the fringe while she leaned forward that she might not lose a word Read that again Polly she said the list of presents exhibited at Arabella Granger s wedding I didn t hear any mention of the Archibalds It can t be that they have fallen out and read more slowly So Polly began once more the long lists of gifts that ushered in the matrimonial happiness of missus John Westover nee Miss Arabella Granger this time however stimulated by the pleasure she was giving to find it an endurable task It seemed to Polly as if missus John Westover had everything on earth given to her that could possibly be presented at a wedding nevertheless the list was gone through again bravely Polly retracing her steps two or three times to read the items over for her listener s slow digestion The Archibalds are not mentioned either as being there or sending a gift nor the Harlands nor the Smythes so I am very glad I didn t remember her said missus Chatterton drawing herself up with a relieved sigh Those presents sound fine on paper but it isn t as well as she might have done if she had made a different match Now something else Polly and she dismissed missus Westover with a careless wave of her hand Polly flew off into the fashion hints and was immediately lost in the whirl of coming toilets No one noticed when the door opened so of course no one saw missus Whitney standing smiling behind the old lady s big chair Well Polly said a pleasant voice suddenly Down went Town Talk to the floor as Polly sprang up with a glad cry and missus Chatterton turned around nervously Oh Auntie Auntie cried Polly convulsively clinging to her are you really here and is Dicky home Dear child said missus Whitney as much a girl for the moment as Polly herself And pressing kisses on the red lips while she folded her close Yes Dick is at home There go and find him he is in missus Pepper s room I am glad to see you so much better missus Chatterton said missus Whitney leaning over the invalid s chair to lay the tenderest of palms on the hand resting on the chair arm Oh yes Marian I am better said missus Chatterton looking around for Polly then down at the delicious Town Talk carelessly thrown on the floor Will you send her back as soon as possible she asked with her old imperativeness Who Polly said missus Whitney following the glance Why she has gone to see Dick you know Now why cannot I read a bit and she picked up the paper You don t know what has been read said missus Chatterton as missus Whitney drew up a chair and sat down running her eye in a practiced way over the front page Dear me it makes me quite nervous Marian to see you prowling around all over the sheet that way Oh I shall find something interesting quite soon I fancy said missus Whitney cheerfully her heart on her boy and the jolly home coming he was having Here is the Washington news I mean all about the receptions and teas She has read that said missus Chatterton Now for the fashion department missus Whitney whirled the paper over dexterously Do you know missus Chatterton gray stuffs are to be worn more than ever this spring I don t care about that said missus Chatterton quickly and besides quite likely there ll be a complete revolution before spring really sets in and gray stuffs will go out Find some description of tea gowns can t you I must have one or two more And here are some wonderfully pretty caps if they are all like the descriptions said missus Whitney unluckily dropping on another paragraph Caps who wants to hear about them cried missus Chatterton in a dudgeon I hope I m not at the cap period yet Oh those lovely little lace arrangements said missus Whitney hastily don t you know how exquisite they are at Pinaud s she cried I m sure I never noticed said missus Chatterton indifferently Hortense always arranges my hair better without lace If you can t find what I ask you Marian raising her voice to a higher key you needn t trouble to read at all Fortunately the description of the gown worn by Lady Hartly Cavendish at a London high tea stood out in bold relief as missus Whitney s eyes nervously ran over the columns again and she seized upon it But in just two moments she was interrupted Send that girl back again Marian cried missus Chatterton I had just got her trained so that she suits me It tires me to death to hear you I do not know whether Polly can come now said missus Whitney gently she Do not know whether Polly can come repeated missus Chatterton sharply and leaning forward in her chair Didn t I say I wanted her You did Marian s tone did not lose a note of its ordinary gentleness But I shall ask her if she is willing to do it as a favor missus Chatterton you quite understand that of course She too leaned forward in her chair and gazed into the cold hard face Just like your father cried missus Chatterton settling herself irascibly back in the chair depths again There is no hope that affairs in this house will mend I wash my hands of you I am so glad that you consider me like my father said missus Whitney gleefully as a child We surely are united on this question May I read some more cried Polly coming in softly and trying to calm the impetuous rush of delight as her eyes met missus Whitney s Yes I am waiting for you said missus Chatterton Begin where you left off missus Whitney bit her pretty lips and slipped out of her chair just pausing a moment to lay her hand on the young shoulder as she passed and a world of comfort fell upon Polly shut in once more to her dreary task How perfectly splendid that I didn t go to Silvia Home s luncheon party now cried Polly s heart over and over between the lines If I had I should have missed dear Auntie s home coming and Dicky s She glanced up with luminous eyes as she whirled the sheet missus Chatterton astonishing as it may seem was actually smiling It s some comfort to hear you read she observed with a sigh of enjoyment because you enjoy it yourself I wouldn t give a fig for anybody to try to do it Polly felt like a guilty little thing to take this quietly and she eased her conscience by being more glad that she was in that very room doing that very task And so the moments sped on Outside Dick was holding high revel as every one revolved around him the hero of the coasting accident till the boy ran considerable danger from all the attention he was receiving But one glance and a smile from missus Whitney brought him back to himself Don t talk any more about it he cried a trifle impatiently I was a muff to stick on when I knew we were going over Mamma won t you stop them And she did Do you know Dicky and I have a secret to tell all of you good people The color flew into her soft cheek and her eyes beamed Really Marian said her father whose hand had scarcely ceased patting Dick s brown head since the boy s home coming you ve grown young in Badgertown I never saw you look so well as you do to day missus Whitney laughed and tossed him a gay little smile that carried him back to the days when Marian King stood before him looking just so Now listen father and all you good people to my secret Dicky s and mine we are allowed to tell it now Papa Whitney sailed in the Servia and he ought to be in to day A shout of joy greeted her announcement Polly off in her prison could hear the merry sounds and her happy heart echoed them The misery of the past week when she had been bearing an unatoned fault seemed to drop away from her as she listened and to say Life holds sunshine yet Then a hush dropped upon the gay uproar She did not know that Dicky was proclaiming Yes and he is never never going back again That is unless he takes mamma and me you know missus Chatterton turned suddenly upon the young figure Do go She tossed an imperative command with her jeweled fingers You have ceased to be amusing since your interest is all in the other room with that boy Polly dashed the newspaper to the floor and rushing impulsively across the room threw herself with no thought for the consequences on her knees at missus Chatterton s chair Oh oh she cried the color flying up to the brown waves on her temples don t send me off then I shall know you never will forgive me Get up do exclaimed missus Chatterton in disgust you are crushing my gown and besides I hate scenes But Polly held resolutely to the chair arm and never took her brown eyes from the cold face I must say Polly Pepper cried missus Chatterton with rising anger you are the most disagreeable girl that I ever had the misfortune to meet I for one will not put up with your constant ebullitions of temper Go out of this room Polly rose slowly and drew herself up with something so new in face and manner that the old lady instinctively put up her eyeglass and gazed curiously through it as one would look at a strange animal Humph she said slowly at last well what do you want to say Speak out and then go Nothing said Polly in a low voice but quite distinctly only I shall not trouble you again missus Chatterton And as the last words were spoken she was out of the room Pretty doings these mister King by a dexterous movement succeeded in slipping back of the portiere folds into the little writing room as Polly rushed out through the other doorway into the hall A fortunate thing it was that I left Dick to see what had become of Polly Now Cousin Eunice you move from my house and descending the stairs he called determinedly Polly Polly child Polly off in her own room now heard him and for the first time in her life wished she need not answer Polly Polly the determined call rang down the passage causing her to run fast with a Yes Grandpapa I m coming Now I should just like to inquire began mister King taking her by her two young shoulders and looking down into the flushed face what she has been saying to you Oh Grandpapa down went Polly s brown head don t make me tell Please don t Grandpapa I shall declared mister King every blessed word Now begin She she wanted me to go out of the room said Polly in a reluctant gasp Indeed snorted mister King Well she will soon go out of that room Indeed I might say out of the house Oh Grandpapa exclaimed Polly in great distress and raising the brown eyes he was dismayed to find them filling with tears don t don t send her away It is all my fault indeed it is Grandpapa Your fault cried mister King irately you must not say such things child that s silly you don t know the woman Grandpapa cried Polly holding back the storm of tears to get the words out I never told you I couldn t but I said perfectly dreadful words to her a week ago Oh Grandpapa I did truly That s right said the old gentleman in a pleased tone What were they pray tell Let us know Oh Grandpapa don t begged Polly with a shiver I want to forget them If you would only follow them up with more said mister King meditatively when it comes to tears she must march you know I won t cry said Polly swallowing the lump in her throat if you will only let her stay She turned to him such a distressed and white face that mister King stood perplexedly looking down at her having nothing to say I m tired of her at last he said we are all tired of her she has about worn us out Grandpapa cried Polly seeing her advantage in his hesitation if you will only let her stay I will never beg you for anything again Well then she goes cried mister King shortly Goodness me Polly if you are going to stop asking favors Cousin Eunice marches instanter Oh I ll beg and tease for ever so many things cried Polly radiantly her color coming back Will you let her stay Grandpapa will you She clasped his arm tightly and would not let him go Well said mister King slowly I ll think about it Polly Will you cried Polly Dear Grandpapa please say yes mister King drew a long breath Yes he said at last XIII A PIECE OF NEWS Collect the whole bunch of Peppers and send them into my writing room Marian Old mister King mounting the stairs turned to see that his command was heard You want Mother Pepper too I presume said missus Whitney pausing at the foot Mother Pepper No indeed the last person in the world I wish to see cried her father irritably The bunch of Pepper children I want and at once see that they all report to me directly With that he redoubled his efforts and was soon at the top of the long oaken steps Polly and Ben closely followed by Joel David and Phronsie soon rushed over the same ascending thoroughfare and presented themselves flushed and panting at the writing room door Come in called mister King from within Here we are sir said Ben spokesman by virtue of being the eldest Yes yes said mister King nervously and turning away from some papers he was fumbling to occupy the waiting moments Well do sit down all of you I sent for you to have a talk about something that you that you well do sit down So all the Peppers deposited themselves in various resting places all but Joel He immediately marched up to the old gentleman s chair If it s good news he said abruptly please let us have it right this minute But if it s bad why a gathering alarm stole over his chubby countenance as he scanned the face before him I m going out doors It s good or bad news according as you take it said the old gentleman It ought to be good But there pushing back his chair to look at the row of anxious figures the other side of the table do sit down with the rest Joe and stop staring me out of countenance Polly at that pushed a chair over toward Joel who persuading himself into it sat uncomfortably perched on its edge where he stared harder than ever Hum well children now you are all remarkably sensible boys and girls Remarkably sensible I ve always said so and I see no reason to change my opinion of you now And so although at first my news may not be quite to your liking why you ll quickly make it so and be very happy about it in the end Hem well did you ever think that that your mother might possibly marry again The last words were brought out so abruptly that to the five pairs of ears strained to catch their import it seemed as if the news had shot by harmlessly But after a breathing space the dreadful marry and your mother came back to them bringing the several owners of the ears out of their chairs at one bound Our mother Ben hoarsely exclaimed Oh how can you cried Polly passionately a little white line showing around her mouth say such perfectly dreadful things sir Phronsie clasped her hands in silent terror and raised big eyes to his face David began to walk helplessly down the apartment See here said Joel turning to the others wait a minute and hold on Perhaps it s you sir whirling back to question with piercing eyes the old gentleman who s going to marry our mother Then it s all right Me roared the old gentleman Oh bless my soul what should I want to marry for at my time of life Oh my goodness me His distress was now so frightful to see that it brought the Peppers in a measure out of theirs and they began at once to endeavor to soothe him Don t oh don t they cried and a common trouble overwhelming them they rushed around the table seized his hands and patted his shoulders and hair Oh this is very dreadful gasped Polly but don t you feel badly dear dear Grandpapa I should think it was said mister King Phronsie here child get into my lap I ll come to myself then There now that s something like as Phronsie with a low cry hopped into her usual nest Now perhaps I can communicate the rest of my news when I get my breath The Peppers held theirs and he began once more Now children it isn t in the course of nature for such a fine bright woman as your mother to remain single the rest of her life somebody would be sure to come and carry her off I m glad it s to be in my lifetime for now I can be easy in my mind and feel that you have a protector when I am gone There there we won t talk about that as the young faces turned dark with sudden pain while Joel rushed convulsively to the window you can see how I feel about it Are you glad cried Ben hoarsely Polly for her life could not speak The whole world seemed turning round and sinking beneath her feet Yes I am said the old gentleman and it won t alter the existing state of things for he will live here with us and things will be just the same if only you children will take it rightly But I ve no doubt you will in the end no doubt at all he added brightening up for you are very sensible young people I ve always said so Who is he The dreadful question trembled on all the lips but no one asked it Seeing this mister King broke out Well now of course you want to know who is going to marry your mother that is if you are willing For she won t have him unless you are to be happy about it Would you like doctor Fisher for a father Joel broke away from the window with a howl while Polly tumultuously threw herself within the kind arms encircling Phronsie Next to you cried the boy why he s a brick doctor Fisher is Why didn t you tell us before that it was he sobbed Polly with joyful tears running over her face Davie coming out of his gloomy walk turned a happy face towards the old man s chair while Ben said something to himself that sounded like Thank God Phronsie alone remained unmoved What is doctor Fisher going to do she asked presently amid the chatter that now broke forth He s going to live here said old mister King looking down at her and smoothing her yellow hair Won t that be nice Phronsie Yes said Phronsie it will And he ll bring his funny old gig won t he and Ill drive sometimes I suppose she added with great satisfaction Yes you will said the old gentleman winking furiously to keep back the excited flow of information that now threatened the child Well Phronsie you love doctor Fisher don t you Yes I do said the child folding her hands in her lap love him very much indeed Well he s going to be your father communicated mister King cautiously watching her face at each syllable Oh no cried Phronsie he couldn t be he s doctor Fisher She laughed softly at the idea Why Grandpapa he couldn t be my father Listen Phronsie and mister King took both her hands in his and I ll tell you about it so that you will understand doctor Fisher loves your mother he has loved her for many years all those years when she was struggling on in the little brown house But he couldn t tell her so because he had others depending on him for support They don t need him now and as soon as he is free he comes and tells your mother and me like a noble good man as he is all about it He s a gentleman children he declared turning to the others and you will be glad to call him father I don t know what you mean said Phronsie with puzzled eyes Dear Grandpapa please tell me Why he is going to marry your mother child and we are all to live here together just the same and everything is going to be just as happy as possible Phronsie gave a sharp and sudden cry of distress But Mamsie my Mamsie will be gone and then she hid her face in the old gentleman s breast O dear dear get a glass of water Polly cried mister King One of you run and open the window Phronsie Phronsie there child look up and let me tell you But Phronsie burrowed yet deeper in the protecting nest regardless of his spotless linen Polly speak to her he cried in despair where is she gone for the water O dear Here Ben you try Dear dear what a blunderer I am Phronsie said Ben leaning over the shaking figure you are making Grandpapa sick Up came Phronsie s yellow head Oh Grandpapa she wailed putting out an unsteady little hand I didn t mean to dear Grandpapa only only Mamsie will be gone now Bless your heart you ll have Mamsie more than ever cried mister King heartily Here you children tell her Polly we don t want the water now she s come to as Polly came rushing in with a glassful Make her understand I can t So Polly setting down her glass the others crowding around took up the task of making the piece of news as delightful as possible and presently Phronsie came out of her despair to ask questions Are you really and truly very glad Polly she asked Really and truly I am so glad I don t know what to do said Polly kneeling down by the chair side Don t you see we are so much the richer Phronsie We have lost nothing and we gain doctor Fisher Dear splendid doctor Fisher You ve always wanted to repay doctor Fisher for his kindness said mister King and now s your chance Polly I guess he ll get his pay back for his stove cried Joel in a burst Polly will wait on him and kill herself doing things for him And for your new eyes sang Phronsie in a pleased way Oh Polly She jumped out of the old gentleman s lap and began to dance around the room softly clapping her hands and exclaiming Oh Polly Well now children said mister King as the excitement ran low you just run and tell your mother every one of you how happy she will make you by bringing doctor Fisher here as your father Scamper now No need to urge them On the wings of the wind ran the five Peppers up into Mamsie s own room missus Pepper for once turning aside from the claim of her pressing duties was standing by the work table Here stood the mending basket before her piled to the brim with the weekly installment of stockings big and little clamoring for attention But the usually busy needle lay idle and the busier hands were folded as the mother heart went over the words she knew were being rehearsed downstairs by the kind friend who had made a home for them He was pleading her cause with her children They shall be happy anyway she said softly to herself bless their hearts as they burst in Mother said Ben How the boy s cheek glowed And what a world of joy rang in the usually quiet tones we want to thank you for giving us doctor Fisher for a father Mamsie Polly hid her happy face on the dear neck I ve always loved him you know oh I m so glad Joel whooped out something incoherent but his face told the words while Davie clasped one of the firm closely folded hands If you ll take me in your lap as much as ever said Phronsie deliberately and patting the other hand why I shall be really and truly glad Mamsie Bless your dear heart cried Mother Pepper clasping her tightly and you children all of you and she drew them all within her arms Now I want you to understand once for all that it isn t to be unless you all wish it You are sure mister King hasn t persuaded you to like it Look at us cried Ben throwing back his head to see her eyes Do we act as if we had been talked over At that Polly burst into a merry laugh and the others joining Mother Pepper laughing as heartily as the rest the big room became the jolliest place imaginable No I don t really think you do said missus Pepper wiping her eyes Dear me cried Jasper putting his head in the doorway what good fun is going on I m not going to be left out Come in Jasper they all called And we ve a piece of news that will make your hair stand on end said Joel gaily Joe don t announce it so cried Polly in dismay who dearly enjoyed being elegant Ben must tell it he is the oldest No no let Polly protested Ben Polly shall said Jasper hurrying in to stand the picture of patience before the group Hurry do for I must say my curiosity is hard to keep within bounds So Polly was gently pushed into the center of the circle Go on said Joel and hurry up or I shall tell myself Jasper said Polly her breath coming fast oh you can t think we are so glad But she got no further for Phronsie rushing out of Mother Pepper s arms piped out suddenly doctor Fisher is coming here to live always and forever and I m going to ride in his gig and Mamsie likes him and I m going to call him father now Jasper I told you I should think you did exclaimed Ben Whew cried Jasper that is a piece of news all in one breath Well missus Pepper I m glad of it too I congratulate you With that he marched up to her Phronsie hanging to his arm and shook her hand heartily And in two days everybody in the King set knew that the mother of the five little Peppers was going to be married I should think you d want to be condoled with Ben said Pickering Dodge clapping him on the shoulder as he rushed down the aisle of the store occupied by Cabot Van Meter Halloo said Ben can t stop rushing past I suppose not said Pickering carelessly and striding after so I ll whisper my gentle congratulations in your ear on the wing But I m awfully sorry for you Ben he added as he came up to him You needn t be said Ben brightly we are all as glad as can be Sweet innocent you don t know a stepfather said Pickering lugubriously I know doctor Fisher said Ben that s enough Well when you want comfort come to me said Pickering or your uncle Don t you fill Ben s ears with your foolishness said the Senior Partner coming out of the counting room Take yourself off Pickering you re hindering Ben Pickering laughed I m caught in the very act Now Ben remember I m your friend when you get into trouble with your dear pa Good by Uncle with a bright nod and a lazy shake of his long figure Trade always demoralizes me I ll get back to my books and he vanished as quickly as he came Back to your books said his uncle grimly hum I wish you would See here Ben he put a controlling hand on the boy s shoulder one word with you marching him into the private office of the firm Don t you follow Pickering too closely my boy he said abruptly he s a good lad in the main but if he is my nephew I must give you warning He s losing ground Ben lifted his head in sudden alarm Oh I hope not sir he said It s a fact Master Nelson says he could be first scholar in the grammar but for the last six months he s failed steadily There s no particular reason only ambition s gone And when you say that you mean there s a general collapse of all my hopes concerning him Oh no sir Ben kept on protesting his ruddy cheek losing its color He ll take hold by and by and give a pull at his books again It isn t a pull now and then that gets a man up hill observed mister Cabot leaning back in his revolving chair to look into the blue eyes that you know as well as I Now Ben I m not going to see you throw away your prospects too Don t let him influence you in the wrong way He s bright and attractive but don t pay attention to his ridicule of good things I ve a mother said Ben proudly and I don t believe any boy could say much to me that I d think of twice if she didn t like it You always tell her everything do you Ben asked mister Cabot with a curious glance I should think so sir said Ben with a short laugh You ll do then said mister Cabot bringing his palm down on a pile of unread letters awaiting him Go ahead I don t promise anything but I will say this If you work on as you have done these two years since you came in here as errand boy Ben I ll make you a power in the house Understand I don t expect you to do brilliant things that isn t in your line You will be a success only as a steady faithful worker But keep at it and hang on to Cabot Van Meter and we ll hang on to you XIV MAMSIE S WEDDING Polly said doctor Fisher coming suddenly out of a corner of the library as she ran around the portiere folds you are sure you are willing are willing it should go on The little man peered at her anxiously through his big glasses and he looked so exactly as he did on that morning so long ago when Polly s eyes were at their worst that she could do nothing but gaze speechlessly into his face I see you don t consider it quite best child said the little doctor brokenly but you are trying with your good heart to make it so Don t be afraid it is not too late to end it all I was thinking cried Polly with a gasp how good you were to me when you saved my eyes and how you kept Joel from dying of the measles Oh I couldn t speak but I love you so She threw her young arms around him Papa Fisher for you are almost my father now I am the very very happiest girl because you are going to live here and now I can show you just how much I really and truly love you The little man beamed at her Then he took off his spectacles wiped them and clapped them into place again You see Polly he said deliberately it was impossible to see your mother and not love her She has had well there child I cannot bear to talk about it and he walked to the window blew his nose violently on an immense pocket handkerchief leaving the words poised in mid air It was the greatest trial of my life that I couldn t show her then when she was struggling so bravely to keep the wolf from the door how I felt But my hands were tied child he added coming back his usual self again Now I can make her she says happy that is if you children like it Just think Polly she said happy It s stupendous but she said so Polly she really did He folded his hands and looked at her in astonishment behind which shone an intense gratification that lighted up his plain little face till he seemed to grow younger every instant Indeed she did repeated Polly like a bird and laughing merrily Oh Papa Fisher you ought to hear Mamsie sing She doesn t know I m hearing her but she sings at her work now Does she cried the doctor radiantly Well Polly we must see that she sings every day after this Yes let us cried Polly clasping his hand we will And proceeded the doctor after the wedding is over I It really dread the wedding Polly but after that is over I do believe we shall all be comfortable together Polly gave a little cry of delight Then she said You needn t dread the wedding one bit Papa Fisher There will be only the people that we love and who love us Grandpapa promised that But that will make it very big said doctor Fisher with round eyes and a small shiver he could not suppress Oh no said Polly cheerily sixty five friends that s all we are going to ask Mamsie and I made out the list last night Sixty five people exclaimed doctor Fisher in dismay Oh isn t is possible to be married without sixty five friends to stare at you Oh that s not many said Polly sixty five is the very smallest number that we could manage We ve been over the list ever so many times and struck out quantities of names You see everybody loves Mamsie and they ll want to see her married I know I know assented the doctor but that makes one hundred and thirty eyes Did you ever think of that Polly Polly burst into such a laugh that Jasper popped in and after him Phronsie and a general hilarity now reigning the dreaded wedding preparations soon sank away from the doctor s perturbed vision But they went on merrily nevertheless All over the old stone mansion there were hints of the on coming festivities and though all signs of it were tucked away from the little doctor on his occasional visits the smothered excitement flamed afresh immediately his departure became an assured thing Everybody had the wildest plans for the occasion it appearing impossible to do enough for the one who had stood at the helm for five long years and who was to be reigning housekeeper for as much longer as her services were needed And doctor Fisher never knew how perilously near he had been to the verge of brilliant evening festivities in the midst of which he was to be ushered into matrimony For Polly had suddenly waked one morning to find herself not famous but alive with the sense of being as her mother had so often expressed it Mamsie s little right hand woman It will be much better to have everything plain said Polly communing with herself as she turned on her pillow Mamsie has always been without show of any kind and so but here Polly s heart stood still Dearly she loved the bright conspicuous accompaniments to the wedding whereby mister King was determined to show his respect for the family under his care And her soul secretly longed for the five hundred guests named on a list of the old gentleman s drawing up And the feast and the lights and the pretty dresses and the dancing party for the young people to follow For mister King had announced himself as about to usher in the brightest of days for the young Peppers to remember Besides it brings our new physician into notice he would answer when any faint protest was made And we shall all have reason to be immensely proud of him I tell you Oh dear cried Polly burrowing deeper within the pillow folds why aren t pleasant things best to do Why I wonder Cherry twittering in the window chirped something vague and unsatisfactory Polly brought up her brown head suddenly and laughed Nonsense our happiness doesn t depend upon a lot of people coming together to help it along Mamsie s face whenever Grandpapa plans all this magnificence is enough to make me feel wretched at the thought of it Dear Mamsie she s afraid of ingratitude if she doesn t try to like it She shall have the little morning wedding with a few people around and the gray silk gown instead of the lavender one Grandpapa wants her to wear for Mamsie always knows just what is right With that Polly sprang out of bed and rushed at her toilet and after breakfast she quietly captured mister King on the edge of some other extravagant plan and led him into the library Everything is going on finely Polly he cried in elation Ring for Thomas child stay I ll do it myself I shall go in an hour to give my orders for the wedding supper Grandpapa cried Polly turning quite pale and laying a quick detaining hand on his arm oh do wait dear Grandpapa I have something to say Well child but he still retained his hand on the cord Oh Grandpapa how could she say it But she must Mamsie will be ever so much happier if the wedding might be a quiet one She really would Grandpapa No doubt missus Pepper finds it a little hard to adjust her ideas to the large affair said the old gentleman considerably disturbed and by no means relinquishing the bell cord but it is due to you children to have a bright time and I must see that you all have it That is my affair and this time the cord was pulled and the bell rang a loud insistent message Polly stood still in despair Grandpapa she said distinctly finding it hard to proceed with his face before her we children do not want the large party that is I do not It was all out at last Stuff and nonsense exclaimed mister King sharply for his surprise was too great to allow of composure who has been putting this idea into your head Your mother couldn t have done it for she promised it should all be as you young people wanted Mamsie never said a word cried Polly recovering herself as she saw a chance to make things right for Mother Pepper it all came to me Grandpapa all alone by myself Oh I hate the big display she declared with sudden vehemence astonishing herself with the repulsion that now seized her Hoity toity exclaimed mister King it s not quite the thing Polly my child to express yourself so decidedly considering your years Grandpapa cried Polly with a sudden rush of tears forgive me do I did not mean to be so naughty I did not dear Grandpapa She looked like Phronsie now and the old gentleman s heart melted But I am quite sure that none of us children would be a bit happy not to have it as Mamsie would like Well but I am not sure that the others wouldn t like it said mister King persistently Ben wouldn t said Polly triumphantly I know for he all along shrank from the big party Oh well Ben I suppose would object somewhat conceded the old gentleman slowly And Davie cried Polly eagerly Oh Grandpapa David would much prefer the morning wedding and the plain things But how about Joel and Phronsie interrupted mister King utterly ignoring Davie s claims to be heard Ah Polly my dear until you tell me that they will prefer to give up the fine party you mustn t expect me to pay any attention to what you say It s due to Phronsie that your mother s wedding is a thing worthy to remember as a fine affair Perhaps Joel and Phronsie will think as we do said Polly But her heart said No All right if they do said mister King easily but unless you come and tell me it is their own choice why I shall just go on with my plans as mapped out he added obstinately Thomas as that functionary appeared in the doorway take the letters to the post at once you will find them on my writing table All right sir I ll give you till to morrow to find out said mister King Now come and kiss me Polly dear You ll see it s all right after it s over and be glad I had the sense to keep my mind about it Polly put up her lips obediently But it was a sad little kiss that was set upon his mouth and it left him feeling like a criminal And running out she met her difficult task without a moment of preparation Halloo Polly whooped Joel rushing around an angle in the hall Grandpapa promised me that I might go out with him to give the supper orders and all that kind of nonsense Polly s heart stood still Joel she began seizing his jacket with trembling fingers come up into my room a minute What s up cried Joel with curiosity some more mysteries There s nothing but whisperings and secrets and no end of jolly understandings ever since Mamsie commenced to marry doctor Fisher Go ahead I ll come And Phronsie too said Polly seeing the yellow head emerge from the breakfast room doorway Come on Phron sang out Joel up in Polly s room she wants you and the three hurried off Now Joel said Polly closing the door and facing him desperately you are Mamsie s own boy I should think so said Joel I m not anybody s else Is that all you brought me up here to say thrusting his hands in his pockets and looking at her And you can make her happy or just as miserable as I can t say what went on Polly incoherently What in the world are you firing at demanded the boy visions of certain pranks at school unpleasantly before him Don t shoot over my head Polly but keep somewhere near your mark he advised irritably Phronsie surveyed the two with wide eyes and a not wholly pleased manner Mamsie does not want a big wedding declared Polly going to the heart of the matter but dear kind Grandpapa thinks it will please us children and so he wants to give her one And so it will cried Joel please us children Whoop la give us your hand Phronsie this is the way we ll dance afterwards at the party I don t want to dance said Phronsie standing quite still in the middle of the room The morning sun shone across her yellow hair but no light came into the large eyes Polly wants something first what is it Joel I m sure I don t know said Joel poised on a careless foot and executing a remarkable pas seul I don t believe she knows herself Polly is often queer you know Phronsie he added cheerfully Tell me Polly do whispered Phronsie going over to her Phronsie said Polly very slowly Mamsie doesn t want a big party in the evening to see her married but to have a cunning little company of friends come in the morning and Ugh cried Joel in disgust coming down suddenly to both feet It will please Mamsie best went on Polly with a cold shoulder to Joel And I never should be happy in all this world to remember that I helped to make my Mamsie unhappy on her wedding day Phronsie shivered and her voice held a miserable little thrill as she begged Oh make her be married just as she wants to be Polly do Now that s what I call mean cried Joel in a loud vindictive tone back of Polly to work on Phronsie s feelings You can t make me say I don t want Mamsie to have a wedding splurge so there Polly Pepper Polly preserved a dignified silence and presented her shoulder again to his view You can t make me say it Polly Pepper shouted Joel shrilly Oh Phronsie exclaimed Polly in a rapture throwing her arms around the child Mamsie will be so pleased you can t think Let us go and tell her come See here called Joel edging up why don t you talk to me I haven t anything to say Polly condescended to give him without turning her head Come Phronsie holding out her hand Wait a minute Well what is it Polly s hand now held Phronsie s but she paused on the way to the door I guess I can give up things as well as she can if I know Mamsie wants me to said Joel with a deeply injured manner Mamsie doesn t want any of us to give up anything unless we do it as if we were glad to said Polly For her life she couldn t conceal a little scornful note in her voice and Joel winced miserably I I wish she wouldn t have the big party he whined I thought you wanted it said Polly turning to him I I don t I d rather Mamsie would be happy O dear don t look at me so I m not looking at you so said Polly You acted just as if you had your heart set on the party Well it isn t I ll I ll if you say party to me again and he faced her vindictively Joel Pepper cried Polly holding him with her brown eyes do you really mean that you are glad to give up that big evening party and have the little teeny one in the morning Yes said Joel as true as I live and breathe I do Oh oh oh cried Polly and seizing his arm she led off in a dance so much surpassing his efforts that Phronsie screamed with delight to see them go When they could dance no more Polly flushed and panting ran out of the room leaving the two to find out as best they might the cause of the strange demeanor Grandpapa Polly rushing over the stairs met him coming up to missus Whitney s room Joel says it s the little morning wedding please and Phronsie too The old gentleman gave no sign of his defeat beyond a Humph and so I m beaten after all And doctor Fisher never knew all this Mamsie s wedding day At last it came Was any other ever so bright and beautiful Phronsie thought not and thereupon she impeded the preparations by running up to kiss her mother every few moments until such time as Felicie carried her off to induct her into a white muslin gown Polly here there and everywhere was in such a rapture that she seemed to float on wings while the boys of the household with the exception of Jasper lost their heads early in the day and helplessly succumbed to all demands upon them Every flower had to be put in place by the young people Old Turner for once stood one side And Polly must put the white satin boxes filled with wedding cake on the little table where one of the waiters would hand them to departing guests And Phronsie must fasten Mamsie s pearl broach the gift of the five little Peppers in her lace collar the very last thing And Jasper collected the rice and set the basket holding it safely away from Joel s eager fingers till such time as they could shower the bride s carriage And all the boys were ushers even little Dick coming up grandly to offer his arm to the tallest guest as it happened And old mister King gave the bride away And doctor Fisher at the last forgot all the one hundred and thirty eyes and his I will rang out like a man s who has secured what he has long wanted And ever so many of the guests said What a good father he will make the children and several attempted to tell the Peppers so As if we didn t know it before said Joel indignantly And Alexia and all the other girls of Polly s set were there and Joel s little blue and white creature came to his great satisfaction with her aunt who was quite intimate in the family and Pickering Dodge was there of course and the Alstynes and hosts of others And Mother Pepper in her silver gray gown and bonnet by the side of her husband with Phronsie clinging to one hand heard nothing but heart felt wishes for her happiness and that of the five little Peppers And there was not so much as the shadow of a skeleton at the wedding breakfast And Cousin Mason Whitney took charge of the toasts and everybody felt that just the right things had been said And then there was a flutter of departure of the bridal party and in the rattle of the wheels Phronsie piped out bravely as she threw the slipper after the departing coach Mamsie has been taking care of us all these years now we re going to be good and let her be happy XV missus CHATTERTON HAS A NEW PLAN Polly is learning to play beautifully mused Phronsie nursing one foot contemplatively as she curled up on the floor And Ben is to be a capital business man so Papa Fisher says and Joel is going to buy up this whole town sometime and Davie knows ever so many books from beginning to end but what can I do Down went the little foot to the floor and the yellow head drooped over the white apron Nothing mourned Phronsie just nothing at all not even the wee est teeniest bit of anything do I know how to do O dear Outside Jasper was calling to Prince Phronsie could hear the big dog rushing over the lawn in response barking furiously as he went But she did not move And Mamsie will never be glad for me unless I learn how to do things too If I don t hurry I shall never be grown up Tweet tweet ch r r r Cherry in his cage over her head chirped vigorously by way of consolation but Phronsie did not lift her head Cherry seeing all his efforts in vain stopped his song and rolled one black eye down at her in astonishment and soon became quite still Presently the rustle of a stiff black satin gown became the chief intruder upon the silence It was so asserting that Phronsie lifted her head to look into the face of missus Chatterton standing before her playing with the rings on her long white hands and regarding her as if she would soon require an explanation of such strange conduct What are you doing Phronsie at last demanded the lady Thinking said Phronsie and she laid her chin in her hand and slowly turned her gaze upon the thin disagreeable face before her but not as if in the slightest degree given up to a study of its lines and expression So I perceive said missus Chatterton harshly Well and what are you thinking of pray tell Still Phronsie looked beyond her and it was not until the question had been repeated that an answer came Of many things said Phronsie but I do not think I ought to tell you And why not pray cried the lady with a short and most unpleasant laugh Because I do not think you would understand them said Phronsie And now she looked at the face she had before overlooked with a deliberate scrutiny as if she would not need to repeat the attention Indeed exclaimed missus Chatterton angrily and pray how long since your thoughts have been so valuable My thoughts are nice ones said Phronsie slowly because they are about nice people Ah And they won t tell themselves And I ought not to make them They would fly away then and I should never find them again when I wanted to think them Your mother brought you up well I must say observed missus Chatterton deliberately drawing up a chair and putting her long figure within it to talk in this style to a lady as old as I am Phronsie allowed one foot to gently trace the pattern on the carpet before she answered I know you are very old she said at last but I cannot tell my thoughts to you Very old cried missus Chatterton her chin in the air Indeed well I am not I would have you know Miss Phronsie and she played with the silk cord of her satin wrapper I hate a child that is made a prig she added explosively under her breath Phronsie made no reply being already deep in her own calculations once more Now Phronsie said missus Chatterton suddenly drawing herself out of her angry fit and clearing her brow I want you to give your attention to me a moment for I have something I must say to you That s why I came in here to find you alone Come look at me child It isn t polite to be staring at the carpet all the time Phronsie thus admonished took her gaze from the floor to bestow it on the face above her It s something that nobody is to know but just you and me began missus Chatterton with a cautious glance at the door Then she got out of her chair and going across the room closed it carefully There that s better Polly is always around Now we are quite alone coming back to her seat You see Phronsie she proceeded not caring that the brown eyes were slowly adding to their astonishment an expression that augured ill for any plans she might be hoping to carry out toward propitiation It is necessary to be careful not to be overheard for what I am going to say to you must be kept quite secret I must tell Mamsie said Phronsie distinctly Indeed you will not declared missus Chatterton She is the very one of all others who ought not to know You can help her Phronsie if you only keep quiet Phronsie s eyes now became so very large that missus Chatterton hastened to add You know Polly is learning to be a music teacher when she grows up Phronsie made no reply And a very creditable one she will be from all acounts I can gather contributed missus Chatterton carelessly Well Ben is doing well in Cabot Van Meter s so he s no trouble to your mother As for the two boys I know nothing about them one way or the other But you as you are a girl and the only one not provided for why I shall show a little kindness in your direction It s wholly disinterested and quixotic I know added missus Chatterton with a sweeping gaze at the walls and ceilings for me to give myself a thought about you or your future And I shall never receive so much as a thank you for it But I ve passed all my life in thinking of others Phronsie here she brought down her attention to the absorbed little countenance and I cannot change now she finished pensively A silence fell upon them so great that missus Chatterton broke it nervously Goodness me Phronsie you are not like a child you are too uncanny for anything Why don t you ask questions about my secret Because I ought not to know it said Phronsie finding her tongue Haven t I told you that you will help your mother only by not telling her said missus Chatterton How would you like to learn how to take care of yourself when you are a big girl A light slowly gathered in the brown eyes becoming at last so joyous and assured that missus Chatterton s face dropped its hard lines to lose itself in a gratified smile Now you make me see some real hope that my scheme won t be wholly a wild piece of philanthropy she exclaimed Only look like that Phronsie and I ll do anything for you If I can do anything for Mamsie cried Phronsie clasping her hands in rapture Oh do tell me dear missus Chatterton she pleaded Oh now I am dear missus Chatterton cried that lady with a hard ill favored smile But she lowered her tone to a gentler one and extending one jeweled hand took the little folded ones in her clasp I will be a good friend to you and show you how you can learn to do something so that when you grow up you can take care of yourself just as Polly will Just think Phronsie just as Polly will cried missus Chatterton artfully How how demanded Phronsie scarcely breathing Listen Phronsie Now you know I haven t any little girl Phronsie drew a long breath Well I have been looking for one for a long time I want one who will be a daughter to me who will grow up under my direction and who will appreciate what I sacrifice in taking her She must be nice looking for I couldn t stand an ill favored child I have found several who were much better looking than you Phronsie in fact they were beauties but I don t like the attitude of their families The poor things actually thought they were doing me a favor by accepting my proposition for the children As this statement required no remark on the part of the hearer Phronsie was silent not removing her eyes from missus Chatterton s face Now although you haven t as much to recommend you as many other children that I have fancied I hope to make you serve my purpose I am going to try you at least Every day Phronsie you can come to my room It s lucky that you don t go to school but do pretty much as you like in this house so no questions will be asked I go to Grandpapa s room every day said Phronsie in a distressed tone to my lessons Of course I know that a very silly thing it is too There s no use in trying to break it up now I suppose or I d put my hand to the attempt But you can come to me after you ve got through toadying mister King What is toding asked Phronsie Never mind that hasn t anything to do with the business in hand replied missus Chatterton impatiently Now if you come to me every day and give me as much time as you can why I ll show you what I want of you and teach you many things Then after a while Phronsie when you learn to appreciate it I shall tell you what I am going to do The adoption will be an easy matter I fancy when the child is interested she added taking the precaution to mutter it You must do everything as I tell you missus Chatterton leaned forward and said with great deliberateness else you will lose this chance to help your mother And you will never have another like it but will grow up to be a good for nothing little thing when Polly and all the rest are earning money for your Mamsie as you call her I shall earn money too declared Phronsie on a high note and nodding her yellow head with great decision Never missus Chatterton brought her foot incased in its black satin slipper down with force on the carpet You will never earn a cent of money in all this world unless you do exactly as I say for you are a child who hasn t it in her to learn anything But you can help me and I shall teach you many things and do well by you When I grow a big girl will anybody want me to do those things that you are going to teach me asked Phronsie drawing near to lay her hand on the stiff black gown and speaking earnestly Then if they will I ll try to do them just exactly as you tell me Of course they will declared missus Chatterton carefully edging off from the little fingers ever so many people will want you Phronsie And I shall give you a great deal of money I shall give it all to Mamsie interrupted Phronsie her brown eyes dilating quickly every single twenty five cents you give me Then I guess she will be glad don t you she cried clasping her hands in sudden rapture while she began to dance up and down I shall give you so many twenty five cents cried missus Chatterton beginning to feel her old heart beat with more enthusiasm than she had known for many a day that you will be very rich Phronsie Oh oh cried Phronsie coming to an abrupt pause in the middle of the floor her cheek paling in excitement And then she could say no more But you must do exactly as I tell you missus Chatterton leaned forward suddenly and seized the little hands now so still in their delight Remember it is only when you follow my commands in every single thing that you will have any chance of earning all this money for your mother and helping her just at Polly is going to do Remember now Phronsie I will remember said Phronsie slowly as her hands were released Very good We will begin now then missus Chatterton threw herself back in her chair and drew a long breath Lucky I found the child alone and so tractable It s singularly good fortune she muttered Well aloud with a light laugh now Phronsie if you are going to be your mother s helper why this is your first duty Let us see how well you perform it Run upstairs to the closet out of the lumber room and open the little black box on the shelf in front of the door the box isn t locked and bring me the roll of black velvet ribbon you will find there Phronsie was about to ask Why does not Hortense go up for it but missus Chatterton forestalled the question by saying with a frown Hortense has gone down to the dressmaker s No child who calls me to account for anything I ask of her can be helped by me Do as you like Phronsie No one will compel you to learn how to do things so that you can be a comfort to your mother Only remember if you don t obey me you will lose your only chance After this speech missus Chatterton sat back and played with her rings looking with oblique glances of cold consideration at the child I ll go said Phronsie with a long sigh and do every thing you say I do really believe I can bend one of those dreadful Pepper children to my will thought missus Chatterton exultingly She is my only hope Polly does better than she did but she is too old to be tractable and she has a shrewd head on her practical body and the others are just horrible She gave a shiver But Phronsie will grow up to fit my purpose I think Three purposes I may say to get the Peppers gradually out from under Horatio King s influence and to train up a girl to wait on me so that I can get away from these French villains of maids and to spite Alexander s daughter by finally adopting this Phronsie if she suits me But I must move carefully The first thing is to get the child fastened to me by her own will Phronsie ascending the stairs to the lumber room with careful deliberateness found no hint of joy at the prospect before her reaching into the dim distance to that enchanted time when she should be grown up But there was a strangely new sense of responsibility born in an hour and an acceptance of life s burdens that made her feel very old and wise I shall be a comfort to my mother she said confidently and mounted on XVI WHERE IS PHRONSIE Phronsie shut the door of the lumber room and with a great sigh realized that she had with her own hand cut herself off from the gay life below stairs But they are not so very far off she said and I shall soon be down again as she made her way across the room and opened the closet door A little mouse scurried along the shelf and dropped to the floor Phronsie peered into the darkness within her small heart beating fearfully as she held the knob in her hand There may be more she said irresolutely I suppose he wouldn t live up here all alone Please go away mousie and let me get the box For answer there was a scratching and nibbling down in the corner that held more terrors for the anxious ears than an invading army I must go in said Phronsie and bring out the box Please good mouse go away for one moment then you may come back and stay all day But the shadowy corner only gave back the renewed efforts of the sharp little teeth so at last Phronsie plucking up courage stepped in The door swung to after her giving out a little click unnoticed in her trepidation as she picked her way carefully along holding her red gown away from any chance nibbles It was a low narrow closet unlighted save by a narrow latticed window in the ceiling for the most part filled with two lines of shelves running along the side and one end Phronsie caught her breath as she went in the air was so confined and stumbling over in the dim light put her hand on the box desired a small black affair easily found as it was the only one there I will take it out into the lumber room then I can get the velvet roll and gathering it up within her arms she speedily made her way back to the door Why another pull at the knob but with the same result and Phronsie setting the box on the floor still with thoughts only of the mouse put both hands to the task of opening the door It sticks I suppose because no one comes up here only once in a great while she said in a puzzled way I ought to be able to pull it open I m sure for I am so big and strong She exerted all her strength till her face was like a rose The door was fast Phronsie turned a despairing look upon the shadowy corner Please don t bite me she said the large tears gathering in her brown eyes I am locked in here in your house but I didn t want to come and I won t do anything to hurt you if you ll let me sit down and wait till somebody comes to let me out Meanwhile missus Chatterton shook out her black satin gown complacently and with a satisfied backward glance at the mirror sailed off to her own apartments Madame exclaimed Hortense breathlessly meeting her within the door de modiste will not send de gown you must Will not send it repeated her mistress in a passion A pretty message to deliver Go back and get it at once She say de drapery de tournure all wrong and she must try it on again said the maid glad to be defiant since the dressmaker supported her What utter nonsense Yet I suppose I must go or the silly creature will have it ruined Take off this gown Hortense and bring my walking suit then ring and say I d like to have Thomas take me down there at once and throwing off her bracelets and the various buckles and pins that confined her laces she rapidly disrobed and was expeditiously inducted by Hortense into her walking apparel and a parlor maid announcing that Thomas with the coupe was at the door she hurried downstairs with no thought for anything beyond a hasty last charge to her maid Where s Phronsie cried Polly rushing into Mother Fisher s room O dear me my hair won t stay straight pushing the rebellious waves out of her eyes It looks as if a brush wouldn t do it any harm observed Mother Fisher critically O dear dear well I ve brushed and brushed but it does no good said Polly running over to the mirror some days Mamsie no matter what I do it flies all ways Good work tells generally said her mother pausing on her way to the closet for a closer inspection of her and her head you haven t taken as much pains Polly lately with your hair that is the trouble Well I m always in such a hurry mourned Polly brushing furiously on the refractory locks There will you stay down to a particularly rebellious wave One at a time is the best way to take things said missus Fisher dryly When you dress yourself Polly I d put my mind on that if I were you With that she disappeared within the closet O dear I suppose so sighed Polly left to her own reflections and brushing away Well that s the best I can make it look now for I can t do the braid over Where is Phronsie I wonder Mamsie she threw down the brush and ran over to put her head in the closet where did she go I told her she might run over to Helen Fargo s right after breakfast said missus Fisher her head over a trunk from which she was taking summer dresses Polly I think you ll get one more season s wear out of this pink cambric Oh I am so glad cried Polly for I had such splendidly good times in it with a fond glance at the pink folds and ruffles Well if Phronsie is over at Helen s there s no use in asking her to go down town with us Where are you going asked missus Fisher extricating one of Phronsie s white gowns from its winter imprisonment Down to Candace s said Polly Jasper wants some more pins for his cabinet No I don t suppose Phronsie would tear herself away from Helen for all the down towns in the world You would better let her stay where she is advised Mother Fisher she hasn t been over to Helen s for quite a while so it s a pity to call her away and she turned to her unpacking again while Polly ran off on the wings of the wind in a tremor at having kept Jasper waiting so long Candace was the widow of an old colored servant of mister King s she called herself a relict that and the pride in her little shop made her hold her turbaned head high in the air while a perennial smile enwreathed her round face The shop was on Temple Place a narrow extension thrown out from one of the city s thoroughfares She was known for a few specialties such as big sugary doughnuts that appealed alike to old and young They were always fresh and sweet with just the proper amount of spice to make them toothsome and she made holders of various descriptions with the most elaborate patterns wrought always in yellow worsted with several other things that the ladies protested could never be found elsewhere Jasper had been accustomed to run down to Candace s little shop since pinafore days when he had been taken there by his nurse and set upon a high stool before the small counter and plied with dainties by the delighted Candace The first thing I can remember he had often told Polly is Candace taking out huge red and white peppermint drops from the big glass jar in the window and telling me to hold out both hands And after the pinafore days were over Candace was the boy s helper in all his sports where a woman s needle could stitch him out of any difficulty She it was who made the sails to his boats and marvelous skate bags She embroidered the most intricate of straps for his school books and once she horrified him completely by working in red cotton large J s on two handkerchiefs He stifled the horror when he saw her delight in presenting the gift and afterwards was careful to remember to carry a handkerchief occasionally when on an errand to the shop Latterly Candace was occupied in preparing pins for Jasper s cabinet out of old needles that had lost their eyes She cleverly put on red and black sealing wax heads turning them out as round as the skillful manipulation of deft fingers could make them In this new employment the boy kept her well occupied many half dollars thereby finding their way into her little till I wish Phronsie had come said Polly as she and Jasper sorted the pins in the little wooden tray Candace kept for the purpose How many red ones you will have Jasper see fifteen well they re prettier than the others Ef little Miss had come wid you said Candace emerging from the folds of a chintz curtain that divided the shop from the bedroom she d a seen my doll I made for her Land but it s a beauty Oh Candace exclaimed Polly dropping the big pin she held and allowing it to roll off the counter to the floor What a pity we didn t bring her Do let us see the doll She s a perfec beauty repeated Candace in satisfaction an I done made her all myself fer de little Miss and she dodged behind the curtain again this time bringing out a large rag doll with surprising black bead eyes a generous crop of wool on its head and a red worsted mouth Dat s my own hair said Candace pointing to the doll s head with pride so I know it s good an ain t dat mouf pretty Oh Candace exclaimed Polly seizing the doll and skillfully evading the question what a lovely dress and the apron is a dear Ain t it said Candace her black face aglow with delight Ole Miss gimme dat yeller satin long ago w en I belonged to her befo de war An dat yere apun was a piece of ole Miss s night cap She used to have sights of em and dey was all ruffled like to kill an made o tambour work Polly had already heard many times the story of Madame Carroll s night caps so she returned to the subject of the doll s beauty as a desirable change Do you want us to take this to Phronsie she asked Jasper won t she be delighted Land no cried Candace recovering the doll in alarm I d never sleep a week o nights ef I didn t put dat yere doll into dat bressed child s arms Then I ll tell Phronsie to come over to morrow said Polly Shall I Candace Yes said Candace you tell her I got somefin fer her don t you tell her what an send her along All right said Jasper Just imagine Phronsie s eyes when she sees that production Candace you ve surpassed yourself You go long exclaimed Candace in delight and bestowing a gentle pat of deprecation on his shoulder tain t like what I could do but la well you send de bressed chile along and mabbe she ll like it Jasper we ll stop at Helen s now said Polly as the two hurried by the tall iron fence that lined with its thick hedge shut out the Fargo estate from vulgar eyes and get Phronsie she ll be ready to come home now it s nearly luncheon time All right said Jasper so the two ran over the carriage drive to a side door by which the King family always had entree Is Phronsie ready to come home asked Polly of the maid Tell her to hurry and get her things on we ll wait here Oh Jasper turning to him why couldn t we have the club next week Wednesday night Miss Mary said the maid interrupting what do you mean I haven t seen Miss Phronsie to day Polly whirled around on the step and looked at her Oh she s upstairs in the nursery playing with Helen I suppose Please ask her to hurry Hannah No she isn t Miss Mary said Hannah I ve been sweeping the nursery this morning just got through She pointed to her broom and dustpan that she had set in a convenient corner as proof of her statement Well she s with Helen somewhere said Polly a little impatiently Yes find Helen and you have the two broke in Jasper Just have the goodness Hannah to produce Helen Miss Helen isn t home said Hannah She went to Greenpoint yesterday with missus Fargo to spend Sunday Why exclaimed Polly in bewilderment Mamsie said she told Phronsie right after breakfast that she could come over here She hasn t been here said the maid positively I know for certain sure Miss Mary Has she Jane appealing to another maid coming down the hall No said Jane She hasn t been here for ever so many days Phronsie played around outside probably said Jasper quickly anyway she s home now Come on Polly She ll run out to meet us Oh Jasper do you suppose she will cried Polly unable to stifle an undefinable dread She was running now on frightened feet Jasper having hard work to keep up with her and the two dashed through the little gate in the hedge where Phronsie was accustomed to let herself through on the only walk she was ever allowed to take alone and into the house where Polly cried to the first person she met Where s Phronsie to be met with what she dreaded Gone over to Helen Fargo s And now there was indeed alarm through the big house Not knowing where to look each fell in the other s way quite as much concerned for mister King s well being for the old gentleman was reduced to such a state by the fright that the entire household had all they could do to keep him in bounds Madame is not to come home to luncheon announced Hortense to missus Whitney in the midst of the excitement She told me to tell you that de Mees Taylor met her at de modiste and took her home with her missus Whitney made no reply but raised her eyes swollen with much crying to the maid s face Hortense run as quickly as possible down to doctor Fisher s office and tell him to come home Thomas should be sent said Hortense with a toss of her head It s not de work for me Beside I am Madame s maid Do you go at once commanded missus Whitney with a light in her blue eyes that the maid never remembered seeing She was even guilty of stamping her pretty foot in the exigency and Hortense slowly gathered herself up I will go Madame with the air of conferring a great favor only I do not such t ings again XVII PHRONSIE IS FOUND I am glad that you agree with me missus Chatterton bestowed a complacent smile upon the company But we don t in the least agree with you said Madame Dyce her stiff brocade rustling impatiently in the effort to put her declaration before the others not in the least Ah Well you must allow that I have good opportunities to judge The Pepper entanglement can be explained only by saying that my cousin s mental faculties are impaired The rest of the family are afflicted in the same way aren t they remarked Hamilton Dyce nonchalantly Humph yes missus Chatterton s still shapely shoulders allowed themselves a shrug intended to reveal volumes What Jasper Horatio King believes the rest of the household accept as law and gospel But it s no less infatuation I ll not hear one word involving those dear Peppers cried Madame Dyce If I could I d have them in my house And it s a most unrighteous piece of work in my opinion to endeavor to arouse prejudice against them It goes quite to my heart to remember their struggles all those years missus Chatterton turned on her with venom Was all the world arrayed against her to take up with those hateful interlopers in her cousin s home She made another effort I should have credited you with more penetration into motives than to allow yourself to be deceived by such a woman as missus Pepper Do give her the name that belongs to her I believe she s missus doctor Fisher isn t she drawled Livingston Bayley a budding youth with a moustache that occasioned him much thought and a solitary eyeglass Stuff and nonsense Yes what an absurd thing that wedding was Did anybody ever hear or see the like missus Chatterton lifted her long jeweled hands in derision but as no one joined in the laugh she dropped them slowly into her lap I don t see any food for scorn in that episode said the youth with the moustache Possibly there will be another marriage there before many years I m sweet on Polly missus Chatterton s face held nothing but blank dismay The rest shouted You needn t laugh you people said the youth setting his eyeglass straight that girl is going to make a sensation I tell you when she comes out I m going to secure her early Not a word mind you about Miss Polly s preferences laughed Hamilton Dyce aside to Miss Mary Tisn t possible that she could be anything but fascinated of course Mary laughed back Of course not The callow youth knows his power Anybody else in favor of the Peppers aloud and looking at the company Don t ask us if we like the Peppers cried two young ladies simultaneously They are our especial and particular pets every one of them The Peppers win said Hamilton Dyce looking full into missus Chatterton s contemptuous face I m glad to record my humble self as their admirer Now Well pa Mary could not refrain from interrupting as her father suddenly appeared in the doorway I can t sit down he said as the company made way for him to join them I came home for some important papers I suppose you have heard the trouble at the Kings I happened to drop in there Well Dyce laying his hand on that gentleman s chair I scarcely expected to see you here to day Why aren t you at the club spread Cousin Horatio I suppose he s had a paralytic attack interrupted missus Chatterton with her most sagacious air What s the trouble up there queried mister Dyce ignoring the question thrust at him It s the little beauty Phronsie said mister Taylor Nothing s happened to that child I hope cried Madame Dyce paling Now mister Taylor you are not going to harrow our feelings by telling us anything has harmed that lovely creature exclaimed the two young ladies excitedly Phronsie can t be found said mister Taylor Can t be found echoed all the voices except missus Chatterton s She ejaculated Ridiculous Hamilton Dyce sprang to his feet and threw down his napkin Excuse me Miss Taylor Come Bayley now is the time to show our devotion to the family Let us go and help them out of this Young Bayley jumped lightly up and stroked his moustache like a man of affairs All right Dyce Bon jour ladies How easily a scene is gotten up said missus Chatterton over a naughty little runaway I wish some of the poor people in this town could have a tithe of the attention that is wasted on these Peppers she added virtuously Madame Dyce turned uneasily in her seat and played with the almonds on her plate I think we do best to reserve our judgments she said coolly I don t believe Phronsie has run away Of course she has asserted missus Chatterton in that positive way that made everybody hate her to begin with She was all right this morning when I left home Where else is she if she hasn t run away pray tell Not being able to answer this no one attempted it and the meal ended in an uncomfortable silence Driving home a half hour later in a cab summoned for that purpose missus Chatterton threw off her things angry not to find Hortense at her post in the dressing room where she had been told to finish a piece of sewing and not caring to encounter any of the family in their present excitement she determined to take herself off upstairs where I can kill two birds with one stone get rid of everybody and find my box myself because of course that child ran away before she got it So she mounted the stairs laboriously counting herself lucky indeed in finding the upper part of the house quite deserted and shutting the lumber room door when she was well within it she proceeded to open the door of the closet Hortense didn t tell me there was a spring lock on this door she exclaimed with an impatient pull Oh good heavens She had nearly stumbled over Phronsie Pepper s little body lying just where it fell when hope was lost I have had nothing to do with it repeated missus Chatterton to herself following mister King and Jasper as they bore Phronsie downstairs her yellow hair floating from the pallid little face Goodness I haven t had such a shock in years My heart is going quite wildly The child probably went up there for something else I am not supposed to know anything about it Is she dead cried Dick summoned with the rest of the household by missus Chatterton s loud screams and quite beside himself he clambered up the stairs to get in every one s way missus Chatterton with an aimless thrust of her long jeweled hands pushed him one side And Dick boiled over at that What are you here for he cried savagely You don t love her You would better get out of the way And no one thought to reprove him Polly was clinging to the post at the foot of the stairs I shall die if Phronsie is dead she said Then she looked at Mother Fisher waiting for her baby Give her to me said Phronsie s mother holding out imperative arms You would better let us carry her well put her in your bed Only get the doctor mister King was almost harsh as he endeavored to pass her But before the words were over his lips the mother held her baby Mamsie cried Polly creeping over to her like a hurt little thing I don t believe but that she ll be all right God won t let anything happen to our Phronsie He couldn t Mamsie doctor Fisher met them at the door Polly never forgot the long slow terror that clutched at her heart as she scanned his face while he took the child out of the arms that now yielded up their burden And everything turned dark before her eyes Was Phronsie dead But there was Mamsie And Polly caught her breath beat back the faintness and helped to lay Phronsie on the big bed Clearly I have had nothing to do with it said missus Chatterton to herself stumbling into a room at the other end of the hall But her face was gray and she found herself picking nervously at the folds of lace at her throat The child went up there as all children will to explore I shall say nothing about it nothing whatever Oh how is she grasping blindly at Jasper as he rushed by the door Still unconscious Stuff and oh well muttering on She ll probably come to Children can bear a little confinement an hour or two doesn t matter with them Hortense aloud bring me my sal volatile Dear me this is telling on my nerves She caught sight of her face in the long mirror opposite and shivered to see how ghastly it was Where is the girl Hortense I say come here this instant A maid summoned by her cries put her head in the door Hadn t you better go into your own room missus Chatterton she said in pity at the shaking figure and blanched face No no she sharply repulsed her Bring Hortense where is that girl she demanded passionately She s crying said the maid her own eyes filling with tears I ll help you to your room Crying Madame Chatterton shrieked She s paid to take care of me what right has she to think of anything else She says she was cross to Phronsie once though I don t see how she could be and and now that she s going to die she and the maid burst into tears and threw her apron over her face Die she shan t What utter nonsense everybody does talk in this house Madame Chatterton seized her arm the slender fingers tightening around the young muscles and shook her fiercely The maid roused by her pain out of her tears looked in affright into the gray face above her Let me go she cried Oh madame you hurt me Give me air said Madame Chatterton her fingers relaxing and making a great effort not to fall Help me over to the window and open it girl and leaning heavily on the slight figure she managed to get across the room There now drawing a heavy breath as she sank into a chair and thrust her ashen face out over the sill do you go and find out how the child is And come back and tell me at once Madame I m afraid to leave you alone said the girl looking at her Afraid I m not so old but that I can take care of myself said missus Chatterton with a short laugh Go and do as I tell you stamping her foot Still unconscious Would no one ever come near her but this detestable maid with her still more detestable news missus Chatterton clutched the window casing in her extremity not feeling the soft springy air as she gasped for breath The maid too frightened to leave her crept into a corner where she watched and cried softly There was a stir in the household that they might have heard betokening the arrival of two other doctors but no word came And darkness settled upon the room Still the figure in the window niche held to its support and still the maid cried at her post As the gray of the twilight settled over the old stone mansion Phronsie moved on her pillow Dear mouse the circle of watchers around the bed moved closer I ll go away when some one comes to open the door Hush doctor Fisher put his hand over the mother s lips Don t please bite me very hard I won t come up again to your house Oh where s Grandpapa Old mister King put his head on his hands and sobbed aloud The little white face moved uneasily Grandpapa always comes when I want him in piteous tones Father said Jasper laying a hand on the bowed shoulders you would better come out We ll call you when she comes to herself But mister King gave no sign of hearing A half hour ticked slowly away and Phronsie spoke again It s growing dark and I suppose they will never come Dear mouse the words died away and she seemed to sleep I shall not tell missus Chatterton was saying to herself in the other room what good could it do Oh this vile air is stifling Will no one come to say she is better And so the night wore on As morning broke Phronsie opened her eyes and gave a weak little cry Polly sprang from her knees at the foot of the bed and staggered toward the child Don t cried Jasper with a hand on her arm Let her alone said doctor Fisher quickly Oh Polly Phronsie raised herself convulsively on the bed You did come you did winding her little arms around Polly s neck Has the mouse gone Yes yes said Polly as convulsively he s all gone Phronsie and I have you fast just see And I ll never let you go again Never cried Phronsie straining to get up further into Polly s arms No dear I ll hold you close just as long as you need me And he won t come again He can t Phronsie because you see I have you now And the door will open and I ll have Mamsie and dear Grandpapa Yes yes my precious one began mister King getting out of the large arm chair into which they had persuaded him Don t do it Stay where you are said doctor Fisher stopping him half way across the room But Phronsie wants me she said so exclaimed old mister King hoarsely and trying to push his way past the doctor Why man don t stop me doctor Fisher planted his small body firmly in front of the old gentleman You must obey me Obey When had mister King heard that word addressed to himself He drew a long breath looked full into the spectacled eyes then said All right Fisher I suppose you know best and went back to his arm chair I m so tired Polly Phronsie was saying and the arms Polly could feel were dropping slowly from her neck Are you Pet Well now I ll tell you what we ll do Let us both go to sleep There Phronsie now you put your arms down so Polly gave them a swift little tuck under the bed clothes and I ll get up beside you so and she crept on to the bed and we ll both go right to nid nid nodland don t you know You re sure you won t let me go whispered Phronsie cuddling close and feeling for Polly s neck again Oh just as sure as I can be declared Polly cheerfully while the tears rained down her cheek in the darkness I feel something wet said Phronsie drawing back one hand What is it Polly Oh that said Polly with a start Oh well it s well I m crying Phronsie but I m so glad oh you don t know how glad I am sweet and she leaned over and kissed her If you re glad said Phronsie weakly I don t care But please don t cry if you are not glad Polly Well now we re fixed said Polly as gaily as she could Give me your hand Pet There now good night Good night said Phronsie Polly could feel her tucking the other hand under her cheek on the pillow and then blessed sound the long quiet breathing that told of rest Oh better is she missus Chatterton looked up quickly to see missus Whitney s pale face Well I supposed she would be I thought I d sit here and wait to know since you were all so frightened But I knew it wouldn t amount to much Now girl nodding over to the maid still in the corner you may get me to bed And she stretched her stiff limbs and held out her hand imperatively It was very fortunate that I did not tell she said when the slow passage to her own apartments had been achieved Now if the child will only keep still all will be well XVIII THE GIRLS HAVE POLLY AGAIN Phronsie shall have a baked apple this morning said Mother Fisher coming into the sunny room where Phronsie lay propped up against the pillows Did Papa Doctor say so asked Phronsie a smile of supreme content spreading over her wan little face Yes he did said her mother as nice an apple red and shiny as we could find is downstairs baking for you Phronsie When it s done Sarah is to bring it up That will be very nice breathed Phronsie slowly And I want my little tea set just the two cups and saucers and my own little pot and sugar bowl Do let me Mamsie and you shall have a cup of milk with me she cried a little pink color stealing into either cheek Yes yes child said Mother Fisher There you mustn t try to lean forward I ll bring the little table Grandpapa bought so she hurried over across the room and wheeled it into place Now isn t that fine Phronsie as the long wing swung over the bed Did you ever see such a tea party as you and I ll have Breakfast party Mamsie hummed Phronsie isn t that just lovely wriggling her toes under the bed clothes Do you think Sarah ll ever bring that apple Yes indeed why here she is now announced missus Fisher cheerily Come in Sarah as a rap sounded on the door Our little girl is all ready for that good apple My what a fine one Bless honey s heart ejaculated Sarah her black face shining with delight Ain t he a beauty though setting down on the table wing a pink plate in the midst of which reposed an apple whose crackling skin disclosed a toothsome interior I bring a pink sasser so s to match his insides But ain t he rich though Sarah said Phronsie with hungry eyes on the apple I think he is very nice indeed and I do thank you for bringing him Bless her precious heart cried Sarah her hands on her ample hips and her mouth extended in the broadest of smiles Do get me a spoon Mamsie begged Phronsie unable to take her gaze from the apple I m so glad he has a stem on Sarah carefully picking at it Well there said Sarah I had the greatest work to save that stem But la I wouldn t a brung one without a stem I know d you d want it to hold it up by when you d eat the most off Yes I do said Phronsie in great satisfaction fondling the stem And here s your spoon said her mother bringing it Now child enjoy it to your heart s content Phronsie set the spoon within the cracked skin and drew it out half full Oh Mamsie she cried as her teeth closed over it do just taste it s so good Hee hee laughed Sarah I guess tis Such works as I had to bake dat apple just right But he s a beauty ain t he though Phronsie did not reply being just at that moment engaged in conveying a morsel as much like her own as possible to her mother s mouth Seems to me I never tasted such an apple said Mother Fisher slowly swallowing the bit Did you now cried Sarah Downstairs Polly was dancing around the music room with three or four girls who had dropped in on their way from school Give me a waltz now Polly begged Philena Dear me I haven t had a sight of you hardly for so long I am positively starved for you I don t care for you other girls now she cried as the two went whirling down the long room together Thank you Miss Philena cried the others seizing their partners and whirling off too I feel as if I could dance forever cried Polly when Amy Garrett turned away from the piano and declared she would play no more and she still pirouetted on one foot to come up red as a rose to the group Look at Polly s cheeks cried Amy You ve been a white little minx so long said Alexia putting a fond arm around Polly I went home and cried every day after I would steal around the back way to see how Phronsie was Won t Phronsie be downstairs soon asked Amy I don t know said Polly Papa Doctor is going to be dreadfully careful of her that she doesn t get up too soon Say Polly cried another girl don t you have to take a lot of pills and stuff now that doctor Fisher is your father Polly threw back her head and laughed merrily It sounded so strangely to her to hear the sound echoing through the room so long silent that she stopped suddenly Oh girls I can t hardly believe even yet that Phronsie is almost well she cried Well you d better advised Alexia philosophically because she is you know Do laugh again Polly it s good to hear you I can t help it said Polly Cathie asked such a funny question Cathie s generally a goose said Alexia coolly Thank you said Cathie a tall girl with such light hair and sallow face that she looked ten years older than her fourteen summers I sometimes know quite as much as a few other people of my acquaintance she said pointedly I didn t say but that you did said Alexia composedly I said you were generally a goose And so you are Why everybody knows that Cath Come come girls don t fight said Polly How can you when Phronsie is getting better Alexia didn t mean anything Cathie Yes she did declared Cathie with a pout she s always meaning something She s the hatefullest thing I ever saw Nonsense said Polly with a gay little laugh She says perfectly dreadful things to me and so I do to her but we don t either of us mind them Well those are in fun said Cathie that s a very different matter So you must make these in fun said Polly I would if I were you But she drew away from Alexia s arm Polly don t be an idiot and fight with me whispered Alexia in her ear Go away said Polly shaking her off Polly Polly I ll say anything if you won t look like that See here Cathie let s make up and she ran over seized the tall girl by the waist and spun her around till she begged to stop Is that your way of making up cried Cathie when she had the breath to speak Yes it is as good as any other way It spins the nonsense out of you There with a last pat on the thin shoulder she left her and ran back to Polly It s all done she cried I m at peace with the whole world Now don t look like an ogre any longer Phronsie s actually hungry now all the time confided Polly in a glow and we can t get enough to satisfy her Good good cried the girls I m going to send her some of my orange jelly declared Alexia I ll make it just as soon as I go home Do you think she will like it Polly she asked anxiously Yes I do believe she will said Polly because she loves oranges so Well I shan t make any old orange jelly cried Cathie her nose in the air Faugh it s insipid enough But tisn t when it s made the way Alexia makes it said Polly viewing in alarm the widening of the breach between the two I ve eaten some of hers and it s too splendid for anything I don t know anything about hers but all orange jelly I have tasted is just horrid I hate it I m going to make almond macaroons They re lovely Polly Oh don t Cathie begged Polly in distress Why not pray tell whirling on one set of toes You needn t be afraid they won t be good I ve made them thousands of times But she couldn t eat them said Polly Just think almond macaroons Why Papa Doctor would Now I know the doctor makes you take perfectly terrible things and won t let you eat anything And macaroons are the only things I can make It s a shame and down sat Cathie in despair on an ottoman What s the matter doctor Fisher put his head in at the doorway his spectacled eyes sending a swift glance of inquiry around O dear me exclaimed Cathie in a fright jumping up and clutching the arm of the girl next to her Don t let Polly tell him what I said don t Polly won t tell said the girl with a superb air don t you know any better Cathie Harrison you goose you To be called a goose by two persons in the course of an hour was too much for Cathie s endurance and flinging off the girl s arm she cried out passionately I won t stay I m going home and rushed out the door doctor Fisher turned from a deliberate look at the girl s white cheeks as she ran past to the flushed ones before him I m very sorry that anything unpleasant has happened I dropped in to tell you of a little surprise but I see it s no time now Oh Papa Doctor cried Polly flying up to him from the center of the group it was nothing only A girl s quarrel is not a slight thing Polly said little doctor Fisher gravely and one of your friends has gone away very unhappy Oh I know it said Polly and I m so sorry We can t any of us help it said Alexia quickly Cathie Harrison has the temper of a gorilla so there doctor Fisher doctor Fisher set his spectacles straight and looked at Alexia but he did not even smile as she hoped he would do I can t help it she said tracing the pattern of the carpet with the toe of her boot she makes us all so uncomfortable oh you can t think And I wish she d stay home forever Still no answer from the doctor He didn t act as if he heard but bowing gravely he withdrew his head and shut the door O dear dear cried Alexia when they had all looked at each other a breathing space Why didn t he speak I d much rather he d scold like everything than to look like that Polly why don t you say something Because there isn t anything to say Polly got no further and turned away suspiciously near to tears Was this the first meeting with the girls to which she had looked forward so long To think of that Cathie Harrison making such a breeze cried Alexia angrily a girl who s just come among us as it were and we only let her in our set because Miss Salisbury asked us to make things pleasant for her If it had been any one else who raised such a fuss Meantime doctor Fisher strode out to the west porch intending to walk down to his office and buttoning up his coat as he went along As he turned the angle in the drive he came suddenly upon a girl who had thrown herself down on a rustic seat under a tree and whose shoulders were shaking so violently that he knew she was sobbing though he heard no sound Don t cry said the little doctor and what s the matter all in the same breath and sitting down beside her Cathie looked up with a gasp and then crushed her handkerchief over her eyes Those girls in there are perfectly horrid Softly softly said doctor Fisher I can t help it No matter what I say they call me names and I m tired of it O dear dear Now see here said the doctor getting up on his feet and drawing a long breath I m on my way to my office suppose you walk along with me a bit and tell me all about it Cathie opened her mouth intending to say Oh I can t instead she found herself silent and not knowing how she was presently pacing down the drive by the doctor s side Polly Pepper exclaimed Alexia as a turn in the drive brought the two figures in view of the music room windows did you ever see such a sight in your life Cathie is walking off with doctor Fisher There isn t anything her tongue won t say Did you tell Polly cried Jasper a half hour later putting his head into doctor Fisher s office Oh beg pardon I didn t know you were busy sir Come in said the doctor folding up some powders methodically No I didn t tell Polly Oh said Jasper in a disappointed tone I hadn t a fair chance But she ought to know it just as soon as it s talked of said Jasper fidgeting at a case of little vials on the table Oh beg pardon again I m afraid I ve smashed that chap as one rolled off to the floor I m no end sorry picking up the bits ruefully I have several like it said the doctor kindly and settling another powder in its little paper There were a lot of girls with Polly when I looked in upon her on my way out But we ll catch a chance to tell her soon my boy Oh I suppose so A lot of giggling creatures How Polly can stand their chatter I don t see cried Jasper impatiently They ve been shut off from Polly for some time you know said doctor Fisher quietly We must remember that Polly doesn t like some of them a bit better than I do said Jasper explosively only she puts up with their nonsense It s rather a difficult matter to pick and choose girls who are in the same classes said the doctor and Polly sees that Don t I know it exclaimed Jasper in an astonished tone Dear me doctor Fisher I ve watched Polly for years now And she s always done so He stopped whirling the articles on the office table and bestowed a half offended look on the little physician Softly softly Jasper said doctor Fisher composedly Of course you ve used your eyes Now don t spoil things by saying anything but let Polly go her own gait I beg of you Then he turned to his powders once more She will anyway declared Jasper Whatever she makes up her mind to do Polly does that very thing Not a bad characteristic laughed the doctor I should say not Now when I come up home for dinner you and I will find Polly and tell her the good news If she s with a lot of those silly girls I ll I ll tear her off this time doctor Fisher glared so fiercely as he declared this determination that Jasper laughed outright I thought no one was to disturb Polly s good intentions in that line he cried Well there s an end to all things and patience ceases to be a virtue sometimes So I ve thought a good many times but I ve borne it like a man Jasper drew himself up and laughed again at the doctor s face Oh you go along cried doctor Fisher his eyes twinkling I ll meet you just before dinner All right as Jasper rushed off doctor Fisher jumped to his feet pushing aside the litter of powder papers and bottles and ran his fingers through the shock of gray hair standing straight on his head Yes yes he muttered walking to the window it will be a good thing for Polly now I tell you Adoniram He always preferred to address himself by his first name then he was sure of a listener A vastly good thing It s quite time that some of the intimacies with these silly creatures are broken up a bit while the child gains immensely in other ways He rubbed his palms gleefully Oh good morning good morning A patient walking in looked up at the jolly little doctor I wish I could laugh like that he ejaculated his long face working in the unusual effort to achieve a smile You would if you had a gay crowd of children such as I have cried the little doctor proudly Why man that s better than all my doses But I haven t the children said the patient sourly and sitting down with a sigh I pity you then said doctor Fisher with the air of having been a family man for years Well besides owning the Peppers I m going off with them to there he stopped for before he knew it the secret was well nigh out XIX PHRONSIE IS WELL AGAIN But Polly was not to be told yet When Papa Fisher walked in to dinner the merry party around the oak table were waiting over the ices and coffee for his appearance Oh Papa Fisher cried Polly in dismay turning from one of Alexia s sallies and dropping her spoon Now you re all tired out too bad Mother Fisher flushed up and set her lips closely together Ben looked disapproval across the board and Polly knew that the wrong thing had been said Oh I didn t mean of course you must take care of the sick people she said impulsively Yes I must said doctor Fisher wearily and pushing up the shock of gray hair to a stiffer brush over his brow That s what I set out to do I believe But that s no reason why you should tire yourself to death and break down the first year said mister King eyeing him sharply Zounds man that isn t what I brought you up from the country for doctor Fisher looked into his wife s eyes and smiled I believe you brought me the smile said But he kept his tongue still And you must get accustomed to seeing suffering that you can t help Why man alive the town s full of it you can t expect to stop it alone I ll do what I can to help said the little doctor between his teeth and taking a long draught of the coffee his wife put by his plate I suppose there s no objection to that Now that s good smacking his lips in a pleased way Of course not if you help in the right way said old mister King stoutly but I ll wager anything that you re picking up all sorts of odd jobs among the poor that belong to the young doctors Your place is considerably higher where you can pick and choose your patients doctor Fisher laughed an odd little laugh that along with its pleasant note carried the ring of a strong will Oh well you know I m too old to learn new ways he said Better let me wag on at the old ones mister King gave an exclamation of disapproval It s lucky your time is short he said grimly and the secret was nearly out Phronsie is coming downstairs to morrow isn t she asked Jasper quickly over to the doctor Oh no indeed I think not answered mister King before doctor Fisher had time to reply She would better wait a day or two longer Isn t that so Doctor at last appealing to him I don t agree with you the little doctor drew off his attention from his plate You see she has regained her strength remarkably Now the quicker she is in the family life again the better for her Oh good good cried Polly delighted at the safe withdrawal from the precipice of dangerous argument Alexia now you must help us think up something to celebrate her coming downstairs Not so fast Polly The little doctor beamed at her in a way surprising to see after the morning s affair Phronsie won t be ready for any celebration before next week Then I think you may venture Alexia pouted and played with her spoon O dear cried Dick dolefully what s the reason we must wait a whole week pray tell Because Father Fisher says so replied Ben across the table that s the principal reason and it doesn t need any more to support it Well I tell you broke in Polly in her brightest way let us think up perfectly splendid things It s best as it is for it will take us a week to get ready I shall get her a new doll declared mister King The rest shouted Her others must be quite worn out What could you get her cried mister Whitney in the way of a doll Do tell us for I really do not see Why one of those phonograph dolls to be sure cried mister King promptly Are they on sale yet asked Jasper I thought they had not perfected them enough for the market I think I know where one can be bought said his father They must be perfected it s all nonsense that I can t find one if Phronsie wants it Yes she shall have a phonograph doll That will be perfectly elegant exclaimed Polly with sparkling eyes Won t Phronsie be delighted when she hears it talk She ought to have a Punch and Judy show said missus Whitney she s always so pleased with them father mister King pushed away his coffee cup and pulled out his note book Punch and Judy down that goes he said noting it after phonograph doll What else Can t we have some of those boys up from the Orphan Asylum asked Polly after a minute in which everybody had done a bit of hard thinking Phronsie loves to hear them sing when she goes there Oh they are so cunning She ll want to give them her best toys and load them down with all her possessions You see if she doesn t warned Jasper Well she won t give away her new doll anyway cried Polly No she never gives away one of the dolls you ve given her father said missus Whitney slowly not a single one I tried her one day asking her to give me one to bestow on a poor child and she quite reproached me by the look in her brown eyes I haven t asked her since What did she say asked mister King abruptly I can t Auntie dear Grandpapa gave them to me himself Then she ran for her savings bank and poured out the money in my lap Let s go out and buy the poor child a doll she begged and I really had to do it And there must be at least two hundred dolls in this house Two hundred dolls cried Alexia in astonishment and raising her hands Why yes father has been bringing Phronsie dolls for the last five years with the greatest faithfulness till her family has increased to a painful extent O dear me cried Alexia with great emphasis I should think they d be under foot in every room Well indeed they re not said Polly she keeps them up in her playroom And the playroom closet said missus Whitney that is full I peeped in there yesterday and the dolls are ranged according to the times when father gave them to her And the baby house is just crowded laughed Jasper I know because I saw her moving out her chairs and tables to make room O dear me exclaimed Alexia again for want of something else to say I just hate dolls exploded Dick Faugh how can girls play with them they re so silly And Phronsie always has something to do for hers so she can t come when I want her to I wish they were burned up he added vindictively mister King rubbed his forehead in a puzzled way Perhaps she has enough he said at last Yet what shall I give her if I don t buy a doll I d give her the phonograph one father said missus Whitney anyway Yes of course but after that what shall I do He looked so troubled that missus Whitney hastened to say Oh well father you know when you are abr and the secret Was nearly out for the second time But they were saved by the appearance of Alexia s father who often dropped in on the edge of the dinner hour for a second cup of coffee The next morning Phronsie was waiting for Grandpapa King who insisted that no one else should carry her downstairs the remainder of the household in various stages of delight and expectation revolving around her and curbing their impatience as best they might in hall and on staircase Oh Grandpapa do hurry begged Dick kicking his heels on the stairs Hush Dicky boy said mamma Grandpapa can t come till his agent is gone Don t you hear them talking in the library Well I wish mister Frazer would take himself off he s a nuisance declared the boy He s been here a whole hour Here comes Grandpapa announced Polly gleefully from a station nearer the library Hush now mister Frazer s going The library door opening at this announcement and a few sentences charged with business floating up the staircase the bustle around Phronsie became joyfully intense Mamsie don t you think she ought to have a shawl on cried Polly anxiously running over the stairs She s been shut up so long No said Mother Fisher Doctor told me particularly not to bundle her up It was the last thing he said before he went to his office Well said Polly with a sigh then there isn t absolutely anything more to do for her Why doesn t Grandpapa come You are worse than Dicky said missus Fisher with a little laugh Dear me Polly just think how old you are Phronsie stood quite still in the middle of the floor and folded her hands I want to see Grandpapa all alone when he comes up she said What for cried Polly pausing in astonishment Do you want us all to go out Phronsie asked her mother slowly Yes said Phronsie shaking her yellow head with great decision please every single one go out Mamsie I want to see Grandpapa quite alone All right child said missus Fisher with a look at Polly So after a little demur and consequent delay on the part of the others the door was closed and she was left standing all alone Phronsie drew a long breath I wish Grandpapa would come she said to herself And so you wanted me did you dear cried mister King joyfully as he hurried in and closed the door carefully Well now see if I can guess what you want to tell me Grandpapa said Phronsie standing quite still and turning a puzzled face toward him I don t want to tell you anything I want to ask you something Well well dear what is it Old mister King not stopping for a chair leaned over her and stroked her yellow head Now then look up and ask me right off Phronsie Must a person keep a promise asked Phronsie a really and truly promise Grandpapa Yes yes said the old gentleman with great abruptness to be sure one must Phronsie To be sure So now if any one has promised you anything do you make him stick to it It s mean enough to break your word child Phronsie drew a long breath That s all Grandpapa she said and lifting up her arms now take me downstairs please She laid a cool little cheek against his as he raised her to his shoulder Remember what I say Phronsie laughed mister King his mind more intent on the delightful fact that he was carrying down the longed for burden to the family life than on what he was saying and if any one has promised you anything keep him up sharp to pay you I verily believe it is that scamp Dick Here goes and reaching the door he threw it wide Forward march Well is the important conference over asked Polly with a keen look at them both missus Fisher s eyes did their duty but she said nothing Yes indeed declared mister King marching on gaily Now clear the way there all you good people Here you Dick drumming your heels go ahead sir I m glad enough to shouted Dick racing down the remainder of the stairs Halloo Phronsie waving his hand at her three cheers and a tiger Bother Here comes missus Chatterton Which was quite true To every one s astonishment the door of that lady s apartment opened slowly disclosing her in new morning wrapper preparing to join the cavalcade Good morning Cousin Eunice cried mister King gaily He could be merry with any one this day Come on this is a festal occasion you see Phronsie s going downstairs for the first time Fall into line I m not able to go down said missus Chatterton coming slowly out into the hall but I ll stand here and see the parade Bully exploded Dick softly peering up from the foot of the stairs Phronsie looked over mister King s shoulder at her as she was borne down the stairs and putting out her hand I m all well now she said Yes I see said missus Chatterton Then she pulled up her white shawl with a shiver It s rather cold here she said after all I believe I must get back to my room Nobody noticed when she crept back the hilarity now being so great below stairs I certainly am losing ground she muttered every little thing affects me so I ll step into Bartram s office next time I go down town and set that little matter straight since I ve made up my mind to do it It never would do to let him come to the house Horatio would suspect something to see my lawyer here and the whole household imagine I was going to die right off No no I must go there that s clear Then if it s attended to I ll live all the longer with nothing on my mind Phronsie meanwhile was going around from room to room in a pleased way and touching different objects gently Everything s new isn t it Polly she said at last when you stay upstairs Oh there s my kittens in the basket pointing to a bisque vase on the table Yes said Polly Mamsie brought it in here And we ve some flowers Alexia sent them over They re out in the back hall we saved them for you to put in yourself Oh exclaimed Phronsie that s so good in you Polly Don t stop now cried Dick in disgust Faugh you can fix flowers any time Come out into the dining room and you ll see something you ll like Phronsie smothered a sigh and turned slowly away from the kittens waiting in their basket for Alexia s flowers Come on shouted Dick seizing her hand You never can guess what it is in all this world Is it a new dog asked Phronsie fearfully whose memory of Dick s latest purchase was not altogether happy No said Dick pulling her on better than that Don t hurry her so said Polly What have you got Dick Now do you mind sir cried Jasper else well stop your pretty plan I won t hurry her said Dick slackening his gait Well here we are opening the dining room door Why Jane has let it out Phronsie fell back a step at this and tried to cover her feet with her gown searching the floor for the it Lookout cried Dick suddenly There he goes And something whirred over Phronsie s head Oh what is it she cried tumbling into Jasper s arms and clasping his neck Oh oh Why it s a swallow cried Dick in the babel that ensued a beautiful one too I ve just caught him and I made Jane let me bring it in here to surprise you he added proudly Well you ve succeeded cried Jasper holding Phronsie close There there child it s all right It s a bird Phronsie and he s gone upstairs He ll frighten my dolls cried Phronsie in new alarm hanging to Jasper s neck Oh do let us go upstairs and tell them he s only a bird Run along Dick and catch your old bird cried Jasper and clear out with him quick now He s the best thing there is in this house cried Dick going over the back stairs two at a time Girls are so silly Bring him down said Polly moving along to the foot and I ll show him to Phronsie and tell her about him Then she ll like him Dick I ll like him Dick echoed Phronsie if he doesn t frighten my dolls This episode taking the family life to the rear of the house no one noticed that soft footsteps were passing through the open front door that Jane who was sweeping the vestibule had left ajar to run and tell Dick that she had not let the bird out of the dining room So the uninvited guest to the household let himself up easily to the scene of his hopes the location of the ladies jewel boxes XX THE SECRET missus Chatterton standing by her toilet table carefully examining her wealth of gray hair to note the changes in its tint was suddenly surprised in the very act of picking out an obnoxious white hair by a slight noise in the further corner of the apartment 
3513_7741_000002_000001	train-clean-360	And dropping her fingers quickly and turning away from the glass she exclaimed How dare you Hortense come in without knocking 
none	none	If you make a noise I ll kill you declared a man standing in the shadow of a portiere and watching her underneath a slouched black hat There was a slight click that caused the listener s nerves to thrill But her varied life had brought her nothing if not self control and she coolly answered If you want my money say so
3513_7741_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Not exactly money ma am said the man for I don t suppose you have much here 
none	none	But I ll thank you to hand over that there box of diamonds He extended the other hand with its dingy fingers toward a large ebony jewel case elaborate with its brass hinges and suggestive of double locks on a corner of the table If you are determined to take it I suppose I must give it to you said missus Chatterton with evident reluctance handing the box designated very glad to think she had but a few days before changed the jewels to another repository to escape Hortense s prying eyes In making the movement she gave a sweeping glance out the window 
3513_7741_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Should she dare to scream 
none	none	Michael was busy on the lawn she knew she could hear his voice talking to one of the under gardeners See here old lady warned the man you keep your eyes in the room Now then his greedy glance fastened on the glittering gems on her fingers I ll thank you to rip them things off Dick racing along the further end of the hall after his bird with a Whoop la I ve almost caught you startling him he proceeded to perform the service for himself
3513_7741_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 There he goes cried Dick in her room 
none	none	Bother 
3513_7741_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Well I must catch him So without the preamble of knocking the boy dashed into the dressing room 
none	none	The bird whizzing ahead of him flashed between the drawn folds of the portiere Excuse me cried Dick rushing in but my swallow oh
3513_7741_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Go back cried missus Chatterton hoarsely you ll be killed 
none	none	The bird flying over his head and the appearance of the boy disconcerted the robber for one instant He held the long white hand in his tearing off the rings 
3513_7741_000010_000002	train-clean-360	There was no chance for her to escape she knew but she could save Dick 
3513_7741_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Go back she screamed again 
3513_7741_000011_000001	train-clean-360	There was only a moment to think but Dick dashed in and with a mighty spirit but small fists he flung himself against the stalwart arms and shoulders 
none	none	O heavens screamed missus Chatterton He s but a boy let him go You shall have the rings 
3513_7741_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Help help 
none	none	Dick clutching and tearing blindly at whatever in the line of hair or ragged garment he could lay hold of was waging an unequal warfare But what he did was accomplished finely And the bird rushing blindly into the midst of the contention with whirrings and flappings indescribable helped more than an army of servants to confuse the man Notwithstanding it was soon over but not before missus Chatterton had wrenched her fingers free and grasped the pistol from its loose hold in his other hand The box under his arm fell to the floor and Dick was just being tossed to the other side of the room she could hear him strike the cheval glass with a dull thud I can shoot as well as you said missus Chatterton handling the pistol deftly Make a noise and I will He knew it by her eyes and that she had taken good aim
3513_7741_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are you Dick cried Polly s voice outside and rapping at the door 
3513_7741_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 missus Chatterton have you seen him 
none	none	Come in called missus Chatterton with firmest of fingers on the trigger and her flashing eyes fastened upon the seamed dirty face before her 
3513_7741_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Polly threw wide the door 
none	none	We have a man here that we don t want said missus Chatterton
3513_7741_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll take care of him till you get help 
none	none	Hurry
3513_7741_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Dick cried Polly in a breath with a fearful glance at the boy lying there 
3513_7741_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I think he s all right Polly She dared say no more for Dick had not stirred 
none	none	Polly clasped her hands and rushed out almost into Jasper s face
3513_7741_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 A burglar a burglar and he dashed into missus Chatterton s room 
none	none	Don t interfere said missus Chatterton
3513_7741_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 I m a splendid markswoman 
none	none	You needn t shoot said the man sullenly
3513_7741_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 I won t stir 
none	none	No I don t think you will said the gray haired woman her eyes alight and hand firm as a rock
3513_7741_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Well here are the men 
3513_7741_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Jasper had seized a table spread and as Michael and the undergardeners advanced he went back of the robber and cleverly threw it over his head 
3513_7741_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It was easy to secure and bind him then 
3513_7741_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Polly rushed over to Dick 
3513_7741_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Turn the creature over and let us see how he looks said mister King hurrying in as the last knot of the rope was made fast 
none	none	The old slouched hat had fallen off in the struggle and the man s features came plainly to view
3513_7741_000027_000002	train-clean-360	 He s no beauty and that s a fact 
3513_7741_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve seen that fellow round here for many a day said Michael giving the recumbent legs a small kick 
none	none	Oncet he axed me ef we wanted ony wourk done I mind yees yer see with another attention from his gardening boot
3513_7741_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I want to tie one rope cried a voice 
3513_7741_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Dick opened his eyes rubbed them and felt of his head 
3513_7741_000029_000002	train-clean-360	 I m all right Polly 
3513_7741_000029_000003	train-clean-360	I saw stars but I ve got over it I guess 
3513_7741_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Let me give him the last knot He staggered blindly to his feet 
none	none	I ll tie for you said Jasper trust me Dick s all right only stunned he telegraphed to the rapidly increasing group
3513_7741_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell his mother so do somebody said old mister King 
none	none	Well Cousin Eunice you ve covered yourself with glory he turned on her warmly She had thrown aside the pistol and now sank into a chair Never mind she waved it off carelessly I ll imagine the compliments Just now I want a glass of wine 
3513_7741_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Call Hortense will you 
none	none	The man on the floor tried to raise his head But he couldn t so was obliged to content himself with an ugly grin That bird has flown he said
3513_7741_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll peep 
3513_7741_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She put me up to it we was goin shares on the old lady s stuff 
3513_7741_000036_000000	train-clean-360	With that missus Chatterton s spirit returned 
none	none	She sprang from her chair and rushed around from bureau to closet to see the extent of her maid s dishonesty But beyond a few minor deficiencies of her wardrobe there was no robbery to speak of Evidently Hortense had considered it unwise to be burdened with much impedimenta So the robber was hauled off to justice and Phronsie coming wonderingly up the stairs came softly in upon them in time to see Dick rush up to missus Chatterton with a You re a brick before them all After that there was no more hope of keeping things quiet in the house for Phronsie s sake Meanwhile the bird who had played no mean part in the engagement now asserted himself and blindly rushed into capture Isn t he lovely cried Phronsie tearing her gaze off from the wonderful wings as the swallow fluttered under the mosquito netting speedily brought in Yes his wings are said Polly
3513_7741_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Dick do tell over again how it all happened 
none	none	So Dick rehearsed once more as far as he knew the story tossing off lightly his part of it Your poor head does it ache cried Polly feeling of the big bump on the crown
3513_7741_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No not a bit declared Dick shaking his brown poll 
none	none	I m glad I didn t crack the glass That heavy plate cried Polly looking over at the cheval glass with a shiver Phronsie deserted the fascinating bird and began to smooth Dick s head with both hands
3513_7741_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Do let me bathe it she begged 
none	none	I ll get the Pond s Extract
3513_7741_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 No I won t said Dick 
3513_7741_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 It smells awfully and I ve had so much of it for my leg 
3513_7741_000046_000002	train-clean-360	I m all right Phronsie 
3513_7741_000046_000003	train-clean-360	See his wings now he s stretching 
none	none	But Phronsie was not to be diverted from her purpose I ll get bay rum she said May I 
3513_7741_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Dick made a wry face 
3513_7741_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Worse and worse 
none	none	Cologne then No I hate it He doesn t want it bathed Phronsie dear said Polly
3513_7741_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Boys like to get hurt you know 
3513_7741_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 Tisn t manly to be fixed up 
3513_7741_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Phronsie gave a sigh which so went to Dick s heart that he said All right bring on some water if you want to 
none	none	But don t get any brown paper I had enough of that when I was a boy And at the end of that exciting day the secret came out after all in rather a tame fashion doctor Fisher and Jasper met Polly in an angle of the hall as she was running upstairs after dinner for her schoolbooks Polly asked the little doctor putting both hands on her shoulders and looking into the brown eyes should you be willing to go abroad with your mother and Phronsie mister King and Jasper
3513_7741_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Polly gasped 
none	none	But you came in a later breath we couldn t leave you she cried loyally Well I suppose I should go along too said the little doctor enjoying her face Why Jasper Elyot King cried Polly slipping out from under the doctor s palms and seizing the two hands extended she began to spin around as in the olden days did you ever ever hear of anything so perfectly magnificent But Ben and Joel and Davie and she paused on the edge of another pirouette doctor Fisher made haste to answer Polly missus Whitney will take care of them And Jasper led her off into the dance again
3513_7741_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 How can we ever leave the boys 
none	none	Oh I don t see cried Polly a bit reproachfully her hair blown over her rosy cheeks 
3513_7741_000060_000003	train-clean-360	As they danced lightly down the long hall doctor Fisher leaned against a pillar and watched them 
3513_7741_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Have to said Jasper guiding his partner deftly in the intricacies of the chairs and statuary 
none	none	That s a good spin Polly he said as they brought up by the little doctor s side Lovely said Polly pushing back her locks from the sparkling eyes
3513_7741_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I m almost tempted to dance myself said doctor Fisher 
3513_7741_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 If I wasn t such an old fellow I d try that is if anybody asked me 
3513_7741_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I will said Polly laughing 
3513_7741_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Come Papa Fisher holding out her hand do give me the honor 
3513_7741_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said doctor Fisher bravely 
3513_7741_000065_000001	train-clean-360	So Jasper took the deserted post by the pillar and whistled a Strauss waltz 
3513_7741_000065_000002	train-clean-360	Thereupon a most extraordinary hopping up and down the hall was commenced the two figures bobbing like a pair of corks on a quivering water surface 
none	none	The doors opened and several faces appeared amongst the number missus Fisher s
3513_7741_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t help it said the little doctor coming up red and animated and wiping his forehead 
none	none	His spectacles had fallen off long since and he had let them go
3513_7741_000067_000002	train-clean-360	 It looked so nice to see Jasper and Polly I thought I d try it 
none	none	I didn t suppose I d get on so well I really believe I can dance
3513_7741_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Humph laughed mister King it looks like it 
3513_7741_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Just see Polly 
3513_7741_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Papa Fisher cried Polly with a merry peal in which Jasper unpuckering his lips from the Strauss effort had joined we must have looked Here she went off again 
3513_7741_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Jasper you did 
3513_7741_000070_000001	train-clean-360	That s just it Polly you did 
3513_7741_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Lucky you two caperers didn t break anything 
3513_7741_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Well if you ve got through laughing observed doctor Fisher I ll remark that the secret is out 
3513_7741_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you like it Polly asked mister King holding out his hand 
3513_7741_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 Say my girl And then before she could answer he went on You see we can t do anything without a doctor on our travels 
3513_7741_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Now Providence has given us one though rather an obstinate specimen he pointed to Father Fisher 
none	none	And he wants to see the hospitals and you want to study a bit of music and your mother wants rest and Jasper and Phronsie and I want fun so we re going that s all
3513_7741_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 When demanded Polly breathlessly 
none	none	In a month XXI THE WHITNEYS LITTLE PLAN I think it s a mean shame cried Joel on a high vindictive key You ve had burglars here twice and I haven t been home You speak as if we appointed the meeting Joe said Ben with a laugh Well it s mean anyway cried Joel with a flash of his black eyes Now there won t any come again in an age Goodness I hope not ejaculated mister King lowering his newspaper to peer over its top I d have floored him declared Joel striking out splendidly from the shoulder if I d only have been here All very well said Percy negligently but you weren t here and he laughed softly Do you mean to say that I couldn t have handled the burglar demanded Joel belligerently and advancing on Percy say Because if you do why I ll try a bout with you I didn t say anything what you could or couldn t do I said you weren t here and you weren t That s enough and Percy turned his back on him thrust his hands in the pockets of his morning jacket and stalked to the window Van opened his mouth to speak then thought better of it and gave a low whistle Joel finding no enthusiasm for tales of his fighting prowess ran off to interview Dick on the old topic of the burglary and to obtain another close account of its details To think Phronsie saw the other burglar five years ago and now Dick was on hand for this one those two babies he fumed and none of us men around Percy said Van come out in the hall will you What do you want asked Percy lazily Oh you come along cried Van laying hold of his jacket See here dropping his voice cautiously as he towed him successfully out let s give Joe a chance to see a burglar he wants to so terribly What do you mean asked Percy with astonished eyes his hands still in his pockets Van burst into a loud laugh then stopped short It ll take two of us he whispered Oh Van exclaimed Percy and pulling his hands from their resting places he clapped them smartly together But we ought not I really suppose he said at last letting them fall to his sides Mamma mightn t like it you know She wouldn t mind said Van yet he looked uneasy It would be a great comfort to every one to take Joe down He does yarn so It s an old grudge with you said Percy pleasantly You know he beat you when you were a little fellow and he d just come As if I cared for that cried Van in a dudgeon that was nothing I didn t half try and he went at me like a country sledge hammer Yes I remember Percy nodded placidly and you got all worsted and knocked into a heap Everybody knew it Do you suppose I d pound a visitor cried Van wrathfully his cheeks aflame Say Percy Whitney No I don t said Percy not when twas Joe That s just it He was Polly s brother At mention of Polly Percy s color rose and he put out his hand Beg pardon Van he said Here shake and make up I forgot all about our promise he added penitently I forgot it too declared Van quieting down and thrusting out his brown palm to meet his brother s Well I don t care what you say if you ll only go halves in this lark he finished brightening up Well I will said Percy to make atonement Come up to our room then and think it out cried Van gleefully flying over the stairs three at a bound Sh sh and hurry up Just then the door bell gave a loud peal and Jencks the butler opened it to receive a box about two feet long and one broad For Miss Phronsie Pepper said the footman on the steps holding it out but it s not to be given to her till to morrow All right said Jencks taking it That s the sixth box for Miss Phronsie that I ve took in this morning he soliloquized going down the hall and reading the address carefully And all the same size Ding a ling Jencks laid the parcel quickly on one of the oaken chairs in the hall and hurried to the door to be met by another parcel for Miss Phronsie Pepper not to be given to her till to morrow And the i dentical size he ejaculated squinting at it as he went back to pick up the first parcel as like as two peas they are Upstairs Polly was at work with happy fingers Alexia across the room asking every third minute Polly how does it go O dear I can t do anything unless you look and see if it s right And Polly would turn her back on a certain cloud of white muslin and floating lace and flying off to Alexia to give the necessary criticism with a pull here and a pat there would set matters straight presently running back to her own work again You see she said everything must be just right for next to Mamsie s wedding this is to be the most important occasion Alexia Rhys that we ve ever known We can t have anything too nice for Phronsie s getting well party That s so said Alexia twitching a pink satin bow on the handle of a flower basket O dear me this bow looks like everything I ve tried six different times to make it hang down quite careless and refined And just to provoke me it pokes up like a stiff old thing in my face Do come and tie it Polly So Polly jumped up again and laying determined fingers on the refractory bow sent it into a shape that Alexia protested was too lovely for anything Are you going to have a good by party asked Alexia after a minute I suppose so said Polly Grandpapa said I would better but O dear me I don t believe I can ever get through with it in all this world and Polly hid her face behind a cloud of muslin that was slowly coming into shape as a dress for one of Phronsie s biggest dolls It will be dreadful said Alexia with a pathetic little sniff and beginning on a second pink bow but then you know it s your duty to go off nicely and I m sure you can t do it Polly without a farewell party Yes said Polly slowly but then I d really rather write little notes to all the girls But I suppose they ll all enjoy the party she added Indeed they will declared Alexia quickly O dear me I wish I was going with you You ll have a perfectly royal time I m going to work hard at my music you know declared Polly raising her head suddenly a glow on her round cheek Oh well you ll only peg away at it when you ve a mind said Alexia carelessly and setting lazy stitches Most of the time you ll be jaunting around seeing things and having fun generally Oh don t I wish I was going with you Alexia Rhys cried Polly in astonishment and casting her needle from her she deserted the muslin cloud summarily Only peg away when I have the mind she repeated indignantly Well I shall have the mind most of the time I can tell you Why that s what I am going abroad for to study music How can I ever teach it if I don t go pray tell she demanded and now her eyes flashed and her hands worked nervously Oh nonsense cried Alexia not looking at the face before her and going on recklessly as if that meant anything all that talk about your being a music teacher Polly and she gave a little incredulous laugh Polly got out of her chair somehow and stood very close to the fussing fingers over the pink satin bow Do you never dare say that to me again she commanded it s the whole of my life to be a music teacher the very whole Oh Polly down went the satin bow dragging with it Alexia s spool of silk and the dainty scissors Don t don t I didn t mean anything but you really know that mister King will never let you be a music teacher in all this world Never you know it Polly Oh don t look like that please don t He will said Polly in a low but perfectly distinct voice for he has promised me Well he ll get out of it somehow said Alexia her evil genius urging her on for you know Polly it would be too queer for any of his family and and a girl of our set to turn out a music teacher You know Polly that it would And Alexia smiled in the most convincing way and jumped up to throw her arms around her friend If any of the girls in our set said Polly grandly and stepping off from Alexia wish to draw away from me they can do so now I am to be a music teacher I m perfectly happy to be one I want you all to understand Just as happy as I can possibly be in all this world Why it s what I ve been studying and working for and how else do you suppose I can ever repay dear Grandpapa for helping me Her voice broke and she stopped a minute clasping her hands tightly to keep back the rush of words Oh Polly cried Alexia in dismay and beginning to whimper she tried again to put her arm around her Don t touch me said Polly waving her off with an imperative hand Oh Polly Polly And the rest of our set may feel as you do then I don t want them to keep on liking me said Polly with her most superb air and drawing off further yet Polly if you don t stop you ll you ll kill me gasped Alexia Oh Polly I don t care what you are You may teach all day if you want to and I ll help get you scholars I ll do anything and so will all the girls I know they will Polly do let me be your friend just as I was O dear dear I wish I hadn t said anything I wish I had bitten my tongue off I didn t think you d mind it so much and now Alexia broke down and sobbed outright You ve got to say it s glorious to teach said Polly unmoved and with her highest air on and that you re glad I m going to do it It s glo glorious to teach mumbled poor Alexia behind her wet handkerchief And I m glad you re going to do it dictated Polly inflexibly I m glad you re going to do it echoed Alexia in a dismal tone Then I ll be your friend once more consented Polly with a slow step toward Alexia that is if you never in all this world say such a dreadful thing again Alexia Rhys Don t ask me You know I won t promised Alexia her spirits rising So Polly went over to her and set a kiss on her wet cheek comforting her as only Polly could and before long the pink satin bow with the spool of silk hanging to it and the scissors were found under the table and Polly attacked the muslin cloud with redoubled vigor and the girls voices carried merry laughter and scraps of happy talk and missus Chatterton stole out of the little reading room next to them and shut herself up in her own apartment Dear me how fine that doll s gown is to be Polly exclaimed Alexia after a bit Is the lace going on all around the bottom Yes said Polly biting off her thread and giving the muslin breadths a little shake Felicie is tucking the flounce then I shall have to sew on the lace How many dolls are there to refurbish before to morrow asked Alexia suddenly Four no five said Polly rapidly counting for the one that Grandpapa gave her Christmas before last Celestine you know does need a new waist I forgot her But that doesn t count the new sashes and the hair ribbons and the lace ruffles around the necks I guess there are almost fifty of them Dear me I must hurry and she began to sew faster yet What a nuisance all those dolls are said Alexia they take up every bit of your spare time That isn t the worst of it said Polly Alexia I don t know what we shall do for Phronsie works over them till she s quite tired out You ought to see her this morning She s up in the play house at it now I suppose said Alexia dressing every one of them for the party to morrow Yes said Polly she is Well I hope no one will give her a doll to morrow said Alexia at least no one but mister King Of course he will Oh no one else will declared Polly cheerfully Of course not Alexia And then Jencks walked in with his seven boxes exactly alike as to size and deposited them solemnly in a row on the blue and white lounge For Miss Phronsie Pepper and not to be opened till to morrow Miss Mary Polly said Alexia in a stage whisper and jumping up as Jencks disappeared to run over to the row do you suppose they are dolls I shall die if they are declared Polly desperately and sitting quite still They surely look like dolls on the very covers said Alexia fingering the cords Would it be so very wrong to open one box and just relieve our suspense Just one Polly No no don t cried Polly sharply They belong to Phronsie But O dear me And just think said Alexia like a Job s comforter and looking over at the clock it s only half past eleven Polly Pepper there s time for oceans more to come in yet It s perfectly horrid to get such a scrap of an outing said Joel that night sprawling on the rug before the library fire only four days Why couldn t mister Marks be sick longer than that if he was going to be sick at all pray These four days will give you strength for your exams won t they Joe asked Van Joel turned his black eyes on him and coolly said Yes then made a wry face doubled up a bit of paper and aimed it at Van Davie sighed and looked up anxiously I hope mister Marks will come out all right so that we can go back Monday I only hope he ll stay ill said Joel affectionately Tisn t safe anyway for us to go back Monday It may be typhoid fever you know Mamsie looking over at her They ll let us know soon enough if that s the case said Mother Fisher in the lamp light over by the center table No I expect your letter to morrow will say Come Monday Well it s a downright shame for us to be pulled off so soon cried Joel indignantly sitting straight Think how soon the term ends Joe cried Polly then you have such a long outing She sighed as she thought of the separation to come and the sea between them That s nothing only a dreadful little time soon will be gone grunted Joel turning his face to look at the brightly leaping flames the cool evening had made necessary Ben glanced over at Polly Don t talk of the summer he was going to say but stopped in time Phronsie set her doll carefully in the corner of the sofa and went over to Joel Does your head ache often at school Joel she asked softly laying her cool little palm on his stubby hair Yes said Joel it does awfully Phronsie and nobody cares and says Stop studying A shout greeted this That s too bad said Phronsie pityingly I shall just write and ask mister Marks if he won t let you stop and rest when it aches Twouldn t do any good Phronsie said Joel nothing would He s a regular old grinder Marks is mister Marks said Phronsie slowly I don t know who you mean by Marks Joel And what is a grinder please getting down on her knees to look in his face And he works us boys so Phronsie you can t think said Joel ignoring the question What is a grinder Joel please tell me repeated Phronsie with gentle persistence Oh a grinder is a horrid buffer began Joel impatiently Joel said missus Fisher reprovingly The fire in her black eyes was not pleasant to look at and after one glance he turned back to the blazing logs once more I can t help it he muttered picking up the tongs to poke the fire Don t ever let me hear that excuse from a son of mine said Mother Fisher scornfully Can t help it I d be master of myself that s one thing Joel set the tongs back with an unsteady hand They slipped and fell to the hearth with a clang Mamsie I didn t mean he began finding his feet And before any one could draw a long breath he rushed out of the room There was a dreadful pause Polly clasped her hands tightly together and looked at her mother missus Fisher quietly put her sewing into the big basket and got out of her chair Oh what is the matter with Joey cried Phronsie standing quite still by the deserted hearth rug Mamsie do you suppose his head aches I think it must said missus Fisher gravely Then she went out very quietly and they could hear her going up the stairs With a firm step she went into her own room and turned up the gas The flash revealed Joel face downward on the broad comfortable sofa missus Fisher went over and closed the door then came to his side I thought my boy she said that I should find you here Now then tell mother all about it and lifting his head she sat down and took it into her lap O dear cried Joel burrowing deep in the comfortable lap O dear O dear Now that is silly Joey said Mother Fisher tell me at once what all this trouble is about passing her firm hands over his hot forehead and trying to look in his face But he struggled to turn it away from her In the first place I just hate school he exploded XXII JOEL Hate school cried Mother Fisher Oh Joey think how Ben wanted more schooling only he wouldn t take the chance when mister King offered it to him because he felt that he must be earning money as soon as possible Oh Joey That Oh Joey cut deeply Joel winced and burrowed deeper under his mother s fingers That s just it he cried Ben wanted it and I don t I hate it and I don t want to go back Don t want to go back repeated missus Fisher in dismay No I don t The fellows are always twitting me and every one gets ahead of me and I m everlastingly staying in from ballgames to make up lessons and I d like to fire the books I would cried Joel with venom missus Fisher said nothing but the hands still stroked the brown stubby head in her lap And nobody cares for me because I won t be smart like the others but I can t help it I just hate school finished Joel in the same strain Joel said missus Fisher slowly if that is the case I shall go down to mister King and tell him that we Father Fisher and I Polly and Phronsie will not go abroad with him Joel bolted upright and putting down his two hands brought his black eyes to bear on her What I shall go directly downstairs and tell mister King that Father Fisher and I Polly and Phronsie will not go abroad with him repeated his mother slowly and distinctly while she looked him fully in the face You can t do that said Joel in amazement He s engaged the state rooms That makes no difference said missus Fisher when a woman has a boy who needs her nothing should stand in the way And I must stay at home and take care of you Joel Joel sprang to his feet and began to prance up and down the floor I m big enough to take care of myself mother he declared coming up to her to prance off again So I thought said missus Fisher composedly or I shouldn t have placed you at mister Marks s school The idea Mamsie of your staying at home to take care of me said Joel excitedly Why feel of that He bared his arm and coming up thrust it out for inspection Isn t that splendid I do verily believe I could whip any fellow in school I do he cried regarding his muscles affectionately If you don t believe it just pinch them hard You don t mean it really Mamsie what you said of course The idea of staying at home to take care of me and he began to prance again I don t care how many boys you can whip observed Mother Fisher coolly as long as you can t whip your own self when you re naughty you re too weak to go alone and I must stay at home Joel stopped suddenly and looked at her And before I d give up a boy of thirteen and beg to be taken away from school because the lessons were hard and I didn t like to study I d work myself to skin and bone but I d go through creditably missus Fisher sat straight now as an arrow in her corner of the sofa I ve said my say Joel she finished after a pause and now I shall go down and tell mister King Mother howled Joel dashing across the room to her don t go I ll stay I will Don t say that again about my having to be taken care of like a baby I ll be good mother and study Study doesn t amount to much unless you are glad of the chance said missus Fisher sharply I wouldn t give a fig for it being driven to it and her lips curled scornfully Joel wilted miserably I do care for the chance he cried just try me and see missus Fisher took his sunburnt face between her two hands Do you really wish to go back to school and put your mind on your books Be honest now Yes I do said Joel without winking Well you never told me a lie and I know you won t begin now said Mother Fisher slowly releasing him You may go back Joe I ll trust you Phronsie said Jasper as the sound of the two voices could be heard in Mother Fisher s room don t you want to come into my den I ve some new bugs in the cabinet found a regular beauty to day Phronsie stood quite still just where Joel had left her her hands were clasped and tears were rolling slowly down her cheeks No she said without looking at him Jasper I don t Do come Phronsie he begged going over to her and holding out his hand You can t think how nice the new one is with yellow stripes and two long horns Come and see it Phronsie No Jasper said the child quietly Then in the next breath I think Joey must be very sick Oh Mamsie is taking care of him and he ll soon be all right broke in Polly cheerily Do go with Jasper Phronsie do dear She took hold of the clasped hands and smiled up into the drooping face But Phronsie shook her head and said No If Grandpapa should come in and find her so twould be very dreadful exclaimed Polly looking over at the five boys who in this sudden emergency were knocked speechless Do let us all play some game Can t some one think of one Let us play Twenty Questions proposed Jasper brightly I ll begin it I ve thought of something That s horrid cried Van finding his tongue none of us want to play that I m sure I do said David I think Twenty Questions is always nice Is it animal vegetable or mineral Jasper I m sick of it Do play something not quite as old as the hills I beg Well you think of something yourself old man said Jasper nodding furiously at him Hurry up I d rather have Polly tell a story than any game you could possibly think of said Van going over to her where she sat on the rug at Phronsie s feet Polly will you he asked wheedlingly Don t ask her to night interposed Jasper Yes I shall It s the only time we shall have said Van before we go back to school Do Polly will you he begged again I can t think of the first thing declared Polly pushing back little rings of brown hair from her forehead Don t try to think just spin it off said Van Now begin You re a regular nuisance Van exclaimed Jasper indignantly Polly I wouldn t indulge him I know Phronsie wants a story don t you Phronsie asked Van artfully and running over to peer into her face But to his astonishment Phronsie stood perfectly still No she said again I don t want a story Joey must be sick Jasper cried Polly in despair and springing up something must be done Grandpapa s coming I hear him Phronsie said Jasper bending to speak into her ear do you know you are making Polly feel very unhappy Just think the next thing I don t know but what she ll cry Phronsie unfolded her hands Give me your handkerchief Polly she said winking back the rest of the tears Now there s a dear cried Polly pulling out her handkerchief and wiping the wet little face None too soon the door opened and mister King came in Well well well he exclaimed looking over his spectacles at them all Playing games hey We re going to said Ben and Jasper together No Polly is going to tell a story said Van loudly that is if you want to hear it Grandpapa Do say you do he begged going over to whisper in his ear I want immensely to hear it declared the old gentleman pulling up an easy chair to the fireside There now sitting down I m fixed Now proceed my dear Van softly clapped his hands Phronsie mister King beckoned to her and then suggestively touched his knee here dear Phronsie scurried across the room to his side Yes Grandpapa There up she goes sang mister King swinging her into position on his lap Now then Polly my child we are all ready for the wonderful tale Stay where is Joel Joel went upstairs a little while ago said Jasper quickly Well now Polly do begin I ll tell how we went to buy Phronsie s shoes said Polly drawing up an ottoman to mister King s side Now boys bring your chairs up Joel ought to know that you are going to tell a story Polly said mister King One of you boys run out and call him at the foot of the stairs He s in Mamsie s room said Ben I suppose when she gets through with him he ll come down Oh ah said the old gentleman Well Polly then perhaps you would better proceed So Polly began on the never tiresome recital how Phronsie fell down the stairs leading from the kitchen to the provision room in the little brown house with the bread knife in her hand and how because she cut her thumb so that it bled dreadfully mother decided that she could at last have a pair of shoes bought especially for her very own self and how Deacon Brown s old horse and wagon were procured and they all set forth except mother and how they rode to town and how the Beebes were just as good as gold and how the red topped shoes fitted as if they were made for Phronsie s feet and how they all went home and how Phronsie danced around the kitchen till she was all tired out and then went to bed carrying the new shoes with her and how she fell asleep with Why I declare exclaimed Polly reaching this denouement in a delightfully roundabout way if she isn t asleep now And indeed she was So she had to be carried up to bed in the same old way only this time it was Jasper instead of Polly who held her Don t you believe we d better put it off till some other night whispered Percy to Van on the way upstairs to bed the library party having broken up early A fellow doesn t want to see a burglar on top of the time Joel has had No no said Van it ll be good for him and knock the other thing out of his head don t you see Percy I should want something else to think of if I were Joel You can t back out you promised you know Well and I ll do it said Percy testily It s no use trying to sleep declared Joel in the middle of the night and kicking the bed clothes for the dozenth time into a roll at the foot as long as I can see Mamsie s eyes I ll just get up and tackle that Latin grammar now Whew haven t I got to work though Might as well begin at it and he jumped out of bed Stepping softly over to the door that led into David s little room he closed it carefully and with a sigh lighted the gas Then he went over to the table where his schoolbooks ought to have been But instead the space was piled with a great variety of things one or two balls a tennis racket and a confusion of fishing tackle while in front the last thing that had occupied him that day lay a book of artificial flies Joel set his teeth together hard and looked at them Suppose I shan t get much of this sort of thing this summer he muttered Here goes and without trusting himself to take another look he swept them all off down to the floor and into a corner There he said standing up straight lie there will you But they loomed up in a suggestive heap and his fingers trembled to just touch them once I must cover up the things or else I know I ll be at them he said and hurrying over to the bed he dragged off the cover lid Now and he threw it over the fascinating mass I ve GOT to study Dear me where are my books For the next five minutes Joel had enough to do to collect his working instruments and when at last he unearthed them from the corner of his closet where he had thrown them under a pile of boots he was tired enough to sit down I don t know which to go at first he groaned whirling the leaves of the upper book It ought to be Latin but then it ought to be algebra just as much and as for history well there here goes I ll take them as they come With a very red face Joel plunged into the first one under his hand It proved to be the Latin grammar and with a grimace he found the page and resting his elbows on the table he seized each side of his stubby head with his hands I ll hang on to my hair he said and plunged into his task And now there was no sound in the room but his hard breathing and the noise he made turning the leaves for he very soon found he was obliged to go back many lessons to understand how to approach the one before him and with cheeks growing every instant more scarlet with shame and confusion the drops of perspiration ran down his forehead and fell on his book Whew he exclaimed it s horribly hot and pushing back his book he tiptoed over to the other window and softly raised it The cool air blew into his face and leaning far out into the dark night he drew in deep breaths I ve skinned through and saved my neck a thousand times he reflected and now I ve got to dig like sixty to make up There s Dave now sleeping in there like a cat he doesn t have anything to do but to run ahead of the class like lightning just because he Loves it something seemed to sting the words into him Joel drew in his head and turned abruptly away from the window Pshaw well here goes he exclaimed again throwing himself into his chair She said I d work myself to skin and bone but I d get through creditably Joel bared his brown arm and regarded it critically I wonder how twould look all skin and bone and he gave a short laugh But this isn t studying He pulled down his sleeve and his head went over the book again Outside a bright blue eye applied to the keyhole gave place to a bright brown one till such time as the persons to whom the eyes belonged were satisfied as to the condition of the interior they were surveying What do you suppose he s doing whispered the taller figure putting his face concealed under a black mask closely to the ear of the other person whose countenance was similarly adorned Don t know whispered the second black mask He acts dreadfully queer but I suppose he s got a novel So you see it s our duty to break it up he added virtuously The taller figure shook his head but as it was very dark on their side of Joel s door the movement was unobserved Well come on whispered the second black mask Are you ready Yes Come then O dear dear grunted Joel I d rather chop wood as I used to years ago to help the little brown house out swinging his arms up over his head Why And he was left in darkness his arms falling nervously to his side while a cautious step across the room made his black eyes stand out in fright A burglar a burglar flashed through his mind He held his breath hard and his knees knocked together But Mamsie s eyes seemed to look with scorn on him again Joel straightened up clenched his fist and every minute expecting to be knocked on the head he crept like a cat to the further corner even in this extremity grumbling inwardly because mister King would not allow firearms If I only had them now he thought Well I must get my club But there was no time to get it Joel creeping along feeling his way cautiously soon knew that there were two burglars instead of one in the room and his mind was made up They ll be after Grandpapa s money sure he thought I have got to get out and warn him But how that was the question Getting down on all fours holding his breath yet with never a thought of danger to himself he crept along toward the door leading into the hall then stopped and rested under cover of the heavy window drapery But as quick as a flash two dark figures that now his eyes becoming more accustomed to the darkness he could dimly distinguish reached there before him and the key clicking in the lock Joel knew that all hope from escape by that quarter was gone Like a cat he sprang to his feet swung the drapery out suddenly toward the figures and in the next second hurled himself over the window sill hanging to the edge grasping the blind crawling to the next window and so on and over and down down by any friendly thing he could grasp to the ground Two black masks hung over the deserted window edge Joe Joe it s only we boys Percy and Van Joe Joe He ll be killed gasped Van his face as white as Joel s robe fluttering below them in his wild descent Stop him Percy Oh do stop him Percy clung to the window sill and danced in distress Stop him he was beyond uttering anything more Yes oh Joe don t you see it s only Percy and Van cried Van persuasively and hanging out of the window to the imminent danger of adding himself to Joel s company Percy shoved him back He s most down he said finding his breath Now we ll run downstairs and let him in Van flew off from the window I ll go it s my scrape and he was unlocking the door I m the oldest said Percy hurrying to get there first I ought to have known better This made Van furious and pushing Percy with all his might he wriggled out first as the door flew open and not forgetting to tiptoe down the hall he hurried along Percy behind him to hear the noise of men s feet coming over the stairs Van tried to rush forward shouting Thomas it s we boys Percy and Van Instead he only succeeded in the darkness in stumbling over a chair and falling flat with it amid a frightful racket that drowned his voice Old mister King who had been awakened by the previous noise and had rung his burglar alarm that connected with Thomas s and Jencks s rooms in the stable now cried out from his doorway Make quick work Thomas and Percy saw the gleam of a pistol held high in Thomas s hand Up with a rush came bare feet over the back stairs a flutter of something white and Joel sprang in between them It s Percy it s Percy he screamed don t you see Thomas I m Percy don t shoot the taller burglar kept saying without intermission while the flaring of candles and frightened voices told of the aroused household Make quick work Jencks shouted mister King from his doorway to add to the general din Thomas whose blood was up determined once for all to put an end to the profession of burglary as far as his master s house was concerned now drew nearer steadying his pistol and trying to sight the nearest fellow This proved to be Van now struggling to his feet Joel took one wild step forward Thomas don t shoot It s Van Make quick work Thomas called mister King There was but a moment in which to decide It was either Van or he and in an instant Joel had stepped in front of the pistol XXIII OF MANY THINGS Van threw his arms around Joel Make quick work Thomas called mister King from his doorway The pistol fell from Thomas s hand I ve shot one of the boys Och murther he screamed And everybody rushing up supposed it was Van who was writhing and screaming unintelligibly in the corner Oh I ve killed him they finally made out Who who Oh Van who Joey screamed Van bending over a white heap on the floor Oh make him get up Oh I ve killed him The mask was hanging by one end from his white face and his eyes protruded wildly Up flew another figure adorned with a second black mask No no it was I and Percy rushed forward with an Oh Joel Joel Somebody lighted the gas that flashed suddenly over the terrified group and somebody else lifted the heap from the corner And as they did so Joel stirred and opened his eyes Don t make such a fuss he said crossly One hand had gripped the sleeve of his night dress trying to hold it up in a little wad on the shoulder the blood pouring down the arm At sight of this Van collapsed and slid to the floor Don t frighten Mamsie said Joel his head drooping despite his efforts to hold it up I m all right nothing but a scratch Ugh let me be will you to mister Whitney and Jasper who were trying to support him And Mother Fisher for the first time since the children had known her lost her self control Oh Joey and mother was cross to you she could only sob as she reached him Polly at a nod from the little doctor s night cap and a few hurried words ran as in a dream for the case of instruments in his bedroom All right Mamsie exclaimed Joel in surprise and trying to stagger to his feet Good heavens and earth cried old mister King approaching What oh it s monstrous Joel Och murther Thomas sidled along the edge of the group rolling fearful eyes at them and repeating over and over I ve shot that boy that boy All this occupied but an instant and Joel was laid on his bed and the wound which proved to be only a flesh one the ball cutting a little furrow as it grazed the shoulder was dressed and everybody drew a long breath Tell Van that I m all right Joel kept saying all the time Polly undertook to do this Van Van she cried running out into the hall to lay a shaking hand on his arm where he lay on the floor Joel sent me to say that he is all right Polly I ve killed him Van thrust his head up suddenly and looked at her with wild eyes I have don t speak to me or look at me I ve killed Joel Take off this dreadful thing said Polly with a shiver and kneeling down she seized the strings that tied the mask O dear it s all in a knot Wait I ll get the scissors and she found her feet and ran off to her room Now you are all right he gave a little sob as the mask tumbled off Oh how could you she wanted to say but Van s distress was too dreadful for anything but comfort Don t you see said Polly sitting down on the floor and cuddling up his head in her lap that Joel is really all right now Suppose we hadn t a Father Fisher who was a doctor what should we do then and she even managed a faint laugh O dear but I ve killed Joel Van covered his face with the folds of her flannel dress and wailed on Now just see here Van Whitney said Polly with the air of authority I tell you that Joel is all right now Don t you say that again not once more Vanny But I have ki I mean I saw Thomas shoot and I couldn t stop him and Van writhed fearfully ending with a scream I ve ki but Polly clapping her hand over his mouth kept the words back Meanwhile Percy had rushed out of the house Oh cried Polly when this new alarm sprang up and everybody was running hither and thither to comfort him by the assurance that Joel was not much hurt do Uncle Mason and Jasper let me go with you No no you stay here Polly cried Jasper throwing wide the heavy front door Brother Mason and I will find him Don t worry Polly I know I could help said Polly hanging over the stair railing Oh do let me she begged No no child said mister Whitney quickly Stay where you are and take care of the others Now then Jasper is Jencks ready with the lantern All right said Jasper Come on Polly longing to fly to the window to watch at least the lantern s twinkling light across the lawn hurried off to comfort Aunt Whitney who at this new stage in the affairs was walking her room biting her lips to keep from screaming the terror that clutched at her heart Oh Polly she cried I m so glad you ve come I should die if left alone here much longer her soft hair floated down the white robe and the blue eyes were filled with tears Do tell me don t you think they will find Percy Yes indeed declared Polly cuddling up to the little woman Oh Auntie remember when Dicky s leg was broken But this is much worse said missus Whitney sobbing and holding close to Polly s warm hand But we thought he was dead and Polly gave a little shiver Don t don t begged missus Whitney clasping her hands Oh Polly don t But he wasn t you see Auntie Polly hurried on and so now you know it will come out all right about Per There Oh they ve found him as a shout from the lawn rang out Do you suppose it Polly cried missus Whitney breathlessly Oh do run to the window and see So Polly ran to the window in the next room that overlooked that part of the lawn where mister Whitney and Jasper were searching and strained her gaze up and down and in every direction Have they oh have they cried missus Whitney Oh Polly do tell me I don t see any of them said Polly listening eagerly for another cry but I do believe they ve found him Do come back implored missus Whitney there now don t go again Polly as Polly hurried to her side but just hold my hand I will said Polly just as tight as I can Auntie Oh oh Percy is so much worse off than Joel wailed missus Whitney Oh to do such a thing Polly she groaned They only meant it in fun said Polly swallowing hard the lump in her throat don t let us talk about it Auntie And Van cried missus Whitney running on Oh my poor poor boys Will your mother ever forgive me Polly Oh Auntie don t talk so said Polly tenderly and we both ought to be out helping There s Van Auntie just think how he feels I can t go near him cried missus Whitney in distress as long as he is in Joel s room for I can see your mother s eyes Polly It would kill me to have her look at me The door opened at this and the trail of a long silken wrapper was heard on the floor missus Chatterton said missus Whitney raising her head and looking at the new comer with as much anger as her gentle face could contain I really cannot see you in my room to night Excuse me but I am unstrung by all that has occurred Will you please not come in I thought I might sit with you said missus Chatterton In the brief interval since the arousing of the household she had contrived to make a perfect breakfast toilet and she folded her hands over her handsome gown Polly might then be with her mother But if you don t wish me to remain I will go I do not need you said missus Whitney decidedly and she turned to Polly again missus Chatterton moved away and closed the door after her Auntie said Polly she really wants to help you Polly you needn t say anything about it exclaimed missus Whitney like many other gentle creatures when roused becoming unreasonably prejudiced I cannot bear the sight of that woman She has been here so long and is so intensely disagreeable to us all Polly s eyes became very round and she held her breath in astonishment Don t look so child said missus Whitney at length you don t understand my dear But you would if you were in my place She s sorry for it said Polly finding her tongue at last And father is nearly worn out with her continued missus Whitney And now to come parading her attentions upon me it Who who Dicky now that the excitement in Joel s room had died down had lost his relish for it and he now pranced into missus Whitney s room Who mamma missus Chatterton said missus Whitney unguardedly She has disagreeably intruded herself upon me Has she been in here asked Dick in astonishment Yes asking if she can sit with me and Polly started at the look in the usually soft blue eyes And you wouldn t let her asked Dick stopping short and regarding his mother curiously Of course not Dicky she made haste to say Then I think you did very wrong declared Dick flatly Oh Dick exclaimed Polly in consternation And you don t act like my mother at all said Dick standing quite stiffly on his sturdy legs and gazing at her with disapprobation Didn t missus Chatterton save my life he exploded when the real burglar was going for me Say didn t she he cried I have yet to find out that is the truth said missus Whitney finding her voice Oh Dicky she added hurt that he should defend another worst of all missus Chatterton don t talk about her But I ought to talk about her persisted Dick She saved me as much as she could Because she won t let anybody thank her I like her more myself I m going to stay with her With that he held his head high and marched to the door Dick Dick called his mother come back dear Dick slowly turned and made his way to her side but he still regarded her with disapproval Dick I want you to go to missus Chatterton s room and say that I am sorry I refused her offer to help and that I would like to have her sit with me Remember say I am sorry I refused her offer to help Dicky She leaned forward and kissed her boy her long soft hair falling like a veil around the two faces Dick threw his arms around her neck Now you re a brick he declared impulsively I ll bring the old lady and we ll both sit with you So Polly was free to run back to Mamsie On the way there she opened the door of Phronsie s little room just out of Father and Mother Fisher s How good it is that she sleeps through it all said Polly listening to the regular breathing Then she stole across the room and stood beside the small bed She looks just as she did the night she took her new shoes to bed thought Polly one hand is over her head exactly as it was then Oh Phronsie to think that you re to have no party to morrow and she turned off with a sigh went out and closed the door Percy s here all right cried Jasper running over the stairs to meet her at the top His eyes were gleaming with excitement and his face was torn and bleeding Are you hurt cried Polly feeling as if the whole family were bound to destruction Oh Jasper did you fall Nothing but a scratch I was fool enough to forget the ledge and walked off for my pains Oh Jasper cried Polly with paling cheeks let me bathe it for you do her strength began to return at the thought of action and she sprang for a basin of water Nonsense No Polly cried Jasper with a quick hand detaining her it s nothing but a mere scratch I tell you but I suppose it looks terribly I ll go and wash it off Run and tell his mother that Percy is found Is he all right asked Polly fearfully holding her breath for the answer Sound as a nut declared Jasper we found him streaking it down the locust path he said he was going to run off to sea Run off to sea repeated Polly Oh Jasper Well he was so frightened of course he didn t know what to say replied Jasper And ashamed too He didn t care to show his head at home I don t know as I blame him Polly Well it s too bad about Phronsie s party isn t it added Jasper mopping up his face as the two went down the hall Yes said Polly with a sigh stopping at missus Whitney s door but oh think how happy we are now that Percy is safe Jasper Still it s too bad for Phronsie repeated Jasper looking back But Joel flatly declared that the first one that even so much as hinted that a single item of the arrangements for Phronsie s getting well party should be changed he d make it disagreeable as only he knew how for that one when he got up from his bed Yes sir and he scolded and fretted and fussed and laid down the law so generally to all not excepting the doctor that at last it was decided to let the party go on Then he lay back against the pillows quite exhausted but with a beatific face I should think you would be tired Joe exclaimed Jasper you ve bullied us so Dear me people ought to be angelic when they re sick at least If you d had him to take care of as I did observed doctor Fisher you d know better goodness me the little brown house scarcely held him when he was getting over the measles What s the use of being sick said Joel reflectively turning on his pillow if you can t make people stand around I d like to know Now that point s settled about Phronsie s party won t you all go out I d like to speak to Father Fisher a moment You don t mean me Joey said Mother Fisher at the head of the bed holding her boy s hand Yes you too Mamsie said Joel giving her an affectionate glance it s something that only the doctor and I are to know You re not hurt anywhere else are you Joey asked his mother a sudden alarm leaping to her black eyes Not a scratch said Joel promptly I want to see Father Fisher about something Sometime you shall know Mamsie He gave her hand a sudden pressure then let it go Perhaps you would better step out my dear said the little doctor nodding to his wife So missus Fisher smothering a sigh went out reluctantly All out asked Joel trying to raise his head to see for himself Every soul said doctor Fisher Well see here will you said Joel pointing to the table the schoolbooks scattered as he had left them pack those things all away in the closet on the shelf you know and put the rubbish on the floor there back on the table doctor Fisher could not for his life refrain from asking curiously as he did as requested Been having a pull at the books eh Joe Um um maybe said Joel twisting uneasily Well now come here please Father Fisher The little man turned away from the table with its sprawling array of delightful things to stand by the bedside You must get me well as soon as you can said Joel confidentially All right I understand doctor Fisher nodded professionally And whatever you say don t let it be that I must be careful of my eyes said Joel All right that is if you get up quickly agreed the doctor That s all said Joel in great satisfaction Now call Mamsie in and the others And in the morning no one told Phronsie what had happened the night before She only knew that Joel was not very well and was going to keep his room all her pleadings to do something for him being set one side by Grandpapa s demands upon her instant attention whenever the idea suggested itself to her And so the time wore along till the party began Alexia was the first to arrive her bowl of orange jelly in her hand and after her a tall slight figure jumped from the carriage her flaxen hair streaming out in two pale braids I thought I d pick Cathie up said Alexia carelessly had to pass her door you know O dear me what perfectly dreadful times you had last night Polly Pepper I didn t bring macaroons said Cathie as I really think that they wouldn t be good for Phronsie Besides I ve forgotten how to make them and our cook was cross and said I shouldn t come into her kitchen But I bought a doll for Phronsie my mother said it would be a great deal more sensible present and she hugged the long box under her arm with great satisfaction O dear dear groaned Alexia falling back with Polly as the three raced along the hall she showed it to me in the carriage and it s a perfect guy besides counting one more But afflictions like this were small to Polly now and although for the next hour it rained dolls into Phronsie s puzzled hands Polly helped her to thank the givers and to dispose them safely on neighboring chairs and tables and sofas missus Chatterton s was the pattern of old mister King s phonograph doll at which discovery he turned upon her with venom in his eye My gift to my little granddaughter taking especial care to emphasize the relationship has always been a doll I suppose you knew that Cousin Eunice and to try to procure one exactly like the one I have purchased is very presuming in you to say the least And why may I not present a doll to Phronsie Pepper if I care to pray tell demanded missus Chatterton in a high cold tone Why because you have always showed a marked dislike for the child cried old mister King angrily that s why Cousin Eunice Grandpapa Grandpapa said Phronsie laying her hand on his arm And to parade any special affection such as the presentation of a gift indicates is a piece of presumption on your part I say it again Cousin Eunice Grandpapa said Phronsie again at his elbow Now Phronsie turning to her you are to take that doll pointing to a gorgeous affair reposing on the sofa with missus Algernon Chatterton s card attached to it and go over to missus Chatterton and say very distinctly I cannot accept this gift mind you say it distinctly Phronsie that there may be no mistake in the future Oh Grandpapa cried Phronsie in dismay Yes child I know what is best for you Take that doll and do exactly as I bid you A dreadful pause fell upon the room Polly clasped her hands while Alexia and the other girls huddled into a corner saying softly Oh how perfectly dreadful No use to say anything to father when he looks like that groaned Jasper when Polly besought him to try his influence his blood is up now he s borne a good deal you know Polly O dear dear whispered Polly back again just look at missus Chatterton s face and at poor Phronsie s can t you do something Jasper I m afraid not said Jasper gloomily No he s making her give it back see Polly You ll know it s for the best mister King was repeating as he led the child to missus Chatterton standing cold and silent at the end of the room sometime child and then you ll thank me that I saved you from further annoyance of this sort There Cousin Eunice is your gift taking the doll from Phronsie s hand and placing it in the long jeweled one My little granddaughter receives presents only from those who love her All others are unwarranted and must be returned Phronsie burst out tearfully She s sorry Grandpapa I know she is and she loves me now Please let me keep the doll But missus Chatterton had left the room the doll in her hand XXIV AWAY And after that everybody had to be as gay as possible to keep Phronsie s sad little face from being flooded with tears Dear me exclaimed Jasper here comes Candace Now what do you suppose she has for you Phronsie Candace sailed through the doorway with ample satisfaction with everything and herself in particular Whar s little Miss she demanded her turban nodding in all directions and her black eyes rolling from side to side There Candace said some one over in the corner with Jasper Oh I see her said Candace waddling over to them Well now Phronsie seein you couldn t come to me for somethin I made xpressly fer you w y Candace has to come to you See dat now chile She unrolled the parcel disclosing the wonderful doll adorned with Candace s own hair and Ole Missus ruffles then stood erect her bosom swelling with pride and delight O my goodness me exclaimed Alexia tumbling back after the first and only glance and nearly overturning Cathie who was looking over her shoulder Polly Pepper O dear me Then she sat down on the floor and laughed till she cried Hush hush cried Polly running over to her do stop Alexia and get up She ll hear you and we wouldn t hurt her feelings for the world Do stop Alexia O dear me cried Alexia gustily and holding her sides while she waved back and forth if it had been a respectable doll but that horror O dear me Stop stop commanded Polly shaking her arm But Alexia was beyond stopping herself And in between Candace s delighted recital how she combed de ha r to take de curl out and how ole Missus ruffles was made into de clothes came the peals of laughter that finally made every one in the room stop and look at the girls Candace come into my den and get a pattern for some new pins I want you to make for me cried Jasper desperately dragging her off It s no use to lecture me said Alexia sitting straight as Candace s feet shuffled down the hall and wiping her face exhaustedly I know it was dreadful O dear me Don t anybody speak to me or I shall disgrace myself again Now Phronsie what do you suppose we are to do next Phronsie looked up into old mister King s face I don t know Grandpapa she said wonderingly Well now my dear you ve had Punch and Judy and these nice children waving his hand to indicate the delegation from the orphan asylum have sung beautifully for you Now what comes next Phronsie I don t know Grandpapa repeated Phronsie When gifts become burdensome they no longer are kindnesses said mister King Now Phronsie I have found out never mind how little birds you now sometimes fly around telling people things they ought to know Well I have discovered in some way that my little girl has too many children to care for Here Phronsie s brown eyes became very wide And when there are too many children in the nest Phronsie why they have to go out into the world to try their fortunes and make other homes Now there are so many poor little girls who haven t any children Phronsie Think of that dear and you have so many Phronsie at this drew nearer and stole her hand into his Now what is to be done about it asked the old gentleman putting his other broad palm over her little one and holding it fast Hey my pet Can t we buy them some children asked Phronsie with warm interest Oh Grandpapa dear do let us I have money in my bank Phronsie said the old gentleman going to the heart of the matter at once and lifting her to his lap I really think the time has come to give away some of your dolls I really do child Phronsie gave a start of incredulity and peered around at him I really do You are going abroad to be gone well we ll say a year And your dolls would be so lonely without anything to do but to sit all day and think of their little mother And there are so many children who would love them and make them happy Now mister King s white hair was very near the yellow waves floating over his shoulder so that none but Phronsie s ears caught the next words It s right Phronsie dear I d do it if I were you he said in a low voice Do you want it Grandpapa asked Phronsie softly I do child but not unless you are willing Then I do declared Phronsie sitting quite straight on his knee And she gave a relieved sigh Oh Grandpapa if we only had the poor children now she exclaimed dreadfully excited Come then Old mister King set her on her feet Clear the way there good people we are going to find some poor children who are waiting for dolls and he threw wide the door into a back passage and there presided over by Jencks and crowding for the first entrance was a score of children with outstretched hands Oh oh exclaimed Phronsie with cheeks aflame Please he said we was to have dolls cried one hungry eyed girl holding out both her hands I ve never had one Please give me one quick Never had one echoed Phronsie taking a step toward her Only a piece Miss I found in a rag barrel Please give me one quick She s never had a doll only a piece repeated Phronsie turning back to the family unable to contain this information Ask the others if they have had any said mister King leaning against a tall cabinet Try that girl there in a brown plaid dress Have you ever had a doll asked Phronsie obediently looking over at the girl indicated and holding her breath for the answer At this the girl in the brown plaid dress burst into tears which so distressed Phronsie that she nearly cried Yes but it died said the girl after a little Oh Grandpapa her doll died exclaimed Phronsie in horror No it didn t Jane corrected another girl the dog et it you know he did Yes I know said Jane between small sobs it died and we couldn t have any fun ral cause the dog had et it Well now Phronsie exclaimed mister King getting away from the support of the cabinet I think it s time that we should make some of these children happy Don t you want to take them up to the playroom and distribute the dolls No no protested Phronsie suddenly I must go up and tell my children They will understand it better then Grandpapa I ll be back in a very few minutes and going out she went quickly upstairs and after a while returned with both arms full This doll is for you she said gravely putting a doll attired in a wonderful pink satin costume into Jane s arms I ve told her about your dog and she s a little frightened so please be careful What s the fun down there now asked Joel of Van who with Percy could not be persuaded to leave his bedside a moment open the door do and let s hear it So Van threw wide the door Go out and listen Percy will you he said I don t want to said Percy who shared Van s wish to keep in the background You two fellows act like muffs said Joel Now if you want me to get well go out do and tell me what the fun is going on down there So persuaded the two boys stole out into the hall in time to see Phronsie go down the stairs with her armful and carefully using their ears they soon rushed back with Phronsie s giving away her dolls Stuff and nonsense exclaimed Joel if you can t bring back anything better than that yarn you might as well stay here But I tell you it s true declared Van isn t it Percy Yes it is said Percy I heard her distinctly say This doll is for you and she had her arms full so I suppose she s going to give those away too A likely story said Joel bursting into a laugh At the noise up in the boys room Mother Fisher ran quickly over the stairs Oh boys what is it Joel are you worse No indeed said Joel I was laughing Percy and Van have been telling such a big story Mamsie they actually said that Phronsie was giving away her dolls Is that all cried missus Fisher in relief Well so she is Joel PHRONSIE GIVING AWAY HER DOLLS MAMSIE screamed Joel Why what does Grandpapa say He s the very one that proposed it said missus Fisher There Joey don t get excited for I don t know what the doctor will say as Joel sank back on his pillow overcome by this last piece of news When Phronsie went to bed that night she clasped mister King s new gift to her breast Grandpapa dear she said confidingly as they went up the stairs together do you know I really think more of this doll now that the others are gone Really I do Grandpapa and I can take better care of her because I shall have more time So you will dear assented mister King Well Phronsie I think you and I dear haven t made a bad day s work I think my children will be happy said Phronsie with a small sigh because you see it s so nice to make good times for their new mothers And Grandpapa I couldn t play with each one more than once a week I used to try to but I couldn t Grandpapa Why didn t you tell me Phronsie asked the old gentleman a bit reproachfully as they reached the top step how it was dear You should have given them away long ago Ah but said Phronsie slowly shaking her head I didn t want to give them away before only just now Grandpapa and I think they will be happy And now I m going to take this newest one to bed just as I used to take things to bed years ago when I was a little girl And after all there was an extension of time for the three boys vacation doctor Marks not getting up from his sudden attack of fever as quickly as was expected But there came a day at last when Percy Van and David bade Joel good by It won t be for long observed that individual cheerfully you ll be back in three weeks O dear groaned Percy when safe within the coach we ve ruined all his chances He certainly will be plucked now with those three weeks to make up Van gathered himself up and leaned forward in his corner Don t look so Dave he cried desperately David tried to smooth the troubled lines out of his face but only succeeded in making it look worse than before And it will kill missus Fisher Percy continued gloomily if he does get plucked as of course he will Keep still will you cried Van his irritation getting beyond bounds What s the use of talking about a thing till it s done which had the effect to make Percy remember his promise to Polly and close his mouth But Joel s wound healed quicker than any one supposed it possibly could and Percy and Van who both hated to write letters gave up much time on the playground to indite daily bulletins so that he declared that it was almost as good as being there on the spot And Mother Fisher and her army of servants cleaned the great stone house from top to bottom and sorted and packed away and made things tidy for the new housekeeper who was to care for them in her absence till doctor Fisher raised his eyebrows and hands in astonishment I really must he said one day put in a remonstrance wife or you ll kill yourself before we start Oh I m used to working missus Fisher would say cheerily and then off she would fly to something so much worse that the little doctor was speechless And Polly set herself at all her studies especially French with redoubled vigor notwithstanding that she was hampered with the faithful attentions of the schoolgirls who fought among themselves for her company and showered her with pathetic O dear me ow I shall miss you and with tears when they got over it And Jasper buried himself in his den only bursting forth at meal times and missus Whitney bemoaned all preparations for the travelers departure and wished a thousand times that she had not given her promise to keep the house and look after the boys And everybody who had the slightest claim to a calling acquaintance now dropped in upon the Kings and Polly had her good by party and it was pronounced perfectly elegant by Alexia and her set and the three boys came home for the long vacation and in two days the party would sail Who do you think is going abroad with us asked mister King suddenly as they all sat in the library for a last evening talk guess quickly Who cried several voices Why I thought you didn t want any outsiders father exclaimed Jasper in surprise Well and I didn t when I said so but circumstances are changed now come guess quickly some one The Cabots said Jasper at a venture No no guess again mister Alstyne No again The Bayleys the Dyces the Herrings shouted mister Whitney and Van and Joel No I know broke in Percy it s missus Chatterton with a quick glance to make sure that she was not in the room NO thundered mister King Oh how stupid people can be when they want to Two persons are to meet us in New York to morrow I didn t tell you till I was sure I had no desire that you should be disappointed Now guess again Auntie do you know asked Polly suddenly leaning back as she sat on the rug in front of the fire to lay her head in missus Whitney s lap No I m sure I don t said missus Whitney stroking lightly the brown hair with a pang to think how long it would be before she should caress it again How any one can desire to cross the ocean remarked mister Whitney folding his hands back of his head and regarding meditatively the glowing fire is more than I can see That I never shall do it again unless whipped over I m morally certain Are the persons men asked Ben suddenly One is replied mister King And the other is a woman The other is a woman said mister King Well what are their names Isn t anybody smart enough to guess them Dear me I ve always said that the Peppers were remarkably bright and the rest of you children are not behind other young people Go on try again Now who are they Polly took her head out of missus Whitney s lap and rested her chin in her hands Davie walked up and down the room while Ben and the two Whitney boys hung over Mother Fisher s chair Dear me fumed Joel Who ever could guess There s such a lot or people in the world that Grandpapa knows It might be any two of them that he had asked Little doctor Fisher s eyes roved from one to the other of the group I couldn t begin to guess because I don t know many of your friends he said quietly You know these two people very well said mister King laughing to see the little man s face Now I think I know said Jasper slowly a light coming into his gray eyes but I don t suppose it s fair to guess for I saw the address on a letter father was writing two or three weeks ago You did you young scamp you cried mister King turning on him Well then tisn t a guess for you Jasper Keep still my boy and let them work away at it Will no one guess Mamsie cried Polly bounding up from the ring nearly upsetting Phronsie who was sitting beside her in a brown study can it be do you suppose it is nice dear mister and missus Henderson Well Polly said mister King beaming at her you ve done what the others couldn t Yes it is mister and missus Henderson and they are going with us to stay until the autumn Good good cried every one till the big room seemed full of joy Oh father exclaimed missus Whitney I m so glad you ve done this They were so kind to Dicky and to me when he was hurt They were kind to Dicky and to you said her father and besides Marian mister Henderson is a man who doesn t preach at you only once a week and missus Henderson is a fine woman So it s a pity not to ease up things for them now and then Well how do you like the plan He spoke to doctor Fisher but his gaze took them all in Immensely said the little doctor which being again echoed heartily by all the rest old mister King began to feel very much elated at his part in the proceedings and in a quarter of an hour it seemed as if the expedition had been especially planned for the benefit of the Hendersons so naturally had it all come about And on the morrow the whole family Kings Whitneys Fishers and Peppers turned their backs on the gray stone mansion and went down to the city And Alexia Rhys persuaded her aunt to do her semi annual shopping at this time and to take her too and mister Alstyne also had business that necessitated his going and mister Cabot and Mary Taylor and her father found they must go along too and Hamilton Dyce was there and Pickering Dodge of course went to be company for Ben on the way back And at the last moment who should jump on the train but Livingston Bayley Had a telegram he explained must be there at noon So glad of the unexpected pleasure of meeting you all And Cousin Eunice Chatterton went for at the last minute she had suddenly discovered that she had visited at the gray stone mansion as long as she cared to and notified the family accordingly And mister King had so far made up for his part in the late unpleasantness as to ask her to go with the party on her way to her nephew s in the city So there she was with the others bidding them good by on the steamer Phronsie she said slowly under cover of the babel of tongues you are a good child and I ve done well by you This little bit of paper putting it into her hands contains a message to mister King which you are to give him after you have started I will go and give it to him now said Phronsie her fingers closing over the bit No no said missus Chatterton sharply do as I say Remember on no account to let any one see it till after you have started You are a good child Phronsie Now remember to do as you are bidden And now will you kiss me child Phronsie lifted her eyes and fixed them on the long white face and suddenly raising herself on her tiptoes she put up her lips Look at Phron cried Joel in the midst of the group actually kissing missus Chatterton and everybody turned and stared Cousin Eunice dropped her veil with a quick hand and moved off with a stately step but not in time to lose young Bayley s drawl Pon me word it s the most extraordinary thing Phronsie come here and tell us what twas like But Phronsie stood quite still as if she had not heard Yes I hope you ll have a nice time Pickering Dodge was saying for the dozenth time with eyes for no one but Polly now don t stay away for a year Polly with her heart full of the boys who were hanging on either side answered at random Oh Ben I can t go she was exclaiming and she hid her head on his shoulder so Pickering turned off But Joel set his teeth together You must he said for Ben was beyond speech with the effort to control himself I can t said poor Polly leave you Ben and the boys And then missus Whitney came up just as Polly was near breaking down My dear child she said taking Polly s hands you know it is right for you to go Yes I know said Polly fighting her tears Then Polly be brave dear and don t begrudge me my three new boys she added playfully Just think how happy I m to be with six such splendid fellows to call my own Polly smiled through her tears And one thing more said missus Whitney in a low voice when you feel badly looking steadily at Polly and the three boys remember what doctor Fisher said that if your mother didn t stop working and rest she would break down I ll remember said Ben hoarsely So will I said David And I will said Joel looking everywhere but into Polly s eyes Well I hope Miss Polly said young mister Bayley sauntering up that you ll have an uncommonly nice time I do indeed I may run across in September if I do we shall probably meet Miss Mary Pepper suddenly asked a man with a huge basket of flowers and pausing in front of her Young mister Bayley smiled indulgently as he could not help reading the card thrust into the flowers She will receive my flowers at intervals all the way over if the steward doesn t fail me he reflected with satisfaction while this boy s will fade in an hour Miss Mary Pepper the florist s messenger repeated extending the basket to Polly It s for you Miss Polly said young mister Bayley Let me relieve you taking the basket Oh are they for me cried Polly I believe you are Miss Mary Pepper said young Bayley Pretty aren t they fingering the roses and glad to think that there were orchids among the flowers to which his card was attached and just placed under the steward s care I suppose I am said Polly with a little laugh but it seems as if I couldn t be anything but Polly Pepper Oh thank you Pickering for these lovely roses catching sight of him Glad you like them said Pickering radiantly Say Polly don t stay away a whole year will you Young mister Bayley set the basket in his hand and turned on his heel with a smile Come Polly I want you cried Alexia trying to draw her off You know she s my very best friend Pickering and I haven t had a chance to say one word to her this morning Come Polly Polly come here called missus Fisher O dear cried Alexia impatiently now that s just the way it always is It s Polly here and Polly there as Polly deserted her and ran off with her basket of roses You don t do any of the calling of course said Pickering with a laugh Well I ll have her to myself declared Alexia savagely before it s time for us to get off the steamer see if I don t I don t believe it said Pickering Look at her now in a maelstrom of relatives You and I Alexia are left out And the next thing Alexia knew somebody unceremoniously helped her from the steamer with a Beg pardon Miss but you must get off and she was standing on the wharf in a crowd of people looking in a dazed way at Polly Pepper s fluttering handkerchief while fast increasing little ripples of greenish water lay between them And Phronsie was running up to mister King Here Grandpapa missus Chatterton wanted me to give you this unclasping her warm little palm where the bit of white paper lay The Dickens she did exclaimed the old gentleman so she has had a last word with you has she Well she won t get another for a long spell so never mind Now let s see what Cousin Eunice says Something interesting no doubt He spread the crumpled bit straight and read Phronsie standing quite still by his side COUSIN HORATIO I have made Phronsie Pepper my sole heir You may like it or not as you please The thing is done and may God bless Phronsie EUNICE CHATTERTON End of Project Gutenberg s Five Little Peppers
