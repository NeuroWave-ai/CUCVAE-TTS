273-123248-0000	train-other-500	The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
273-123248-0001	train-other-500	and to assume among the Powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature s God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
273-123248-0002	train-other-500	requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
273-123248-0003	train-other-500	that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men
273-123248-0004	train-other-500	deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government
273-123248-0005	train-other-500	laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness Prudence indeed will dictate
273-123248-0006	train-other-500	that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable
273-123248-0007	train-other-500	than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism
273-123248-0008	train-other-500	it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies and such is now the necessity
273-123248-0009	train-other-500	which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object
273-123248-0010	train-other-500	the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world He has refused his Assent to Laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good
none	none	 He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation 
273-123248-0011	train-other-500	till his Assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people
273-123248-0012	train-other-500	unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual
273-123248-0013	train-other-500	uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their Public Records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly
273-123248-0014	train-other-500	for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected
none	none	 whereby the Legislative Powers incapable of Annihilation 
273-123248-0015	train-other-500	have returned to the People at large for their exercise the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within
273-123248-0016	train-other-500	He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States
none	none	 for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners 
273-123248-0017	train-other-500	refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands
273-123248-0018	train-other-500	He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers He has made judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices
273-123248-0019	train-other-500	and the amount and payment of their salaries He has erected a multitude of New Offices and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our People and eat out their substance
273-123248-0020	train-other-500	He has kept among us in times of peace Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures
none	none	 He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power 
273-123248-0021	train-other-500	He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation
273-123248-0022	train-other-500	For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us For protecting them by a mock Trial from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States
273-123248-0023	train-other-500	For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world For imposing taxes on us without our Consent For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury
273-123248-0024	train-other-500	For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province establishing therein an Arbitrary government
none	none	 and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters abolishing our most valuable Laws 
273-123248-0025	train-other-500	and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments For suspending our own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever He has abdicated Government here
273-123248-0026	train-other-500	by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us He has plundered our seas ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people He is at this time
none	none	 transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of Cruelty perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation 
273-123248-0028	train-other-500	He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren or to fall themselves by their Hands
273-123248-0029	train-other-500	He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian Savages
none	none	 whose known rule of warfare 
273-123248-0030	train-other-500	is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms
273-123248-0031	train-other-500	Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free People
273-123248-0032	train-other-500	Nor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us
273-123248-0033	train-other-500	We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations
none	none	 which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice 
273-123248-0034	train-other-500	and of consanguinity We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our Separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies in War in Peace Friends
none	none	 We therefore the Representatives of the United States of America 
273-123248-0035	train-other-500	in General Congress Assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the Name and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies solemnly publish and declare
273-123248-0036	train-other-500	That these United Colonies are and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown
273-123248-0037	train-other-500	and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved
none	none	 and that as Free and Independent States they have full Power to levy War conclude Peace contract Alliances establish Commerce and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do And for the support of this Declaration with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred Honor End of
