Shakespeare Hurricane Hall is a large old family mansion built of dark red sandstone in one of the loneliest and wildest of the mountain regions of Virginia The estate is surrounded on three sides by a range of steep gray rocks spiked with clumps of dark evergreens and called from its horseshoe form the Devil s Hoof On the fourth side the ground gradually descends in broken rock and barren soil to the edge of the wild mountain stream known as the Devil s Run When storms and floods were high the loud roaring of the wind through the wild mountain gorges and the terrific raging of the torrent over its rocky course gave to this savage locality its ill omened names of Devil s Hoof Devil s Run and Hurricane Hall Major Ira Warfield the lonely proprietor of the Hall was a veteran officer who in disgust at what he supposed to be ill requited services had retired from public life to spend the evening of his vigorous age on this his patrimonial estate Here he lived in seclusion with his old fashioned housekeeper missus Condiment and his old family servants and his favorite dogs and horses Here his mornings were usually spent in the chase in which he excelled and his afternoons and evenings were occupied in small convivial suppers among his few chosen companions of the chase or the bottle In person Major Warfield was tall and strongly built reminding one of some old iron limbed Douglas of the olden time His features were large and harsh his complexion dark red as that of one bronzed by long exposure and flushed with strong drink His fierce dark gray eyes were surmounted by thick heavy black brows that when gathered into a frown reminded one of a thunder cloud as the flashing orbs beneath them did of lightning His hard harsh face was surrounded by a thick growth of iron gray hair and beard that met beneath his chin His usual habit was a black cloth coat crimson vest black leather breeches long black yarn stockings fastened at the knees and morocco slippers with silver buttons In character Major Warfield was arrogant domineering and violent equally loved and feared by his faithful old family servants at home disliked and dreaded by his neighbors and acquaintances abroad who partly from his house and partly from his character fixed upon him the appropriate nickname of Old Hurricane There was however other ground of dislike besides that of his arrogant mind violent temper and domineering habits Old Hurricane was said to be an old bachelor yet rumor whispered that there was in some obscure part of the world hidden away from human sight a deserted wife and child poor forlorn and heart broken It was further whispered that the elder brother of Ira Warfield had mysteriously disappeared and not without some suspicion of foul play on the part of the only person in the world who had a strong interest in his taking off However these things might be it was known for a certainty that Old Hurricane had an only sister widowed sick and poor who with her son dragged on a wretched life of ill requited toil severe privation and painful infirmity in a distant city unaided unsought and uncared for by her cruel brother It was the night of the last day of October eighteen hundred and forty five The evening had closed in very dark and gloomy About dusk the wind arose in the northwest driving up masses of leaden hued clouds and in a few minutes the ground was covered deep with snow and the air was filled with driving sleet As this was All Hallow Eve the dreadful inclemency of the weather did not prevent the negroes of Hurricane Hall from availing themselves of their capricious old master s permission and going off in a body to a banjo breakdown held in the negro quarters of their next neighbor Upon this evening then there was left at Hurricane Hall only Major Warfield missus Condiment his little housekeeper and Wool his body servant Early in the evening the old hall was shut up closely to keep out as much as possible the sound of the storm that roared through the mountain chasms and cannonaded the walls of the house as if determined to force an entrance As soon as she had seen that all was safe missus Condiment went to bed and went to sleep It was about ten o clock that night that Old Hurricane well wrapped up in his quilted flannel dressing gown sat in his well padded easy chair before a warm and bright fire taking his comfort in his own most comfortable bedroom This was the hour of the coziest enjoyment to the self indulgent old Sybarite who dearly loved his own ease And indeed every means and appliance of bodily comfort was at hand Strong oaken shutters and thick heavy curtains at the windows kept out every draft of air and so deadened the sound of the wind that its subdued moaning was just sufficient to remind one of the stormy weather without in contrast to the bright warmth within Old Hurricane as I said sat well wrapped up in his wadded dressing gown and reclining in his padded easy chair with his head thrown back and his feet upon the fire irons toasting his shins and sipping his punch On his right stood a little table with a lighted candle a stack of clay pipes a jug of punch lemons sugar Holland gin et cetera while on the hearth sat a kettle of boiling water to help replenish the jug if needful On his left hand stood his cozy bedstead with its warm crimson curtains festooned back revealing the luxurious swell of the full feather bed and pillows with their snow white linen and lamb s wool blankets inviting repose Between this bedstead and the corner of the fireplace stood Old Hurricane s ancient body servant Wool engaged in warming a crimson cloth nightcap Fools muttered Old Hurricane over his punch jacks they ll all get the pleurisy except those that get drunk Did they all go Wool Ebery man oman and chile sar cept tis me and coachman sar More fools they And I shouldn t wonder if you you old scarecrow didn t want to go too No Marse I know better sir Don t contradict me Well as soon as I m in bed and that won t be long now you may go so that you get back in time to wait on me to morrow morning Thanky marse Hold your tongue You re as big a fool as the rest I take this said Old Hurricane as he sipped his punch and smacked his lips I take this to be the very quintessence of human enjoyment sitting here in my soft warm chair before the fire toasting my legs sipping my punch listening on the one hand to the storm without and glancing on the other hand at my comfortable bed waiting there to receive my sleepy head If there is anything better than this in this world I wish somebody would let me know it It s all werry comformable indeed marse said the obsequious Wool I wonder now if there is anything on the face of the earth that would tempt me to leave my cozy fireside and go abroad to night I wonder how large a promise of pleasure or profit or glory it would take now Much as ebber Congress itse f could give if it give you a penance for all your sarvins suggested Wool Yes and more for I wouldn t leave my home comforts to night to insure not only the pension but the thanks of Congress said the old man replenishing his glass with steaming punch and drinking it off leisurely The clock struck eleven The old man again replenished his glass and while sipping its contents said You may fill the warming pan and warm my bed Wool The fumes of this fragrant punch are beginning to rise to my head and make me sleepy The servant filled the warming pan with glowing embers shut down the lid and thrust it between the sheets to warm the couch of this luxurious Old Hurricane The old man continued to toast his feet sip his punch and smack his lips He finished his glass set it down and was just in the act of drawing on his woolen nightcap preparatory to stepping into his well warmed bed when he was suddenly startled by a loud ringing of the hall door bell What the foul fiend can that mean at this time of night exclaimed Old Hurricane dropping his nightcap and turning sharply around toward Wool who warming pan in hand stood staring with astonishment What does that mean I ask you Deed I dunno sar less it s some benighted traveler in search o shelter outen de storm Humph and in search of supper too of course and everybody gone away or gone to bed but you and me At this moment the ringing was followed by a loud knocking Marse don t less you and me listen to it and then we ain t bliged to sturb ourselves with answering of it suggested Wool Sdeath sir Do you think that I am going to turn a deaf ear to a stranger that comes to my house for shelter on such a night as this Go and answer the bell directly Yes sar But stop look here sirrah mind I am not to be disturbed If it is a traveler ask him in set refreshments before him and show him to bed I m not going to leave my warm room to welcome anybody to night please the Lord Do you hear Yes sar said the darkey retreating As Wool took a shaded taper and opened the door leading from his master s chamber the wind was heard howling through the long passages ready to burst into the cozy bedroom Shut that door you scoundrel roared the old man folding the skirt of his warm dressing gown across his knees and hovering closer to the fire Wool quickly obeyed and was heard retreating down the steps Whew said the old man spreading his hands over the blaze with a look of comfortable appreciation What would induce me to go abroad on such a night as this Wind blowing great guns from the northwest snow falling fast from the heavens and rising just as fast before the wind from the ground cold as Lapland dark as Erebus No telling the earth from the sky Whew and to comfort the cold thought Old Hurricane poured out another glass of smoking punch and began to sip it How I thank the Lord that I am not a doctor If I were a doctor now the sound of that bell at this hour of night would frighten me I should think some old woman had been taken with the pleurisy and wanted me to get up and go out in the storm to turn out of my warm bed to ride ten miles through the snow to prescribe for her A doctor never can feel sure even in the worst of weathers of a good night s rest But thank Heaven I am free from all such annoyances and if I am sure of anything in this world it is of my comfortable night s sleep said Old Hurricane as he sipped his punch smacked his lips and toasted his feet At this moment Wool reappeared Shut the door you villain Do you intend to stand there holding it open on me all night vociferated the old man Wool hastily closed the offending portals and hurried to his master s side Well sir who was it rung the bell Please marster sir it wer de Reverend mister Parson Goodwin Goodwin Been to make a sick call I suppose and got caught in the snow storm I declare it is as bad to be a parson as it is to be a doctor Thank the Lord I am not a parson either if I were now I might be called away from my cozy armchair and fireside to ride twelve miles to comfort some old man dying of quinsy Well here help me into bed pile on more comforters tuck me up warm put a bottle of hot water at my feet and then go and attend to the parson said the old man getting up and moving toward his inviting couch Sar sar stop sar if you please cried Wool going after him Why what does the old fool mean exclaimed Old Hurricane angrily Sar de Reverend mister Parson Goodwin say how he must see you yourself personable alone See me you villain Didn t you tell him that I had retired Yes marse I tell him how you wer gone to bed and asleep more n an hour ago and he ordered me to come wake you up and say how it were a matter o life and death Life and death What have I to do with life and death I won t stir If the parson wants to see me he will have to come up here and see me in bed exclaimed Old Hurricane suiting the action to the word by jumping into bed and drawing all the comforters and blankets up around his head and shoulders Mus I fetch him reverence up sar Yes I wouldn t get up and go down to see Washington Shut the door you rascal or I ll throw the bootjack at your wooden head Wool obeyed with alacrity and in time to escape the threatened missile After an absence of a few minutes he was heard returning attending upon the footsteps of another And the next minute he entered ushering in the reverend mister Goodwin the parish minister of Bethlehem saint Mary s How do you do How do you do Glad to see you sir glad to see you though obliged to receive you in bed Fact is I caught a cold with this severe change of weather and took a warm negus and went to bed to sweat it off You ll excuse me Wool draw that easy chair up to my bedside for worthy mister Goodwin and bring him a glass of warm negus It will do him good after his cold ride I thank you Major Warfield I will take the seat but not the negus if you please to night Not the negus Oh come now you are joking Why it will keep you from catching cold and be a most comfortable nightcap disposing you to sleep and sweat like a baby Of course you spend the night with us I thank you no I must take the road again in a few minutes Take the road again to night Why man alive it is midnight and the snow driving like all Lapland Sir I am sorry to refuse your proffered hospitality and leave your comfortable roof to night and sorrier still to have to take you with me said the pastor gravely Take me with you No no my good sir no no that is too good a joke ha ha Sir I fear that you will find it a very serious one Your servant told you that my errand was one of imminent urgency Yes something like life and death Exactly down in the cabin near the Punch Bowl there is an old woman dying There I knew it I was just saying there might be an old woman dying But my dear sir what s that to me What can I do Humanity sir would prompt you But my dear sir how can I help her I am not a physician to prescribe She is far past a physician s help Nor am I a priest to hear her confession Her confession God has already received Well and I m not a lawyer to draw up her will No sir but you are recently appointed one of the justices of the peace for Alleghany Yes Well what of that That does not comprise the duty of getting up out of my warm bed and going through a snow storm to see an old woman expire I regret to inconvenience you sir but in this instance your duty demands your attendance at the bedside of this dying woman I tell you I can t go and I won t Anything in reason I ll do Anything I can send she shall have Here Wool look in my breeches pocket and take out my purse and hand it And then go and wake up missus Condiment and ask her to fill a large basket full of everything a poor old dying woman might want and you shall carry it Spare your pains sir The poor woman is already past all earthly selfish wants She only asks your presence at her dying bed But I can t go I The idea of turning out of my warm bed and exposing myself to a snow storm this time of night Excuse me for insisting sir but this is an official duty said the parson mildly but firmly I ll I ll throw up my commission to morrow growled the old man To morrow you may do that but meanwhile to night being still in the commission of the peace you are bound to get up and go with me to this woman s bedside And what the demon is wanted of me there To receive her dying deposition To receive a dying deposition Good Heaven was she murdered then exclaimed the old man in alarm as he started out of bed and began to draw on his nether garments Be composed she was not murdered said the pastor Well then what is it Dying deposition It must concern a crime exclaimed the old man hastily drawing on his coat It does concern a crime What crime for the love of Heaven I am not at liberty to tell you She will do that Wool go down and rouse up Jehu and tell him to put Parson Goodwin s mule in the stable for the night And tell him to put the black draught horses to the close carriage and light both of the front lanterns for we shall have a dark stormy road Shut the door you infernal I beg your pardon parson but that villain always leaves the door ajar after him The good pastor bowed gravely and the major completed his toilet by the time the servant returned and reported the carriage ready It was dark as pitch when they emerged from the hall door out into the front portico before which nothing could be seen but two red bull s eyes of the carriage lanterns and nothing heard but the dissatisfied whinnying and pawing of the horses CHAPTER II THE MASKS What are these So withered and so wild in their attire That look not like th inhabitants of earth And yet are on t Macbeth To the Devil s Punch Bowl was the order given by Old Hurricane as he followed the minister into the carriage And now sir he continued addressing his companion I think you had better repeat that part of the church litany that prays to be delivered from battle murder and sudden death for if we should be so lucky as to escape

none	none	and his gang we shall have at least an equal chance of being upset in the darkness of these dreadful mountains A pair of saddle mules would have been a safer conveyance certainly said the minister Old Hurricane knew that but though a great sensualist he was a brave man and so he had rather risk his life in a close carriage than suffer cold upon a sure footed mule s back Only by previous knowledge of the route could any one have told the way the carriage went Old Hurricane and the minister both knew that they drove lumbering over the rough road leading by serpentine windings down that rugged fall of ground to the river s bank and that then turning to the left by a short bend they passed in behind that range of horseshoe rocks that sheltered Hurricane Hall thus as it were doubling their own road Beneath that range of rocks and between it and another range there was an awful abyss or chasm of cleft torn and jagged rocks opening as it were from the bowels of the earth in the shape of a mammoth bowl in the bottom of which almost invisible from its great depth seethed and boiled a mass of dark water of what seemed to be a lost river or a subterranean spring This terrific phenomenon was called the Devil s Punch Bowl Not far from the brink of this awful abyss and close behind the horseshoe range of rocks stood a humble log cabin occupied by an old free negress who picked up a scanty living by telling fortunes and showing the way to the Punch Bowl Her cabin went by the name of the Witch s Hut or Old Hat s Cabin A short distance from Hat s cabin the road became impassable and the travelers got out and preceded by the coachman bearing the lantern struggled along on foot through the drifted snow and against the buffeting wind and sleet to where a faint light guided them to the house The pastor knocked The door was immediately opened by a negro whose sex from the strange anomalous costume it was difficult to guess The tall form was rigged out first in a long red cloth petticoat above which was buttoned a blue cloth surtout A man s old black beaver hat sat upon the strange head and completed this odd attire Well Hat how is your patient inquired the pastor as he entered preceding the magistrate You will see sir replied the old woman The two visitors looked around the dimly lighted miserable room in one corner of which stood a low bed upon which lay extended the form of an old feeble and gray haired woman How are you my poor soul and what can I do for you now I am here inquired Old Hurricane who in the actual presence of suffering was not utterly without pity You are a magistrate inquired the dying woman Yes my poor soul And qualified to administer an oath and take your deposition said the minister Will it be legal will it be evidence in a court of law asked the woman lifting her dim eyes to the major Certainly my poor soul certainly said the latter who by the way would have said anything to soothe her Send every one but yourself from the room What my good soul send the parson out in the storm That will never do Won t it be just as well to let him go up in the corner yonder No You will repent it unless this communication is strictly private But my good soul if it is to be used in a court of law That will be according to your own discretion My dear parson said Old Hurricane going to the minister would you be so good as to retire There is a fire in the woodshed master said Hat leading the way Now my good soul now You want first to be put upon your oath Yes sir The old man drew from his great coat pocket a miniature copy of the Scriptures and with the usual formalities administered the oath Now then my good soul begin the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth you know But first your name Is it possible you don t know me master Not I in faith For the love of heaven look at me and try to recollect me sir It is necessary some one in authority should be able to know me said the woman raising her haggard eyes to the face of her visitor The old man adjusted his spectacles and gave her a scrutinizing look exclaiming at intervals Lord bless my soul it is it ain t it must it can t be Granny Grewell the the the midwife that disappeared from here some twelve or thirteen years ago Yes master I am Nancy Grewell the ladies nurse who vanished from sight so mysteriously some thirteen years ago replied the woman Heaven help our hearts And for what crime was it you ran away Come make a clean breast of it woman You have nothing to fear in doing so for you are past the arm of earthly law now I know it master And the best way to prepare to meet the Divine Judge is to make all the reparation that you can by a full confession I know it sir if I had committed a crime but I have committed no crime neither did I run away What what what What was it then Remember witness you are on your oath I know that sir and I will tell the truth but it must be in my own way At this moment a violent blast of wind and hail roared down the mountain side and rattled against the walls shaking the witch s hut as if it would have shaken it about their ears It was a proper overture to the tale that was about to be told Conversation was impossible until the storm raved past and was heard dying in deep reverberating echoes from the depths of the Devil s Punch Bowl It is some thirteen years ago began Granny Grewell upon just such a night of storm as this that I was mounted on my old mule Molly with my saddlebags full of dried yarbs and stilled waters and sich as I allus carried when I was out tendin on the sick I was on my way a going to see a lady as I was sent for to tend Well master I m not shamed to say as I never was afraid of man beast nor sperrit and never stopped at going out all hours of the night through the most lonesome roads if so be I was called upon to do so Still I must say that jest as me and Molly my mule got into that deep thick lonesome woods as stands round the old Hidden House in the hollow I did feel queerish case it was the dead hour of the night and it was said how strange things were seen and hearn yes and done too in that dark deep lonesome place I seen how even my mule Molly felt queer too by the way she stuck up her ears stiff as quills So partly to keep up my own spirits and partly to courage her says I Molly says I what are ye afeared on Be a man Molly But Molly stepped out cautious and pricked up her long ears all the same Well master it was so dark I couldn t see a yard past Molly s ears and the path was so narrow and the bushes so thick we could hardly get along and just as we came to the little creek as they calls the Spout cause the water jumps and jets along it till it empties into the Punch Bowl and just as Molly was cautiously putting her fore foot into the water out starts two men from the bushes and seized poor Molly s bridle Good Heaven exclaimed Major Warfield Well master before I could cry out one of them willains seized me by the scruff of my neck and with his other hand upon my mouth he says Be silent you old fool or I ll blow your brains out And then master I saw for the first time that their faces were covered over with black crape I couldn t a screamed if they d let me for my breath was gone and my senses were going along with it from the fear that was on me Don t struggle come along quietly and you shall not be hurt says the man as had spoke before Struggle I couldn t a struggled to a saved my soul I couldn t speak I couldn t breathe I liked to have a dropped right offen Molly s back One on em says says he Give her some brandy And t other takes out a flask and puts it to my lips and says says he Here drink this Well master as he had me still by the scruff o my neck I couldn t do no other ways but open my mouth and drink it And as soon as I took a swallow my breath came back and my speech And oh gentlemen says I ef it s your money or your life you mean I hain t it about me Deed clare to the Lord a mighty I hain t It s wrapped up in an old cotton glove in a hole in the plastering in the chimney corner at home and ef you ll spare my life you can go there and get it says I You old blockhead says they we want neither one nor t other Come along quietly and you shall receive no harm But at the first cry or attempt to escape this shall stop you And with that the willain held the mizzle of a pistil so nigh to my nose that I smelt brimstone while t other one bound a silk hankercher round my eyes and then took poor Molly s bridle and led her along I couldn t see in course and I dassint breathe for fear o the pistil But I said my prayers to myself all the time Well master they led the mule on down the path until we comed to a place wide enough to turn when they turned us round and led us back outen the wood and then round and round and up and down and crossways and lengthways as ef they didn t want me to find where they were taking me Well sir when they d walked about in this fused way leadin of the mule about a mile I knew we was in the woods again the very same woods and the very same path I knowed by the feel of the place and the sound of the bushes as we hit up against them each side and also by the rumbling of the Spout as it rumbled along toward the Punch Bowl We went down and down and down and lower and lower and lower until we got right down in the bottom of that hollow Then we stopped A gate was opened I put up my hand to raise the hankerchief and see where I was but just at that minute I felt the mizzle o the pistol like a ring of ice right agin my temple and the willain growling into my ear If you do But I didn t I dropped my hand down as if I had been shot and afore I had seen anything either So we went through the gate and up a gravelly walk I knew it by the crackling of the gravel under Molly s feet and stopped at a horse block where one o them willains lifted me off I put up my hand agin Do if you dare says t other one with the mizzle o the pistol at my head I dropped my hand like lead So they led me on a little way and then up some steps I counted them to myself as I went along They were six You see master I took all this pains to know the house agin Then they opened a door that opened in the middle Then they went along a passage and up more stairs there was ten and a turn and then ten more Then along another passage and up another flight of stairs just like the first Then along another passage and up a third flight of stairs They was alike Well sir here we was at the top o the house One o them willains opened a door on the left side and t other said There go in and do your duty and pushed me through the door and shut and locked it on me Good gracious sir how scared I was I slipped off the silk handkercher and feared as I was I didn t forget to put it in my bosom Then I looked about me Right afore me on the hearth was a little weeny taper burning that showed I was in a great big garret with sloping walls At one end two deep dormer windows and a black walnut bureau standing between them At t other end a great tester bedstead with dark curtains There was a dark carpet on the floor And with all there were so many dark objects and so many shadows and the little taper burned so dimly that I could hardly tell t other from which or keep from breaking my nose against things as I groped about And what was I in this room for to do I couldn t even form an idee But presently my blood ran cold to hear a groan from behind the curtains then another and another then a cry as of some child in mortal agony saying For the love of Heaven save me I ran to the bed and dropped the curtains and liked to have fainted at what I saw And what did you see asked the magistrate Master behind those dark curtains I saw a young creature tossing about on the bed flinging her hair and beautiful arms about and tearing wildly at the fine lace that trimmed her night dress But master that wasn t what almost made me faint it was that her right hand was sewed up in black crape and her whole face and head completely covered with black crape drawn down and fastened securely around her throat leaving only a small slit at the lips and nose to breathe through What Take care woman Remember that you are upon your oath said the magistrate I know it master And as I hope to be forgiven I am telling you the truth Go on then Well sir she was a young creature scarcely past childhood if one might judge by her small size and soft rosy skin I asked her to let me take that black crape from her face and head but she threw up her hands and exclaimed Oh no no no for my life no Well master I hardly know how to tell you what followed said the old woman hesitating in embarrassment Go right straight on like a car of Juggernaut woman Remember the whole truth Well master in the next two hours there were twins born in that room a boy and a girl the boy was dead the girl living And all the time I heard the measured tramping of one of them willains up and down the passage outside of that room Presently the steps stopped and there was a rap at the door I went and listened but did not open it Is it all over the voice asked Before I could answer a cry from the bed caused me to look round There was the poor masked mother stretching out her white arms toward me in the most imploring way I hastened back to her Tell him no no she said Have you got through asked the man at the door rapping impatiently No no said I as directed He resumed his tramping up and down and I went back to my patient She beckoned me to come close and whispered Save my child The living one I mean Hide her oh hide her from him When he demands the babe give him the poor little dead one he cannot hurt that And he will not know there was another Oh hide and save my child Master I was used to queer doings but this was a little the queerest But if I was to conceal that second child in order to save it it was necessary to stop its mouth for it was squalling like a wild cat So I took a vial of paregoric from my pocket and give it a drop and it went off to sleep like an angel I wrapped it up warm and lay it along with my shawl and bonnet in a dark corner Just then the man rapped again Come in master said I No bring me the babe he said I took up the dead infant Its mother kissed its brow and dropped tears upon its little cold face And I carried it to the man outside Is it asleep the willain asked me Yes master said I as I put it well wrapped up in his arms very sound aslep So much the better said the knave walking away I bolted the door and went back to my patient With her free hand she seized mine and pressed it to her lips and then holding up her left hand pointed to the wedding ring upon her third finger Draw it off and keep it she said conceal the child under your shawl and take her with you when you go Save her and your fortune shall be made I declare master I hadn t time to think before I heard one of them wretches rap at the door Come Get ready to go he said She also beckoned me I hastened to her With eager whispers and imploring gestures she prayed me to take her ring and save her child But you said I who is to attend to you I do not know or care Save her The rapping continued I ran to the corner where I had left my things I put on my bonnet made a sort of sling around my neck of the silk handkercher opened the large part of it like a hammock and laid the little sleeping babe there Then I folded my big shawl around my breast and nobody any the wiser The rapping was very impatient I am coming said I Remember whispered the poor girl I will said I and went out and opened the door There stood t other willain with his head covered with black crape I dreamt of nothing but black headed demons for six months afterward Are you ready says he Yes your worship says I Come along then And binding another silk hankercher round my eyes he led me along Instead of my mule a carriage stood near the horse block Get in says he holding the pistil to my ears by way of an argument I got in He jumped up upon the driver s seat and we drove like the wind In another direction from that in which we come in course for there was no carriage road there The carriage whirled along at such a rate it made me quite giddy At last it stopped again The man in the mask got down and opened the door Where are you taking me says I Be quiet says he or And with that he put the pistil to my cheek ordered me to get out take the bandage from my eyes and walk before him I did so and saw dimly that we were in a part of the country that I was never at before We were in a dark road through a thick forest On the left side of the road in a clearing stood an old house a dim light was burning in a lower window Go on in there said the willain putting the pistil to the back of my head As the door stood ajar I went in to a narrow dark passage the man all the time at my back He opened a door on the left side and made me go into a dark room Just then the unfortunate child that had been moving restlessly began to wail Well it might poor starved thing What s that says the miscreant under his breath and stopping short It ain t nothing sir says I and Hush h h to the baby But the poor little wretch raised a squall What is the meaning of this says he Where did that child come from Why the demon don t you speak And with that he seized me again by the scruff of the neck and shook me Oh master for the love of Heaven don t says I This is only a poor unfortnet infant as its parents wanted to get outen the way and hired me to take care on And I have had it wrapped up under my shawl all the time cept when I was in your house when I put it to sleep in the corner Humph and you had that child concealed under your shawl when I first stopped you in the woods In course master says I Whose is it Master says I it s it s a dead secret for I hadn t another lie ready He broke out into a rude scornful laugh and seemed not half to believe me and yet not to care about questioning me too closely He made me sit down then in the dark and went out and turned the key on me I wet my finger with the paregoric and put it to the baby s lips to quiet its pains of hunger Then I heard a whispering in the next room Now my eyesight never was good but to make up for it I believe I had the sharpest ears that ever was and I don t think anybody could have heard that whispering but me I saw a little glimmer of light through the chinks that showed me where the door was and so I creeped up to it and put my ear to the key hole Still they whispered so low that no ears could o heard them but my sharp ones The first words I heard good was a grumbling voice asking How old Fifty more or less but strong active a good nurse and a very light mulatto says my willain s voice Hum too old says the other But I will throw the child in A low crackling laugh the only answer You mean that would be only a bother Well I want to get rid of the pair of them said my willain so name the price you are willing to give Cap n you and me have had too many transactions together to make any flummery about this You want to get shet o them pair I hain t no objections to turning an honest penny So jest make out the papers bill o sale o the oman Kate or whatsoever her name may be and the child with any price you please so it is only a make believe price and I ll engage to take her away and make the most I can of them in the South that won t be much seeing it s only an old oman and child scarcely a fair profit on the expense o takin of her out Now as money s no object to you Cap n Very well have your own way only don t let that woman escape and return for if you do I understand Cap n but I reckon you needn t threaten for if you could blow me why I would return you the same favor said the other raising his voice and laughing aloud Be quiet fool or come away farther here And the two willains moved out of even my hearing I should o been uneasy master if it hadn t been the oman they were talking about was named Kate and that wasn t my name which were well beknown to be Nancy Presently I heard the carriage drive away And almost mediately after the door was unlocked and a great big black bearded and black headed beast of a ruffian came in and says he Well my woman have you had any supper No said I I hain t and ef I m to stay here any length of time I d be obleeged to you to let me have some hot water and milk to make pap for this perishing baby Follow me says he And he took me into the kitchen at the back of the house where there was a fire in the fireplace and a cupboard with all that I needed Well sir not to tire you I made a nursing bottle for the baby and fed it And then I got something for my own supper or rather breakfast for it was now near the dawn of day Well sir I thought I would try to get out and look about myself to see what the neighborhood looked like by daylight but when I tried the door I found myself locked up a close prisoner I looked out of the window and saw nothing but a little back yard closed in by the woods I tried to raise the sash but it was nailed down The black headed monster came in just about that minute and seeing what I was a doing of says he Stop that What am I stopped here for says I a free oman says I a vented of going about her own business says I But he only laughed a loud crackling scornful laugh and went out turning the key after him A little after sunrise an old dried up spiteful looking hag of a woman came in and began to get breakfast What am I kept here for says I to her But she took no notice at all nor could I get so much as a single word outen her In fact master the little oman was deaf an dumb Well sir to be short I was kept in that place all day long and when night come I was druv into a shay at the point of the pistil and rattled along as fast as the horses could gallop over a road as I knew nothing of We changed horses wunst or twict and just about the dawn of day we come to a broad river with a vessel laying to not far from the shore As soon as the shay druv down on the sands the willain as had run away with me puts a pipe to his willainous mouth and blows like mad Somebody else blowed back from the wessel Then a boat was put off and rowed ashore I was forced to get into it and was follered by the willain We was rowed to the wessel and I was druv up the ladder on to the decks And there master right afore my own looking eyes me and the baby was traded off to the captain It was no use for me to splain or spostulate I wasn t b lieved The willain as had stole me got back into the boat and went ashore and I saw him get into the shay and drive away It was no use for me to howl and cry though I did both for I couldn t even hear myself for the swearing of the captain and the noise of the crew as they was a gettin of the wessel under way Well sir we sailed down that river and out to sea Now sir come a strange providence which the very thoughts of it might convert a heathen We had been to sea about five days when a dreadful storm riz Oh marster the inky blackness of the sky the roaring of the wind the raging of the sea the leaping of the waves and the rocking of that wessel and every once in a while sea and ship all ablaze with the blinding lightning was a thing to see not to hear tell of I tell you marster that looked like the wrath of God And then the cursing and swearing and bawling of the captain and the crew as they were a takin in of sail was enough to raise one s hair on their head I hugged the baby to my breast and went to praying as hard as ever I could pray Presently I felt an awful shock as if heaven an earth had come together and then everybody screaming She s struck She s struck I felt the wessel trembling like a live creetur and the water a pouring in everywhere I hugged the babe and scrambled up the companionway to the deck It was pitch dark and I heard every man rushing toward one side of the wessel A flash of lightning that made everything as bright as day again showed me that they were all taking to the boat I rushed after calling to them to save me and the baby But no one seemed to hear me they were all too busy trying to save themselves and keep others out of the boat and cursing and swearing and hollering that there was no more room that the boat would be swamped and so on The end was that all who could crowd into the boat did so And me and the baby and a poor sailor lad and the black cook were left behind to perish But marster as it turned out we as was left to die were the only ones saved We watched after that boat with longing eyes though we could only see it when the lightning flashed And every time we saw it it was farther off At last marster a flash of lightning showed us the boat as far off as ever we could see her capsized and beaten hither and thither by the wild waves its crew had perished Marster as soon as the sea had swallowed up that wicked captain and crew the wind died away the waves fell and the storm lulled just as if it had done what it was sent to do and was satisfied The wreck where we poor forlorn ones stood the wreck that had shivered and trembled with every wave that struck it until we had feared it would break up every minute became still and firm on its sand bar as a house on dry land Daylight came at last And a little after sunrise we saw a sail bearing down upon us We could not signal the sail but by the mercy of Providence she saw us and lay to and sent off a boat and picked us up and took us on board me and the baby and the cook and the sailor lad It was a foreign wessel and we could not understand a word they said nor they us All we could do was by signs But they were very good to us dried our clothes and gave us breakfast and made us lie down and rest and then put about and continued their course The sailor lad Herbert Greyson soon found out and told me they were bound for New York And in fact marster in about ten days we made that port When the ship anchored below the Battery the officers and passengers made me up a little bundle of clothes and a little purse of money and put me ashore and there I was in a strange city so bewildered I didn t know which way to turn While I was a standing there in danger of being run over by the omnibuses the sailor boy came to my side and told me that he and the cook was gwine to engage on board of another Merican wessel and axed me what I was gwine to do I told him how I didn t know nothing at all bout sea sarvice and so I didn t know what I should do Then he said he d show me where I could go and stay all night and so he took me into a little by street to a poor looking house where the people took lodgers and there he left me to go aboard the ship As he went away he advised me to take care of my money and try to get a servant s place Well marster I ain t a gwine to bother you with telling you of how I toiled and struggled along in that great city first living out as a servant and afterward renting a room and taking in washing and ironing ay how I toiled and struggled for ten long years hoping for the time to come when I should be able to return to this neighborhood where I was known and expose the evil deeds of them willains And for this cause I lived on toiling and struggling and laying up money penny by penny Sometimes I was fool enough to tell my story in the hopes of getting pity and help but telling my story always made it worse for me some thought me crazy and others thought me deceitful which is not to be wondered at for I was a stranger and my adventures were indeed beyond belief No one ever helped me but the lad Herbert Greyson W enver he came from sea he sought me out and made a little present to me or Cap Cap marster was Capitola the child The reason I gave her that name was because on that ring I had drawn from the masked mother s hand were the two names Eugene Capitola Well marster the last time Herbert Greyson came home he gave me five dollars and that with what I had saved was enough to pay my passage to Norfolk I left my little Cap in the care of the people of the house she was big enough to pay for her keep in work and I took passage for Norfolk When I got there I fell ill spent all my money and was at last taken to the poor house Six months passed away before I was discharged and then six months more before I had earned and saved money enough to pay my way on here I reached here three days ago and found a wheat field growing where my cottage fire used to burn and all my old cronies dead all except Old Hat who has received and given me shelter Sir my story is done make what you can of it said the invalid sinking down in her bed as if utterly exhausted Old Hurricane whose countenance had expressed emotions as powerful as they were various while listening to this tale now arose stepped cautiously to the door drew the bolt and coming back bent his head and asked What more of the child Cap sir I have not heard a word of Cap since I left her to try to find out her friends But any one interested in her might inquire for her at missus Simmons laundress No eight Rag Alley You say the names upon that ring were Eugene Capitola Yes sir they were Have you that ring about you No marster I thought it was best in case of accidents to leave it with the child Have you told her any part of this strange history No marster nor hinted at it she was too young for such a confidence You were right Had she any mark about her person by which she could be identified Yes marster a very strange one In the middle of her left palm was the perfect image of a crimson hand about half an inch in length There was also another Henry Greyson to please me marked upon her forearm in India ink her name and birthday Capitola Oct thirty first eighteen thirty two Right Now tell me my good soul do you know from what you were able to observe what house that was where Capitola was born I am on my oath No sir I do not know but You suspect The woman nodded It was said old Hurricane stooping and whispering a name that was heard by no one but the sick woman She nodded again with a look of intense meaning Does your old hostess here Hat know or suspect anything of this story inquired Major Warfield Not a word No soul but yourself has heard it That is right Still be discreet If you would have the wicked punished and the innocent protected be silent and wary Have no anxiety about the girl What man can do for her will I do and quickly And now good creature day is actually dawning You must seek repose And I must call the parson in and return home I will send missus Condiment over with food wine medicine clothing and every comfort that your condition requires said Old Hurricane rising and calling in the clergyman with whom he soon after left the hut for home They reached Hurricane Hall in time for an early breakfast which the astonished housekeeper had prepared and for which their night s adventures had certainly given them a good appetite Major Warfield kept his word and as soon as breakfast was over he dispatched missus Condiment with a carriage filled with provisions for the sick woman But they were not needed In a couple of hours the housekeeper returned with the intelligence that the old nurse was dead The false strength of mental excitement that had enabled her to tell so long and dreadful a tale had been the last flaring up of the flame of life that almost immediately went out I am not sorry upon the whole for now I shall have the game in my own hands muttered Old Hurricane to himself Ah Gabrielle Le Noir better you had cast yourself down from the highest rock of this range and been dashed to pieces below than have thus fallen into my power CHAPTER III THE QUEST Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling And out he rode Hudibras Pursuant to the orders of Major Warfield the corpse of the old midwife was the next day after her decease brought over and quietly interred in the family graveyard of Hurricane Hall And then Major Warfield astonished his household by giving orders to his housekeeper and his body servant to prepare his wardrobe and pack his trunks for a long journey to the north What can the major be thinking of to be setting out for the north at this time of the year exclaimed good little missus Condiment as she picked over her employer s shirts selecting the newest and warmest to be done up for the occasion Lord A mighty o ny knows but pears to me marster s never been right in his headpiece since Hollow eve night when he took that ride to the Witch s Hut replied Wool who with brush and sponge was engaged in rejuvenating his master s outer garments But let his family wonder as they would Old Hurricane kept his own counsel only just as he was going away lest mystery should lead to investigation and that to discovery the old man gave out that he was going north to invest capital in bank stock and so quite unattended he departed His servant Wool indeed accompanied him as far as Tip Top the little hamlet on the mountain at which he was to meet the eastern stage but there having seen his master comfortably deposited in the inside of the coach and the luggage safely stowed in the boot Wool was ordered to return with the carriage And Major Warfield proceeded on his journey alone This also caused much speculation in the family Who s gwine to make his punch and warm his bed and put his slippers on the hearth and hang his gown to de fire that what I want to know cried the grieved and indignant Wool Oh the waiters at the taverns where he stops can do that for him said missus Condiment No they can t nuther they don t know his ways they don t know nuffin bout him I clare I think our ole marse done gone clean crazy I shouldn t be s prised he d gone off to de norf to get married and was to bring home a young wife to we dem Tut tut tut such talk That will never do exclaimed the deeply shocked missus Condiment Werry well All I say is Dem as libs longest will see most said Wool shaking his white head After which undeniable apothegm the conversation came to a stand Meanwhile Old Hurricane pursued his journey a lumbering old fashioned stage coach ride across the mountains creeping at a snail s crawl up one side of the precipice and clattering thunderously down the other at a headlong speed that pitched the back seat passengers into the bosoms of the front ones and threatened even to cast the coach over the heads of the horses Three days and nights of such rugged riding brought the traveler to Washington City where he rested one night and then took the cars for New York He rested another night in Philadelphia resumed his journey by the first train in the morning and reached New York about noon The crowd the noise the hurry and confusion at the wharf almost drove this irascible old gentleman mad No confound you I ll see your neck stretched first you villain Out of my way or I ll break your head sirrah were some of his responses to the solicitous attentions of cabmen and porters At length taking up his heavy carpet bag in both hands Old Hurricane began to lay about him with such effect that he speedily cleared a passage for himself through the crowd Then addressing a cabman who had not offended by speaking first he said Here sir Here are my checks Go get my luggage and take it to the Astor House Hand the clerk this card and tell him I want a good room well warmed I shall take a walk around the city before going And hark ye If one of my trunks is missing I ll have you hanged you rogue Breach of trust isn t a hanging matter in New York your honor laughed the cabman as he touched his hat and hurried off toward the crowd collected around the baggage car Old Hurricane made a step or two as if he would have pursued and punished the flippancy of the man but finally thought better of it picked up his portmanteau and walked up the street slowly with frequent pauses and bewildered looks as though he had forgotten his directions or lost his way and yet hesitated to inquire of any one for the obscure little alley in which he had been told to look for his treasure CHAPTER IV CAPITOLA Her sex a page s dress belied Obscured her charms but could not hide Scott Please sir do you want your carpet bag carried asked a voice near Old Hurricane looked around him with a puzzled air for he thought that a young girl had made this offer so soft and clear were the notes of the voice that spoke It was I sir Here I am at yours and everybody s service sir said the same voice And turning Old Hurricane saw sitting astride a pile of boxes at the corner store a very ragged lad some thirteen years of age Good gracious thought Old Hurricane as he gazed upon the boy this must be crown prince and heir apparent to the king of shreds and patches Well old gent you ll know me next time that s certain said the lad returning the look with interest It is probable Old Hurricane did not hear this irreverent speech for he continued to gaze with pity and dismay upon the ragamuffin before him He was a handsome boy too notwithstanding the deplorable state of his wardrobe Thick clustering curls of jet black hair fell in tangled disorder around a forehead broad white and smooth as that of a girl slender and quaintly arched black eyebrows played above a pair of mischievous dark gray eyes that sparkled beneath the shade of long thick black lashes a little turned up nose and red pouting lips completed the character of a countenance full of fun frolic spirit and courage Well governor if you ve looked long enough maybe you ll take me into service said the lad winking to a group of his fellow newsboys that had gathered at the corner Dear dear dear he looks as if he had never in his life seen soap and water or a suit of whole clothes ejaculated the old gentleman adding kindly Yes I reckon I will give you the job my son His son Oh crikey do you hear that fellows His son Oh Lor my governor s turned up at last I m his son oh gemini But what did I tell you I always had a sort of impression that I must have had a father in some former period of my life and behold here he is Who knows but I might have had a mother also But that isn t likely Still I ll ask him How s the old woman sir said the newsboy jumping off the boxes and taking the carpet bag in his hand What are you talking about you infatuated tatterdemalion Come along If it weren t for pity I d have you put in the pillory exclaimed Old Hurricane shaking his cane at the offender Thanky sir I ve not had a pillow under my head for a long time Silence ragamuffin Just so sir a dumb devil is better than a talking one answered the lad demurely following his employer They went on some distance Old Hurricane diligently reading the names of the streets at the corners Presently he stopped again bewildered and after gazing around himself for a few minutes said Boy Yes sir Do you know such a place as Rag Alley in Manillo Street Rag Alley sir Yes a sort of narrow dark musty place with a row of old tumble down tenements each side where poor wretches live all huddled up together fifty in a house eh I was told I couldn t drive up it in a carriage so I had to walk Do you know such a place Do I know such a place Do I know Rag Alley Oh my eye Oh he he he he What are you laughing at now you miscellaneous assortment of variegated pieces Oh oh dear I was laughing to think how well I knew Rag Alley Humph you do look as if you were born and bred there But sir I wasn t Humph How did you get into life then I don t know governor unless I was raked up from the gutter by some old woman in the rag picking line said the newsboy demurely Humph I think that quite likely But now do you say that you know where that alley is Oh don t set me off again Oh he he he Yes sir I know Well then show me the way and don t be a fool I d scorn to be it sir This is the way said the lad taking the lead They walked on several squares and then the boy stopped and pointing down a cross street said There governor there you are There Where Why that s a handsome street said Old Hurricane gazing up in admiration at the opposite blocks of stately brown stone mansions That s it hows ever That s Rag Alley Tain t called Rag Alley now though It s called Hifalutin Terrace Them tenements you talk of were pulled down more n a year ago and these houses put up in their place said the newsboy Dear dear dear what changes And what became of the poor tenants asked Old Hurricane gazing in dismay at the inroads of improvement The tenants poor wretches how do I know Carted away blown away thrown away with the other rubbish What became of the tenants Ask of the winds that far around With fragments strewed the sea ty I heard that spouted at a school exhibition once governor said the lad demurely Humph well well well the trace is lost What shall I do put advertisements in all the daily papers apply at the chief police office Yes I ll do both muttered Old Hurricane to himself then speaking out he called Boy Yes sir Call me a cab Yes sir And the lad was off like an arrow to do his bidding In a few moments the cab drove up The newsboy who was sitting beside the driver jumped down and said Here it is sir Thank you my son here is your fee said Old Hurricane putting a silver dollar into the lad s hand What Lor it can t be I but it is He must have made a mistake What if he did I don t care Yes I do too Honor bright exclaimed the newsboy looking in wonder and desire and sore temptation upon the largest piece of money he had ever touched in his life Governor Well boy said the old gentleman with his feet upon the steps of the cab You ve been and done and gone and give me a whole dollar by mistake And why should you think it a mistake you impertinent monkey Your honor didn t mean it Why not you young rascal Of course I did Take it and be off with you said Old Hurricane beginning to ascend the steps I m a great mind to said the newsboy still gazing on the coin with satisfaction and desire I m a great mind to but I won t tain t fair Governor I say What now you troublesome fellow Do stop a minute Don t tempt me too hard cause you see I ain t sure I could keep honest if I was tempted too hard What do you mean now you ridiculous little ape I mean I know you re from the country and don t know no better and I mus n t impose upon your ignorance My ignorance you impudent villain exclaimed the old man with rising wrath Yes governor you hain t cut your eye teeth yet you hain t up to snuff you don t know nothing Why this is too much for toting a carpet bag a half a dozen squares and it s very well you fell in with a honest lad like me that wouldn t impose on your innocence Bless you the usual price isn t more n a dime or if you re rich and generous a shillin but What the deuce do I care for the usual price you you you perfect prodigy of patches There for the Lord s sake go get yourself a decent suit of clothes Drive on cabman roared Old Hurricane flinging an eagle upon the sidewalk and rolling off in his cab Poor dear old gentleman I wonder where his keeper is How could he have got loose Maybe I d better go and tell the police But then I don t know who he is or where he s gone But he is very crazy and I m afraid he ll fling away every cent of his money before his friends can catch him I know what I ll do I ll go to the stand and watch for the cab to come back and ask the driver what he has done with the poor dear old fellow said the newsboy picking up the gold coin and putting it into his pocket And then he started but with an eye to business singing out Herald Triebune Express last account of the orful accident steamer et cetera et cetera et cetera selling his papers as he went on to the cab stand He found the cabman already there And to his anxious inquiries as to the sanity of the old gentleman that Jehu replied Oh bless your soul crazy No no more n you or I He s a real nob a real Virginian F F V with money like the sands on the seashore Keep the tin lad he knowed what he was a doin on Oh it a most scares me to have so much money exclaimed the boy half in delight half in dismay but to night I ll have a warm supper and sleep in a bed once more And to morrow a new suit of clothes So here goes Herald Express full account the horrible murder Bell Street Ledgee ee ee et cetera et cetera et cetera crying his papers until he was out of hearing Never in his life had the newsboy felt so prosperous and happy CHAPTER V THE DISCOVERY And at the magistrate s command And next undid the leathern band That bound her tresses there And raised her felt hat from her head And down her slender form there spread Black ringlets rich and rare Old Hurricane meanwhile dined at the public table at the Astor and afterward went to his room to rest smoke and ruminate And he finished the evening by supping and retiring to bed In the morning after an early breakfast he wrote a dozen advertisements and called a cab and rode around to leave them with the various daily papers for immediate publication Then to lose no time he rode up to the Recorder s office to set the police upon the search As he was about to enter the front portal he observed the doorway and passage blocked up with even a larger crowd than usual And seeing the cabman who had waited upon him the preceding day he inquired of him What is the matter here Nothing your honor cept a boy tuk up for wearing girl s clothes or a girl tuk up for wearing boy s I dunno which said the man touching his hat Let me pass then I must speak to the chief of police said Old Hurricane shoving his way into the Recorder s room This is not the office of the chief sir you will find him on the other side of the hall said a bystander But before Old Hurricane had gathered the sense of these words a sight within the office drew his steps thither Up before the Recorder stood a lad of about thirteen years who despite his smart new suit of gray casinet his long rolling black ringlets and his downcast and blushing face Old Hurricane immediately recognized as his acquaintance of the preceding day the saucy young tatterdemalion Feeling sorry for the friendless boy the old man impulsively went up to him and patted him on the shoulder saying What In trouble my lad Never mind never look down I ll warrant ye an honest lad from what I ve seen myself Come come pluck up a spirit I ll see you through my lad Lad Lord bless your soul sir he s no more a lad than you or I The young rascal is a girl in boy s clothes sir said the officer who had the culprit in custody What what what exclaimed Old Hurricane gazing in consternation from the young prisoner to the accuser what what my newsboy my saucy little prince of patches a girl in boy s clothes Yes sir a young scoundrel I actually twigged him selling papers at the Fulton Ferry this morning A little rascal A girl in boy s clothes A girl exclaimed Old Hurricane with his eyes nearly starting out of his head Just then the young culprit looked up in his face with an expression half melancholy half mischievous that appealed to the rugged heart of the old man Turning around to the policeman he startled the whole office by roaring out Girl is she sir Then demmy sir whether a girl in boy s clothes or men s clothes or soldier s clothes or sailor s clothes or any clothes or no clothes sir treat her with the delicacy due to womanhood sir ay and the tenderness owed to childhood for she is but a bit of a poor friendless motherless fatherless child lost and wandering in your great Babylon No more hard words to her sir or by the ever lasting Order put in the calm and dignified Recorder Old Hurricane though his face was still purple his veins swollen and his eyeballs glaring with anger immediately recovered himself turned and bowed to the Recorder and said Yes sir I will keep order if you ll make that brute of a policeman reform his language And so saying Old Hurricane subsided into a seat immediately behind the child to watch the examination What ll they do with her do you think he inquired of a bystander Send her down in course Down Where To Blackwell s Island to the work us in course To the workhouse her that child the wretches Um m m me Oh h h groaned Old Hurricane stooping and burying his shaggy gray head in his great hands He felt his shoulder touched and looking up saw that the little prisoner had turned around and was about to speak to him Governor said the same clear voice that he had even at first supposed to belong to a girl Governor don t you keep on letting out that way You don t know nothing You re in the Recorder s Court If you don t mind your eye they ll commit you for contempt Will they Then they ll do well my lad Lass I mean I plead guilty to contempt Send a child like you to the They shan t do it Simply they shan t do it I Major Warfield of Virginia tell you so my boy girl I mean But you innocent old lion instead of freeing me you ll find yourself shut up between four walls and very narrow ones at that I tell you You ll think yourself in your coffin Governor they call it The Tombs whispered the child Attention said the clerk The little prisoner turned and faced the court And the old lion buried his shaggy gray head and beard in his hands and groaned aloud Now then what is your name my lad my girl I should say inquired the clerk Capitola sir Old Hurricane pricked up his ears and raised his head muttering to himself Cap it o la That s a very odd name Can t surely be two in the world of the same Cap it ola if it should be my Capitola after all I shouldn t wonder at all I ll listen and say nothing And with this wise resolution Old Hurricane again dropped his head upon his hands You say your name is Capitola Capitola what inquired the clerk continuing the examination Nothing sir Nothing What do you mean I have no name but Capitola sir Who is your father Never had any that I know sir Your mother Never had a mother either sir as ever I heard Where do you live About in spots in the city sir Oh oh oh groaned old Hurricane within his hands What is your calling inquired the clerk Selling newspapers carrying portmanteaus and packages sweeping before doors clearing off snow blacking boots and so on Little odd jobs in general eh Yes sir anything that I can turn my hand to and get to do Boy girl I should say what tempted you to put yourself into male attire Sir In boy s clothes then Oh yes want sir and and danger sir cried the little prisoner putting her hands to a face crimson with blushes and for the first time since her arrest upon the eve of sobbing Oh oh oh groaned Old Hurricane from his chair Want Danger How is that continued the clerk Your honor mightn t like to know By all means It is in fact necessary that you should give an account of yourself said the clerk Old Hurricane once more raised his head opened his ears and gave close attention One circumstance he had particularly remarked the language used by the poor child during her examination was much superior to the slang she had previously affected to support her assumed character of newsboy Well well why do you pause Go on go on my good boy girl I mean I said the Recorder in a tone of kind encouragement CHAPTER VI A SHORT SAD STORY Ah poverty is a weary thing It burdeneth the brain It maketh even the little child To murmur and complain It is not much I have to tell began Capitola I was brought up in Rag Alley and its neighborhood by an old woman named Nancy Grewell Ah ejaculated Old Hurricane She was a washwoman and rented one scantily furnished room from a poor family named Simmons Oh cried Old Hurricane Granny as I called her was very good to me and I never suffered cold nor hunger until about eighteen months ago when Granny took it into her head to go down to Virginia Umph exclaimed Old Hurricane When Granny went away she left me a little money and some good clothes and told me to be sure to stay with the people where she left me for that she would be back in about a month But your honor that was the last I ever saw or heard of poor Granny She never came back again And by that I know she must have died Ah h h breathed the old man puffing fast The first month or two after Granny left I did well enough And then when the little money was all gone I eat with the Simmonses and did little odd jobs for my food But by and by mister Simmons got out of work and the family fell into want and they wished me to go out and beg for them I just couldn t do that and so they told me I should look out for myself Were there no customers of your grandmother that you could have applied to for employment asked the Recorder No sir My Granny s customers were mostly boarders at the small taverns and they were always changing I did apply to two or three houses where the landladies knew Granny but they didn t want me Oh h h groaned Major Warfield in the tone of one in great pain I wouldn t have that old fellow s conscience for a good deal whispered a spectator for as sure as shooting that gal s his unlawful child Well go on What next asked the clerk Well sir though the Simmonses had nothing to give me except a crust now and then they still let me sleep in the house for the little jobs I could do for them But at last Simmons he got work on the railroad away off somewhere and they all moved away from the city And you were left alone Yes sir I was left alone in the empty unfurnished house Still it was a shelter and I was glad of it and I dreaded the time when it would be rented by another tenant and I should be turned into the street Oh oh oh Lord groaned the major But it was never rented again for the word went around that the whole row was to be pulled down and so I thought I had leave to stay at least as long as the rats did continued Capitola with somewhat of her natural roguish humor twinkling in her dark gray eyes But how did you get your bread inquired the Recorder Did not get it at all sir Bread was too dear I sold my clothes piece by piece to the old Jew over the way and bought corn meal and picked up trash to make a fire and cooked a little mush every day in an old tin can that had been left behind And so I lived on for two or three weeks And then when my clothes were all gone except the suit I had upon my back and my meal was almost out instead of making mush every day I economized and made gruel But my boy my good girl I mean before you became so destitute you should have found something or other to do said the Recorder Sir I was trying to get jobs every hour in the day I d have done anything honest I went around to all the houses Granny knew but they didn t want a girl Some of the good natured landlords said if I was a boy now they could keep me opening oysters but as I was a girl they had no work for me I even went to the offices to get papers to sell but they told me that crying papers was not proper work for a girl I even went down to the ferry boats and watched for the passengers coming ashore and ran and offered to carry their carpet bags or portmanteaus but some growled at me and others laughed at me and one old gentleman asked me if I thought he was a North American Indian to strut up Broadway with a female behind him carrying his pack And so sir while all the ragged boys I knew could get little jobs to earn bread I because I was a girl was not allowed to carry a gentleman s parcel or black his boots or shovel the snow off a shopkeeper s pavement or put in coal or do anything that I could do just as well as they And so because I was a girl there seemed to be nothing but starvation or beggary before me Oh Lord oh Lord that such things should be cried Old Hurricane That was bad sir but there was worse behind There came a day when my meal even the last dust of it was gone Then I kept life in me by drinking water and by sleeping all I could At first I could not sleep for the gnawing gnawing in my stomach but afterwards I slept deeply from exhaustion and then I d dream of feasts and the richest sort of food and of eating such quantities and really sir I seemed to taste it and enjoy it and get the good of it almost as much as if it was all true One morning after such a dream I was waked up by a great noise outside I staggered upon my feet and crept to the window and there sir were the workmen all outside a pulling down the house over my head Good Heaven ejaculated Old Hurricane who seemed to constitute himself the chorus of this drama Sir they didn t know that I or any one was in the empty house Fright gave me strength to run down stairs and run out Then I stopped Oh I stopped and looked up and down the street What should I do The last shelter was gone away from me the house where I had lived so many years and that seemed like a friend to me was falling before my eyes I thought I d just go and pitch myself into the river and end it all That was a very wicked thought said the Recorder Yes sir I know it was and besides I was dreadfully afraid of being suffocated in the dirty water around the wharf said Capitola with a sparkle of that irrepressible humor that effervesced even through all her trouble Well sir the hand that feeds young ravens kept me from dying that day I found a five cent piece in the street and resolved not to smother myself in the river mud as long as it lasted So I bought a muffin ate it and went down to the wharf to look for a job I looked all day but found none and when night came I went into a lumber yard and hid myself behind a pile of planks that kept the wind off me and I went to sleep and dreamed a beautiful dream of living in a handsome house with friends all around me and everything good to eat and drink and wear Poor poor child but your dream may come true yet muttered Old Hurricane to himself Well your honor next day I spent another penny out of my half dime and looked

none	none	for work all day and slept at night in a broken down omnibus that had happened to be left on the stand And so not to tire your patience a whole week passed away I lived on my half dime spending a penny a day for a muffin until the last penny was gone and sleeping at night wherever I could sometimes under the front stoop of a house sometimes in an old broken carriage and sometimes behind a pile of boxes on the sidewalk That was a dreadful exposure for a young girl said the Recorder A burning blush flamed up over the young creature s cheek as she answered Yes sir that was the worst of all that finally drove me to putting on boy s clothes Let us hear all about it Oh sir I can t I How can I Well being always exposed sleeping outdoors I was often in danger from bad boys and bad men said Capitola and dropping her head upon her breast and covering her crimson cheeks with her hands for the first time she burst into tears and sobbed aloud Come come my little man my good little woman I mean don t take it so to heart You couldn t help it said Old Hurricane with raindrops glittering even in his own stormy eyes Capitola looked up with her whole countenance flashing with spirit and exclaimed Oh but I took care of myself sir I did indeed your honor You mustn t either you or the old gentleman dare to think but what I did Oh of course of course said a bystander laughing Old Hurricane sprang up bringing his feet down upon the floor with a resound that made the great hall ring again exclaiming What do you mean by of course of course you villain Demmy I ll swear she took care of herself you varlet and if any man dares to hint otherwise I ll ram his falsehood down his throat with the point of my walking stick and make him swallow both Order order said the clerk Old Hurricane immediately wheeled to the right about faced and saluted the bench in military fashion and then said Yes sir I ll regard order but in the meanwhile if the court does not protect this child from insult I must order or no order and with that the old gentleman once more subsided into his seat Governor don t you be so noisy You ll get yourself stopped up into a jug next Why you remind me of an uproarious old fellow poor Granny used to talk about that they called Old Hurricane because he was so stormy whispered Capitola turning toward him Humph she s heard of me then muttered the old gentleman to himself Well sir I mean miss go on said the clerk addressing Capitola Yes sir Well your honor at the end of five days being a certain Thursday morning when I couldn t get a job of work for love nor money when my last penny was spent for my last roll and my last roll was eaten up and I was dreading the gnawing hunger by day and the horrid perils of the night I thought to myself if I were only a boy I might carry packages and shovel in coal and do lots of jobs by day and sleep without terror by night And then I felt bitter against Fate for not making me a boy And so thinking and thinking and thinking I wandered on until I found myself in Rag Alley where I used to live standing right between the pile of broken bricks plaster and lumber that used to be my home and the old Jew s shop where I sold my clothes for meal And then all of a sudden a bright thought struck me and I made up my mind to be a boy Made up your mind to be a boy Yes sir for it was so easy I wondered how I came to be so stupid as not to have thought of it before I just ran across to the old Jew s shop and offered to swap my suit of girl s clothes that was good though dirty for any even the raggedest suit of boy s clothes he had whether they d fit me or not so they would only stay on me The old fellow put his finger to his nose as if he thought I d been stealing and wanted to dodge the police So he took down an old not very ragged suit that he said would fit me and opened a door and told me to go in his daughter s room and put em on Well not to tire your honors I went into that little back parlor a girl and I came out a boy with a suit of pants and jacket with my hair cut short and a cap on my head The Jew gave me a penny roll and a sixpence for my black ringlets All seemed grist that came to his mill said Old Hurricane Yes Governor he was a dealer in general Well the first thing I did was to hire myself to the Jew at a sixpence a day and find myself to shovel in his coal That didn t take me but a day So at night the Jew paid me and I slept in peace behind a stack of boxes Next morning I was up before the sun and down to the office of the little penny paper the Morning Star I bought two dozen of em and ran as fast as I could to the ferry boats to sell to the early passengers Well sir in an hour s time I had sold out and pocketed just two shillings and felt myself on the highroad to fortune And so that was the way by which you came to put yourself in male attire Yes sir and the only thing that made me feel sorry was to see what a fool I had been not to turn to a boy before when it was so easy And from that day forth I was happy and prosperous I found plenty to do I carried carpet bags held horses put in coal cleaned sidewalks blacked gentlemen s boots and did everything an honest lad could turn his hand to And so for more n a year I was as happy as a king and should have kept on so only I forgot and let my hair grow and instead of cutting it off just tucked it up under my cap and so this morning on the ferry boat in a high breeze the wind blowed off my cap and the policeman blowed on me Twasn t altogether her long hair your honor for I had seen her before having known her when she lived with old missus Grewell in Rag Alley interrupted the officer You may sit down my child said the Recorder in a tone of encouragement CHAPTER VII METAMORPHOSIS OF THE NEWSBOY With caution judge of probability Things deemed unlikely e en impossible Experience oft hath proven to be true Shakespeare What shall we do with her inquired the Recorder sotto voce of a brother magistrate who appeared to be associated with him on the bench Send her to the Refuge replied the other in the same tone What are they consulting about asked Old Hurricane whose ears were not of the best They are talking of sending her to the Refuge answered a bystander Refuge Is there a refuge for destitute children in New York Then Babylon is not so bad as I thought it What is this Refuge It is a prison where juvenile delinquents are trained to habits of A prison Send her to a prison Never burst forth Old Hurricane rising and marching up to the Recorder he stood hat in hand before him and said Your honor if a proper legal guardian appears to claim this young person and holds himself in all respects responsible for her may she not be at once delivered into his hands Assuredly answered the magistrate with the manner of one glad to be rid of the charge Then sir I Ira Warfield of Hurricane Hall in Virginia present myself as the guardian of this girl Capitola Black whom I claim as my ward And I will enter into a recognizance for any sum to appear and prove my right if it should be disputed For my personal responsibility sir I refer you to the proprietors of the Astor who have known me many years It is not necessary Major Warfield we assume the fact of your responsibility and deliver up the young girl to your charge I thank you sir said Old Hurricane bowing low Then hurrying across the room where sat the reporters for the press he said Gentlemen I have a favor to ask of you it is that you will altogether drop this case of the boy in girl s clothes I mean the girl in girl s clothes I declare I don t know what I mean nor I shan t neither until I see the creature in its proper dress but this I wish to request of you gentlemen that you will drop that item from your report or if you must mention it treat it with delicacy as the good name of a young lady is involved The reporters with sidelong glances winks and smiles gave him the required promise and Old Hurricane returned to the side of his protegee Capitola are you willing to go with me Jolly willing governor Then come along my cab is waiting said Old Hurricane and bowing to the court he took the hand of his charge and led her forth amid the ill suppressed jibes of the crowd There s a hoary headed old sinner said one She s as like him as two peas quoth another Wonder if there s any more belonging to him of the same sort inquired a third Leaving all the sarcasm behind him Old Hurricane handed his protegee into the cab took the seat beside her and gave orders to be driven out toward Harlem As soon as they were seated in the cab the old man turned to his charge and said Capitola I shall have to trust to your girl s wit to get yourself into your proper clothes again without exciting further notice Yes governor My boy girl I mean I am not the governor of Virginia though if every one had his rights I don t know but I should be However I am only Major Warfield said the old man naively for he had not the most distant idea that the title bestowed on him by Capitola was a mere remnant of her newsboys slang Now my lad pshaw my lass I mean how shall we get you metamorphosed again I know gov major I mean There is a shop of ready made clothing at the Needle Woman s Aid corner of the next square I can get out there and buy a full suit Very well Stop at the next corner driver called Old Hurricane The next minute the cab drew up before a warehouse of ready made garments Old Hurricane jumped out and leading his charge entered the shop Luckily there was behind the counter only one person a staid elderly kind looking woman Here madam said Old Hurricane stooping confidentially to her ear I am in a little embarrassment that I hope you will be willing to help me out of for a consideration I came to New York in pursuit of my ward this young girl here whom I found in boy s clothes I now wish to restore her to her proper dress before presenting her to my friends of course Therefore I wish you to furnish her with a half dozen complete suits of female attire of the very best you have that will fit her And also to give her the use of a room and of your own aid in changing her dress I will pay you liberally Half suspicious and half scandalized the worthy woman gazed with scrutiny first into the face of the guardian and then into that of the ward but finding in the extreme youth of the one and the advanced age of the other and in the honest expression of both something to allay her fears if not to inspire her confidence she said Very well sir Come after me young gentleman young lady I should say And calling a boy to mind the shop she conducted Capitola to an inner apartment Old Hurricane went out and dismissed his cab When it was entirely out of sight he hailed another that was passing by empty and engaged it to take himself and a young lady to the Washington House When he re entered the shop he found the shop woman and Capitola returned and waiting for him Capitola was indeed transfigured Her bright black hair parted in the middle fell in ringlets each side her blushing cheeks her dark gray eyes were cast down in modesty at the very same instant that her ripe red lips were puckered up with mischief She was well and properly attired in a gray silk dress crimson merino shawl and a black velvet bonnet The other clothing that had been purchased was done up in packages and put into the cab And after paying the shop woman handsomely Old Hurricane took the hand of his ward handed her into the cab and gave the order To the Washington House The ride was performed in silence Capitola sat deeply blushing at the recollection of her male attire and profoundly cogitating as to what could be the relationship between herself and the gray old man whose claim the Recorder had so promptly admitted There seemed but one way of accounting for the great interest he took in her fate Capitola came to the conclusion that the grim old lion before her was no more nor less than her own father for alas poor Cap had been too long tossed about New York not to know more of life than at her age she should have known She had indeed the innocence of youth but not its simplicity Old Hurricane on his part sat with his thick cane grasped in his two knobby hands standing between his knees his grizzled chin resting upon it and his eyes cast down as in deep thought And so in silence they reached the Washington House Major Warfield then conducted his ward into the ladies parlor and went and entered his own and her name upon the books as Major Warfield and his ward Miss Black for whom he engaged two bedrooms and a private parlor Then leaving Capitola to be shown to her apartment by a chambermaid he went out and ordered her luggage up to her room and dismissed the cab Next he walked to the Astor House paid his bill collected his baggage took another carriage and drove back to the Washington Hotel All this trouble Old Hurricane took to break the links of his action and prevent scandal This filled up a long forenoon He dined alone with his ward in their private parlor Such a dinner poor Cap had never even smelled before How immensely she enjoyed it with all its surroundings the comfortable room the glowing fire the clean table the rich food the obsequious attendance her own genteel and becoming dress the company of a highly respectable guardian all all so different from anything she had ever been accustomed to and so highly appreciated How happy she felt How much happier from the contrast of her previous wretchedness to be suddenly freed from want toil fear and all the evils of destitute orphanage and to find herself blessed with wealth leisure and safety under the care of a rich good and kind father or as such Capitola continued to believe her guardian to be It was an incredible thing It was like a fairy tale Something of what was passing in her mind was perceived by Old Hurricane who frequently burst into uproarious fits of laughter as he watched her At last when the dinner and the dessert were removed and the nuts raisins and wine placed upon the table and the waiters had retired from the room and left them alone sitting one on each side of the fire with the table and its luxuries between them Major Warfield suddenly looked up and asked Capitola whom do you think that I am Old Hurricane to be sure I knew you from Granny s description the moment you broke out so in the police office answered Cap Humph Yes you re right and it was your Granny that bequeathed you to me Capitola Then she is really dead Yes There don t cry about her She was very old and she died happy Now Capitola if you please me I mean to adopt you as my own daughter Yes father No no you needn t call me father you know because it isn t true Call me uncle uncle uncle Is that true sir asked Cap demurely No no no but it will do it will do Now Cap how much do you know Anything Ignorant as a horse I am afraid Yes sir even as a colt Can you read at all Yes sir I learned to read at Sunday school Cast accounts and write I can keep your books at a pinch sir Humph Who taught you these accomplishments Herbert Greyson sir Herbert Greyson I ve heard that name before here it is again Who is that Herbert Greyson He s second mate on the Susan sir that is expected in every day Umph umph Take a glass of wine Capitola No sir I never touch a single drop Why Why Good wine after dinner my child is a good thing let me tell you Ah sir my life has shown me too much misery that has come of drinking wine Well well as you please Why where has the girl run off to exclaimed the old man breaking off and looking with amazement at Capitola who had suddenly started up and rushed out of the room In an instant she rushed in again exclaiming Oh he s come he s come I heard his voice Whose come you madcap inquired the old man Oh Herbert Greyson Herbert Greyson His ship is in and he has come here He always comes here most of the sea officers do exclaimed Cap dancing around until all her black ringlets flew up and down Then suddenly pausing she came quietly to his side and said solemnly Uncle Herbert has been at sea three years he knows nothing of my past misery and destitution nor of my ever wearing boy s clothes Uncle please don t tell him especially of the boy s clothes And in the earnestness of her appeal Capitola clasped her hands and raised her eyes to the old man s face How soft those gray eyes looked when praying But for all that the very spirit of mischief still lurked about the corners of the plump arched lips Of course I shall tell no one I am not so proud of your masquerading as to publish it And as for this young fellow I shall probably never see him exclaimed Old Hurricane CHAPTER VIII HERBERT GREYSON A kind true heart a spirit high That cannot fear and will not bow Is flashing in his manly eye And stamped upon his brow Halleck In a few minutes Capitola came bounding up the stairs again exclaiming joyously Here he is uncle Here is Herbert Greyson Come along Herbert you must come in and see my new uncle And she broke into the room dragging before her astonished guardian a handsome dark eyed young sailor who bowed and then stood blushing at his enforced intrusion I beg your pardon sir he said for bursting in upon you in this way but I dragged him here willy nilly said Capitola Still if I had had time to think I should not have intruded Oh say no more sir You are heartily welcome exclaimed the old man thrusting out his rugged hand and seizing the bronzed one of the youth Sit down sir sit down Good Lord how like he added mentally Then seeing the young sailor still standing blushing and hesitating he struck his cane upon the floor and roared out Demmy sit down sir When Ira Warfield says sit down he means sit down Ira Warfield exclaimed the young man starting back in astonishment one might almost say in consternation Ay sir Ira Warfield That s my name Never heard any ill of it did you The young man did not answer but continued gazing in amazement upon the speaker Nor any good of it either perhaps eh uncle archly put in Capitola Silence you monkey Well young man well what is the meaning of all this exclaimed old Hurricane impatiently Oh your pardon sir this was sudden But you must know I had once a relative of that name an uncle And have still Herbert and have still lad Come come boy I am not sentimental nor romantic nor melodramatic nor nothing of that sort I don t know how to strike an attitude and exclaim Come to my bosom sole remaining offspring of a dear departed sister or any of the like stage playing But I tell you lad that I like your looks and I like what I have heard of you from this girl and another old woman now dead and so But sit down sit down demmy sir sit down and we ll talk over the walnuts and the wine Capitola take your seat too ordered the old man throwing himself into his chair Herbert also drew his chair up Capitola resumed her seat saying to herself Well well I am determined not to be surprised at anything that happens being perfectly clear in my own mind that this is all nothing but a dream But how pleasant it is to dream that I have found a rich uncle and he has found a nephew and that nephew is Herbert Greyson I do believe that I had rather die in my sleep than wake from this dream Herbert said old Hurricane as soon as they were gathered around the table Herbert this is my ward Miss Black the daughter of a deceased friend Capitola this is the only son of my departed sister Hem m m We have had the pleasure of being acquainted with each other before said Cap pinching up her lip and looking demure But not of really knowing who each other was you monkey Herbert fill your glass Here s to our better acquaintance I thank you sir I never touch wine said the young man Never touch wine Here s another here s a young prig I don t believe you yes I do too Demmy sir if you never touch wine it s because you prefer brandy Waiter I thank you sir Order no brandy for me If I never use intoxicating liquors it is because I gave a promise to that effect to my dying mother Say no more say no more lad Drink water if you like It won t hurt you exclaimed the old man filling and quaffing a glass of champagne Then he said I quarreled with your mother Herbert for marrying a man that I hated yes hated Herbert for he differed with me about the tariff and the Trinity Oh how I hated him boy until he died And then I wondered in my soul as I wonder even now how I ever could have been so infuriated against a poor fellow now cold in his grave as I shall be in time I wrote to my sister and expressed my feelings but somehow or other Herbert we never came to a right understanding again She answered my letter affectionately enough but she refused to accept a home for herself and child under my roof saying that she thanked me for my offer but that the house which had been closed against her husband ought never to become the refuge of his widow After that we never corresponded and I have no doubt Herbert that she naturally enough taught you to dislike me Not so sir indeed you wrong her She might have been loyal to my father s memory without being resentful toward you She said that you had a noble nature but it was often obscured by violent passions On her dead bed she bade me should I ever meet you to say that she repented her refusal of your offered kindness And consented that it should be transferred to her orphan boy added Old Hurricane with the tears like raindrops in his stormy eyes No sir she said not so But yet she would not have disapproved a service offered to her son Uncle since you permit me to call you so I want nothing I have a good berth in the Susan and a kind friend in her captain You have all your dear mother s pride Herbert And all his uncle s put in Cap Hush Magpie But is the merchant service agreeable to you Herbert Not perfectly sir but one must be content Demmy sir my sister s son need not be content unless he has a mind to And if you prefer the navy No sir I like the navy even less than the merchant service Then what would suit you lad Come you have betrayed the fact that you are not altogether satisfied On the contrary sir I told you distinctly that I really wanted nothing and that I must be satisfied And I say demmy sir you sha n t be satisfied unless you like to Come if you don t like the navy what do you say to the army eh It is a proud aspiring profession sir said the young man as his face lighted up with enthusiasm Then demmy if you like the army sir you shall enter it Yes sir Demmy the administration confound them has not done me justice but they ll scarcely dare to refuse to send my nephew to West Point when I demand it To West Point exclaimed Herbert in delight Ay youngster to West Point I shall see to it when I pass through Washington on my way to Virginia We start in the early train to morrow morning In the meantime young man you take leave of your captain pack up your traps and join us You must go with me and make Hurricane Hall your home until you go to West Point Oh what a capital old governor our uncle is exclaimed Cap jumping up and clapping her hands Sir indeed you overwhelm me with this most unexpected kindness I do not know as yet how much of it I ought to accept But accident will make me whether or no your traveling companion for a great part of the way as I also start for Virginia to morrow to visit dear friends there whose house was always my mother s home and mine and who since my bereavement have been to me like a dear mother and brother I have not seen them for years and before I go anywhere else even to your kind roof I must go there said Herbert gravely And who are those dear friends of yours Hebert and where do they live If I can serve them they shall be rewarded for their kindness unto you my boy Oh sir yes you can indeed serve them They are a poor widow and her only son She has seen better days but now takes in sewing to support herself and boy When my mother was living during the last years of her life when she also was a poor widow with an only son they joined their slender means and took a house and lived together When my mother died leaving me a boy of ten years old this poor woman still sheltered and worked for me as for her own son until ashamed of being a burden to her I ran away and went to sea Noble woman I will make her fortune exclaimed Old Hurricane jumping up and walking up and down the floor Oh do sir Oh do dear uncle I don t wish you to expend either money or influence upon my fortunes but oh do educate Traverse He is such a gifted lad so intellectual Even his Sunday school teacher says that he is sure to work his way to distinction although now he is altogether dependent on his Sunday school for his learning Oh sir if you would only educate the son he d make a fortune for his mother Generous boy to plead for your friends rather than for yourself But I am strong enough thank God to help you all You shall go to West Point Your friend shall go to school and then to college said Old Hurricane with a burst of honest enthusiasm And where shall I go sir inquired Cap To the insane asylum you imp exclaimed the old man then turning to Herbert he continued Yes lad I will do as I say and as for the poor but noble hearted widow You ll marry her yourself as a reward won t you uncle asked the incorrigible Cap Perhaps I will you monkey if it is only to bring somebody home to keep you in order said Old Hurricane then turning again to Herbert he resumed As to the widow Herbert I will place her above want Over my head cried Cap And now Herbert I will trouble you to ring for coffee and after we have had that I think we had better separate and prepare for our journey to morrow Herbert obeyed and after the required refreshment had been served and partaken of the little circle broke up for the evening and soon after retired to rest Early the next morning after a hasty breakfast the three took their seats in the express train for Washington where they arrived upon the evening of the same day They put up for the night at Brown s and the next day Major Warfield leaving his party at their hotel called upon the President the Secretary of the Navy and other high official dignitaries and put affairs in such a train that he had little doubt of the ultimate appointment of his nephew to a cadetship at West Point The same evening wishing to avoid the stage route over the mountains he took with his party the night boat for Richmond where in due time they arrived and whence they took the valley line of coaches that passed through Tip Top which they reached upon the morning of the fourth day of their long journey Here they found Major Warfield s carriage waiting for him and here they were to separate Major Warfield and Capitola to turn off to Hurricane Hall and Herbert Greyson to keep on the route to the town of Staunton It was as the three sat in the parlor of the little hotel where the stage stopped to change horses that their adieus were made Remember Herbert that I am willing to go to the utmost extent of my power to benefit the good widow and her son who were so kind to my nephew in his need Remember that I hold it a sacred debt that I owe them Tell them so And mind Herbert I shall expect you back in a week at furthest I shall be punctual sir God bless you my dear uncle You have made me very happy in being the bearer of such glad tidings to the widow and the fatherless And now I hear the horn blowing good by uncle good by Capitola I am going to carry them great joy such great joy uncle as you who have everything you want can scarcely imagine And shaking hands heartily with his companions Herbert ran through the door and jumped aboard the coach just as the impatient driver was about to leave him behind As soon as the coach had rolled out of sight Major Warfield handed Capitola into his carriage that had long been waiting and took the seat by her side much to the scandalization of Wool who muttered to his horses There I told you so I said how he d go and bring home a young wife and behold he s gone and done it Uncle said Capitola as the carriage rolled lazily along uncle do you know you never once asked Herbert the name of the widow you are going to befriend and that he never told you By George that is true How strange Yet I did not seem to miss the name How did it ever happen Capitola Did he omit it on purpose do you think Why no uncle He boylike always spoke of them as Traverse and Traverse s mother and you like yourself called her nothing but the poor widow and the struggling mother and the noble woman and so on and her son as the boy the youth young Traverse Herbert s friend et cetera I for my part had some curiosity to see whether you and Herbert would go on talking of them forever without having to use their surnames And behold he even went away without naming them By George and so he did It was the strangest over sight But I ll write as soon as I get home and ask him No uncle just for the fun of the thing wait until he comes back and see how long it will be and how much he will talk of them without mentioning their names Ha ha ha So I will Cap so I will Besides whatever their names are it s nothing to me A rose by any other name would smell as sweet you know And if she is missus Tagfoot Waddle I shall still think so good a woman exalted as a Montmorencie Mind there Wool this road is getting rough Over it now marster said Wool after a few heavy jolts Over it now missus and de rest of de way is perfectly delightful Cap looked out of the window and saw before her a beautiful piece of scenery first just below them the wild mountain stream of the Demon s Run and beyond it the wild dell dented into the side of the mountain like the deep print of an enormous horse s hoof in the midst of which gleaming redly among its richly tinted autumn woods stood Hurricane Hall CHAPTER IX MARAH ROCKE There sits upon her matron face A tender and a thoughtful grace Though very still for great distress Hath left this patient mournfulness Beside an old rocky road leading from the town of Staunton out to the forest crowned hills beyond stood alone a little gray stone cottage in the midst of a garden inclosed by a low moldering stone wall A few gnarled and twisted fruit trees long past bearing stood around the house that their leafless branches could not be said to shade A little wooden gate led up an old paved walk to the front door on each side of which were large windows In this poor cottage remote from other neighbors dwelt the friends of Herbert Greyson the widow Rocke and her son Traverse No one knew who she was or whence or why she came Some fifteen years before she had appeared in town clothed in rusty mourning and accompanied by a boy of about two years of age She had rented that cottage furnished it poorly and had settled there supporting herself and child by needlework At the time that Doctor Greyson died and his widow and son were left perfectly destitute and it became necessary for missus Greyson to look out for a humble lodging where she could find the united advantages of cheapness cleanliness and pure air she was providentially led to inquire at the cottage of the widow Rocke whom she found only too glad to increase her meager income by letting half her little house to such unexceptionable tenants as the widow Greyson and her son And thus commenced between the two poor young women and the two boys an acquaintance that ripened into friendship and thence into that devoted love so seldom seen in this world Their households became united One fire one candle and one table served the little family and thus considerable expense was saved as well as much social comfort gained And when the lads grew too old to sleep with their mothers one bed held the two boys and the other accommodated the two women And despite toil want care the sorrow for the dead and the neglect of the living this was a loving contented and cheerful little household How much of their private history these women might have confided to each other was not known but it was certain that they continued fast friends up to the time of the death of missus Greyson after which the widow Rocke assumed a double burden and became a second mother to the orphan boy until Herbert himself ashamed of taxing her small means ran away as he had said and went to sea Every year had Herbert written to his kind foster mother and his dear brother as he called Traverse And at the end of every prosperous voyage when he had a little money he had sent them funds but not always did these letters or remittances reach the widow s cottage and long seasons of intense anxiety would be suffered by her for the fate of her sailor boy as she always called Herbert Only three times in all these years had Herbert found time and means to come down and see them and that was long ago It was many months over two years since they had even received a letter from him And now the poor widow and her son were almost tempted to think that their sailor boy had quite forsaken them It is near the close of a late autumnal evening that I shall introduce you reader into the interior of the widow s cottage You enter by the little wooden gate pass up the moldering paved walk between the old leafless lilac bushes and pass through the front door right into a large clean but poor looking sitting room and kitchen Everything was old though neatly and comfortably arranged about this room A faded home made carpet covered the floor a threadbare crimson curtain hung before the window a rickety walnut table dark with age sat under the window against the wall old walnut chairs were placed each side of it old plated candlesticks with the silver all worn off graced the mantelpiece a good fire a cheap comfort in that well wooded country blazed upon the hearth on the right side of the fireplace a few shelves contained some well worn books a flute a few minerals and other little treasures belonging to Traverse on the left hand there was a dresser containing the little delfware tea service and plates and dishes of the small family Before the fire with her knitting in her hand sat Marah Rocke watching the kettle as it hung singing over the blaze and the oven of biscuits that sat baking upon the hearth Marah Rocke was at this time about thirty five years of age and of a singularly refined and delicate aspect for one of her supposed rank her little form slight and flexible as that of a young girl was clothed in a poor but neat black dress relieved by a pure white collar around her throat her jet black hair was parted plainly over her low sweet brow brought down each side her thin cheeks and gathered into a bunch at the back of her shapely little head her face was oval with regular features and pale olive complexion serious lips closed in pensive thought and soft dark brown eyes full of tender affection and sorrowful memories and too often cast down in meditation beneath the heavy shadows of their long thick eyelashes completed the melancholy beauty of a countenance not often seen among the hard working children of toil Marah Rocke was a very hard working woman sewing all day long and knitting through the twilight and then again resuming her needle by candle light and sewing until midnight and yet Marah Rocke made but a poor and precarious living for herself and son Needlework so ill paid in large cities is even worse paid in the country towns and though the cottage hearth was never cold the widow s meals were often scant Lately her son Traverse who occasionally earned a trifle of money by doing with all his might whatever his hand could find to do had been engaged by a grocer in the town to deliver his goods to his customers during the illness of the regular porter for which as he was only a substitute he received the very moderate sum of twenty five cents a day This occupation took Traverse from home at daybreak in the morning and kept him absent until eight o clock at night Nevertheless the widow always gave him a hot breakfast before he went out in the morning and kept a comfortable supper waiting for him at night It was during this last social meal that the youth would tell his mother all that had occurred in his world outside the home that day and all that he expected to come to pass the next for Traverse was wonderfully hopeful and sanguine And after supper the evening was generally spent by Traverse in hard study beside his mother s sewing stand Upon this evening when the widow sat waiting for her son he seemed to be detained longer than usual She almost feared that the biscuits would be burned or if taken from the oven be cold before he would come to enjoy them but just as she had looked for the twentieth time at the little black walnut clock that stood between those old plated candlesticks on the mantelpiece the sound of quick light joyous footsteps was heard resounding along the stony street the gate was opened a hand laid upon the door latch and the next instant entered a youth some seventeen years of age clad in a home spun suit whose coarse material and clumsy make could not disguise his noble form or graceful air He was like his mother with the same oval face regular features and pale olive complexion with the same full serious lips the same dark tender brown eyes shaded by long black lashes and the same wavy jet black hair but there was a difference in the character of their faces where hers showed refinement and melancholy his exhibited strength and cheerfulness his loving brown eyes instead of drooping sadly under the shadow of their lashes looked you brightly and confidently full in the face and lastly his black hair curled crisply around a broad high forehead royal with intellect Such was the boy that entered the room and came joyously forward to his mother clasping his arm around her neck saluting her on both cheeks and then laughingly claiming his childish privilege of kissing the pretty little black mole on her throat Will you never have outgrown your babyhood Traverse asked his mother smiling at his affectionate ardor Yes dear little mother in everything but the privilege of fondling you that feature of babyhood I never shall outgrow exclaimed the youth kissing her again with all the ardor of his true and affectionate heart and starting up to help her set the table He dragged the table out from under the window spread the cloth and placed the cups and saucers upon it while his mother took the biscuits from the oven and made the tea so that in ten minutes from the moment in which he entered the room mother and son were seated at their frugal supper I suppose to morrow being Saturday you will have to get up earlier than usual to go to the store said his mother No ma am replied the boy looking up brightly as if he were telling a piece of good news I am not wanted any longer mister Spicer s own man has got well again and returned to work So you are discharged said missus Rocke sadly Yes ma am but just think how fortunate that is for I shall have a chance to morrow of mending the fence and nailing up the gate and sawing wood enough to last you a week besides doing all the other little odd jobs that have been waiting for me so long and then on Monday I shall get more work I wish I were sure of it said the widow whose hopes had long since been too deeply crushed to permit her ever to be sanguine When their supper was over and the humble service cleared away the youth took his books and applied himself to study on the opposite side of the table at which his mother sat busied with her needlework And there fell a perfect silence between them The widow s mind was anxious and her heart heavy many cares never communicated to cloud the bright sunshine of her boy s soul oppressed hers The rent had fallen fearfully behindhand and the landlord threatened unless the money could be raised to pay him to seize their furniture and eject them from the premises And how this money was to be raised she could not see at all True this meek Christian had often in her sad experience proved God s special providence at her utmost need and now she believed in His ultimate interference but in what manner He would now interpose she could not imagine and her faith grew dim and her hope dark and her love cold While she was revolving these sad thoughts in her mind Traverse suddenly thrust aside his books and with a deep sigh turned to his mother and said Mother what do you think has ever become of Herbert I do not know I dread to conjecture It has now been nearly three years since we heard from him exclaimed the widow with the tears welling up in her brown eyes You think he has been lost at sea mother but I don t I simply think his letters have been lost And somehow to night I can t fix my mind on my lesson or keep it off Herbert He is running in my head all the time If I were fanciful now I should believe that Herbert was dead and his spirit was about me Good heavens mother whose step is that suddenly exclaimed the youth starting up and assuming an attitude of intense listening as a firm and ringing step attended by a peculiar whistling approached up the street and entered the gate It is Herbert it is Herbert cried Traverse starting across the room and tearing open the door with a suddenness that threw the entering guest forward upon his own bosom but his arms were soon around the newcomer clasping him closely there while he breathlessly exclaimed Oh Herbert I am so glad to see you Oh Herbert why didn t you come or write all this long time Oh Herbert how long have you been ashore I was just talking about you Dear fellow dear fellow I have come to make you glad at last and to repay all your great kindness but now let me speak to my second mother said Herbert returning Traverse s embrace and then gently extricating himself and going to where missus Rocke stood up pale trembling and incredulous she had not yet recovered from the great shock of his unexpected appearance Dear mother won t you welcome me asked Herbert going up to her His words dissolved the spell that bound her Throwing her arms around his neck and bursting into tears she exclaimed Oh my son my son my sailor boy my other child how glad I am to have you back once more Welcome To be sure you are welcome Is my own circulating blood welcome back to my heart But sit you down and rest by the fire I will get your supper directly Sweet mother do not take the trouble I supped twenty miles back where the stage stopped And will you take nothing at all Nothing dear mother but your kind hand to kiss again and again said the youth pressing that hand to his lips and then allowing the widow to put him into a chair right in front of the fire Traverse sat on one side of him and his mother on the other each holding a hand of his and gazing on him with mingled incredulity surprise and delight as if indeed they could not realize his presence except by devouring him with their eyes And for the next half hour all their talk was as wild and incoherent as the conversation of long parted friends suddenly brought together is apt to be It was all made up of hasty questions hurried one upon another so as to leave but little chance to have any of them answered and wild exclamations and disjointed sketches of travel interrupted by frequent ejaculations yet through all the widow and her son perhaps through the quickness of their love as well as of their intellect managed to get some knowledge of the past three years of their sailor boy s life and adventures and they entirely vindicated his constancy when they learned how frequently and regularly he had written though they had never received his letters And now said Herbert looking from side to side from mother to son I have told you all my adventures I am dying to tell you something that concerns yourselves That concerns us exclaimed mother and son in a breath Yes ma am yes sir that concerns you both eminently But first of all let me ask how you are getting on at the present time Oh as usual said the widow smiling for she did not wish to dampen the spirits of her sailor boy as usual of course Traverse has not been able to accomplish his darling purpose of entering the Seminary yet but But I m getting on quite well with my education for all that interrupted Traverse for I belong to doctor Day s Bible class in the Sabbath school which is a class of young men you know and the doctor is so good as to think that I have some mental gifts worth cultivating so he does not confine his instructions to me to the Bible class alone but permits me to come to him in his library at Willow Heights for an hour twice a week when he examines me in Latin and algebra and sets me new exercises which I study and write out at night so that you see I am doing very well Indeed the doctor who is a great scholar and one of the trustees and examiners of the Seminary says that he does not know any young man there with all the advantages of the institution around him who is getting along so fast as Traverse is with all the difficulties he has to encounter The doctor says it is all because Traverse is profoundly in earnest and that one of these days he will be There mother don t repeat all the doctor s kind speeches He only says such things to encourage a poor boy in the pursuit of knowledge under difficulties said Traverse blushing and laughing Will be an honor to his kindred country and race said Herbert finishing the widow s incomplete quotation It was something like that indeed she said nodding and smiling You do me proud said Traverse touching his forelock with comic gravity But inquired he suddenly changing his tone and becoming serious was it not is it not noble in the doctor to give up an hour of his precious time twice a week for no other cause than to help a poor struggling fellow like me up the ladder of learning I should think it was But he is not the first noble heart I ever heard of said Herbert with an affectionate glance that directed the compliment Nor is his the last that you will meet with I must tell you the good news now Oh tell it tell it Have you got a ship of your own Herbert No nor is it about myself that I am anxious to tell you missus Rocke you may have heard that I had a rich uncle whom I had never seen because from the time of my dear mother s marriage to that of her death she and her brother this very uncle had been estranged Yes said the widow speaking in a very low tone and bending her head over her work yes I have heard so but your mother and myself seldom alluded to the subject Exactly mother never was fond of talking of him Well when I came ashore and went as usual up to the old Washington House who should I meet with all of a sudden but this rich uncle He had come to New York to claim a little girl whom I happened to know and who happened to recognize me and name me to him Well I knew him only by his name but he knew me both by my name and by my likeness to his sister and received me with wonderful kindness offered me a home under his roof and promised to get for me an appointment to West Point Are you not glad say are you not glad he exclaimed jocosely clapping his hand upon Traverse s knee and then turning around and looking at his mother Oh yes indeed I am very glad Herbert exclaimed Traverse heartily grasping and squeezing his friend s hand Yes yes I am indeed sincerely glad of your good fortune dear boy said the widow but her voice was very faint and her head bent still lower over her work Ha ha ha I knew you d be glad for me but now I require you to be glad for yourselves Now listen When I told my honest old uncle for he is honest with all his eccentricities when I told him of what friends you had been to me Oh no you did not you did not mention us to him cried the widow suddenly starting up and clasping her hands together while she gazed in an agony of entreaty into the face of the speaker Why not Why in the world not Was there anything improper in doing so inquired Herbert in astonishment while Traverse himself gazed in amazement at the excessive and unaccountable agitation of his mother Why mother Why shouldn t he have mentioned us Was there anything strange or wrong in that inquired Traverse No oh no certainly not I forgot it was so sudden said the widow sinking back in her chair and struggling for self control Why mother what in the world is the meaning of this asked her son Nothing nothing boy only we are poor folks and should not be forced upon the attention of a wealthy gentleman she said with a cold unnatural smile putting her hand to her brow and striving to gain composure Then as Herbert continued silent and amazed she said to him Go on go on you were saying something about my about Major Warfield s kindness to you go on And she took up her work and tried to sew but she was as pale as death and trembling all over at the same time that every nerve was acute with attention to catch every word that might fall from the lips of Herbert Well recommenced the young sailor I was just saying that when I mentioned you and Traverse to my uncle and told him how kind and disinterested you had been to me you being like a mother and Traverse like a brother he was really moved almost to tears Yes I declare I saw the raindrops glittering in his tempestuous old orbs as he walked the floor muttering to himself Poor women good excellent woman While Herbert spoke the widow dropped her work without seeming to know that she had done so her fingers twitched so nervously that she had to hold both hands clasped together and her eyes were fixed in intense anxiety upon the face of the youth as she repeated Go on oh go on What more did he say when you talked of us He said everything that was kind and good He said that he could not do too much to compensate you for the past Oh did he say that exclaimed the widow breathlessly Yes and a great deal more that all that he could do for you or your son was but a sacred debt he owed you Oh he acknowledged it he acknowledged it Thank Heaven oh thank Heaven Go on Herbert go on He said that he would in future take the whole charge of the boy s advancement in life and that he would place you above want forever that he would in fact compensate for the past by doing you and yours full justice Thank Heaven oh thank Heaven exclaimed the widow no longer concealing her agitation but throwing down her work and starting up and pacing the floor in excess of joy Mother said Traverse uneasily going to her and taking her hand mother what is the meaning of all this Do come and sit down She immediately turned and walked back to the fire and resting her hands upon the back of the chair bent upon them a face radiant with youthful beauty Her cheeks were brightly flushed her eyes were sparkling with light her whole countenance resplendent with joy she scarcely seemed twenty years of age Mother tell us what it is pleaded Traverse who feared for her sanity Oh boys I am so happy At last at last after eighteen years of patient hoping against hope I shall go mad with joy Mother said Herbert softly Children I am not crazy I know what I am saying though I did not intend to say it And you shall know too But first I must ask Herbert another question Herbert are you very sure that he Major Warfield knew who we were Yes indeed didn t I tell him all about you your troubles your struggles your disinterestedness and all your history since ever I knew you answered Herbert who was totally unconscious that he had left Major Warfield in ignorance of one very important fact her surname Then you are sure he knew who he was talking about Of course he did He could not have failed to do so indeed But Herbert did he mention any other important fact that you have not yet communicated to us No ma am Did he allude to any previous acquaintance with us No ma am unless it might have been in the words I repeated to you there was nothing else except that he bade me hurry to you and make you glad with his message and return as soon as possible to let him know whether you accept his offers Accept them accept them Of course I do I have waited for them for years Oh children you gaze on me as if you thought me mad I am not so nor can I now explain myself for since he has not chosen to be confidential with Herbert I cannot be so prematurely but you will know all when Herbert shall have borne back my message to Major Warfield It was indeed a mad evening in the cottage And even when the little family had separated and retired to bed the two youths lying together as formerly could not sleep for talking while the widow on her lonely couch lay awake for joy CHAPTER X THE ROOM OF THE TRAP DOOR If you have hitherto concealed this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsoever else doth hap to night Give it an understanding but no tongue Shakespeare Capitola meanwhile in the care of the major arrived at Hurricane Hall much to the discomfiture of good missus Condiment who was quite unprepared to expect the new inmate and when Major Warfield said missus Condiment this is your young lady take her up to the best bedroom where she can take off her bonnet and shawl the worthy dame thinking secretly The old fool has gone and married a young wife sure enough a mere chit of a child made a very deep curtsy and a very queer cough and said I am mortified madam at the fire not being made in the best bedroom but then I was not warned of your coming madam Madam Is the old woman crazed This child is no madam She is Miss Black my ward the daughter of a deceased friend sharply exclaimed Old Hurricane Excuse me miss I did not know I was unprepared to receive a young lady Shall I attend you Miss Black said the old lady in a mollified tone If you please said Capitola who arose to follow her Not expecting you miss I have no proper room prepared most of them are not furnished and in some the chimneys are foul indeed the only tolerable room I can put you in is the room with the trap door if you would not object to it said missus Condiment as with a candle in her hand she preceded Capitola along the gloomy hall and then opened a door that led into a narrow passage A room with a trap door That s a curious thing but why should I object to it I don t at all I think I should rather like it said Capitola I will show it to you and tell you about it and then if you like it well and good If not I shall have to put you in a room that leaks and has swallows nests in the chimney answered missus Condiment as she led the way along the narrow passages and up and down dark back stairs and through bare and deserted rooms and along other passages until she reached a remote chamber opened the door and invited her guest to enter It was a large shadowy room through which the single candle shed such a faint uncertain light that at first Capitola could see nothing but black masses looming through the darkness But when missus Condiment advanced and set the candle upon the chimney piece and Capitola s sight accommodated itself to the scene she saw that upon the right of the chimney piece stood a tall tester bedstead curtained with very dark crimson serge on the left hand thick curtains of the same color draped the two windows Between the windows directly opposite the bed stood a dark mahogany dressing bureau with a large looking glass a washstand in the left hand corner of the chimney piece and a rocking chair and two plain chairs completed the furniture of this room that I am particular in describing as upon the simple accident of its arrangement depended upon two occasions the life and honor of its occupant There was no carpet on the floor with the exception of a large old Turkey rug that was laid before the fireplace Here my dear this room is perfectly dry and comfortable and we always keep kindlings built up in the fireplace ready to light in case a guest should come said missus Condiment applying a match to the waste paper under the pine knots and logs that filled the chimney Soon there arose a cheerful blaze that lighted up all the room glowing on the crimson serge bed curtains and window curtains and flashing upon the large looking glass between them There my dear sit down and make yourself comfortable said missus Condiment drawing up the rocking chair Capitola threw herself into it and looked around and around the room and then into the face of the old lady saying But what about the trap door I see no trap door Ah yes look said missus Condiment lifting up the rug and revealing a large drop some four feet square that was kept up in its place by a short iron bolt Now my dear take care of yourself for this bolt slides very easily and if while you happened to be walking across this place you were to push the bolt back the trap door would drop and you fall down heaven knows where Is there a cellar under there inquired Capitola gazing with interest upon the door Lord knows child I don t I did once make one of the nigger men let it down so I could look in it but Lord child I saw nothing but a great black deep vacuity without bottom or sides It put such a horror over me that I have never looked down there since and never want to I m sure Ugh for goodness sake what was the horrid thing made for ejaculated Capitola gazing as if fascinated by the trap The Lord only knows my dear for it was made long before ever the house came into the major s family But they do say whispered missus Condiment mysteriously Ah what do they say asked Capitola eagerly throwing off her bonnet and shawl and settling herself to hear some thrilling explanation missus Condiment slowly replaced the rug drew another chair to the side of the young girl and said They do say it was a trap for Indians A trap for Indians Yes my dear You must know that this room belongs to the oldest part of the house It was all built as far back as the old French and Indian war but this room belonged to the part that dates back to the first settlement of the country Then I shall like it better than any room in the house for I dote on old places with stories to them Go on please Yes my dear Well first of all this place was a part of the grant of land given to the Le Noirs And the first owner old Henri Le Noir was said to be one of the grandest villains that ever was heard of Well you see he lived out here in his hunting lodge which is this part of the house Oh my then this very room was a part of the old pioneer hunter s lodge Yes my dear and they do say that he had this place made as a trap for the Indians You see they say he was on terms of friendship with the Succapoos a little tribe of Indians that was nearly wasted away though among the few that was left there were several braves Well he wanted to buy a certain large tract of land from this tribe and they were all willing to sell it except those half a dozen warriors who wanted it for camping ground So what does this awful villain do but lay a snare for them He makes a great feast in his lodge and invites his red brothers to come to it and they come Then he proposes that they stand upon his blanket and all swear eternal brotherhood which he made the poor souls believe was the right way to do it Then when they all six stood close together as they could stand with hands held up touching above their heads all of a sudden the black villain sprung the bolt the trap fell and the six men went down down the Lord knows where Oh that is horrible horrible cried Capitola but where do you think they fell to I tell you the Lord only knows They say that it is a bottomless abyss with no outlet but one crooked one miles long that reaches to the Demon s Punch Bowl But if there is a bottom to that abyss that bottom is strewn with human bones Oh horrible most horrible exclaimed Capitola Perhaps you are afraid to sleep here by yourself If so there s the damp room Oh no oh no I am not afraid I have been in too much deadly peril from the living ever to fear the dead No I like the room with its strange legend but tell me did that human devil escape without punishment from the tribe of the murdered victims Lord child how were they to know of what was done There wasn t a man left to tell the tale Besides the tribe was now brought down to a few old men women and children So when he showed a bill of sale for the land he wanted signed by the six braves their marks in six blood red arrows there was none to contradict him How was his villainy found out Well it was said he married had a family and prospered for a long while but that the poor Succapoos always suspected him and bore a long grudge and that when the sons of the murdered warriors grew up to be powerful braves one night they set upon the house and massacred the whole family except the eldest son a lad of ten who escaped and ran away and gave the alarm to the block house where there were soldiers stationed It is said that after killing and scalping father mother and children the savages threw the dead bodies down that trap door And they had just set fire to the house and were dancing their wild dance around it when the soldiers arrived and dispersed the party and put out the fire Oh what bloody bloody days Yes my dear and as I told you before if that horrible pit has any bottom that bottom is strewn with human skeletons It is an awful thought As I said my dear if you feel at all afraid you can have another room Afraid What of Those skeletons supposing them to be there cannot hurt me I am not afraid of the dead I only dread the living and not them much either said Capitola Well my dear you will want a waiting woman anyhow and I think I will send Pitapat to wait on you she can sleep on a pallet in your room and be some company And who is Pitapat missus Condiment Pitapat Lord child she is the youngest of the housemaids I ve called her Pitapat ever since she was a little one beginning to walk when she used to steal away from her mother Dorcas the cook and I would hear her little feet coming pit a pat pit a pat up the dark stairs up to my room As it was often the only sound to be heard in the still house I grew to call my little visitor Pitapat Then let me have Pitapat by all means I like company especially company that I can send away when I choose Very well my dear and now I think you d better smooth your hair and come down with me to tea for it is full time and the major as you may know is not the most patient of men Capitola took a brush from her traveling bag hastily arranged her black ringlets and announced herself ready They left the room and traversed the same labyrinth of passages stairs empty rooms and halls back to the dining room where a comfortable fire burned and a substantial supper was spread Old Hurricane took Capitola s hand with a hearty grasp and placed her in a chair at the side and then took his own seat at the foot of the table missus Condiment sat at the head and poured out the tea Uncle said Capitola suddenly what is under the trap door in my room What Have they put you in that room exclaimed the old man hastily looking up There was no other one prepared sir said the housekeeper Besides I like it very well uncle said Capitola Humph humph humph grunted the old man only half satisfied But uncle what is under the trap door persisted Capitola what s under it Oh I don t know an old cave that was once used as a dry cellar until an underground stream broke through and made it too damp so it is said I never explored it But uncle what about the Here missus Condiment stretched out her foot and trod upon the toes of Capitola so sharply that it made her stop short while she dexterously changed the conversation by asking the major if he would not send Wool to Tip Top in the morning for another bag of coffee Soon after supper was over Capitola saying that she was tired bade her uncle good night and attended by her little black maid Pitapat whom missus Condiment had called up for the purpose retired to her distant chamber There were already collected here three trunks which the liberality of her uncle had filled As soon as she had got in and locked the door she detached one of the strongest straps from her largest trunk and then turned up the rug and secured the end of the strap to the ring in the trap door Then she withdrew the bolt and holding on to one end of the strap gently lowered the trap and kneeling gazed down into an awful black void without boundaries without sight without sounds except a deep faint subterranean roaring as of water Bring the light Pitapat and hold it over this place and take care you don t fall in said Capitola Come as I ve got a pit in my name and you ve got a pit in yours we ll see if we can t make something of this third pit Deed I se fraid Miss said the poor little darkey Afraid What of Ghoses Nonsense I ll agree to lay every ghost you see The little maid approached candle in hand but in such a gingerly sort of way that Capitola seized the light from her hand and stooping held it down as far as she could reach and gazed once more into the abyss But this only made the horrible darkness visible no object caught or reflected a single ray of light all was black hollow void and silent except the faint deep distant roaring as of subterraneous water Capitola pushed the light as far down as she could possibly reach and then yielding to a strange fascination dropped it into the abyss It went down down down down into the darkness until far below it glimmered out of sight Then with an awful shudder Capitola pulled up and fastened the trap door laid down the rug and said her prayers and went to bed by the firelight with little Pitapat sleeping on a pallet The last thought of Cap before falling to sleep was It is awful to go to bed over such a horrible mystery but I will be a hero CHAPTER XI A MYSTERY AND A STORM AT HURRICANE HALL Bid her address her prayers to Heaven Learn if she there may be forgiven Its mercy may absolve her yet But here upon this earth beneath There is no spot where she and I Together for an hour could breathe Byron Early the next morning Capitola arose made her toilet and went out to explore the outer walls of her part of the old house to discover if possible some external entrance into the unknown cavity under her room It was a bright cheerful healthy autumnal morning well adapted to dispel all clouds of mystery and superstition Heaps of crimson and golden hued leaves glimmering with hoar frost lay drifted against the old walls and when these were brushed away by the busy hands of the young girl they revealed nothing but the old moldering foundation not a vestige of a cellar door or window was visible Capitola abandoned the fruitless search and turned to go into the house And saying to herself I ll think no more of it I dare say after all it is nothing but a very dark cellar without window and with a well and the story of the murders and of the skeletons is all moonshine she ran into the dining room and took her seat at the breakfast table Old Hurricane was just then storming away at his factotum Wool for some misdemeanor the nature of which Capitola did not hear for upon her appearance he suffered his wrath to subside in a few reverberating low thunders gave his ward a grumphy Good morning and sat down to his breakfast After breakfast Old Hurricane took his great coat and old cocked hat and stormed forth upon the plantation to blow up his lazy overseer mister Will Ezy and his idle negroes who had loitered or frolicked away all the days of their master s absence missus Condiment went away to mix a plum pudding for dinner and Cap was left alone After wandering through the lower rooms of the house the stately old fashioned drawing room the family parlor the dining room et cetera Cap found her way through all the narrow back passages and steep little staircases back to her own chamber The chamber looked quite different by daylight the cheerful wood fire burning in the chimney right before her opposite the door by which she entered the crimson draped windows with the rich old mahogany bureau and dressing glass standing between them on her left the polished dark oak floor the comfortable rocking chair the new work stand placed there for her use that morning and her own well filled trunks standing in the corners looked altogether too cheerful to associate with dark thoughts Besides Capitola had not the least particle of gloom superstition or marvelousness in her disposition She loved old houses and old legends well enough to enjoy them but was not sufficiently credulous to believe or cowardly to fear them She had besides a pleasant morning s occupation before her in unpacking her three trunks and arranging her wardrobe and her possessions which were all upon the most liberal scale for Major Warfield at every city where they had stopped had given his poor little protegee a virtual carte blanche for purchases having said to her Capitola I m an old bachelor I ve not the least idea what a young girl requires all I know is that you have nothing but your clothes and must want sewing and knitting needles and brushes and scissors and combs and boxes and smelling bottles and tooth powder and such So come along with me to one of those Vanity Fairs they call fancy stores and get what you want I ll foot the bill And Capitola who firmly believed that she had the most sacred of claims upon Major Warfield whose resources she also supposed to be unlimited did not fail to indulge her taste for rich and costly toys and supplied herself with a large ivory dressing case lined with velvet and furnished with ivory handled combs and brushes silver boxes and crystal bottles a papier mache work box with gold thimble needle case and perforator and gold mounted scissors and winders and an ebony writing desk with silver mounted crystal standishes each of these boxes and desk was filled with all things requisite in the several departments And now as Capitola unpacked them and arranged them upon the top of her bureau it was with no small degree of appreciation The rest of the forenoon was spent in arranging the best articles of her wardrobe in her bureau drawers Having locked the remainder in her trunks and carefully smoothed her hair and dressed herself in a brown merino she went down stairs and sought out missus Condiment whom she found in the housekeeper s little room and to whom she said Now missus Condiment if uncle has any needlework wanted to be done any buttons to be sewed on or anything of that kind just let me have it I ve got a beautiful work box and I m just dying to use it My dear Miss Black Please to call me Capitola or even Cap I never was called Miss Black in my life until I came here and I don t like it at all Well then my dear Miss Cap I wish you would wait till to morrow for I just came in here in a great hurry to get a glass of brandy out of the cupboard to put in the sauce for the plum pudding as dinner will be on the table in ten minutes With a shrug of her little shoulders Capitola left the housekeeper s room and hurried through the central front hall and out at the front door to look about and breathe the fresh air for a while As she stepped upon the front piazza she saw Major Warfield walking up the steep lawn followed by Wool leading a pretty mottled iron gray pony with a side saddle on his back Ah I m glad you re down Cap Come look at this pretty pony he is good for nothing as a working horse and is too light to carry my weight and so I intend to give him to you You must learn to ride said the old man coming up the steps Give him to me I learn to ride Oh uncle Oh uncle I shall go perfectly crazy with joy exclaimed Cap dancing and clapping her hands with delight Oh well a tumble or two in learning will bring you back to your senses I reckon Oh uncle oh uncle When shall I begin You shall take your first tumble immediately after dinner when being well filled you will not be so brittle and apt to break in falling Oh uncle I shall not fall I feel I shan t I feel I ve a natural gift for holding on Come come get in get in I want my dinner said Old Hurricane driving his ward in before him to the dining room where the dinner was smoking upon the table After dinner Cap with Wool for a riding master took her first lesson in equestrianism She had the four great requisites for forming a good rider a well adapted figure a fondness for the exercise perfect fearlessness and presence of mind She was not once in danger of losing her seat and during that single afternoon s exercise she made considerable progress in learning to manage her steed Old Hurricane whom the genial autumn afternoon had tempted out to smoke his pipe in his armchair on the porch was a pleased spectator of her performances and expressed his opinion that in time she would become the best rider in the neighborhood and that she should have the best riding dress and cap that could be made at Tip Top Just now in lack of an equestrian dress poor Cap was parading around the lawn with her head bare and her hair flying and her merino skirt exhibiting more ankles than grace It was while Old Hurricane still sat smoking his pipe and making his comments and Capitola still ambled around and around the lawn that a horseman suddenly appeared galloping as fast as the steep nature of the ground would admit up toward the house and before they could form an idea who he was the horse was at the block and the rider dismounted and standing before Major Warfield Why Herbert my boy back so soon We didn t expect you for a week to come This is sudden indeed So much the better so much the better Glad to see you lad exclaimed Old Hurricane getting up and heartily shaking the hand of his nephew Capitola came ambling up and in the effort to spring nimbly from her saddle tumbled off much to the delight of Wool who grinned from ear to ear and of Old Hurricane who with an I said so burst into a roar of laughter Herbert Greyson sprang to assist her but before he reached the spot Cap had picked herself up straightened her disordered dress and now she ran to meet and shake hands with him There was such a sparkle of joy and glow of affection in the meeting between these two that Old Hurricane who saw it suddenly hushed his laugh and grunted to himself Humph humph humph I like that that s better than I could have planned myself let that go on and then Gabe Le Noir we ll see under what name and head the old divided manor will be held Before his mental soliloquy was concluded Herbert and Capitola came up to him He welcomed Herbert again with great cordiality and then called to his man to put up the horses and bade the young people to follow him into the house as the air was getting chilly And how did you find your good friends lad inquired Old Hurricane when they had reached the sitting parlor Oh very well sir and very grateful for your offered kindness and indeed so anxious to express their gratitude that that I shortened my visit and came away immediately to tell you Right lad right You come by the down coach Yes sir and got off at Tip Top where I hired a horse to bring me here I must ask you to let one of your men take him back to mister Merry at the Antler s Inn to morrow Surely surely lad Wool shall do it And so Herbert the poor woman was delighted at the prospect of better times said Old Hurricane with a little glow of benevolent self satisfaction Oh yes sir delighted beyond all measure Poor thing poor thing See young folks how easy it is for the wealthy by sparing a little of their superfluous means to make the poor and virtuous happy And the boy Herbert the boy Oh sir delighted for himself but still more delighted for his mother for her joy was such as to astonish and even alarm me Before that I had thought Marah Rocke a proud woman but What say that again exclaimed Major Warfield I say that I thought she was a proud woman but Thought who was a proud woman sir roared Old Hurricane Marah Rocke replied the young man with wonder Major Warfield started up seized the chair upon which he had sat and struck it upon the ground with such force as to shatter it to pieces then turning he strode up and down the floor with such violence that the two young people gazed after him in consternation and fearful expectancy Presently he turned suddenly strode up to Herbert Greyson and stood before him His face was purple his veins swollen and they stood out upon his forehead like cords his eyes were protruded and glaring his mouth clenched until the grizzly gray mustache and beard were drawn in his whole huge frame was quivering from head to foot It was impossible to tell what passion whether rage grief or shame the most possessed him for all three seemed tearing his giant frame to pieces For an instant he stood speechless and Herbert feared that he would fall into a fit but the old giant was too strong for that For one short moment he stood thus and in a terrible voice he asked Young man did you did you know the shame that you dashed into my face with the name of that woman Sir I know nothing but that she is the best and dearest of her sex exclaimed Herbert beyond all measure amazed at what he heard and saw Best and dearest thundered the old man Oh idiot is she still a siren and are you a dupe But that cannot be No sir it is I whom you both would dupe Ah I see it all now This is why you artfully concealed her name from me until you had won my promise It shall not serve either you or her sir I break my promise thus bending and snapping his own cane and flinging the fragments behind his back There sir when you can make those ends of dry cedar grow together again and bear green leaves you may hope to reconcile Ira Warfield and Marah Rocke I break my promise sir as she broke The old man suddenly sank back into the nearest chair dropped his shaggy head and face into his hands and remained trembling from head to foot while the convulsive heaving of his chest and the rising and falling of his huge shoulders betrayed that his heart was nearly bursting with such suppressed sobs as only can be forced from manhood by the fiercest anguish The young people looked on in wonder awe and pity and then their eyes met those of Herbert silently inquired What can all this mean Those of Capitola mutely answered Heaven only knows In his deep pity for the old man s terrible anguish Herbert could feel no shame or resentment for the false accusation made upon himself Indeed his noble and candid nature easily explained all as the ravings of some heartrending remembrance Waiting therefore until the violent convulsions of the old man s frame had somewhat subsided Herbert went to him and with a low and respectful inflection of voice said Uncle if you think that there was any collusion between myself and missus Rocke you wrong us both You will remember that when I met you in New York I had not seen or heard from her for years nor had I then any expectation of ever seeing you The subject of the poor widow came up between us accidentally and if it is true that I omitted to call her by name it must have been because we both then felt too tenderly by her to call her anything else but the poor widow the poor mother the good woman and so on and all this she is still The old man without raising his head held out one hand to his nephew saying in a voice still trembling with emotion Herbert I wronged you forgive me Herbert took and pressed that rugged and hairy old hand to his lips and said Uncle I do not in the least know what is the cause of your present emotion but Emotion Demmy sir what do you mean by emotion Am I a man to give way to emotion Demmy sir mind what you say roared the old lion getting up and shaking himself free of all weaknesses I merely meant to say sir that if I could possibly be of any service to you I am entirely at your orders Then go back to that woman and tell her never to dare to utter or even to think of my name again if she values her life Sir you do not mean it and as for missus Rocke she is a good woman I feel it my duty to uphold Good ugh ugh ugh I ll command myself I ll not give way again Good ah lad it is quite plain to me now that you are an innocent dupe Tell me now for instance do you know anything of that woman s life before she came to reside at Staunton Nothing but from what I ve seen of her since I m sure she always was good Did she never mention her former life at all Never but mind I hold to my faith in her and would stake my salvation on her integrity said Herbert warmly Then you d lose it lad that s all but I have an explanation to make to you Herbert You must give me a minute or two of your company alone in the library before tea And so saying Major Warfield arose and led the way across the hall to the library that was immediately back of the back drawing room Throwing himself into a leathern chair beside the writing table he motioned for his companion to take the one on the opposite side A low fire smoldering on the hearth before them so dimly lighted the room that the young man arose again to pull the bell rope but the other interrupted with No you need not ring for lights Herbert my story is one that should be told in the dark Listen lad but drop your eyes the while I am all attention sir Herbert the poet says that At thirty man suspects himself a fool Knows it at forty and reforms his rule But boy at the ripe age of forty five I succeeded in achieving the most sublime folly of my life I should have taken a degree in madness and been raised to a professor s chair in some college of lunacy Herbert at the age of forty five I fell in love with and married a girl of sixteen out of a log cabin merely forsooth because she had a pearly skin like the leaf of the white japonica soft gray eyes like a timid fawn s and a voice like a cooing turtle dove s because those delicate cheeks flushed and those soft eyes fell when I spoke to her and the cooing voice trembled when she replied because the delicate face brightened when I came and faded when I turned away because She wept with delight when I gave her a smile And trembled with fear at my frown et cetera because she adored me as a sort of god I loved her as an angel and married her married her secretly for fear of the ridicule of my brother officers put her in a pastoral log cabin in the woods below the block house and visited her there by stealth like Numa did his nymph in the cave But I was watched my hidden treasure was discovered and coveted by a younger and prettier follow than myself Perdition I cannot tell this story in detail One night I came home very late and quite unexpectedly and found this man in my wife s cabin I broke the man s head and ribs and left him for dead I tore the woman out of my heart and cauterized its bleeding wounds This man was Gabriel Le Noir Satan burn him forever This woman was Marah Rocke God forgive her I could have divorced the woman but as I did not dream of ever marrying again I did not care to drag my shame before a public tribunal There You know all Let the subject sink forever said Old Hurricane wiping great drops of sweat from his laboring brows Uncle I have heard your story and believe you of course But I am bound to tell you that without even having heard your poor wife s defense I believe and uphold her to be innocent I think you have been as grossly deceived as she has been fearfully wronged and that time and Providence will prove this exclaimed Herbert fervently A horrible laugh of scorn was his only answer as Old Hurricane arose shook himself and led the way back to the parlor CHAPTER XII MARAH S DREAM And now her narrow kitchen walls Stretched away into stately halls The weary wheel to a spinnet turned The tallow candle an astral burned A manly form at her side she saw And joy was duty and love was law Whittier On the same Saturday morning that Herbert Greyson hurried away from his friend s cottage to travel post to Hurricane Hall for the sole purpose of accelerating the coming of her good fortune Marah Rocke walked about the house with a step so light with eyes so bright and cheeks so blooming that one might have thought that years had rolled backward in their course and made her a young girl again Traverse gazed upon her in delight Reversing the words of the text he said We must call you no longer Marah which is bitter but we must call you Naomi which is beautiful mother Young flatterer she answered smiling and slightly flushing But tell me truly Traverse am I very much faded Have care and toil and grief made me look old You old exclaimed the boy running his eyes over her beaming face and graceful form with a look of non comprehension that might have satisfied her but did not for she immediately repeated Yes do I look old Indeed I do not ask from vanity child Ah it little becomes me to be vain but I do wish to look well in some one s eyes I wish there was a looking glass in the house mother that it might tell you you should be called Naomi instead of Marah Ah that is just what he used to say to me in the old happy time the time in Paradise before the serpent entered What he mother Your father boy of course That was the first time she had ever mentioned his father to her son and now she spoke of him with such a flush of joy and hope that even while her words referred darkly to the past her eyes looked brightly to the future All this taken with the events of the preceding evening greatly bewildered the mind of Traverse and agitated him with the wildest conjectures Mother will you tell me about my father and also what it is beyond this promised kindness of Major Warfield that has made you so happy he asked Not now my boy dear boy not now I must not I cannot I dare not yet Wait a few days and you shall know all Oh it is hard to keep a secret from my boy but then it is not only my secret but another s You do not think hard of me for withholding it now do you Traverse she asked affectionately No dear mother of course I don t I know you must be right and I am glad to see you happy Happy Oh boy you don t know how happy I am I did not think any human being could ever feel so joyful in this erring world much less me One cause of this excess of joyful feeling must be from the contrast else it were dreadful to be so happy Mother I don t know what you mean said Traverse uneasily for he was too young to understand these paradoxes of feeling and thought and there were moments when he feared for his mother s reason Oh Traverse think of it eighteen long long years of estrangement sorrow and dreadful suspense eighteen long long weary years of patience against anger and loving against hatred and hoping against despair your young mind cannot grasp it your very life is not so long I was seventeen then I am thirty five now And after wasting all my young years of womanhood in loving hoping longing lo the light of life has dawned at last God save you mother said the boy fervently for her wild unnatural joy continued to augment his anxiety Ah Traverse I dare not tell you the secret now and yet I am always letting it out because my heart overflows from its fulness Ah boy many many weary nights have I lain awake from grief but last night I lay awake from joy Think of it The boy s only reply to this was a deep sigh He was becoming seriously alarmed I never saw her so excited I wish she would get calm was his secret thought Then with the design of changing the current of her ideas he took off his coat and said Mother my pocket is half torn out and though there s no danger of my losing a great deal out of it still I ll get you please to sew it in while I mend the fence Sew the pocket mend the fence Well smiled missus Rocke we ll do so if it will amuse you The mended fence will be a convenience to the next tenant and the patched coat will do for some poor boy Ah Traverse we must be very good to the poor in more ways than in giving them what we do not ourselves need for we shall know what it is to have been poor she concluded in more serious tones than she had yet used Traverse was glad of this and went out to his work feeling somewhat better satisfied The delirium of happiness lasted intermittently a whole week during the last three days of which missus Rocke was constantly going to the door and looking up the road as if expecting some one The mail came from Tip Top to Staunton only once a week on Saturday mornings Therefore when Saturday came again she sent her son to the post office saying If they do not come to day they will surely write Traverse hastened with all his speed and got there so soon that he had to wait for the mail to be opened Meanwhile at home the widow walked the floor in restless joyous anticipation or went to the door and strained her eyes up the road to watch for Traverse and perhaps for some one else s coming At last she discerned her son who came down the road walking rapidly smiling triumphantly and holding a letter up to view She ran out of the gate to meet him seized and kissed the letter and then with her face burning her heart palpitating and her fingers trembling she hastened into the house threw herself into the little low chair by the fire and opened the letter It was from Herbert and read thus Hurricane Hall Nov thirtieth eighteen forty three My Dearest and Best missus Rocke May God strengthen you to read the few bitter lines I have to write Most unhappily Major Warfield did not know exactly who you were when he promised so much Upon learning your name he withdrew all his promises At night in his library he told me all your early history Having heard all the very worst I believe you as pure as an angel So I told him So I would uphold with my life and seal with my death Trust yet in God and believe in the earnest respect and affection of your grateful and attached son Herbert Greyson P S For henceforth I shall call you mother Quietly she finished reading pressed the letter again to her lips reached it to the fire saw it like her hopes shrivel up to ashes and then she arose and with her trembling fingers clinging together walked up and down the floor There were no tears in her eyes but oh such a look of unutterable woe on her pale blank despairing face Traverse watched her and saw that something had gone frightfully wrong that some awful revolution of fate or revulsion of feeling had passed over her in this dread hour Cautiously he approached her gently he laid his hand upon her shoulder tenderly he whispered Mother She turned and looked strangely at him then exclaiming Oh Traverse how happy I was this day week She burst into a flood of tears Traverse threw his arm around his mother s waist and half coaxed and half bore her to her low chair and sat her in it and knelt by her side and embracing her fondly whispered Mother don t weep so bitterly You have me am I nothing Mother I love you more than son ever loved his mother or suitor his sweetheart or husband his wife Oh is my love nothing mother Only sobs answered him Mother he pleaded you are all the world to me let me be all the world to you I can be it mother I can be it try me I will make every effort for my mother and the Lord will bless us Still no answer but convulsive sobs Oh mother mother I will try to do for you more than ever son did for mother or man for woman before Dear mother if you will not break my heart by weeping so The sobbing abated a little partly from exhaustion and partly from the soothing influences of the boy s loving words Listen dear mother what I will do In the olden times of chivalry young knights bound themselves by sacred vows to the service of some lady and labored long and perilously in her honor For her blood was spilled for her fields were won but mother never yet toiled knight in the battlefield for his lady love as I will in the battle of life for my dearest lady my own mother She reached out her hand and silently pressed his Come come said Traverse lift up your head and smile We are young yet both you and I for after all you are not much older than your son and we two will journey up and down the hills of life together all in all to each other and when at last we are old as we shall be when you are seventy seven and I am sixty we will leave all our fortune that we shall have made to found a home for widows and orphans as we were and we will pass out and go to heaven together Now indeed this poor modern Hagar looked up and smiled at the oddity of her Ishmael s far reaching thought In that poor household grief might not be indulged Marah Rocke took down her work basket and sat down to finish a lot of shirts and Traverse went out with his horse and saw to look for a job at cutting wood for twenty five cents a cord Small beginnings of the fortune that was to found and endow asylums but many a fortune has been commenced upon less Marah Rocke had managed to dismiss her boy with a smile but that was the last effort of nature as soon as he was gone and she found herself alone tear after tear welled up in her eyes and rolled down her pale cheeks sigh after sigh heaved her bosom Ah the transitory joy of the past week had been but the lightning s arrowy course scathing where it illumined She felt as if this last blow that had struck her down from the height of hope to the depth of despair had broken her heart as if the power of reaction was gone and she mourned as one who would not be comforted While she sat thus the door opened and before she was aware of his presence Herbert Greyson entered the room and came softly to her side Ere she could speak to him he dropped upon one knee at her feet and bowed his young head lowly over the hand that he took and pressed to his lips Then he arose and stood before her This was not unnatural or exaggerated it was his way of expressing the reverential sympathy and compassion he felt for her strange life long martyrdom Herbert you here Why we only got your letter this morning she said in tones of gentle inquiry as she arose and placed a chair for him Yes I could not bear to stay away from you at such a time I came up in the same mail coach that brought my letter but I kept myself out of Traverse s sight for I could not bear to intrude upon you in the first hour of your disappointment said Herbert in a broken voice Oh that need not have kept you away dear boy I did not cry much I am used to trouble you know I shall get over this also after a little while and things will go on in the old way said Marah Rocke struggling to repress the rising emotion that however overcame her for dropping her head upon her sailor boy s shoulder she burst into a flood of tears and wept plenteously Dear mother be comforted he said dear mother be comforted CHAPTER XIII MARAH S MEMORIES In the shade of the apple tree again She saw a rider draw his rein And gazing down with a timid grace She felt his pleased eyes read her face Whittier Dear Marah I cannot understand your strong attachment to that bronzed and grizzled old man who has besides treated you so barbarously said Herbert Is he bronzed and gray asked Marah looking up with gentle pity in her eyes and tone Why of course he is He is sixty two He was forty five when I first knew him and he was very handsome then At least I thought him the very perfection of manly strength and beauty and goodness True it was the mature warm beauty of the Indian summer for he was more than middle aged but it was very genial to the chilly loveless morning of my own early life said Marah dropping her head upon her hand and sliding into reminiscences of the past Dear Marah I wish you would tell me all about your marriage and misfortunes said Herbert in a tone of the deepest sympathy and respect Yes he was very handsome continued missus Rocke speaking more to herself than to her companion his form was tall full and stately his complexion warm rich and glowing his fine face was lighted up by a pair of strong dark gray eyes full of fire and tenderness and was surrounded by waving masses of jet black hair and whiskers they are gray now you say Herbert Gray and grizzled and bristling up around his hard face like thorn bushes around a rock in winter said Herbert bluntly for it enraged his honest but inexperienced boyish heart to hear this wronged woman speak so enthusiastically Ah it is winter with him now but then it was glorious Indian summer He was a handsome strong and ardent man I was a young slight pale girl with no beauty but the cold and colorless beauty of a statue with no learning but such as I had picked up from a country school with no love to bless my lonely life for I was a friendless orphan without either parents or relatives and living by sufferance in a cold and loveless home Poor girl murmured Herbert in almost inaudible tones Our log cabin stood beside the military road leading through the wilderness to the fort where he was stationed And oh when he came riding by each day upon his noble coal black steed and in his martial uniform looking so vigorous handsome and kingly he seemed to me almost a god to worship Sometimes he drew rein in front of the old oak tree that stood in front of our cabin to breathe his horse or to ask for a draught of water I used to bring it to him Oh then when he looked at me his eyes seemed to send new warmth to my chilled heart when he spoke too his tones seemed to strengthen me while he stayed his presence seemed to protect me Aye such protection as vultures give to doves covering and devouring them muttered Herbert to himself missus Rocke too absorbed in her reminiscences to heed his interruptions continued One day he asked me to be his wife I do not know what I answered I only know that when I understood what he meant my heart trembled with instinctive terror at its own excessive joy We were privately married by the chaplain at the fort There were no accommodations for the wives of officers there And besides my husband did not wish to announce our marriage until he was ready to take me to his princely mansion in Virginia Humph grunted Herbert inwardly for comment But he built for me a pretty cabin in the woods below the fort furnished it simply and hired a half breed Indian woman to wait on me Oh I was too happy To my wintry spring of life summer had come warm rich and beautiful There is a clause in the marriage service which enjoins the husband to cherish his wife I do not believe many people ever stop to think how much is in that word He did he cherished my little thin chill feeble life until I became strong warm and healthful Oh even as the blessed sun warms and animates and glorifies the earth causing it to brighten with life and blossom with flowers and bloom with fruit so did my husband enrich and cherish and bless my life Such happiness could not and it did not last Of course not muttered Herbert to himself At first the fault was in myself Yes Herbert it was you need not look incredulous or hope to cast all the blame on him Listen Happy grateful adoring as I was I was also shy timid and bashful never proving the deep love I bore my husband except by the most perfect self abandonment to his will All this deep though quiet devotion he understood as mere passive obedience void of love As this continued he grew uneasy and often asked me if I cared for him at all or if it were possible for a young girl like me to love an old man like himself A very natural question thought Herbert Well I used to whisper in answer Yes and still Yes But this never satisfied Major Warfield One day when he asked me if I cared for him the least in the world I suddenly answered that if he were to die I should throw myself across his grave and lie there until death should release me whereupon he broke into a loud laugh saying Methinks the lady doth protest too much I was already blushing deeply at the unwonted vehemence of my own words although I had spoken only as I felt the very very truth But his laugh and his test so increased my confusion that in fine that was the first and last time I ever did protest Like Lear s Cordelia I was tongue tied I had no words to assure him Sometimes I wept to think how poor I was in resources to make him happy Then came another annoyance my name and fame were freely discussed at the fort A natural consequence sighed Herbert The younger officers discovered my woodland home and often stole out to reconnoitre my calm Among them was Captain Le Noir who after he had discovered my retreat picked acquaintance with Lura my attendant Making the woodland sports his pretext he haunted the vicinity of my cabin often stopping at the door to beg a cup of water which of course was never denied or else to offer a bunch of partridges or a brace of rabbits or some other game the sports of his gun which equally of course was never accepted One beautiful morning in June finding my cabin door open and myself alone he ventured unbidden across my threshold and by his free conversation and bold admiration offended and alarmed me Some days afterward in the mess room at the fort being elevated by wine he boasted among his messmates of the intimate terms of friendly acquaintance upon which he falsely asserted that he had the pleasure of standing with Warfield s pretty little favorite as he insolently called me When my husband heard of this I learned for the first time the terrific violence of his temper It was awful it frightened me almost to death There was a duel of course Le Noir was very dangerously wounded scarred across the face for life and was confined many weeks to his bed Major Warfield was also slightly hurt and laid up at the fort for a few days during which I was not permitted to see him Is it possible that even then he did not see your danger and acknowledge your marriage and call you to his bedside inquired Herbert impatiently No no if he had all after suffering had been spared No at the end of four days he came back to me but we met only for bitter reproaches on his part and sorrowful tears on mine He charged me with coldness upon account of the disparity in our years and of the preference for Captain Le Noir because he was a pretty fellow I knew this was not true of me I knew that I loved my husband s very footprints better than I did the whole human race besides but I could not tell him so then Oh in those days though my heart was so full I had so little power of utterance There he stood before me he that had been so ruddy and buoyant now so pale from loss of blood and so miserable that I could have fallen and groveled at his feet in sorrow and remorse at not being able to make him happy There are some persons whom we can never make happy It is not in them to be so commented Herbert He made me promise never to see or to speak to Le Noir again a promise eagerly given but nearly impossible to keep My husband spent as much time with me as he possibly could spare from his military duties and looked forward with impatience to the autumn when it was thought that he would be at liberty to take me home He often used to tell me that we should spend our Christmas at his house Hurricane Hall and that I should play Lady Bountiful and distribute Christmas gifts to the negroes and that they would love me And oh with what joy I anticipated that time of honor and safety and careless ease as an acknowledged wife in the home of my husband There too I fondly believed our child would be born All his old tenderness returned for me and I was as happy if not as wildly joyful as at first Twas but a lull in the storm said Herbert Aye twas but a lull in the storm or rather before the storm I do think that from the time of that duel Le Noir had resolved upon our ruin As soon as he was able to go out he haunted the woods around my cabin and continually lay in wait for me I could not go out even in the company of my maid Lura to pick blackberries or wild plums or gather forest roses or to get fresh water at the spring without being intercepted by Le Noir and his offensive admiration He seemed to be ubiquitous He met me everywhere except in the presence of Major Warfield I did not tell my husband because I feared that if I did he would have killed Le Noir and died for the deed Humph it would have been good riddance of bad rubbish in both cases muttered Herbert under his teeth But instead of telling him I confined myself strictly to my cabin One fatal day my husband on leaving me in the morning said that I need not wait up for him at night for that it would be very late when he came even if he came at all He kissed me very fondly when he went away Alas alas it was the last last time At night I went to bed disappointed yet still so expectant that I could not sleep I know not how long I had waited thus or how late it was when I heard a tap at the outer door and heard the bolt undrawn and a footstep enter and a low voice asking Is she asleep and Lura s reply in the affirmative Never doubting it was my husband I lay there in pleased expectation of his entrance He came in and began to take off his coat in the dark I spoke telling him that there were matches on the bureau He did not reply at which I was surprised but before I could repeat my words the outer door was burst violently open hurried footsteps crossed the entry a light flashed into my room my husband stood in the door in full military uniform with a light in his hand and the aspect of an avenging demon on his brow and Horror upon horrors the half undressed man in my chamber was Captain Le Noir I saw and swooned away But you were saved you were saved gasped Herbert white with emotion Oh I was saved but not from sorrow not from shame I awoke from that deadly swoon to find myself alone deserted cast away Oh torn out from the warmth and light and safety of my husband s heart and hurled forth shivering faint and helpless upon the bleak world and all this in twenty four hours Ah I did not lack the power of expression then happiness had never given it to me anguish conferred it upon me that one fell stroke of fate cleft the rock of silence in my soul and the fountain of utterance gushed freely forth I wrote to him but my letters might as well have been dropped into a well I went to him but was spurned away I prayed him with tears to have pity on our unborn babe but he laughed aloud in scorn and called it by an opprobrious name Letters prayers tears were all in vain He never had acknowledged our marriage he now declared that he never would do so he discarded me disowned my child and forbade us ever to take his name Oh Marah and you but seventeen years of age without a father or a brother or a friend in the world to employ an advocate exclaimed Herbert covering his face with his hands and sinking back Nor would I have used any of these agencies had I possessed them If my wifehood and motherhood my affections and my helplessness were not advocates strong enough to win my cause I could not have borne to employ others Oh Marah with none to pity or to help it was monstrous to have abandoned you so No hush consider the overwhelming evidence against me I considered it even in the tempest and whirlwind of my anguish and never once blamed and never once was angry with my husband for I knew not life but the terrible circumstantial evidence had ruined me Ay but did you not explain it to him How could I alas when I did not understand it myself How Le Noir knew that Major Warfield was not expected home that fatal night how he got into my house whether by conspiring with my little maid or by deceiving her or lastly how Major Warfield came to burst in upon him so suddenly I did not know and do not to this day But you told Major Warfield all that you have told me Oh yes again and again calling heaven to witness my truth In vain he had seen with his own eyes he said Against all I could say or do there was built up a wall of scornful incredulity on which I might have dashed my brains out to no purpose Oh Marah Marah with none to pity or to save again exclaimed Herbert Yes said the meek creature bowing her head God pitied and helped me First he sent me a son that grew strong and handsome in body good and wise in soul Then He kept alive in my heart faith and hope and charity He enabled me through long years of unremitting and ill requited toil to live on loving against anger waiting against time and hoping against despair Why did you leave your western home and come to Staunton Marah asked Herbert To be where I could sometimes hear of my husband without intruding on him I took your widowed mother in because she was his sister though I never told her who I was lest she should wrong and scorn me as he had done When she died I cherished you Herbert first because you were his nephew but now dear boy for your own sake also And I while I live will be a son to you madam I will be your constant friend at Hurricane Hall He talks of making me his heir Should he persist in such blind injustice the day I come into the property I shall turn it all over to his widow and son But I do not believe that he will persist I for my part still hope for the best I also hope for the best for whatever God wills is sure to happen and His will is surely the best Yes Herbert I also hope beyond the grave said Marah Rocke with a wan smile The little clock that stood between the tall plated candlesticks on the mantelpiece struck twelve and Marah rose from her seat saying Traverse poor fellow will be home to his dinner Not a word to him Herbert please I do not wish the poor lad to know how much he has lost and above all I do not wish him to be prejudiced against his father You are right Marah said Herbert for if he were told the natural indignation that your wrongs would arouse in his heart would totally unfit him to meet his father in a proper spirit in that event for which I still hope a future and a perfect family union Herbert Greyson remained a week with his friends during which time he paid the quarter s rent and relieved his adopted mother of that cause of anxiety Then he took leave and departed for Hurricane Hall on his way to Washington City where he was immediately going to pass his examination and await his appointment CHAPTER XIV THE WASTING HEART Then she took up the burden of life again Saying only It might have been Alas for them both alas for us all Who vainly the dreams of youth recall For of all sad words of lips or pen The saddest are these It might have been Whittier By the tacit consent of all parties the meteor hope that had crossed and vanished from Marah Rocke s path of life was never mentioned again Mother and son went about their separate tasks Traverse worked at jobs all day studied at night and went twice a week to recite his lessons to his patron Doctor Day at Willow Hill Marah sewed as usual all day and prepared her boy s meals at the proper times But day by day her cheeks grew paler her form thinner her step fainter Her son saw this decline with great alarm Sometimes he found her in a deep troubled reverie from which she would awaken with heavy sighs Sometimes he surprised her in tears At such times he did not trouble her with questions that he instinctively felt she could not or would not answer but he came gently to her side put his arms about her neck stooped and laid her face against his breast and whispered assurances of his true love and his boyish hopes of getting on of making a fortune and bringing brighter days for her And she would return his caresses and with a faint smile reply that he must not mind her that she was only a little low spirited that she would get over it soon But as day followed day she grew visibly thinner and weaker dark shadows settled under her hollow eyes and in her sunken cheeks One evening while standing at the table washing up their little tea service she suddenly dropped into her chair and fainted Nothing could exceed the alarm and distress of poor Traverse He hastened to fix her in an easy position bathed her face in vinegar and water the only restoratives in their meager stock and called upon her by every loving epithet to live and speak to him The fit yielded to his efforts and presently with a few fluttering inspirations her breath returned and her eyes opened Her very first words were attempts to reassure her dismayed boy But Traverse could no more be flattered He entreated his mother to go at once to bed And though the next morning when she arose she looked not worse than usual Traverse left home with a heart full of trouble But instead of turning down the street to go to his work in the town he turned up the street toward the wooded hills beyond now glowing in their gorgeous autumn foliage and burning in the brilliant morning sun A half hour s walk brought him to a high and thickly wooded hill up which a private road led through a thicket of trees to a handsome graystone country seat situated in the midst of beautifully ornamented grounds and known as Willow Heights the residence of doctor William Day a retired physician of great repute and a man of earnest piety He was a widower with one fair daughter Clara a girl of fourteen then absent at boarding school Traverse had never seen this girl but his one great admiration was the beautiful Willow Heights and its worthy proprietor He opened the highly ornate iron gate and entered up an avenue of willows that led up to the house a two storied edifice of graystone with full length front piazzas above and below Arrived at the door he rang the bell which was answered promptly by a good humored looking negro boy who at once showed Traverse to the library up stairs where the good doctor sat at his books doctor Day was at this time about fifty years of age tall and stoutly built with a fine head and face shaded by soft bright flaxen hair and beard thoughtful and kindly dark blue eyes and an earnest penetrating smile that reached like sunshine the heart of any one upon whom it shone He wore a cheerful looking flowered chintz dressing gown corded around his waist his feet were thrust into embroidered slippers and he sat in his elbow chair at his reading table poring over a huge folio volume The whole aspect of the man and of his surroundings was kindly cheerfulness The room opened upon the upper front piazza and the windows were all up to admit the bright morning sun and genial air at the same time that there was a glowing fire in the grate to temper its chilliness Traverse s soft step across the carpeted floor was not heard by the doctor who was only made aware of his presence by his stepping between the sunshine and his table Then the doctor arose and with his intense smile extended his hand and greeted the boy with Well Traverse lad you are always welcome I did not expect you until night as usual but as you are here so much the better Got your exercises all ready eh Heaven bless you lad what is the matter inquired the good man suddenly on first observing the boy s deeply troubled looks My mother sir my mother was all that Traverse could at first utter Your mother My dear lad what about her Is she ill inquired the doctor with interest Oh sir I am afraid she is going to die exclaimed the boy in a choking voice struggling hard to keep from betraying his manhood by bursting into tears Going to die Oh pooh pooh pooh she is not going to die lad Tell me all about it said the doctor in an encouraging tone She has had so much grief and care and anxiety sir doctor is there any such malady as a broken heart Broken heart Pooh pooh no my child no never heard of such a thing in thirty years medical experience Even that story of a porter who broke his heart trying to lift a ton of stone is all a fiction No such a disease as a broken heart But tell me about your mother It is of her that I am talking She has had so much trouble in her life and now I think she is sinking under it she has been failing for weeks and last night while washing the teacups she fainted away from the table Heaven help us that looks badly said the doctor Oh does it does it sir She said it was nothing much Oh doctor don t say she will die don t If she were to die if mother were to die I d give right up I never should do a bit of good in the world for she is all the motive I have in this life To study hard to work hard and make her comfortable and happy so as to make up to her for all she has suffered is my greatest wish and endeavor Oh don t say mother will die it would ruin me cried Traverse My dear boy I don t say anything of the sort I say judging from your account that her health must be attended to immediately And true I have retired from practice but I will go and see your mother Traverse Oh sir if you only would I came to ask you to do that very thing I should not have presumed to ask such a favor for any cause but this of my dear mother s life and health and you will go to see her Willingly and without delay Traverse said the good man rising immediately and hurrying into an adjoining chamber Order the gig while I dress Traverse and I will take you back with me he added as he closed the chamber door behind him By the time Traverse had gone down given the necessary orders and returned to the library the doctor emerged from his chamber buttoned up his gray frock coat and booted gloved and capped for the ride They went down together entered the gig and drove rapidly down the willow avenue slowly through the iron gate and through the dark thicket and down the wooded hill to the high road and then as fast as the sorrel mare could trot toward town In fifteen minutes the doctor pulled up his gig at the right hand side of the road before the cottage gate They entered the cottage Traverse going first in order to announce the doctor They found missus Rocke as usual seated in her low chair by the little fire bending over her needlework She looked up with surprise as they came in Mother this is Doctor Day come to see you said Traverse She arose from her chair and raised those soft and timid dark gray eyes to the stranger s face where they met that sweet intense smile that seemed to encourage while it shone upon her We have never met before missus Rocke but we both feel too much interest in this good lad here to meet as strangers now said the doctor extending his hand Traverse gives me every day fresh cause to be grateful to you sir for kindness that we can never never repay said Marah Rocke pressing that bountiful hand and then placing a chair which the doctor took Traverse seated himself at a little distance and as the doctor conversed with and covertly examined his mother s face he watched the doctor s countenance as if life and death hung upon the character of its expression But while they talked not one word was said upon the subject of sickness or medicine They talked of Traverse The doctor assured his mother that her boy was of such fine talent character and promise and that he had already made such rapid progress in his classical and mathematical studies that he ought immediately to enter upon a course of reading for one of the learned professions The mother turned a smile full of love pride and sorrow upon the fine intellectual face of her boy and said You are like the angel in Cole s picture of life You point the youth to the far up temple of fame And leave him to get there as he can Not at all madam Let us see Traverse you are now going on eighteen years of age if you had your choice which of the learned professions would you prefer for yourself law physic or divinity The boy looked up and smiled then dropped his head and seemed to reflect Perhaps you have never thought upon the subject Well you must take time so as to be firm in your decision when you have once decided said the doctor Oh sir I have thought of it long and my choice has been long and firmly decided were I only free to follow it Speak lad what is your choice Why don t you know sir Can t you guess Why your own profession of course sir certainly sir I could not think of any other exclaimed the boy with sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks That s my own lad exclaimed the doctor enthusiastically seizing the boy s hand with one of his and clapping the other down upon his palm for if the doctor had an admiration in the world it was for his own profession That s my own lad My profession the healing art Why it is the only profession worthy the study of an immortal being Law sets people by the ears together Divinity should never be considered as a profession it is a divine mission Physic physic my boy the healing art that s the profession for you And I am very glad to hear you declare for it too for now the way is perfectly clear Both mother and son looked up in surprise Yes the way is perfectly clear Nothing is easier Traverse shall come and read medicine in my office I shall be glad to have the lad there It will amuse me to give him instruction occasionally I have a positive mania for teaching And for doing good Oh sir how have we deserved this kindness at your hands and how shall we ever ever repay it cried missus Rocke in a broken voice while the tears filled her gentle eyes Oh pooh pooh a mere nothing ma am a mere nothing for me to do whatever it may prove to him It is very hard indeed if I am to be crushed under a cart load of thanks for doing something for a boy I like when it does not cost me a cent of money or a breath of effort Oh sir your generous refusal of our thanks does but deepen our obligation said Marah still weeping Now my dear madam will you persist in making me confess that it is all selfishness on my part I like the boy I tell you I shall like his bright cheerful face in my office I can make him very useful to me also Oh sir if you can and will only make him useful to you Why to be sure I can and will He can act as my clerk keep my accounts write my letters drive out with me and sit in the rig while I go in to visit my patients for though I have pretty much retired from practice still Still you visit and prescribe for the sick poor gratis added Marah feelingly Pooh pooh habit madam habit ruling passion strong as death et cetera I can t for the life of me keep from giving people bread pills And now by the way I must be off to see some of my patients in Staunton Traverse my lad my young medical assistant I mean are you willing to go with me Oh sir said the boy and here his voice broke down with emotion Come along then laughed the doctor You shall drive with me into the village as a commencement Traverse got his hat while the doctor held out his hand to missus Rocke who with her eyes full of tears and her voice faltering with emotion began again to thank him when he good humoredly interrupted her by saying Now my good little woman do pray hush I m a selfish fellow as you ll see I do nothing but what pleases my own self and makes me happy Good by God bless you madam he said cordially shaking her hand Come Traverse he added hurriedly striding out of the door and through the yard to the gate before which the old green gig and sorrel mare were still waiting Traverse I brought you out again to day more especially to speak of your mother and her state of health said Doctor Day very seriously as they both took their seats in the gig and drove on toward the town Traverse your mother is in no immediate danger of death in fact she has no disease whatever Oh sir you do not think her ill then I thought you did not from the fact that you never felt her pulse or gave her a prescription exclaimed Traverse delightedly for in one thing the lad resembled his mother he was sensitive and excitable easily depressed and easily exhilarated Traverse I said your mother is in no immediate danger of death for that in fact she has no disease but yet Traverse brace yourself up for I am about to strike you a heavy blow Traverse Marah Rocke is starving Starving Heaven of heavens no that is not so it cannot be My mother starving oh horrible horrible But doctor it cannot cannot be Why we have two meals a day at our house cried the boy almost beside himself with agitation Lad there are other starvations besides the total lack of food There are slow starvations and divers ones Marah Rocke is starving slowly and in every way mind soul and body Her body is slowly wasting from the want of proper nutriment her heart from the want of human sympathy her mind from the need of social intercourse Her whole manner of life must be changed if she is to live at all Oh sir I understand you now I feel I feel that you speak the very truth Something must be done I must do something What shall it be Oh advise me sir I must reflect a little Traverse said the doctor thoughtfully as he drove along with very slack reins And oh how thoughtless of me I forgot indeed I did sir when I so gladly accepted your offer for me to read with you I forgot that if I spent every day reading in your office my mother would sadly miss the dollar and a half a week I make by doing odd jobs in town But I did not forget it boy rest easy upon that score and now let me reflect how we can best serve your good little mother said the doctor and he drove slowly and thoughtfully along for about twenty minutes before he spoke again when he said Traverse Monday is the first of the month You shall set in with me then Come to me therefore on Monday and I think by that time I shall have thought upon some plan for your mother In the mean time you make as much money at jobs as you can and also you must accept from me for her a bottle or so of port wine and a turkey or two Tell her if she demurs that it is the doctor s prescription and that for fear of accident he always prefers to send his own physic Oh Doctor Day if I could only thank you aright cried Traverse Pooh pooh nonsense there is no time for it Here we are at Spicer s grocery store where I suppose you are again employed Yes Well jump out then You can still make half a day Mind remember on Monday next December first you enter my office as my medical student and by that time I shall have some plan arranged for your mother Good by God bless you lad said the good doctor as he drove off and left Traverse standing in the genial autumn sunshine with his heart swelling and his eyes overflowing with excess of gratitude and happiness

none	none	CAP S COUNTRY CAPERS
3584_178748_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 A willful elf an uncle s child That half a pet and half a pest Was still reproved endured caressed Yet never tamed though never spoiled 
3584_178748_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Capitola at first was delighted and half incredulous at the great change in her fortunes 
none	none	The spacious and comfortable mansion of which she found herself the little mistress the high rank of the veteran officer who claimed her as his ward and niece the abundance regularity and respectability of her new life the leisure the privacy the attendance of servants were all so different from anything to which she had previously been accustomed that there were times when she doubted its reality and distrusted her own identity 
3584_178748_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Sometimes of a morning after a very vivid dream of the alleys cellars and gutters ragpickers newsboys and beggars of New York she would open her eyes upon her own comfortable chamber with its glowing fire and crimson curtains and bright mirror crowning the walnut bureau between them she would jump up and gaze wildly around not remembering where she was or how she came thither 
3584_178748_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Sometimes suddenly startled by an intense realization of the contrast between her past and her present life she would mentally inquire 
3584_178748_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Can this be really I myself and not another 
3584_178748_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I the little houseless wanderer through the streets and alleys of New York 
3584_178748_000006_000002	train-clean-360	I the little newsgirl in boy s clothes 
3584_178748_000006_000003	train-clean-360	I the wretched little vagrant that was brought up before the recorder and was about to be sent to the House of Refuge for juvenile delinquents 
3584_178748_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Can this be I Capitola the little outcast of the city now changed into Miss Black the young lady perhaps the heiress of a fine old country seat calling a fine old military officer uncle having a handsome income of pocket money settled upon me having carriages and horses and servants to attend me 
3584_178748_000006_000005	train-clean-360	No it can t be 
3584_178748_000006_000006	train-clean-360	It s just impossible 
3584_178748_000006_000007	train-clean-360	No I see how it is 
3584_178748_000006_000008	train-clean-360	I m crazy 
3584_178748_000006_000009	train-clean-360	that s what I am crazy 
3584_178748_000006_000010	train-clean-360	For now I think of it the last thing I remember of my former life was being brought before the recorder for wearing boy s clothes 
none	none	Now I m sure that it was upon that occasion that I went suddenly mad with trouble and all the rest is a lunatic s fancy This fine old country seat of which I vainly think myself the mistress is just the pauper madhouse to which the magistrates have sent me 
3584_178748_000006_000013	train-clean-360	This fine old military officer whom I call uncle is the head doctor 
3584_178748_000006_000014	train-clean-360	The servants who come at my call are the keepers 
3584_178748_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 There is no figure out of my past life in my present one except Herbert Greyson 
3584_178748_000007_000001	train-clean-360	But pshaw he is not the nephew of his uncle he is only my old comrade Herbert Greyson the sailor lad who comes here to the madhouse to see me and out of compassion humors all my fancies 
3584_178748_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder how long they ll keep me here 
3584_178748_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Forever I hope 
none	none	Until I get cured I m sure 
3584_178748_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I hope they won t cure me I vow I won t be cured 
3584_178748_000008_000004	train-clean-360	It s a great deal too pleasant to be mad and I ll stay so 
none	none	I ll keep on calling myself Miss Black and this madhouse my country seat and the head doctor my uncle and the keepers servants until the end of time so I will 
3584_178748_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Catch me coming to my senses when it s so delightful to be mad 
3584_178748_000008_000007	train-clean-360	I m too sharp for that 
3584_178748_000008_000008	train-clean-360	I didn t grow up in Rag Alley New York for nothing 
3584_178748_000009_000000	train-clean-360	So half in jest and half in earnest Capitola soliloquized upon her change of fortune 
3584_178748_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Her education was commenced but progressed rather irregularly 
3584_178748_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Old Hurricane bought her books and maps slates and copy books set her lessons in grammar geography and history and made her write copies do sums and read and recite lessons to him 
3584_178748_000010_000002	train-clean-360	missus Condiment taught her the mysteries of cutting and basting back stitching and felling hemming and seaming 
3584_178748_000010_000003	train-clean-360	A pupil as sharp as Capitola soon mastered her tasks and found herself each day with many hours of leisure with which she did not know what to do 
3584_178748_000011_000000	train-clean-360	These hours were at first occupied with exploring the old house with all its attics cuddies cock lofts and cellars then in wandering through the old ornamental grounds that were even in winter and in total neglect beautiful with their wild growth of evergreens thence she extended her researches into the wild and picturesque country around 
3584_178748_000012_000000	train-clean-360	She was never weary of admiring the great forest that climbed the heights of the mountains behind their house the great bleak precipices of gray rock seen through the leafless branches of the trees the rugged falling ground that lay before the house and between it and the river and the river itself with its rushing stream and raging rapids 
3584_178748_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Capitola had become a skilful as she had first been a fearless rider But her rides were confined to the domain between the mountain range and the river she was forbidden to ford the one or climb the other 
3584_178748_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps if such a prohibition had never been made Capitola would never have thought of doing the one or the other but we all know the diabolical fascination there is in forbidden pleasures for young human nature 
3584_178748_000013_000002	train-clean-360	And no sooner had Cap been commanded if she valued her safety not to cross the water or climb the precipice than as a natural consequence she began to wonder what was in the valley behind the mountain and what might be in the woods across the river 
3584_178748_000013_000003	train-clean-360	And she longed above all things to explore and find out for herself 
none	none	She would eagerly have done so notwithstanding the prohibition but Wool who always attended her rides was sadly in the way 
3584_178748_000013_000005	train-clean-360	If she could only get rid of Wool she resolved to go upon a limited exploring expedition 
3584_178748_000014_000000	train-clean-360	One day a golden opportunity occurred 
3584_178748_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It was a day of unusual beauty when autumn seemed to be smiling upon the earth with her brightest smiles before passing away 
3584_178748_000014_000002	train-clean-360	In a word it was Indian summer 
3584_178748_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The beauty of the weather had tempted Old Hurricane to ride to the county seat on particular business connected with his ward herself 
3584_178748_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Capitola left alone amused herself with her tasks until the afternoon then calling a boy she ordered him to saddle her horse and bring him around 
3584_178748_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear what do you want with your horse 
3584_178748_000016_000001	train-clean-360	There is no one to attend you Wool has gone with his master said missus Condiment as she met Capitola in the hall habited for her ride 
3584_178748_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I know that but I cannot be mewed up here in the old house and deprived of my afternoon ride exclaimed Capitola decidedly 
3584_178748_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear you must never think of riding out alone exclaimed the dismayed missus Condiment 
3584_178748_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed I shall though and glad of the opportunity added Cap mentally 
3584_178748_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear love it is improper imprudent dangerous 
3584_178748_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Why so asked Cap 
3584_178748_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Good gracious upon every account 
3584_178748_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Suppose you were to meet with ruffians suppose oh heaven suppose you were to meet with Black Donald 
3584_178748_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Condiment once for all do tell me who this terrible Black Donald is 
3584_178748_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Is he the Evil One himself or the Man in the Iron Mask or the individual that struck Billy Patterson or who is he 
3584_178748_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is Black Donald 
3584_178748_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Good gracious child you ask me who is Black Donald 
none	none	Yes who is he 
3584_178748_000025_000001	train-clean-360	where is he 
3584_178748_000025_000002	train-clean-360	what is he 
none	none	that every cheek turns pale at the mention of his name asked Capitola Black Donald 
3584_178748_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Oh my child may you never know more of Black Donald than I can tell you 
3584_178748_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Black Donald is the chief of a band of ruthless desperadoes that infest these mountain roads robbing mail coaches stealing negroes breaking into houses and committing every sort of depredation 
3584_178748_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Their hands are red with murder and their souls black with darker crimes 
3584_178748_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Darker crimes than murder ejaculated Capitola 
3584_178748_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes child yes there are darker crimes 
3584_178748_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Only last winter he and three of his gang broke into a solitary house where there was a lone woman and her daughter and it is not a story for you to hear but if the people had caught Black Donald then they would have burned him at the stake His life is forfeit by a hundred crimes 
3584_178748_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He is an outlaw and a heavy price is set upon his head 
none	none	And can no one take him
3584_178748_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 No my dear at least no one has been able to do so yet 
3584_178748_000030_000001	train-clean-360	His very haunts are unknown but are supposed to be in concealed mountain caverns 
3584_178748_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 How I would like the glory of capturing Black Donald said Capitola 
3584_178748_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 You child 
3584_178748_000032_000001	train-clean-360	You capture Black Donald 
3584_178748_000032_000002	train-clean-360	You are crazy 
3584_178748_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh by stratagem I mean not by force 
3584_178748_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Oh how I should like to capture Black Donald There s my horse good by and before missus Condiment could raise another objection Capitola ran out sprang into her saddle and was seen careering down the hill toward the river as fast as her horse could fly 
3584_178748_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 My Lord but the major will be hopping if he finds it out was good missus Condiment s dismayed exclamation 
none	none	Rejoicing in her freedom Cap galloped down to the water s edge and then walked her horse up and down along the course of the stream until she found a good fording place 
3584_178748_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Then gathering up her riding skirt and throwing it over the neck of her horse she plunged boldly into the stream and with the water splashing and foaming all around her urged him onward till they crossed the river and climbed up the opposite bank A bridle path lay before her leading from the fording place through a deep wood 
3584_178748_000035_000002	train-clean-360	That path attracted her she followed it charmed alike by the solitude of the wood the novelty of the scene and her own sense of freedom 
3584_178748_000035_000003	train-clean-360	But one thought was given to the story of Black Donald and that was a reassuring one 
3584_178748_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 If Black Donald is a mail robber then this little bridle path is far enough off his beat 
3584_178748_000037_000000	train-clean-360	And so saying she gayly galloped along singing as she went following the narrow path up hill and down dale through the wintry woods 
none	none	Drawn on by the attraction of the unknown and deceiving herself by the continued repetition of one resolve namely When I get to the top of the next hill and see what lies beyond then I will turn back she galloped on and on on and on on and on until she had put several miles between herself and her home until her horse began to exhibit signs of weariness and the level rays of the setting sun were striking redly through the leafless branches of the trees Cap drew rein at the top of a high wooded hill and looked about her 
3584_178748_000038_000001	train-clean-360	On her left hand the sun was sinking like a ball of fire below the horizon all around her everywhere were the wintry woods far away in the direction whence she had come she saw the tops of the mountains behind Hurricane Hall looking like blue clouds against the southern horizon the Hall itself and the river below were out of sight 
3584_178748_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I wonder how far I am from home said Capitola uneasily somewhere between six and seven miles I reckon 
3584_178748_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Dear me I didn t mean to ride so far 
3584_178748_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I ve got over a great deal of ground in these two hours 
3584_178748_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I shall not get back so soon my horse is tired to death it will take me three hours to reach Hurricane Hall 
3584_178748_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Good gracious it will be pitch dark before I get there 
3584_178748_000039_000005	train-clean-360	No thank heaven there will be a moon 
3584_178748_000039_000006	train-clean-360	But won t there be a row though 
none	none	Whew 
3584_178748_000039_000008	train-clean-360	Well I must turn about and lose no time Come Gyp get up Gyp good horse we re going home 
none	none	And so saying Capitola turned her horse s head and urged him into a gallop 
3584_178748_000041_000000	train-clean-360	She had gone on for about a mile and it was growing dark and her horse was again slackening his pace when she thought she heard the sound of another horse s hoofs behind her 
3584_178748_000041_000001	train-clean-360	She drew rein and listened and was sure of it 
3584_178748_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Now without being the least of a coward Capitola thought of the loneliness of the woods the lateness of the hour her own helplessness and Black Donald 
3584_178748_000042_000001	train-clean-360	And thinking discretion the better part of valor she urged her horse once more into a gallop for a few hundred yards but the jaded beast soon broke into a trot and subsided into a walk that threatened soon to come to a standstill 
3584_178748_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The invisible pursuer gained on her 
none	none	In vain she urged her steed with whip and voice the poor beast would obey and trot for a few yards and then fall into a walk 
3584_178748_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The thundering footfalls of the pursuing horse were close in the rear 
3584_178748_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Gyp is it possible that instead of my capturing Black Donald you are going to let Black Donald or somebody else catch me exclaimed Capitola in mock despair as she urged her wearied steed 
none	none	In vain The pursuing horseman was beside her a strong hand was laid upon her bridle a mocking voice was ringing in her ear
3584_178748_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Whither away so fast pretty one 
none	none	CHAPTER XVI CAP S FEARFUL ADVENTURE Who passes by this road so late Companion of the Majolaine Who passes by this road so late Say oh say Old French Song Of a naturally strong constitution and adventurous disposition and inured from infancy to danger Capitola possessed a high degree of courage self control and presence of mind At the touch of that ruthless hand at the sound of that gibing voice all her faculties instantly collected and concentrated themselves upon the emergency As by a flash of lightning she saw every feature of her imminent danger the loneliness of the woods the lateness of the hour the recklessness of her fearful companion and her own weakness In another instant her resolution was taken and her course determined So when the stranger repeated his mocking question Whither away so fast pretty one she answered with animation Oh I am going home and so glad to have company for indeed I was dreadfully afraid of riding alone through these woods to night Afraid pretty one of what Oh of ghosts and witches wild beasts runaway negroes and Black Donald Then you are not afraid of me Lors no indeed I guess I ain t Why should I be afraid of a respectable looking gentleman like you sir And so you are going home Where is your home pretty one On the other side of the river But you need not keep on calling me pretty one it must be as tiresome to you to repeat it as it is to me to hear it What shall I call you then my dear You may call me Miss Black or if you are friendly you may call me Capitola Capitola exclaimed the man in a deep and changed voice as he dropped her bridle Yes Capitola what objection have you got to that It is a pretty name isn t it But if you think it is too long and if you feel very friendly you may call me Cap Well then my pretty Cap where do you live across the river asked the stranger recovering his self possession Oh at a rum old place they call Hurricane Hall with a rum old military officer they call Old Hurricane said Capitola for the first time stealing a sidelong glance at her fearful companion It was not Black Donald that was the first conclusion to which she rashly jumped He appeared to be a gentlemanly ruffian about forty years of age well dressed in a black riding suit black beaver hat drawn down close over his eyes black hair and whiskers heavy black eyebrows that met across his nose drooping eyelashes and eyes that looked out under the corners of the lids altogether a sly sinister cruel face a cross between a fox and a tiger It warned Capitola to expect no mercy there After the girl s last words he seemed to have fallen into thought for a moment and then again he spoke Well my pretty Cap how long have you been living at Hurricane Hall Ever since my guardian Major Warfield brought me from the City of New York where I received my education in the streets she mentally added Humph Why did you ride so fast my pretty Cap he asked eying her from the corner of his eyes Oh sir because I was afraid as I told you before afraid of runaway negroes and wild beasts and so on but now with a good gentleman like you I don t feel afraid at all and I m very glad to be able to walk poor Gyp because he is tired poor fellow Yes poor fellow said the traveler in a mocking tone he is tired suppose you dismount and let him rest Come I ll get off too and we will sit down here by the roadside and have a friendly conversation Capitola stole a glance at his face Yes notwithstanding his light tone he was grimly in earnest there was no mercy to be expected from that sly sinister cruel face Come my pretty Cap what say you I don t care if I do she said riding to the edge of the path drawing rein and looking down as if to examine the ground Come little beauty must I help you off asked the stranger N n no answered Capitola with deliberate hesitation no this is not a good place to sit down and talk it s all full of brambles Very well shall we go on a little further Oh yes but I don t want to ride fast because it will tire my horse You shall go just as you please my angel said the traveler I wonder whether this wretch thinks me very simple or very depraved He must come to one or the other conclusion thought Capitola They rode on very slowly for a mile further and then having arrived at an open glade the stranger drew rein and said Come pretty lark hop down here s a nice place to sit and rest Very well come help me off said Capitola pulling up her horse then as by a sudden impulse she exclaimed I don t like this place either it s right on top of the hill so windy and just see how rocky the ground is No I ll not sit and rest here and that I tell you I am afraid you are trifling with me my pretty bird Take care I ll not be trifled with said the man I don t know what you mean by trifling with you any more than the dead But I ll not sit down there on those sharp rocks and so I tell you If you will be civil and ride along with me until we get to the foot of the hill I know a nice place where we can sit down and have a good talk and I will tell you all my travels and you shall tell me all yours Ex actly and where is that nice place Why in the valley at the foot of the hill Come come on then Slowly slowly said Capitola I won t tire my horse They rode over the hill down the gradual descent and on toward the center of the valley They were now within a quarter of a mile of the river on the opposite side of which was Hurricane Hall and safety The stranger drew rein saying Come my cuckoo here we are at the bottom of the valley now or never Oh now of course you see I keep my promise answered Capitola pulling up her horse The man sprang from his saddle and came to her side Please be careful now don t let my riding skirt get hung in the stirrup said Capitola cautiously disengaging her drapery rising in the saddle and giving the stranger her hand In the act of jumping she suddenly stopped and looked down exclaiming Good gracious how very damp the ground is here in the bottom of the valley More objections I suppose my pretty one but they won t serve you any longer I am bent upon having a cozy chat with you upon that very turf said the stranger pointing to a little cleared space among the trees beside the path Now don t be cross just see how damp it is there it would spoil my riding dress and give me my death of cold Humph said the stranger looking at her with a sly grim cruel resolve I ll tell you what it is said Cap I m not witty nor amusing nor will it pay to sit out in the night air to hear me talk but since you wish it and since you were so good as to guard me through these woods and since I promised why damp as it is I will even get off and talk with you That s my birdling But hold on a minute is there nothing you can get to put there for me to sit on no stump nor dry stone No my dear I don t see any Could you not turn your hat down and let me sit on that Ha ha ha Why your weight would crush it as flat as a flounder Oh I know now exclaimed Capitola with sudden delight you just spread your saddle cloth down there and that will make a beautiful seat and I ll sit and talk with you so nicely only you must not want me to stay long because if I don t get home soon I shall catch a scolding You shall neither catch a scolding nor a cold on my account pretty one said the man going to his horse to get the saddle cloth Oh don t take off the saddle it will detain you too long said Cap impatiently My pretty Cap I cannot get the cloth without taking it off said the man beginning to unbuckle the girth Oh yes you can you can draw it from under persisted Cap Impossible my angel said the man lifting off the saddle from his horse and laying it carefully by the roadside Then he took off the gay crimson saddle cloth and carried it into the little clearing and began carefully to spread it down Now was Cap s time Her horse had recovered from his fatigue The stranger s horse was in the path before her While the man s back was turned she raised her riding whip and with a shout gave the front horse a sharp lash that sent him galloping furiously ahead Then instantaneously putting whip to her own horse she started into a run Hearing the shout the lash and the starting of the horses the baffled villain turned and saw that his game was lost he had been outwitted by a child He gnashed his teeth and shook his fist in rage Turning as she wheeled out of sight Capitola I am sorry to say put her thumb to the side of her nose and whirled her fingers into a semicircle in a gesture more expressive than elegant CHAPTER XVII ANOTHER STORM AT HURRICANE HALL At this Sir Knight grew high in wroth And lifting hands and eyes up both Three times he smote on stomach stout From whence at length fierce words broke out Hudibras The moon was shining full upon the river and the homestead beyond when Capitola dashed into the water and amid the sparkling and leaping of the foam made her way to the other bank and rode up the rugged ascent On the outer side of the lawn wall the moonbeams fell full upon the little figure of Pitapat waiting there Why Patty what takes you out so late as this asked Capitola as she rode up to the gate Oh Miss Catterpillar I se waitin for you Old marse is dreadful he is Jest fit to bust the shingles offen the roof with swearing So I come out to warn you so you steal in the back way and go to your room so he won t see you and I ll go and send Wool to put your horse away and then I ll bring you up some supper and tell old marse how you ve been home ever so long and gone to bed with a werry bad head ache Thank you Patty It is perfectly astonishing how easy lying is to you You really deserve to have been born in Rag Alley but I won t trouble the recording angel to make another entry against you on my account Yes miss said Pitapat who thought that her mistress was complimenting her And now Patty stand out of my way I am going to ride straight up to the horse block dismount and walk right into the presence of Major Warfield said Capitola passing through the gate Oh Miss Catterpillar don t don t he ll kill you so he will Who s afeard muttered Cap to herself as she put her horse to his mettle and rode gayly through the evergreens up to the horse block where she sprang down lightly from her saddle Gathering up her train with one hand and tossing back her head she swept along toward the house with the air of a young princess There was a vision calculated to test her firmness Reader did you ever see a raging lion tearing to and fro the narrow limits of his cage and occasionally shaking the amphitheatre with his tremendous roar or a furious bull tossing his head and tail and plowing up the earth with his hoofs as he careered back and forth between the boundaries of his pen If you have seen and noted these mad brutes you may form some idea of the frenzy of Old Hurricane as he stormed up and down the floor of the front piazza Cap had just escaped an actual danger of too terrible a character to be frightened now by sound and fury Composedly she walked up into the porch and said Good evening uncle The old man stopped short in his furious strides and glared upon her with his terrible eyes Cap stood fire without blanching merely remarking Now I have no doubt that in the days when you went battling that look used to strike terror into the heart of the enemy but it doesn t into mine somehow Miss roared the old man bringing down his cane with a resounding thump upon the floor miss how dare you have the impudence to face me much less the the the assurance the effrontery the audacity the brass to speak to me Well I declare said Cap calmly untying her hat this is the first time I ever heard it was impudent in a little girl to give her uncle good evening The old man trotted up and down the piazza two or three turns then stopping short before the delinquent he struck his cane down upon the floor with a ringing stroke and thundered Young woman tell me instantly and without prevarication where you ve been Certainly sir going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it said Cap quietly Flames and furies that is no answer at all Where have you been roared Old Hurricane shaking with excitement Look here uncle if you go on that way you ll have a fit presently said Cap calmly Where have you been thundered Old Hurricane Well since you will know just across the river and through the woods and back again And didn t I forbid you to do that minion and how dare you disobey me You the creature of my bounty you the miserable little vagrant that I picked up in the alleys of New York and tried to make a young lady of but an old proverb says You can t make a silken purse out of a pig s ear How dare you you little beggar disobey your benefactor a man of my age character and position I I Old Hurricane turned abruptly and raged up and down the piazza All this time Capitola had been standing quietly holding up her train with one hand and her riding habit in the other At this last insult she raised her dark gray eyes to his face with one long indignant sorrowful gaze then turning silently away and entering the house she left Old Hurricane to storm up and down the piazza until he had raged himself to rest Reader I do not defend far less approve poor Cap I only tell her story and describe her as I have seen her leaving her to your charitable interpretation Next morning Capitola came down into the breakfast room with one idea prominent in her hard little head to which she mentally gave expression Well as I like that old man he must not permit himself to talk to me in that indecent strain and so he must be made to know When she entered the breakfast room she found missus Condiment already at the head of the table and Old Hurricane at the foot He had quite got over his rage and turned around blandly to welcome his ward saying Good morning Cap Without taking the slightest notice of the salutation Cap sailed on to her seat Humph Did you hear me say Good morning Cap Without paying the least attention Capitola reached out her hand and took a cup of coffee from missus Condiment Humph Humph Good morning Capitola said Old Hurricane with marked emphasis Apparently without hearing him Cap helped herself to a buckwheat cake and daintily buttered it Humph humph humph Well as you said yourself a dumb devil is better than a speaking one ejaculated Old Hurricane as he sat down and subsided into silence Doubtless the old man would have flown into another passion had that been possible but in truth he had spent so much vitality in rage number one that he had none left to sustain rage number two Besides he knew it would be necessary to blow up Bill Ezy his lazy overseer before night and perhaps saved himself for that performance He finished his meal in silence and went out Cap finished hers and tempering justice with mercy went up stairs to his room and looked over all his appointments and belongings to find what she would do for his extra comfort and found a job in newly lining his warm slippers and the sleeves of his dressing gown They met again at the dinner table How do you do Cap said Old Hurricane as he took his seat Capitola poured out a glass of water and drank it in silence Oh very well a dumb devil et cetera exclaimed Old Hurricane addressing himself to his dinner When the meal was over they again separated The old man went to his study to examine his farm books and Capitola back to her chamber to finish lining his warm slippers Again at tea they met Well Cap is the dumb devil cast out yet he said sitting down Capitola took a cup of tea from missus Condiment and passed it on to him in silence Humph not gone yet eh Poor girl how it must try you said Old Hurricane After supper the old man found his dressing gown and slippers before the fire all ready for his use Cap you monkey you did this he said turning around But Capitola had already left the room Next morning at breakfast there was a repetition of the same scene Early in the forenoon Major Warfield ordered his horses and attended by Wool rode up to Tip Top He did not return either to dinner or tea but as that circumstance was not unusual it gave no uneasiness missus Condiment kept his supper warm and Capitola had his dressing gown and slippers ready She was turning them before the fire when the old man arrived He came in quite gayly saying Now Cap I think I have found a talisman at last to cast out that dumb devil I heard you wishing for a watch the other day Now as devils belong to eternity and have no business with time of course the sight of this little time keeper must put yours to flight and so saying he laid upon the table before the eyes of Capitola a beautiful little gold watch and chain She glanced at it as it lay glittering and sparkling in the lamplight and then turned abruptly and walked away Humph that s always the way the devils do fly when they can t stand shot Capitola deliberately walked back laid a paper over the little watch and chain as if to cover its fascinating sparkle and glitter and said Uncle your bounty is large and your present is beautiful but there is something that poor Capitola values more than She paused dropped her head upon her bosom a sudden blush flamed up over her face and tear drops glittered in her downcast eyes She put both hands before her burning face for a moment and then dropping them resumed Uncle you rescued me from misery and perhaps perhaps early death you have heaped benefits and bounties upon me without measure you have placed me in a home of abundance honor and security For all this if I were not grateful I should deserve no less than death But uncle there is a sin that is worse at least more ungenerous than ingratitude it is to put a helpless fellow creature under heavy obligations and then treat that grateful creature with undeserved contempt and cruel unkindness Once more her voice was choked with feeling For some reason or other Capitola s tears perhaps because they were so rare always moved Old Hurricane to his heart s center Going toward her softly he said Now my dear now my child now my little Cap you know it was all for your own good Why my dear I never for one instant regretted bringing you to the house and I wouldn t part with you for a kingdom Come now my child come to the heart of your old uncle Now the soul of Capitola naturally abhorred sentiment If ever she gave way to serious emotion she was sure to avenge herself by being more capricious than before Consequently flinging herself out of the caressing arms of Old Hurricane she exclaimed Uncle I won t be treated with both kicks and half pennies by the same person and so I tell you I am not a cur to be fed with roast beef and beaten with a stick nor nor nor a Turk s slave to be caressed and oppressed as her master likes Such abuse as you heaped upon me I never heard no not even in Rag Alley Oh my dear my dear my dear for heaven s sake forget Rag Alley I won t I vow I ll go back to Rag Alley for a very little more Freedom and peace is even sweeter than wealth and honors Ah but I won t let you my little Cap Then I d have you up before the nearest magistrate to show by what right you detained me Ah ha I wasn t brought up in New York for nothing Whee eu and all this because for her own good I gave my own niece and ward a little gentle admonition Gentle admonition Do you call that gentle admonition Why uncle you are enough to frighten most people to death with your fury You are a perfect dragon a griffin a Russian bear a Bengal tiger a Numidian lion You re all Barnum s beasts in one I declare if I don t write and ask him to send a party down here to catch you for his museum You d draw I tell you Yes especially with you for a keeper to stir me up once in a while with a long pole And that I d engage to do cheap The entrance of missus Condiment with the tea tray put an end to the controversy It was as yet a drawn battle And what about the watch my little Cap Take it back uncle if you please But they won t have it back it has got your initials engraved upon it Look here said the old man holding the watch to her eyes C L N those are not my initials said Capitola looking up with surprise Why so they are not the blamed fools have made a mistake But you ll have to take it Cap No uncle keep it for the present said Capitola who was too honest to take a gift that she felt she did not deserve and yet too proud to confess as much Peace was proclaimed for the present Alas twas but of short continuance During these two days of coolness and enforced quietude Old Hurricane had gathered a store of bad humors that required expenditure So the very next day something went wrong upon the farm and Old Hurricane came storming home driving his overseer poor old meek Billy Ezy and his man Wool before him Bill Ezy was whimpering Wool was sobbing aloud Old Hurricane was roaring at them both as he drove them on before him swearing that Ezy should go and find himself a new home and Wool should go and seek another master And for this cause Old Hurricane was driving them on to his study that he might pay the overseer his last quarter s salary and give the servant a written order to find a master He raged past Capitola in the hall and meeting missus Condiment at the study door ordered her to bring in her account book directly for that he would not be imposed upon any longer but meant to drive all the lazy idle dishonest eye servants and time servers from the house and land What s the matter now said Capitola meeting her Oh child he s in his terrible tantrums again He gets into these ways every once in a while when a young calf perishes or a sheep is stolen or anything goes amiss and then he abuses us all for a pack of loiterers sluggards and thieves and pays us off and orders us off We don t go of course because we know he doesn t mean it still it is very trying to be talked to so Oh I should go but Lord child he s a bear but we love him Just as she spoke the study door opened and Bill Ezy came out sobbing and Wool lifting up his voice and fairly roaring missus Condiment stepped out of the parlor door What s the matter you blockhead she asked of Wool Oh boo hoo woo Ole marse been and done and gone and guv me a line to find an an another boo hoo woo sobbed Wool ready to break his heart Give you a line to find another boo hoo woo I wouldn t do it if I were you Wool said Capitola Give me the paper Wool said missus Condiment taking the permit and tearing it up and adding There now you go home to your quarter and keep out of your old master s sight until he gets over his anger and then you know very well that it will be all right There go along with you Wool quickly got out of the way and made room for the overseer who was sniveling like a whipped schoolboy and to whom the housekeeper said I thought you were wiser than to take this so to heart mister Ezy Oh mum what could you expect An old sarvint as has sarved the major faithful these forty years to be discharged at sixty five Oh hoo ooo oo whimpered the overseer But then you have been discharged so often you ought to be used to it by this time You get discharged just as Wool gets sold about once a month but do you ever go Oh mum but he s in airnest this time deed he is mum terrible in airnest and all about that misfortnet bobtail colt getting stole I know how it wur some of Black Donald s gang as done it as if I could always be on my guard against them devils and he means it this time mum he s terrible in airnest Tut he s always in earnest for as long as it lasts go home to your family and to morrow go about your business as usual Here the study bell rang violently and Old Hurricane s voice was heard calling missus Condiment missus Condiment Oh Lor he s coming cried Bill Ezy running off as fast as his age and grief would let him missus Condiment missus Condiment called the voice Yes sir yes answered the housekeeper hurrying to obey the call Capitola walked up and down the hall for half an hour at the end of which missus Condiment came out with a smile on her lip and a tear in her eye and saying Well Miss Capitola I m paid off and discharged also What for For aiding and abetting the rebels in a word for trying to comfort poor Ezy and Wool And are you going Certainly not I shan t budge I would not treat the old man so badly as to take him at his word And with a strange smile missus Condiment hurried away just in time to escape Old Hurricane who came raving out of the study Get out of my way you beggar he cried pushing past Capitola and hurrying from the house Well I declare that was pleasant thought Cap as she entered the parlor missus Condiment what will he say when he comes back and finds you all here still she asked Say Nothing After this passion is over he will be so exhausted that he will not be able to get up another rage in two or three days Where has he gone To Tip Top and alone too he was so mad with poor Wool that he wouldn t even permit him to attend Alone Has he gone alone Oh won t I give him a dose when he comes back thought Capitola Meanwhile Old Hurricane stormed along toward Tip Top lashing off the poor dogs that wished to follow him and cutting at every living thing that crossed his path His business at the village was to get bills printed and posted offering an additional reward for the apprehension of the marauding outlaw Black Donald That day he dined at the village tavern The Antlers by mister Merry and differed disputed or quarrelled as the case might be with every man with whom he came in contact Toward evening he set off for home It was much later than his usual hour for returning but he felt weary exhausted and indisposed to come into his own dwelling where his furious temper had created so much unhappiness Thus though it was very late he did not hurry he almost hoped that every one might be in bed when he should return The moon was shining brightly when he passed the gate and rode up the evergreen avenue to the horse block in front of the house There he dismounted and walked up into the piazza where a novel vision met his surprised gaze It was Capitola walking up and down the floor with rapid almost masculine strides and apparently in a state of great excitement Oh is it you my little Cap Good evening my dear he said very kindly Capitola pulled up in her striding walk wheeled around faced him drew up her form folded her arms threw back her head set her teeth and glared at him What the demon do you mean by that cried Old Hurricane Sir she exclaimed bringing down one foot with a sharp stamp sir how dare you have the impudence to face me much less the the the the brass the bronze the copper to speak to me Why what in the name of all the lunatics in Bedlam does the girl mean Is she crazy exclaimed the old man gazing upon her in astonishment Capitola turned and strode furiously up and down the piazza and then stopping suddenly and facing him with a sharp stamp of her foot exclaimed Old gentleman Tell me instantly and without prevarication where have you been To the demon with you What do you mean Have you taken leave of your senses demanded Old Hurricane Capitola strode up and down the floor a few times and stopping short and shaking her fist exclaimed Didn t you know you headstrong reckless desperate frantic veteran didn t you know the jeopardy in which you placed yourself in riding out alone at this hour Suppose three or four great runaway negresses had sprung out of the bushes and and and She broke off apparently for want of breath and strode up and down the floor then pausing suddenly before him with a stern stamp of her foot and a fierce glare of her eye she continued You shouldn t have come back here any more No dishonored old man should have entered the house of which I call myself the mistress Oh I take I take ha ha ha Good Cap good You are holding up the glass before me but your mirror is not quite large enough to reflect Old Hurricane my dear I owe one said the old man as he passed into the house followed by his capricious favorite CHAPTER XVIII THE DOCTOR S DAUGHTER Oh her smile it seemed half holy As if drawn from thoughts more far Than our common jestings are And if any painter drew her He would paint her unaware With a hallow round her hair E B Browning On the appointed day Traverse took his way to Willow Heights to keep his tryst and enter upon his medical studies in the good doctor s office He was anxious also to know if his patron had as yet thought of any plan by which his mother might better her condition He was met at the door by little Mattie the parlor maid who told him to walk right up stairs into the study where her master was expecting him Traverse went up quietly and opened the door of that pleasant study room to which the reader has already been introduced and the windows of which opened upon the upper front piazza Now however as it was quite cold the windows were down though the blinds were open and through them streamed the golden rays of the morning sun that fell glistening upon the fair hair and white raiment of a young girl who sat reading before the fire The doctor was not in the room and Traverse in his native modesty was just about to retreat when the young creature looked up from her book and seeing him arose with a smile and came forward saying You are the young man whom my father was expecting I presume Sit down he has stepped out but will be in again very soon Now Traverse being unaccustomed to the society of young ladies felt excessively bashful when suddenly coming into the presence of this refined and lovely girl With a low bow and a deep blush he took the chair she placed for him With natural politeness she closed her book and addressed herself to entertaining him I have heard that your mother is an invalid I hope she is better I thank you yes ma am miss stammered Traverse in painful embarrassment Understanding the mauvaise honte of the bashful boy and seeing that her efforts to entertain only troubled him she placed the newspapers on the table before him saying Here are the morning journals if you would like to look over them mister Rocke and then she resumed her book I thank you miss replied the youth taking up a paper more for the purpose of covering up his embarrassment than for any other mister Rocke Traverse was seventeen years of age and had never been called mister Rocke before This young girl was the very first to compliment him with the manly title and he felt a boyish gratitude to her and a harmless wish that his well brushed Sunday suit of black was not quite so rusty and threadbare tempered by an innocent exultation in the thought that no gentleman in the land could exhibit fresher linen brighter shoes or cleaner hands than himself But not many seconds were spent in such egotism He stole a glance at his lovely companion sitting on the opposite side of the fireplace he was glad to see that she was already deeply engaged in reading for it enabled him to observe her without embarrassment or offense He had scarcely dared to look at her before and had no distinct idea of her beauty There has been for him only a vague dazzling vision of a golden haired girl in floating white raiment wafting the fragrance of violets as she moved and with a voice sweeter than the notes of the cushat dove as she spoke Now he saw that the golden hair flowed in ringlets around a fair roseate face soft and bright with feeling and intelligence As her dark blue eyes followed the page a smile intense with meaning deepened the expression of her countenance That intense smile it was like her father s only lovelier more heavenly That intense smile it had even on the old doctor s face an inexpressible charm for Traverse but on the lovely young face of his daughter it exercised an ineffable fascination So earnest and so unconscious became the gaze of poor Traverse that he was only brought to a sense of propriety by the opening of the door and the entrance of the doctor who exclaimed Ah here already Traverse That is punctual This is my daughter Clara Traverse Clare this is Traverse you ve heard me speak about But I daresay you ve already become acquainted concluded the doctor drawing his chair up to the reading table sitting down and folding his dressing gown around his limbs Well Traverse how is the little mother he presently inquired I was just telling Miss Day that she was much better sir said Traverse Ah ha ha ha muttered the doctor to himself that s kitchen physic roast turkey and port wine and moral medicine hope and mental medicine sympathy Well Traverse he said aloud I have been racking my brain for a plan for your mother and to no purpose Traverse your mother should be in a home of peace plenty and cheerfulness I can speak before my little Clare here I never have any secrets from her Your mother wants good living cheerful company and freedom from toil and care The situation of gentleman s or lady s housekeeper in some home of abundance where she would be esteemed as a member of the family would suit her But where to find such a place I have been inquiring without mentioning her name of course among all my friends but not one of them wants a housekeeper or knows a soul who does want one and so I am at sea on the subject I m ashamed of myself for not succeeding better Oh sir do not do yourself so great an injustice said Traverse Well the fact is after boasting so confidently that I would find a good situation for missus Rocke lo and behold I have proved myself as yet only a boaster Father said Clara turning upon him her sweet eyes Well my love Perhaps missus Rocke would do us the favor to come here and take charge of our household Eh What I never thought of that I never had a housekeeper in my life exclaimed the doctor No sir because you never needed one before but now we really do Aunt Moggy has been a very faithful and efficient manager although she is a colored woman but she is getting very old Yes and deaf and blind and careless I know she is I have no doubt in the world she scours the coppers with the table napkins and washes her face and hands in the soup tureen Oh father said Clara Well Clare at least she wants looking after Father she wants rest in her old age No doubt of it no doubt of it And father I intend of course in time to be your housekeeper but having spent all my life in a boarding school I know very little about domestic affairs and I require a great deal of instruction so I really do think that there is no one needs missus Rocke s assistance more than we do and if she will do us the favor to come we cannot do better than to engage her To be sure to be sure Lord bless my soul to think it should never have entered my stupid old head until it was put there by Clare Here I was searching blindly all over the country for a situation for missus Rocke and wanting her all the time more than any one else That s the way Traverse that s the way with us all my boy While we are looking away off yonder for the solution of our difficulties the remedy is all the time lying just under our noses But so close to our eyes father that we cannot see it said Clara Just so Clare just so You are always ahead of me in ideas Now Traverse when you go home this evening you shall take a note to your mother setting forth our wishes mine and Clara s if she accedes to them she will make us very happy With a great deal of manly strength of mind Traverse had all his mother s tenderness of heart It was with difficulty that he could keep back his tears or control his voice while he answered I remember reading sir that the young queen of England when she came to her throne wished to provide handsomely for an orphan companion of her childhood and seeing that no office in her household suited the young person she created one for her benefit Sir I believe you have made one for my mother Not at all not at all If she doesn t come to look after our housekeeping old Moggy will be greasing our griddles with tallow candle ends next If you don t believe me ask Clara ask Clara Not believe him If the doctor had affirmed that the moon was made of moldy cheese Traverse would have deemed it his duty to stoutly maintain that astronomical theory He felt hurt that the doctor should use such a phrase Yes indeed we really do need her Traverse said the doctor s daughter Traverse It had made him proud to hear her call him for the first time in his life mister Rocke but it made him deeply happy to hear her call him Traverse It had such a sisterly sound coming from this sweet creature How he wished that she really were his sister But then the idea of that fair golden haired blue eyed white robed angel being the sister of such a robust rugged sunburned boy as himself The thought was so absurd extravagant impossible that the poor boy heaved an unconscious sigh Why what s the matter Traverse What are you thinking of so intently Of your great goodness sir among other things Tut let s hear no more of that I pleased myself said the doctor and now Traverse let s go to work decently and in order But first let me settle this point if your good little mother determines in our favor Traverse then of course you will live with us also so I shall have my young medical assistant always at hand That will be very convenient and then we shall have no more long lonesome evenings Clara shall we dear And now Traverse I will mark out your course of study and set you to work at once Shall I leave the room father inquired Clara No no my dear certainly not I have not had you home so long as to get tired of the sight of you yet No Clare no you are not in our way is she Traverse Oh sir the idea stammered Traverse blushing deeply to be so appealed to In his way Why a pang had shot through his bosom at the very mention of her going Very well then Here Traverse here are your books You are to begin with this one keep this medical dictionary at hand for reference Bless me it will bring back my student days to go over the ground with you my boy Clara took her work box and sat down to stitch a pair of dainty wristbands for her father s shirts The doctor took up the morning papers Traverse opened his book and commenced his readings It was a quiet but by no means a dull circle Occasionally Clara and her father exchanged words and once in a while the doctor looked over his pupil s shoulder or gave him a direction Traverse studied con amore and with intelligent appreciation The presence of the doctor s lovely daughter far from disturbing him calmed and steadied his soul into a state of infinite content If the presence of the beautiful girl was ever to become an agitating element the hour had not yet come So passed the time until the dinner bell rang By the express stipulation of the doctor himself it was arranged that Traverse should always dine with his family After dinner an hour which the doctor called a digestive hour was spent in loitering about and then the studies were resumed At six o clock in the evening Traverse took leave of the doctor and his fair daughter and started for home Be sure to persuade your mother to come Traverse said Clara She will not need persuasion she will be only too glad to come miss said Traverse with a deep bow turning and hurrying away toward home With winged feet he ran down the wooded hill and got into the highway and hastened on with such speed that in half an hour he reached his mother s little cottage He was agog with joy and eagerness to tell her the good news CHAPTER XIX THE RESIGNED SOUL This day be bread and peace my lot All else beneath the sun Thou knowest if best bestowed or not And let thy will be done Pope Poor Marah Rocke had schooled her soul to resignation had taught herself just to do the duty of each day as it came and leave the future where indeed it must always remain in the hands of God Since the doctor s delicate and judicious kindness had cherished her life some little health and cheerfulness had returned to her Upon this particular evening of the day upon which Traverse entered upon his medical studies she felt very hopeful The little cottage fire burned brightly the hearth was swept clean the tea kettle was singing over the blaze the tiny tea table with its two cups and saucers and two plates and knives was set everything was neat comfortable and cheerful for Traverse s return Marah sat in her little low chair putting the finishing touches to a set of fine shirts She was not anxiously looking for her son for he had told her that he should stay at the doctor s until six o clock therefore she did not expect him until seven But so fast had Traverse walked that just as the minute hand pointed to half past six the latch was raised and Traverse ran in his face flushed with joy The first thing he did was to run to his mother fling his arms around her neck and kiss her Then he threw himself into his chair to take breath Now then what s the matter Traverse You look as if somebody had left you a fortune And so they have or as good as done so exclaimed Traverse panting for breath What in the world do you mean exclaimed Marah her thoughts naturally flying to Old Hurricane and suggesting his possible repentance or relenting Read that mother read that said Traverse eagerly putting a note into her hand She opened it and read Willow Heights Monday Dear Madam My little daughter Clara fourteen years of age has just returned from boarding school to pursue her studies at home Among other things she must learn domestic affairs of which she knows nothing If you will accept the position of housekeeper and matronly companion of my daughter I will make the terms such as shall reconcile you to the change We shall also do all that we can to make you happy Traverse will explain to you the details Take time to think of it but if possible let us have your answer by Traverse when he comes to morrow If you accede to this proposition you will give my daughter and myself sincere satisfaction Yours truly WILLIAM DAY Marah finished reading and raised her eyes full of amazement to the face of her son Mother said Traverse speaking fast and eagerly they say they really cannot do without you They have troops of servants but the old cook is in her dotage and does all sorts of strange things such as frying buckwheat cakes in lamp oil and the like Oh hush what exaggeration Well I don t say she does that exactly but she isn t equal to her situation without a housekeeper to look after her and they want you very much indeed And what is to become of your home if I break up suggested the mother Oh that is the very best of it The doctor says if you consent to come that I must also live there and that then he can have his medical assistant always at hand which will be very convenient Marah smiled dubiously I do not understand it but one thing I do know Traverse There is not such a man as the doctor appears in this world more than once in a hundred years Not in a thousand years mother and as for his daughter oh you should see Miss Clara mother Her father calls her Clare Clare Day how the name suits her She is so fair and bright with such a warm thoughtful sunny smile that goes right to your heart Her face is indeed like a clear day and her beautiful smile is the sunshine that lights it up said the enthusiastic youth whose admiration was as yet too simple and single hearted and unselfish to tie his tongue The mother smiled at his earnestness smiled without the least misgiving for to her apprehension the youth was still a boy to wonder at and admire beauty without being in the least danger of having his peace of mind disturbed by love And as yet her idea of him was just And mother of course you will go said Traverse Oh I do not know The proposition was so sudden and unexpected and is so serious and important that I must take time to reflect said missus Rocke thoughtfully How much time mother Will until to morrow morning do It must little mother because I promised to carry your consent back with me Indeed I did mother exclaimed the impatient boy missus Rocke dropped her head upon her hand as was her custom when in deep thought Presently she said Travy I m afraid this is not a genuine offer of a situation of housekeeper I m afraid that it is only a ruse to cover a scheme of benevolence and that they don t really want me and I should only be in their way Now mother I do assure you they do want you Think of that young girl and elderly gentleman Can either of them take charge of a large establishment like that of Willow Heights Well argued Traverse but granting that they need a housekeeper how do I know I would suit them Why you may take their own words for that mother But how can they know I am afraid they would be disappointed Wait until they complain mother I don t believe they ever would I don t believe they ever would have cause Well granting also that I should suit them the mother paused and sighed Traverse filled up the blank by saying I suppose you mean if you should suit them they might not suit you No I do not mean that I am sure they would suit me but there is one in the world who may one day come to reason and take bitter umbrage at the fact that I should accept a subordinate situation in any household murmured missus Rocke almost unconsciously Then that one in the world whoever he she or it may be had better place you above the necessity or else hold his her or its tongue Mother I think that goods thrown in our way by Providence had better be accepted leaving the consequences to Him Traverse dear I shall pray over this matter to night and sleep on it and He to whom even the fall of a sparrow is not indifferent will guide me said missus Rocke and here the debate ended The remainder of the evening was spent in laudation of Clare Day and in writing a letter to Herbert Greyson at West Point in which all these laudations were reiterated and in the course of which Traverse wrote these innocent words I have known Clare Day scarcely twelve hours and I admire her as much as I love you and oh Herbert If you could only rise to be a major general and marry Clare Day I should be the happiest fellow alive Would Traverse as willingly dispose of Clare s hand a year or two after this time I trow not The next morning after breakfast missus Rocke gave in her decision Tell the doctor Traverse she said that I understand and appreciate his kindness that I will not break up my humble home as yet but I will lock up my house and come a month on trial If I can perform the duties of the situation satisfactorily well and good I will remain if not why then having my home still in possession I can return to it Wise little mother She will not cut down the bridge behind her exclaimed Traverse joyfully as he bade his mother good by for the day and hastened up to Willow Heights with her answer This answer was received by the good doctor and his lovely daughter with delight as unfeigned as it was unselfish They were pleased to have a good housekeeper but they were far better pleased to offer a poor struggling mother a comfortable and even luxurious home On the next Monday morning missus Rocke having completed all her arrangements and closed up the house entered upon the duties of her new situation Clara gave her a large airy bed chamber for her own use communicating with a smaller one for the use of her son besides this as housekeeper she had of course the freedom of the whole house Traverse watched with anxious vigilance to find out whether the efforts of his mother really improved the condition of the housekeeping and was delighted to find that the coffee was clearer and finer flavored the bread whiter and lighter the cream richer the butter fresher and the beefsteak juicier than he had ever known them to be on the doctor s table that on the dinner table from day to day dishes succeeded each other in a well ordered variety and well dressed style in a word that in every particular the comfort of the family was greatly enhanced by the presence of the housekeeper and that the doctor and his daughter knew it While the doctor and his student were engaged in the library Clara spent many hours of the morning in missus Rocke s company learning the arts of domestic economy and considerably assisting her in the preparation of delicate dishes In the evening the doctor Clara missus Rocke and Traverse gathered around the fire as one family missus Rocke and Clara engaged in needlework and the doctor or Traverse in reading aloud for their amusement some agreeable book Sometimes Clara would richly entertain them with music singing and accompanying herself upon the piano An hour before bedtime the servants were always called in and general family prayer offered up Thus passed the quiet pleasant profitable days Traverse was fast falling into a delicious dream from which as yet no rude shock threatened to wake him Willow Heights seemed to him Paradise its inmates angels and his own life beatitude CHAPTER XX THE OUTLAW S RENDEZVOUS Our plots fall short like darts which rash hands throw With an ill aim and have too far to go Nor can we long discoveries prevent God is too much about the innocent Sir Robert Howard The Old Road Inn described in the dying deposition of poor Nancy Grewell was situated some miles from Hurricane Hall by the side of a forsaken turnpike in the midst of a thickly wooded long and narrow valley shut in by two lofty ranges of mountains Once this turnpike was lively with travel and this inn gay with custom but for the last twenty five years since the highway had been turned off in another direction both road and tavern had been abandoned and suffered to fall to ruin The road was washed and furrowed into deep and dangerous gullies and obstructed by fallen timber the house was disfigured by moldering walls broken chimneys and patched windows Had any traveler lost himself and chanced to have passed that way he might have seen a little old dried up woman sitting knitting at one of the windows She was known by those who were old enough to remember her and her home as Granny Raven the daughter of the last proprietor of the inn She was reputed to be dumb but none could speak with certainty of the fact In truth for as far back as the memory of the oldest inhabitant could reach she had been feared disliked and avoided as one of malign reputation indeed the ignorant and superstitious believed her to possess the evil eye and to be gifted with second sight But of late years as the old road and the old inn were quite forsaken so the old beldame was quite forgotten It was one evening a few weeks after Capitola s fearful adventure in the forest that this old woman carefully closed up every door and window in the front of the house stopping every crevice through which a ray of light might gleam and warn that impossible phenomenon a chance traveler on the old road of life within the habitation Having so to speak hermetically sealed the front of the house she betook herself to a large back kitchen This kitchen was strangely and rudely furnished having an extra broad fireplace with the recesses on each side of the chimney filled with oaken shelves laden with strong pewter plates dishes and mugs all along the walls were arranged rude oaken benches down the length of the room was left always standing a long deal table capable of accommodating from fifteen to twenty guests On entering this kitchen Granny Raven struck a light kindled a fire and began to prepare a large supper Nor unlike the ill omened bird whose name she bore did this old beldame look in her close clinging black gown and flapping black cape and hood and with her sharp eyes hooked nose and protruding chin Having put a huge sirloin of beef before the fire she took down a pile of pewter plates and arranged them along on the sides of the table then to every plate she placed a pewter mug A huge wheaten loaf of bread a great roll of butter and several plates of pickles were next put upon the board and when all was ready the old woman sat down to the patient turning of the spit She had not been thus occupied more than twenty minutes when a hasty scuffling step was heard at the back of the house accompanied by a peculiar whistle immediately under the window That s Headlong Hal for a penny He never can learn the cat s tread thought the crone as she arose and withdrew the bolt of the back door A little dark skinned black eyed black haired thin and wiry man came hurrying in exclaiming How now old girl supper ready She shook her head pointed to the roasting beef lifted up both hands with the ten fingers spread out twice and then made a rotary motion with one arm Oh you mean it will be done in twenty turns but hang me if I understand your dumb show half the time Have none of the men come yet She put her fingers together flung her hands widely apart in all directions brought them slowly together again and pointed to the supper table Um That is to say they are dispersed about their business but will all be here to night She nodded Where s the captain n She pointed over her left shoulder upwards placed her two hands out broad from her temples then made a motion as of lifting and carrying a basket and displaying goods Humph humph gone to Tip top to sell goods disguised as a peddler She nodded And before he could put another question a low soft mew was heard at the door There s Stealthy Steve he might walk with hob nailed high lows upon a gravelly road and you would never hear his footfall said the man as the door noiselessly opened and shut a soft footed low voiced subtle looking mulatto entered the kitchen and gave good evening to its occupants Ha I m devilish glad you ve come Steve for hang me if I m not tired to death trying to talk to this crone who to the charms of old age and ugliness adds that of dumbness Seen the cap n No he s gone out to hear the people talk and find out what they think of him Hal burst into a loud and scornful laugh saying I should think it would not require much seeking to discover that Here the old woman came forward and by signs managed to inquire whether he had brought her the tea Steve drew a packet from his pocket saying softly Yes mother when I was in Spicer s store I saw this lying with other things on the counter and remembering you quietly put it into my pocket The old crone s eyes danced She seized the packet patted the excellent thief on the shoulder wagged her head deridingly at the delinquent one and hobbled off to prepare her favorite beverage While she was thus occupied the whistle was once more heard at the door followed by the entrance of a man decidedly the most repulsive looking of the whole party a man one having a full pocket would scarcely like to meet on a lonely road in a dark night In form he was of Dutch proportions short but stout with a large round head covered with stiff sandy hair broad flat face coarse features pale half closed eyes and an expression of countenance strangely made up of elements as opposite as they were forbidding a mixture of stupidity and subtlety cowardice and ferocity caution and cruelty His name in the gang was Demon Dick a sobriquet of which he was eminently deserving and characteristically proud He came in sulkily neither saluting the company nor returning their salutations He pulled a chair to the fire threw himself into it and ordered the old woman to draw him a mug of ale Dick s in a bad humor to night murmured Steve softly When was he ever in a good one roughly broke forth Hal H sh said Steve glancing at Dick who with a hideous expression was listening to the conversation There s the cap n exclaimed Hal as a ringing footstep sounded outside followed by the abrupt opening of the door and entrance of the leader Setting down a large basket and throwing off a broad brimmed Quaker hat and broad skirted overcoat Black Donald stood roaring with laughter Black Donald from his great stature might have been a giant walked out of the age of fable into the middle of the nineteenth century From his stature alone he might have been chosen leader of this band of desperadoes He stood six feet eight inches in his boots and was stout and muscular in proportion He had a well formed stately head fine aquiline features dark complexion strong steady dark eyes and an abundance of long curling black hair and beard that would have driven to despair a Broadway beau broken the heart of a Washington belle or made his own fortune in any city of America as a French count or a German baron He had decidedly the air noble and distinguished While he threw his broad brim in one direction and his broad coat in another and gave way to peals of laughter Headlong Hal said Cap n I don t know what you think of it but I think it just as churlish to laugh alone as to get drunk in solitude Oh you shall laugh You shall all laugh Wait until I tell you But first answer me Does not my broad skirted gray coat and broad brimmed gray hat make me look about twelve inches shorter and broader That s so cap n And when I bury my black beard and chin deep down in this drab neck cloth and pull the broad brim low over my black hair and eyes I look as mild and respectable as William Penn Yea verily friend Donald said Hal Well in this meek guise I went peddling to day Aye cap n we knew it and you ll go once too often I have gone just once too often I knew it We said so D n were some of the ejaculations as the members of the band sprang to their feet and handled secret arms Pshaw put up your knives and pistols There is no danger I was not traced our rendezvous is still a secret for which the government would pay a thousand dollars How then do you say that you went once too often cap n It was inaccurate I should have said that I had gone for the last time for that it would not be safe to venture again Come I must tell you the whole story But in the mean time let us have supper Mother Raven dish the beef Dick draw the ale Hal cut the bread Steve carve Bestir yourselves burn you or you shall have no story exclaimed the captain flinging himself into a chair at the head of the table When his orders had been obeyed and the men were gathered around the table and the first draught of ale had been quaffed by all Black Donald asked Where do you think I went peddling to day Devil knows said Hal That s a secret between the Demon and Black Donald said Dick Hush he s about to tell us murmured Steve Wooden heads you d never guess I went I went to do you give it up I went right straight into the lion s jaws not only into the very clutches but into the very teeth and down the very throat of the lion and have come out as safe as Jonah from the whale s belly In a word I have been up to the county seat where the court is now in session and sold cigar cases snuff boxes and smoking caps to the grand and petit jury and a pair of gold spectacles to the learned judge himself No No No exclaimed Hal Steve and Dick in a breath Yes and moreover I offered a pair of patent steel spring handcuffs to the sheriff John Keepe in person and pressed him to purchase them assuring him that he would have occasion for their use if ever he caught that grand rascal Black Donald Ah the atrocious villain if I thought I should ever have the satisfaction of springing them upon his wrists I d buy them at my own proper cost said the sheriff taking them in his hands and examining them curiously Ah he s a man of Belial that same Black Donald thee d better buy the handcuffs John said I Nay friend I don t know and as for Black Donald we have some hopes of taking the wretch at last said the simple gentleman Ah verily John that s a good hearing for peaceful travelers like myself said I Excellent excellent For when that fell marauder once swings from the gallows His neck will be broken John Yes friend yes probably after which honest men may travel in safety Ah never have I adjusted a hempen cravat about the throat of any aspirant for such an honor with less pain than I shall officiate at the last toilet of Black Donald If thee catch him Exactly friend if I catch him but the additional reward offered by Major Warfield together with the report that he often frequents our towns and villages in disguise will stimulate people to renewed efforts to discover and capture him said the sheriff Ah that will be a great day for Alleghany And when Black Donald is hanged I shall make an effort to be present at the solemnity myself Do friend said the sheriff and I will see to getting you a good place for witnessing the proceedings I have no doubt thee will John a very good place And I assure thee that there will not be one present more interested in those proceedings than myself said I Of course that is very natural for there is no one more in danger from these marauders than men of your itinerant calling Good heavens It was but three years ago a peddler was robbed and murdered in the woods around the Hidden House Just so John said I and it s my opinion that often when I ve been traveling along the road at night Black Donald hasn t been far off But tell me John so that I may have a chance of earning that thousand dollars what disguises does this son of Moloch take Why friend it is said that he appears as a Methodist missionary going about selling tracts and sometimes as a knife grinder and sometimes simulates your calling as a peddler said the unsuspicious sheriff I thought however it was time to be off so I said Thee had better let me sell thee those handcuffs John Allow me I will show thee their beautiful machinery Hold out thy wrists if thee pleases John The unsuspicious officer with a face brimful of interest held out his wrists for experiment I snapped the ornaments on them in a little less than no time and took up my pack and disappeared before the sheriff had collected his faculties and found out his position Ha ha ha Haw haw haw Ho ho ho laughed the outlaws in every key of laughter And so our captain instead of being pinioned by the sheriff turned the tables and actually manacled his honor Hip hip hurrah Three times three for the merry captain that manacled the sheriff Hush burn ye There s some one coming exclaimed the captain rising and listening It is Le Noir who was to meet me here to night on important business CHAPTER XXI GABRIEL LE NOIR Naught s had all s spent When our desires are gained without content Shakespeare The colonel exclaimed the three men in a breath as the door opened and a tall handsome and distinguished looking gentleman wrapped in a black military cloak and having his black beaver pulled low over his brow strode into the room All arose upon their feet to greet him as though he had been a prince With a haughty wave of the hand he bade them resume their seats and beckoning their leader said Donald I would have a word with you At your command colonel said the outlaw rising and taking a candle and leading the way into the adjoining room the same in which fourteen years before old Granny Grewell and the child had been detained Setting the candle upon the mantelpiece Black Donald stood waiting for the visitor to open the conversation a thing that the latter seemed in no hurry to do for he began walking up and down the room in stern silence You seem disturbed colonel at length said the outlaw I am disturbed more than disturbed I am suffering Suffering colonel Aye suffering From what think you The pangs of remorse Remorse Ha ha ha ha ha laughed the outlaw till all the rafters rang Aye man you may laugh but I repeat that I am tortured with remorse And for what do you suppose For those acts of self preservation that fanatics and fools would stigmatize as crimes No my good fellow no but for one unacted crime I told your honor so cried the outlaw triumphantly Donald when I go to church as I do constantly I hear the preacher prating of repentance but man I never knew the meaning of the word until recently And I can almost guess what it is that has enlightened your honor said the outlaw Yes it is that miserable old woman and babe Donald in every vein of my soul I repent not having silenced them both forever while they were yet in my power Just so colonel the dead never come back or if they do are not recognized as property holders in this world I wish your honor had taken my advice and sent that woman and child on a longer journey Donald I was younger then than now I shrank from bloodshed said the man in a husky voice Bah superstition Bloodshed blood is shed every day We kill to live say the butchers So do we Every creature preys upon some other creature weaker than himself the big beasts eat up the little ones artful men live on the simple So be it The world was made for the strong and cunning Let the weak and foolish look to themselves said the outlaw with a loud laugh While he spoke the visitor resumed his rapid restless striding up and down the room Presently he came again to the side of the robber and whispered Donald that girl has returned to the neighborhood brought back by old Warfield My son met her in the woods a month ago fell into conversation with her heard her history or as much of it as she herself knows Her name is Capitola She is the living image of her mother How she came under the notice of old Warfield to what extent he is acquainted with her birth and rights what proofs may be in his possession I know not All that I have discovered after the strictest inquiry that I was enabled to make is this that the old beggar woman that died and was buried at Major Warfield s expense was no other than Nancy Grewell returned that the night before she died she sent for Major Warfield and had a long talk with him and that shortly afterward the old scoundrel traveled to the north and brought home this girl Humph it is an ugly business your honor especially with your honor s little prejudice against Donald this is no time for weakness I have gone too far to stop Capitola must die That s so colonel the pity is that it wasn t found out fourteen years ago It is so much easier to pinch a baby s nose until it falls asleep than to stifle a young girl s shrieks and cries then the baby would not have been missed but the young girl will be sure to be inquired after I know that there will be additional risk but there shall be the larger compensation larger than your most sanguine hopes would suggest Donald listen said the colonel stooping and whispering low the day that you bring me undeniable proofs that Capitola Le Noir is dead you finger one thousand dollars Ha ha ha laughed the outlaw in angry scorn Capitola Le Noir is the sole heiress of a fortune in land negroes coal mines iron foundries railway shares and bank stock of half a million of dollars and you ask me to get her out of your way for a thousand dollars I ll do it you know I will Ha ha ha Why the government doesn t value your whole carcass at more than I offer you for the temporary use of your hands you villain frowned the colonel No ill names your honor between us they are like kicking guns apt to recoil You forget that you are in my power I remember that your honor is in mine Ha ha ha The day Black Donald stands at the bar the honorable Colonel Le Noir will probably be beside him Enough of this Confound you do you take me for one of your pals No your worship my pals are too poor to hire their work done but then they are brave enough to do it themselves Enough of this I say Name the price of this new service Ten thousand dollars five thousand in advance the remainder when the deed is accomplished Extortioner Shameless ruthless extortioner Your honor will fall into that vulgar habit of calling ill names It isn t worth while It doesn t pay If your honor doesn t like my terms you needn t employ me What is certain is that I cannot work for less You take advantage of my necessities Not at all but the truth is Colonel that I am tired of this sort of life and wish to retire from active business Besides every man has his ambition and I have mine I wish to emigrate to the glorious West settle marry turn my attention to politics be elected to Congress then to the Senate then to the Cabinet then to the White House for success in which career I flatter myself nature and education have especially fitted me Ten thousand dollars will give me a fair start Many a successful politician your honor knows has started on less character and less capital To this impudent slander the colonel made no answer With his arms folded and his head bowed upon his chest he walked moodily up and down the length of the apartment Then muttering Why should I hesitate he came to the side of the outlaw and said I agree to your terms accomplish the work and the sum shall be yours Meet me here on to morrow evening to receive the earnest money In the meantime in order to make sure of the girl s identity it will be necessary for you to get sight of her beforehand at her home if possible find out her habits and her haunts where she walks or rides when she is most likely to be alone and so on Be very careful A mistake might be fatal Your honor may trust me And now good by remember to morrow evening said the colonel as wrapping himself closely in his dark cloak and pulling his hat low over his eyes he passed out by the back passage door and left the house Ha ha ha Why does that man think it needful to look so villainous If I were to go about in such a bandit like dress as that every child I met would take me for what I am laughed Black Donald returning to his comrades During the next hour other members of the band dropped in until some twenty men were collected together in the large kitchen around the long table where the remainder of the night was spent in revelry CHAPTER XXII THE SMUGGLER AND CAPITOLA Come buy of me come buy come buy Buy lads or else the lassies cry I have lawns as white as snow Silk as black as e er was crow Gloves as sweet as damask roses Veils for faces musk for noses Pins and needles made of steel All you need from head to heel Shakespeare If I am not allowed to walk or ride out alone I shall gang daft I know I shall Was ever such a dull lonesome humdrum place as this same Hurricane Hall complained Cap as she sat sewing with missus Condiment in the housekeeper s room You don t like this quiet country life inquired missus Condiment No no better than I do a quiet country graveyard I don t want to return to dust before my time I tell you said Cap yawning dismally over her work I hear you vixen roared the voice of Old Hurricane who presently came storming in and saying If you want a ride go and get ready quickly and come with me I am going down to the water mill please the Lord to warn Hopkins off the premises worthless villain Had my grain there since yesterday morning and hasn t sent it home yet Shan t stay in my mill another month Come Cap be off with you and get ready The girl did not need a second bidding but flew to prepare herself while the old man ordered the horses In ten minutes more Capitola and Major Warfield cantered away They had been gone about two hours and it was almost time to expect their return and missus Condiment had just given orders for the tea table to be set when Wool came into her room and said there was a sailor at the hall door with some beautiful foreign goods which he wished to show to the ladies of the house A sailor Wool a sailor with foreign goods for sale I am very much afraid he s one of these smugglers I ve heard tell of and I m not sure about the right of buying from smugglers However I suppose there s no harm in looking at his goods You may call him in Wool said the old lady tampering with temptation He do look like a smudgeler dat s a fact said Wool whose ideas of the said craft were purely imaginary I don t know him to be a smuggler and it s wrong to judge particularly beforehand said the old lady nursing ideas of rich silks and satins imported free of duty and sold at half price and trying to deceive herself While she was thus thinking the door opened and Wool ushered in a stout jolly looking tar dressed in a white pea jacket duck trousers and tarpaulin hat and carrying in his hand a large pack He took off his hat and scraped his foot behind him and remained standing before the housekeeper with his head tied up in a red bandana handkerchief and his chin sunken in a red comforter that was wound around his throat Sit down my good man and rest while you show me the goods said missus Condiment who whether he were smuggler or not was inclined to show the traveler all lawful kindness The sailor scraped his foot again sat down on a low chair put his hat on one side drew the pack before him untied it and first displayed a rich golden hued fabric saying Now here ma am is a rich China silk I bought in the streets of Shanghai where the long legged chickens come from Come now I ll ship it off cheap Oh that is a great deal too gay and handsome for an old woman like me said missus Condiment Well ma am perhaps there s young ladies in the fleet Now this would rig out a smart young craft as gay as a clipper Better take it ma am I ll ship it off cheap Wool said missus Condiment turning to the servant go down to the kitchen and call up the house servants perhaps they would like to buy something As soon as Wool had gone and the good woman was left alone with the sailor she stooped and said I did not wish to inquire before the servant man but my good sir I do not know whether it is right to buy from you Why so ma am asked the sailor with an injured look Why I am afraid I am very much afraid you risk your life and liberty in an unlawful trade Oh ma am on my soul these things are honestly come by and you have no right to accuse me said the sailor with a look of subdued indignation I know I haven t and I meant no harm but did these goods pass through the custom house Oh ma am now that s not a fair question It is as I suspected I cannot buy from you my good friend I do not judge you I don t know whether smuggling is right or wrong but I know that it is unlawful and I cannot feel free to encourage any man in a traffic in which he risks his life and liberty poor fellow Oh ma am said the sailor evidently on the brink of bursting into laughter if we risk our lives sure it s our own business and if you ve no scruples on your own account you needn t have any on ours While he was speaking the sound of many shuffling feet was heard along the passage and the room was soon half filled with colored people come in to deal with the sailor You may look at these goods but you must not buy anything Lor missus why asked little Pitapat Because I want you to lay out all your money with my friend mister Crash at Tip Top But after de good gemman has had de trouble said Pitapat He shall have his supper and a mug of ale and go on his journey said missus Condiment The sailor arose and scraped his foot behind him in acknowledgment of this kindness and began to unpack his wares and display them all over the floor And while the servants in wonder and delight examined these treasures and inquired their prices a fresh young voice was heard carolling along the hall and the next moment Capitola in her green riding habit and hat entered the room She turned her mischievous gray eyes about pursed up her lips and asked missus Condiment if she were about to open a fancy bazaar No my dear Miss Capitola It is a sailor with foreign goods for sale answered the old lady A sailor with foreign goods for sale Umph yes I know Isn t he a smuggler whispered Capitola Indeed I m afraid so my dear in fact he don t deny it whispered back the matron Well I think it s strange a man that smuggles can t lie Well I don t know my dear may be he thinks it s no harm to smuggle and he knows it would be a sin to lie But where is your uncle Miss Capitola Gone around to the stable to blow Jem up for mounting on a lame horse He swears Jem shall find another master before to morrow s sun sets But now I want to talk to that bold buccaneer Say you sir show me your foreign goods I m very fond of smugglers myself You are right my dear young lady You would give poor sailors some little chance to turn an honest penny Certainly Brave fellows Show me that splendid fabric that shines like cloth of gold This my young lady this is a real genuine China silk I bought it myself in my last cruise in the streets of Shanghai where the long legged chickens And fast young men come from I know the place I ve been along there interrupted Capitola her gray eyes glittering with mischief This you will perceive young lady is an article that cannot be purchased anywhere except From the manufactory of foreign goods in the city of New York or from their traveling agents Oh my dear young lady how you wrong me This article came from The factory of Messrs Hocus Pocus corner of Can t and Come it Street City of Gotham Oh my dear young lady Look here my brave buccaneer I know all about it I told you I d been along there said the girl and turning to missus Condiment she said See here my dear good soul if you want to buy that India silk that you are looking at so longingly you may do it with a safe conscience True it never passed through the custom house because it was made in New York I know all about it All these foreign goods are manufactured at the north and sent by agents all over the country These agents dress and talk like sailors and assume a mysterious manner on purpose to be suspected of smuggling because they know well enough fine ladies will buy much quicker and pay much more if they only fancy they are cheating Uncle Sam in buying foreign goods from a smuggler at half price So then you are not a smuggler after all said missus Condiment looking almost regretfully at the sailor Why ma am you know I told you you were accusing me wrongfully Well but really now there was something about you that looked sort of suspicious What did I tell you A look put on on purpose said Cap Well he knows that if he wanted to pass for a smuggler it didn t take here said missus Condiment No that it didn t muttered the object of these commentaries Well my good man since you are after all an honest peddler just hand me that silk and don t ask me an unreasonable price for it because I m a judge of silks and I won t pay more than it is worth said the old lady Madam I leave it to your own conscience You shall give me just what you think it s worth Humph that s too fair by half I begin to think this fellow is worse than he seems said Capitola to herself After a little hesitation a price was agreed upon and the dress bought Then the servants received permission to invest their little change in ribbons handkerchiefs tobacco snuff or whatever they thought they needed When the purchases were all made and the peddler had done up his diminished pack and replaced his hat upon his head and was preparing to leave missus Condiment said My good man it is getting very late and we do not like to see a traveler leave our house at this hour pray remain until morning and then after an early breakfast you can pursue your way in safety Thank you kindly ma am but I must be far on my road to night said the peddler But my good man you are a stranger in this part of the country and don t know the danger you run said the housekeeper Danger ma am in this quiet country Oh dear yes my good man particularly with your valuable pack oh my good gracious cried the old lady with an appalled look Indeed ma am you you make me sort of uneasy What danger can there be for a poor peaceful peddler pursuing his path Oh my good soul may heaven keep you from Black Donald Black Donald who s he Oh my good man he s the awfullest villain that ever went unhung Black Donald Black Donald Never heard that name before in my life Why is the fellow called Black Donald Oh sir he s called Black Donald for his black soul black deeds and and also I believe for his jet black hair and beard Oh my countrymen what a falling up was there exclaimed Capitola at this anti climax And how shall I keep from meeting this villain asked the peddler Oh sir how can I tell you You never can form an idea where he is or where he isn t Only think he may be in our midst any time and we not know it Why only yesterday the desperate villain handcuffed the very sheriff in the very courtyard Yet I wonder the sheriff did not know him at once For my own part I m sure I should know Black Donald the minute I clapped my two looking eyes on him Should you ma am Yes indeed by his long black hair and beard They say it is half a yard long now a man of such a singular appearance as that must be easily recognized Of course Then you never met this wretch face to face He Me Am I standing here alive Do you suppose I should be standing here if ever I had met that demon Why man I never leave this house even in the day time except with two bull dogs and a servant for fear I should meet Black Donald I know if ever I should meet that demon I should drop dead with terror I feel I should But maybe now ma am the man may not be so bad after all Even the devil is not so bad as he is painted The devil may not be but Black Donald is What do you think of this outlaw young lady asked the peddler turning to Capitola Why I like him said Cap You do Yes I do I like men whose very names strike terror into the hearts of commonplace people Oh Miss Black exclaimed missus Condiment Yes I do ma am And if Black Donald were only as honest as he is brave I should quite adore him So there And if there is one person in the world I should like to see it is Black Donald Do you really wish to see him asked the peddler looking intently into the half earnest half satirical face of the girl Yes I do wish to see him above all things And do you know what happened the rash girl who wished to see the devil No what did She saw him Oh if that s all I dare it And if wishing will bring me the sight of this notorious outlaw lo I wish it I wish to see Black Donald said Capitola The peddler deliberately arose and put down his pack and his hat then he suddenly tore off the scarf from his neck and the handkerchief from his head lifted his chin and shook loose a great rolling mass of black hair and beard drew himself up struck an attitude called up a look and exclaimed Behold Black Donald With a piercing shriek missus Condiment swooned and fell to the floor the poor negroes men and maids were struck dumb and motionless with consternation Capitola gazed for one lost moment in admiration and curiosity in the meantime Black Donald quickly resumed his disguises took up his pack and walked out of the room Capitola was the first to recover her presence of mind the instinct of the huntress possessed her starting forward she exclaimed Pursue him catch him come with me Cowards will you let a robber and murderer escape and she ran out and overtook the outlaw in the middle of the hall With the agile leap of a little terrier she sprang up behind him seized the thick collar of his pea jacket with both hands and drawing up her feet hung there with all her weight crying Help murder murder help Come to my aid I ve caught Black Donald He could have killed her instantly in any one of a dozen ways He could have driven in her temples with a blow of his sledge hammer fist he could have broken her neck with the grip of his iron fingers he only wished to shake her off without hurting her a difficult task for there she hung a dead weight at the collar of his coat at the back of his neck Oh very well he cried laughing aloud Such adhesiveness I never saw You stick to me like a wife to her husband So if you won t let go I shall have to take you along that s all So here I go like Christian with his bundle of sin on his back And loosing the upper button of his pea jacket so as to give him more breath and putting down his peddler s pack to relieve himself as much as possible the outlaw strode through the hall door down the steps and down the evergreen avenue leading to the woods Capitola still clinging to the back of his coat collar with feet drawn up a dead weight and still crying Help Murder I ve caught Black Donald and I ll die before I ll let him go You re determined to be an outlaw s bride that s certain Well I ve no particular objection cried Black Donald roaring with laughter as he strode on It was a thing to see not hear that brave rash resolute imp clinging like a terrier or a crab or a briar on to the back of that gigantic ruffian whom if she had no strength to stop she was determined not to release They had nearly reached the foot of the descent when a great noise and hallooing was heard behind them It was the negroes who having recovered from their panic and armed themselves with guns pistols swords pokers tongs and pitchforks were now in hot pursuit And cries of Black Donald Black Donald Black Donald filled the air I ve got him I ve got him help help quick quick screamed Capitola clinging closer than ever Though still roaring with laughter at the absurdity of his position Black Donald strode on faster than before and was in a fair way of escape when lo suddenly coming up the path in front of him he met Old Hurricane As the troop of miscellaneously armed negroes running down the hill were still making eve hideous with yells of Black Donald and Capitola still clinging and hanging on at the back of his neck continued to cry I ve caught him help help something like the truth flashed in a blinding way upon Old Hurricane s perceptions Roaring forth something between a recognition and a defiance the old man threw up his fat arms and as fast as age and obesity would permit ran up the hill to intercept the outlaw There was no time for trifling now The army of negroes was at his heels the old veteran in his path the girl clinging a dead weight to his jacket behind An idea suddenly struck him which he wondered had not done so before quickly unbuttoning and throwing off his garment he dropped both jacket and captor behind him on the ground And before Capitola had picked herself up Black Donald bending his huge head and shoulders forward and making a battering ram of himself ran with all his force and butted Old Hurricane in the stomach pitching him into the horse pond leaped over the park fence and disappeared in the forest What a scene what a row followed the escape and flight of the famous outlaw Who could imagine far less describe it a general tempest in which every individual was a particular storm There stood the baffled Capitola extricating her head from the pea jacket and with her eyes fairly flashing out sparks of anger exclaiming Oh wretches wretches that you are If you d been worth salt you could have caught him while I clung to him so There wallowed Old Hurricane spluttering floundering half drowning in the horse pond making the most frantic efforts to curse and swear as he struggled to get out There stood the crowd of negroes brought to a sudden stand by a panic of horror at seeing the dignity of their master so outraged And most frenzied of all there ran Wool around and around the margin of the pond in a state of violent perplexity how to get his master out without half drowning himself Blurr urr rr flitch flitch Blurr ur spluttered and sneezed and strangled Old Hurricane as he floundered to the edge of the pond Burr urr rr Help me out you scoundrel I ll break every bone in your flitch body Do you hear me ca snish villain you flitch flitch ca snish oh h Wool with his eyes starting from his head and his hair standing up with terrors of all sorts plunged at last into the water and pulled his old master up upon his feet Ca snish ca snish blurr rr flitch what are you gaping there for as if you d raised the devil you crowd of born fools bawled Old Hurricane as soon as he could get the water out of his mouth and nose what are you standing there for After him After him I say Scour the woods in every direction His freedom to any man who brings me Black Donald dead or alive Wool Yes sir said that functionary who was busying himself with squeezing the water out of his master s garments Wool let me alone Take the fleetest horse in the stable Ride for your life to the Court House Tell Keepe to have new bills posted everywhere offering an additional five hundred dollars for the apprehension of that that that for the want of a word strong enough to express himself Old Hurricane suddenly stopped and for the lack of his stick to make silence emphatic he seized his gray hair with both hands and groaned aloud Wool waited no second bidding but flew to do his errand Capitola came to the old man s side saying Uncle hadn t you better hurry home you ll take cold Cold Cold demmy I never was so hot in my life cried the old man but demmy you re right Run to the house Capitola and tell missus Condiment to have me a full suit of dry clothes before the fire in my chamber Go child every man jack is off after Black Donald and there is nobody but you and Condiment and the housemaids to take care of me Stop look for my stick first Where did that black demon throw it Demmy I d as well be without my legs Capitola picked up the old man s cane and hat and put the one on his head and the other in his hand and then hastened to find missus Condiment and tell her to prepare to receive her half drowned patron She found the old lady scarcely recovered from the effects of her recent fright but ready on the instant to make every effort in behalf of Old Hurricane who presently after arrived dripping wet at the house Leaving the old gentleman to the care of his housekeeper we must follow Black Donald Hatless and coatless with his long black hair and beard blown by the wind the outlaw made tracks for his retreat occasionally stopping to turn and get breath and send a shout of laughter after his baffled pursuers That same night at the usual hour the gang met at their rendezvous the deserted inn beside the old road through the forest They were in the midst of their orgies around the supper table when the well known ringing step of the leader sounded under the back windows without the door was burst open and the captain hatless coatless with his dark elf locks flying and every sign of haste and disorder rushed into the room He was met by a general rising and outcry Hi hillo what s up exclaimed every man starting to his feet and laying hands upon secret arms prepared for instant resistance For a moment Black Donald stood with his leonine head turned and looking back over his stalwart shoulders as if in expectation of pursuit and then with a loud laugh turned to his men exclaiming Ho you thought me followed So I have been but not as close as hound to heel In fact captain you look as if you d but escaped with your skin this time said Hal Faith the captain looks well peeled said Stephen Worse than that boys worse than that Your chief has not only lost his pack his hat and his coat but his heart Not only are the outworks battered but the citadel itself is taken Not only has he been captured but captivated And all by a little minx of a girl Boys your chief is in love exclaimed Black Donald throwing himself into his seat at the head of the table and quaffing off a large draught of ale Hip hip hurraw three times three for the captain s love cried Hal rising to propose the toast which was honored with enthusiasm Now tell us all about it captain Who is she Where did you see her Is she fair or dark tall or short thin or plump what s her name and is she kind asked Hal First guess where I have been to day You and your demon only know I guess they also know at Hurricane Hall for it is there I have been Well then why didn t you go to perdition at once exclaimed Hal in a consternation that was reflected in every countenance present Why because when I go there I intend to take you all with me and remain answered Black Donald Tell us about the visit to Hurricane Hall said Hal Whereupon Black Donald commenced and concealing only the motive of his visit gave his comrades a very graphic spicy and highly colored narrative of his adventure at Hurricane Hall and particularly of his passages at arms with the little witch Capitola whom he described as Such a girl slender petite lithe with bright black ringlets dancing around a little face full of fun frolic mischief and spirit and bright eyes quick and vivacious as those of a monkey darting hither and thither from object to object The captain is in love sure enough said Steve Bravo here s success to the captain s love she s a brick shouted the men Oh she is assented their chief with enthusiasm Long life to her three times three for the pretty witch of Hurricane Hall roared the men rising to their feet and waving their full mugs high in the air before pledging the toast That is all very well boys but I want more substantial compliments than words boys I must have that girl Who doubts it captain Of course you will take her at once if you want her said Hal confidently But I must have help in taking her Captain I volunteer for one exclaimed Hal And I for another added Stephen And you Dick inquired the leader turning toward the sullen man whose greater atrocity had gained for him the name of Demon Dick What is the use of volunteering when the captain has only to command said this individual sulkily Ay when the enterprise is simply the robbing of a mail coach in which you all have equal interest then indeed your captain has only to command and you to obey but this is a more delicate matter of entering a lady s chamber and carrying her off for the captain s arms and so should only be entrusted to those whose feelings of devotion to the captain s person prompt them to volunteer for the service said Black Donald How elegantly our captain speaks He ought to be a lawyer said Steve The captain knows I m with him for everything said Dick sulkily Very well then for a personal service like this a delicate service requiring devotion I should scorn to give commands I thank you for your offered assistance my friends and shall count on you three Hal Stephen and Richard for the enterprise said the captain Ay ay ay said the three men in a breath For the time and place and manner of the seizure of the girl we must reflect Let us see There is to be a fair in the village next week during the session of the court Old Hurricane will be at court as usual And for one day at least his servants will have a holiday to go to the fair They will not get home until the next morning The house will be ill guarded We must find out the particular day and night when this shall be so Then you three shall watch your opportunity enter the house by stealth conceal yourselves in the chamber of the girl and at midnight when all is quiet gag her and bring her away Excellent said Hal And mind no liberty except the simple act of carrying her off is to be taken with your captain s prize said the leader with a threatening glare of his lion like eye Oh no no not for the world She shall be as sacred from insult as though she were an angel and we saints said Hal both the others assenting And now not a word more We will arrange the further details of this business hereafter said the captain as a peculiar signal was given at the door Waving his hand for the men to keep their places Black Donald went out and opened the back passage door admitting Colonel Le Noir Well said the latter anxiously Well sir I have contrived to see her come into the front room and I will tell you all about it said the outlaw leading the way into the old parlor that had been the scene of so many of their conspiracies Does Capitola Le Noir still live hoarsely demanded the colonel as the two conspirators reached the parlor Still live Yes twas but yesterday we agreed upon her death Give a man time Sit down colonel Take this seat We will talk the matter over again With something very like a sigh of relief Colonel Le Noir threw himself into the offered chair Black Donald drew another chair up and sat down beside his patron Well colonel I have contrived to see the girl as I told you he began But you have not done the deed When will it be done Colonel my patron be patient Within twelve days I shall claim the last instalment of the ten thousand dollars agreed upon between us for this job But why so long since it is to be done why not have it over at once said Colonel Le Noir starting up and pacing the floor impatiently Patience my colonel The cat may play with the mouse most delightfully before devouring it What do you mean My colonel I have seen the girl under circumstances that has fired my heart with an uncontrollable desire for her Ha ha ha scornfully laughed the colonel Black Donald the mail robber burglar outlaw the subject of the grand passion Why not my colonel Listen you shall hear And then you shall judge whether or not you yourself might not have been fired by the fascinations of such a witch said the outlaw who straightway commenced and gave his patron the same account of his visit to Hurricane Hall that he had already related to his comrades The colonel heard the story with many a pish tush and pshaw and when the man had concluded the tale he exclaimed Is that all Then we may continue our negotiations I care not Carry her off marry her do as you please with her only at the end of all kill her hoarsely whispered Le Noir That is just what I intend colonel That will do if the event be certain but it must be certain I cannot breathe freely while my brother s heiress lives whispered Le Noir Well colonel be content here is my hand upon it In six days Capitola will be in my power In twelve days you shall be out of hers It is a bargain said each of the conspirators in a breath as they shook hands and parted Le Noir to his home and Black Donald to join his comrades revelry CHAPTER XXIII THE BOY S LOVE Endearing endearing Why so endearing Are those soft shining eyes Through their silk fringe peering They love thee they love thee Deeply sincerely And more than aught else on earth Thou lovest them dearly Motherwell While these dark conspiracies were hatching elsewhere all was comfort peace and love in the doctor s quiet dwelling Under Marah Rocke s administration the business of the household went on with the regularity of clockwork Every one felt the advantage of this improved condition The doctor often declared that for his part he could not for the life of him think how they had ever been able to get along without missus Rocke and Traverse Clara affirmed that however the past might have been the mother and son were a present and future necessity to the doctor s comfort and happiness The little woman herself gained rapidly both health and spirits and good looks Under favorable circumstances Marah Rocke even at thirty six would have been esteemed a first rate beauty and even now she was pretty graceful and attractive to a degree that she herself was far from suspecting Traverse advanced rapidly in his studies to the ardent pursuit of which he was urged by every generous motive that could fire a human bosom affection for his mother whose condition he was anxious to elevate gratitude to his patron whose great kindness he wished to justify and admiration for Clara whose esteem he was ambitious to secure He attended his patron in all his professional visits for the doctor said that actual experimental knowledge formed the most important part of a young medical student s education The mornings were usually passed in reading in the library the middle of the day in attending the doctor on his professional visits and the evenings were passed in the drawing room with the doctor Clara and missus Rocke And if the morning s occupation was the most earnest and the day s the most active the evening s relaxation with Clara and music and poetry was certainly the most delightful In the midst of all this peace and prosperity a malady was creeping upon the boy s heart and brain that in his simplicity and inexperience he could neither understand nor conquer Why was it that these evening fireside meetings with the doctor s lovely daughter once such unalloyed delight were now only a keenly pleasing pain Why did his face burn and his heart beat and his voice falter when obliged to speak to her Why could he no longer talk of her to his mother or write of her to his friend Herbert Greyson Above all why had his favorite day dream of having his dear friends Herbert and Clara married together grown so abhorrent as to sicken his very soul Traverse himself could not have answered these questions In his ignorance of life he did not know that all his strong ardent earnest nature was tending toward the maiden by a power of attraction seated in the deepest principles of being and of destiny Clara in her simplicity did not suspect the truth but tried in every innocent way to enliven the silent boy and said that he worked too hard and begged her father not to let him study too much Whereupon the doctor would laugh and bid her not be uneasy about Traverse that the boy was all right and would do very well Evidently the doctor with all his knowledge of human nature did not perceive that his protege was in process of forming an unadvisable attachment to his daughter and heiress missus Rocke with her woman s tact and mother s forethought saw all She saw that in the honest heart of her poor boy unconsciously there was growing up a strong ardent earnest passion for the lovely girl with whom he was thrown in such close intimate daily association and who was certainly not indifferent in her feelings toward him but whom he might never never hope to possess She saw this daily growing and trembled for the peace of both She wondered at the blindness of the doctor who did not perceive what was so plain to her own vision Daily she looked to see the eyes of the doctor open and some action taken upon the circumstances but they did not open to the evil ahead for the girl and boy for morning after morning their hands would be together tying up the same vines or clearing out the same flower bed day after day at the doctor s orders Traverse attended Clara on her rides night after night their blushing faces would be bent over the same sketch book chess board or music sheet Oh if the doctor cannot and will not see what shall I do What ought I to do said the conscientious little woman to herself dreading above all things and equally for her son and the doctor s daughter the evils of an unhappy attachment which she with her peculiar temperament and experiences believed to be the worst of sorrows a misfortune never to be conquered or outlived Yes It is even better that we should leave the house than that Traverse should become hopelessly attached to Clara or worse than all that he should repay the doctor s great bounty by winning the heart of his only daughter said Marah Rocke to herself and so screwing her courage to the sticking place she took an opportunity one morning early while Traverse and Clara were out riding to go into the study to speak to the doctor As usual he looked up with a smile to welcome her as she entered but her downcast eyes and serious face made him uneasy and he hastened to inquire if she was not well or if anything had happened to make her anxious and at the same time he placed a chair and made her sit in it Yes I am troubled doctor about a subject that I scarcely know how to break to you she said in some considerable embarrassment missus Rocke you know I am your friend anxious to serve you Trust in me and speak out Well sir said Marah beginning to roll up the corner of her apron in her embarrassment I should not presume to interfere but you do not see gentlemen perhaps seldom do until it is too late She paused and the good doctor turned his head about listening first with one ear and then with the other as if he thought by attentive hearing he might come to understand her incomprehensible words Miss Clara has the misfortune to be without a mother or an aunt or any lady relative Oh yes I know it my dear madam but then I am sure you conscientiously try to fill the place of a matronly friend and adviser to my daughter said the doctor striving after light Yes sir and it is in view of my duties in this relation that I say I and Traverse ought to go away You and Traverse go away My good little woman you ought to be more cautious how you shock a man at my time of life fifty is a very apoplectic age to a full blooded man missus Rocke But now that I have got over the shock tell me why you fancy that you and Traverse ought to go away Sir my son is a well meaning boy A high spirited noble hearted lad put in the doctor I have never seen a better But granting all that to be what I hope and believe it is true still Traverse Rocke is not a proper or desirable daily associate for Miss Day Why curtly inquired the doctor If Miss Clara s mother were living sir she would probably tell you that young ladies should never associate with any except their equals of the opposite sex said Marah Rocke Clara s dear mother were she on earth would understand and sympathize with me and esteem your Traverse as I do missus Rocke said the doctor with moist eyes and a tremulous voice But oh sir exceeding kind as you are to Traverse I dare not in duty look on and see things going the way in which they are and not speak and ask your consent to withdraw Traverse My good little friend said the doctor rising and looking kindly and benignantly upon Marah My good little woman sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof Suppose you and I trust a little in Divine Providence and mind our own business But sir it seems to me a part of our business to watch over the young and inexperienced that they fall into no snare And also to treat them with a little wholesome neglect that our over officiousness may plunge them into none I wish you would comprehend me sir I do and applaud your motives but give yourself no further trouble Leave the young people to their own honest hearts and to Providence Clara with all her softness is a sensible girl and as for Traverse if he is one to break his heart from an unhappy attachment I have been mistaken in the lad that is all said the doctor heartily missus Rocke sighed and saying I deemed it my duty to speak to you sir and having done so I have no more to say she slightly curtsied and withdrew He does not see His great benevolence blinds him In his wish to serve us he exposes Traverse to the most dreadful misfortune the misfortune of becoming hopelessly attached to one far above him in station whom he can never expect to possess said Marah Rocke to herself as she retired from the room I must speak to Traverse himself and warn him against this snare she said as she afterward ruminated over the subject And accordingly that evening when she had retired to her chamber and heard Traverse enter the little adjoining room where he slept she called him in and gave him a seat saying that she must have some serious conversation with him The boy looked uneasy but took the offered chair and waited for his mother to speak Traverse she said a change has come over you recently that may escape all other eyes but those of your mother she Traverse cannot be blind to anything that seriously affects her boy s happiness Mother I scarcely know what you mean said the youth in embarrassment Traverse you are beginning to think too much of Miss Day Oh mother exclaimed the boy while a violent blush overspread and empurpled his face Then in a little while and in faltering tones he inquired Have I betrayed in any way that I do To no one but to me Traverse to me whose anxiety for your happiness makes me watchful and now dear boy you must listen to me I know it is very sweet to you to sit in a dark corner and gaze on Clara when no one not even herself witnesses your joy and to lie awake and think and dream of her when no eye but that of God looks down upon your heart and to build castles in the air for her and for you all this I know is very sweet but Traverse it is a sweet poison fatal if indulged in fatal to your peace and integrity Oh my mother Oh my mother What are you telling me exclaimed Traverse bitterly Unpalatable truths dear boy but necessary antidotes to that sweet poison of which you have already tasted too much What would you have me to do my mother Guard your acts and words and even thoughts forbear to look at or speak to or think of Clara except when it is unavoidable or if you do regard her as she is one so far beyond your sphere as to be forever unattainable Oh mother I never once dreamed of such presumption as to think of of The youth paused and a deep blush again overspread his face I know you have not indulged presumptuous thoughts as yet my boy and it is to warn you against them while yet your heart is in some measure within your own keeping that I speak to you Indulge your imagination in no more sweet reveries about Miss Day for the end thereof will be bitter humiliation and disappointment Remember also that in so doing you would indulge a sort of treachery against your patron who in his great faith in your integrity has received you in the bosom of his family and admitted you to an almost brotherly intimacy with his daughter Honor his trust in you and treat his daughter with the distant respect due to a princess I will mother It will be hard but I will Oh an hour ago I did not dream how miserable I should be now said Traverse in a choking voice Because I have pointed out to you the gulf toward which you were walking blindfolded I know it I know it now mother said Traverse as he arose and pressed his mother s hand and hurried to his own room The poor youth did his best to follow out the line of conduct prescribed for him by his mother He devoted himself to his studies and to the active service of his patron He avoided Clara as much as possible and when obliged to be in her company he treated her with the most respectful reserve Clara saw and wondered at his change of manner and began to cast about in her own mind for the probable cause of his conduct I am the young mistress of the house said Clara to herself and I know I owe to every inmate of it consideration and courtesy perhaps I may have been unconsciously lacking in these toward Traverse whose situation would naturally render him very sensitive to neglect I must endeavor to convince him that none was intended And so resolving Clara redoubled all her efforts to make Traverse as well as others happy and comfortable But happiness and comfort seemed for the time to have departed from the youth He saw her generous endeavors to cheer him and while adoring her amiability grew still more reserved This pained the gentle girl who taking herself seriously to task said Oh I must have deeply wounded his feelings in some unconscious way And if so how very cruel and thoughtless of me How could I have done it I cannot imagine But I know I shall not allow him to continue unhappy if I can prevent it I will speak to him about it And then in the candor innocence and humility of her soul she followed him to the window where he stood in a moody silence and said pleasantly Traverse we do not seem to be so good friends as formerly If I have done anything to offend you I know that you will believe me when I say that it was quite unintentional on my part and that I am very sorry for it and hope you will forget it You you Miss Day You say anything to displease anybody Any one become displeased with you exclaimed the youth in a tremulous enthusiasm that shook his voice and suffused his cheeks Then if you are not displeased Traverse what is the matter and why do you call me Miss Day instead of Clara Miss Day because it is right that I should You are a young lady the only daughter and heiress of Doctor Day of Willow Heights while I am His friend said Clara The son of his housekeeper said Traverse walking away Clara looked after him in dismay for a moment and then sat down and bent thoughtfully over her needlework From that day Traverse grew more deeply in love and more reserved than before How could it be otherwise domesticated as he was with this lovely girl and becoming daily more sensible of her beauty goodness and intelligence Yet he struggled against his inevitable attachment as a great treachery Meantime he made rapid progress in his medical studies It was while affairs were in this state that one morning the doctor entered the study holding the morning paper in his hand Seating himself in his leathern armchair at the table he said I see my dear Traverse that a full course of lectures is to be commenced at the medical college in Washington and I think that you are sufficiently far advanced in your studies to attend them with great advantage what say you Oh sir said Traverse upon whom the proposition had burst quite unexpectedly I should indeed be delighted to go if that were possible There is no if about it my boy if you wish to go you shall do so I have made up my mind to give you a professional education and shall not stop half way Oh sir the obligation the overwhelming obligation you lay upon me Nonsense Traverse it is only a capital investment of funds If I were a usurer I could not put out money to a better advantage You will repay me by and by with compound interest so just consider all that I may be able to do for you as a loan to be repaid when you shall have achieved success I am afraid sir that that time will never No you are not interrupted the doctor and so don t let modesty run into hypocrisy Now put up your books and go and tell your good little mother to get your clothes all ready for you to go to Washington for you shall start by the next coach Much surprise was created in the little household by the news that Traverse was going immediately to Washington to attend the medical lectures There were but two days to prepare his wardrobe for the journey missus Rocke went cheerfully to work Clara lent her willing and skilful aid and at the end of the second day his clothes in perfect order were all neatly packed in his trunk And on the morning of the third day Traverse took leave of his mother and Clara and for the first time left home to go into the great world Doctor Day accompanied him in the old green gig as far as Staunton where he took the stage As soon as they had left the house Marah Rocke went away to her own room to drop a few natural tears over this first parting with her son Very lonely and desolate the mother felt as she stood weeping by the window and straining her eyes to catch a distant view of the old green gig that had already rolled out of sight While she stood thus in her loneliness and desolation the door silently opened a footstep softly crossed the floor a pair of arms was put around her neck and Clara Day dropped her head upon the mother s bosom and wept softly Marah Rocke pressed that beautiful form to her breast and felt with dismay that the doctor s sweet daughter already returned her boy s silent love CHAPTER XXIV CAPITOLA S MOTHER A woman like a dew drop she was purer than the purest And her noble heart the noblest yes and her sure faith the surest And her eyes were dark and humid like the depth in depth of lustre Hid i the harebell while her tresses sunnier than the wild grape s cluster Gushed in raven tinted plenty down her cheeks rose tinted marble Then her voice s music call it the well s bubbling the bird s warble Browning Cap Sir What the blazes is the matter with you What the blazes You better say what the dust and ashes I m bored to death I m blue as indigo There never was such a rum old place as this or such a rum old uncle as you Cap how often have I told you to leave off this Bowery boy talk Rum pah said Old Hurricane Well it is rum then Nothing ever happens here The silence deafens me the plenty takes away my appetite the safety makes me low Hum you are like the Bowery boys in times of peace spoiling for a fight Yes I am just decomposing above ground for want of having my blood stirred and I wish I was back in the Bowery Something was always happening there One day a fire next day a fight another day a fire and a fight together Umph and you to run with the engine Don t talk about it uncle it makes me homesick every day something glorious to stir one s blood Here nothing ever happens hardly It has been three days since I caught Black Donald ten days since you blowed up the whole household Oh I wish the barns would catch on fire I wish thieves would break in and steal I wish Demon s Run would rise to a flood and play the demon for once Ohyah oo said Cap opening her mouth with a yawn wide enough to threaten the dislocation of her jaws Capitola said the old man very gravely I am getting seriously uneasy about you I know I am a rough old soldier quite unfit to educate a young girl and that missus Condiment can t manage you and I ll consult mister Goodwin he concluded getting up and putting on his hat and walking out of the breakfast room where this conversation had taken place Cap laughed to herself I hope it is not a sin I know I should die of the blues if I couldn t give vent to my feelings and tease uncle Capitola had scarcely exaggerated her condition The monotony of her life affected her spirits the very absence of the necessity of thinking and caring for herself left a dull void in her heart and brain and as the winter waned the annual spring fever of lassitude and dejection to which mercurial organizations like her own are subject tended to increase the malady that missus Condiment termed a lowness of spirits At his wits end from the combined feelings of his responsibility and his helplessness in his ward s case Old Hurricane went and laid the matter before the reverend mister Goodwin Having reached the minister s house and found him alone and disengaged in his library Old Hurricane first bound him over to strict secrecy and then made a clean breast of it told him where Capitola had been brought up and under what circumstances he had found her The honest country clergyman was shocked beyond all immediate power of recovering himself so shocked in fact that Old Hurricane fearing he had gone too far hastened to say But mind on my truth as a man my honor as a soldier and my faith as a Christian I declare that that wild reckless desolate child has passed unscathed through the terrible ordeal of destitution poverty and exposure She has sir She is as innocent as the most daintily sheltered young heiress in the country She is sir And I d cut off the tongue and ears of any man that said otherwise I do not say otherwise my friend but I say that she has suffered a frightful series of perils She has come out of them safe sir I know it by a thousand signs what I fear for her is the future I can t manage her She won t obey me except when she likes She has never been taught obedience nor been accustomed to subordination and I don t understand either She rides and walks out alone in spite of all I can do or say If she were a boy I d thrash her but what can I do with a girl said Old Hurricane in despair Lock her up in her chamber until she is brought to reason suggested the minister Demmy she d jump out of the window and break her neck or hang herself with her garters or starve herself to death You don t know what an untamable thing she is Some birds if caged beat themselves to death against the bars of their prison She is just such a wild bird as that Humph it is a difficult case to manage but you should not shrink from responsibility you should be firm with her That s just what I can t be with the witch confound her she is such a wag such a drole such a mimic disobeys me in such a mocking cajoling affectionate way I could not give her pain if her soul depended on it Then you should talk to her try moral suasion Yes if I could only get her to be serious long enough to listen to me But you see Cap isn t sentimental and if I try to be she laughs in my face But then is she so insensible to all the benefits you have conferred upon her Will not gratitude influence her Yes so far as repaying me with a genuine affection fervent caresses and careful attention to my little comforts can go but Cap evidently thinks that the restriction of her liberty is too heavy a price to pay for protection and support The little rogue Think of her actually threatening in her good humored way to cite me before the nearest justice to show cause why I detained her in my house Well you could easily do that I suppose and she could no longer oppose your authority No that is just what I couldn t do I couldn t show any legal rights to detain Capitola Humph That complicates the case very much Yes and much more than you think for I wish to keep Capitola until she is of legal age I do not wish that she should fall into the hands of her perfidious guardian until I shall be able to bring legal proof of his perfidy Then it appears that this girl has received foul play from her friends Foul play I should think so Gabriel Le Noir has very nearly put his neck into a halter Gabriel Le Noir Colonel Le Noir our neighbor exclaimed the minister Exactly so Parson you have given me your word as a Christian minister to be silent forever concerning this interview or until I give you leave to speak of it Yes major and I repeat my promise but indeed sir you astound me Listen and let astonishment rise to consternation I will tell you who Capitola is You sir have been in this neighborhood only ten years and consequently you know Gabriel Le Noir only as the proprietor of Hidden House a widower with a grown son And as a gentleman of irreproachable reputation in good standing both in the church and in the county Ex actly A man that pays his pew rent gives good dinners and takes off his hat to women and clergymen Well sir this gentleman of irreproachable manners and morals this citizen of consideration in the community this member in good standing with the church has qualified himself for twenty years residence in the penitentiary even if not for the exaltation of a hangman s halter Sir I am inexpressibly shocked to hear you say so and I must still believe that there is some great mistake Wait until I tell you I Ira Warfield have known Gabriel Le Noir as a villain for the last eighteen years I tell you so without scruple and hold myself ready to maintain my words in field or forum by sword or law Well having known him so long for such a knave I was in no manner surprised to discover some six months ago that he was also a criminal and only needed exposure to become a felon Sir sir this is strong language I am willing to back it with life liberty and sacred honor as the Declaration of Independence has it Listen Some sixteen years ago before you came to take this pastoral charge the Hidden House was occupied by old Victor Le Noir the father of Eugene the heir and of Gabriel the present usurper The old man died leaving a will to this effect the landed estate including the coal and iron mines the Hidden House and all the negroes stock furniture and other personal property upon the premises to his eldest son Eugene with the proviso that if Eugene should die without issue the landed estate houses negroes et cetera should descend to his younger brother Gabriel To Gabriel he left his bank stock and blessing An equitable will observed the minister Yes but hear At the time of his father s death Eugene was traveling in Europe On receiving the news he immediately returned home bringing with him a lovely young creature a mere child that he presented to his astounded neighbors as Madame Eugene Le Noir I declare to you there was one simultaneous outcry of shame that he should have trapped into matrimony a creature so infantile for she was scarcely fourteen years of age It was indeed highly improper said the minister So thought all the neighborhood but when they found out how it happened disapproval was changed to commendation She was the daughter of a French patriot Her father and mother had both perished on the scaffold in the sacred cause of liberty she was thrown helpless friendless and penniless upon the cold charity of the world Providence cast her in the way of our sensitive and enthusiastic young traveler he pitied her he loved her and was casting about in his own mind how he could help without compromising her when the news of his father s illness summoned him home Then seeing no better way of protecting her after a little hesitation upon account of her tender age he married her and brought with him Good deeds we know must be rewarded in heaven since on earth they are so often punished He did not long enjoy his bride She was just the most beautiful creature that ever was seen with a promise of still more glorious beauty in riper years I have seen handsome women and pretty women but Madame Eugene Le Noir was the only perfectly beautiful woman I ever saw in my long life My own aged eyes seemed enriched only to look at her She adored Eugene too any one could see that At first she spoke English in broken music but soon her accent became as perfect as if she had been native born How could it have been otherwise when her teacher and inspirer was love She won all hearts with her loveliness Humph hear me an old fool worse an Old Hurricane betrayed into discourses of love and beauty merely by the remembrance of Madame Eugene Le Noir Ah bright exotic flower she did not bloom long The bride had scarcely settled down into the wife when one night Eugene Le Noir did not come home as usual The next day his dead body with a bullet in his brain was found in the woods around the Hidden House The murderer was never discovered Gabriel Le Noir came in haste from the military post where he had been stationed Madame Eugene was never seen abroad after the death of her husband It was reported that she had lost her reason a consequence that surprised no one Eugene having died without issue and his young widow being mad Gabriel by the terms of his father s will stepped at once into the full possession of the whole property Something of all this I have heard before said the minister Very likely for these facts and falsehoods were the common property of the neighborhood But what you have not heard before and what is not known to any now living except the criminals the victims and myself is that three months after the death of her husband Madame Eugene Le Noir gave birth to twins one living one dead The dead child was privately buried the living one together with the nurse that was the sole witness of the birth was abducted Great heavens can this be true exclaimed the minister shocked beyond all power of self control True as gospel I have proof enough to carry conviction to any honest breast to satisfy any caviller except a court of justice You shall hear You remember the dying woman whom you dragged me out in the snow storm to see blame you Yes She was the abducted nurse escaped and returned It was to make a deposition to the facts I am about to relate that she sent you to fetch me said Old Hurricane and with that he commenced and related the whole dark history of crime comprised in the nurse s dying deposition They examined the instrument together and Old Hurricane again related in brief the incidents of his hurried journey to New York his meeting and identifying Capitola and bringing her home in safety to his house And thus said the old man you perceive that this child whose birth was feloniously concealed and who was cast away to perish among the wretched beggars thieves and street walkers of New York is really the only living child of the late Eugene Le Noir and the sole inheritrix of the Hidden House with its vast acres of fields forests iron and coal mines water power steam mills furnaces and foundries wealth that I would not undertake to estimate within a million of dollars all of which is now held and enjoyed by that usurping villain Gabriel Le Noir But said the minister gravely you have of course commenced proceedings on the part of your protege Listen I will tell you what I have done When I first brought Cap home I was moved not only by the desire of wreaking vengeance upon a most atrocious miscreant who had done me an irreparable injury but also by sympathy for the little witch who had won my heart at first sight Therefore you may judge I lost no time in preparing to strike a double blow which should ruin my own mortal enemy and reinstate my favorite in her rights With this view immediately on my return home I sent for Breefe my confidential attorney and laid the whole matter before him And he To my dismay he told me that though the case was clear enough it was not sufficiently strong in a legal point of view to justify us in bringing suit for that the dying deposition of the mulatto nurse could not be received as evidence in our county courts You knew that before sir I presume Of course I did but I thought it was a lawyer s business to get over such difficulties and I assure you parson that I flew into a passion and cursed court and county law and lawyers to my heart s content I would have quarreled with old Breefe then and there only Breefe won t get excited He very coolly advised me to keep the matter close and my eyes open and gather all the corroborative testimony I could find and that in the meantime he would reflect upon the best manner of proceeding I think Major Warfield that his counsel was wise and disinterested But tell me sir of the girl s mother Is it not astonishing in fact is it not perfectly incomprehensible that so lovely a woman as you have represented her to be should have consented to the concealment if not to the destruction of her own legitimate offspring Sir to me it is not incomprehensible at all She was at once an orphan and a widow a stranger in a strange land a poor desolate broken hearted child in the power of the cunningest and most unscrupulous villain that the Lord ever suffered to live I wonder at nothing that he might have deceived or frightened her into doing Heaven forgive us Have I known that man for ten years to hear this account of him at last But tell me sir have you really any true idea of what has been the fate of the poor young widow No not the slightest Immediately after his brother s funeral Gabriel Le Noir gave out that Madame Eugene had lost her reason through excessive grief soon after which he took her with him to the North and upon his return alone reported that he had left her in a celebrated lunatic asylum The story was probable enough and received universal belief Only now I do not credit it and do not know whether the widow be living or dead or if living whether she be mad or sane if dead whether she came to her end by fair means or foul Merciful heaven sir you do not mean to say Yes I do mean to say and if you would like to know what is on my private mind I ll tell you I believe that Madame Eugene Le Noir has been treacherously made away with by the same infernal demon at whose instigation her husband was murdered and her child stolen The minister seemed crushed beneath the overwhelming weight of this communication he passed his hand over his brow and thence down his face and sighed deeply For a few moments he seemed unable to reply and when he spoke it was only to say In this matter Major Warfield I can offer you no counsel better than that of your confidential attorney follow the light that you have until it lead you to the full elucidation of this affair and may heaven grant that you may find Colonel Le Noir less guilty than you apprehend Parson humbug When charity drivels it ought to be turned off by justice I will follow the little light I have I suspect from the description that the wretch who at Le Noir s instance carried off the nurse and child was no other than the notorious Black Donald I have offered an additional thousand dollars for his apprehension and if he is taken he will be condemned to death make a last dying speech and confession and give up his accomplices the accomplished Colonel Le Noir among the rest If the latter really was an accomplice there could be no better way of discovering the fact than to bring this Black Donald to justice but I greatly fear that there is little hope of that said the minister Aye but there is Listen The long impunity enjoyed by this desperado has made him daring to fatuity Why I was within a hair s breadth of capturing him myself a few days ago Ha is it possible asked the minister with a look of surprise and interest Aye was I and you shall hear all about it said Old Hurricane And upon that he commenced and told the minister the adventure of Capitola with Black Donald at Hurricane Hall The minister was amazed yet could not forbear to say It seems to me however that it was Capitola who was in a hair s breadth of capturing this notorious desperado Pooh she clung to him like the reckless lunatic that she is but Lord he would have carried her off on his back if it had not been for me The minister smiled a little to himself and then said This protege of yours is a very remarkable girl as interesting to me in her character as she is in her history her very spirit courage and insubordination make her singularly hard to manage and apt to go astray With your permission I will make her acquaintance with the view of seeing what good I can do her Pray do so for then you will be better able to counsel me how to manage the capricious little witch who if I attempt to check her in her wild and dangerous freedom of action tells me plainly that liberty is too precious a thing to be exchanged for food and clothing and that rather than live in bondage she will throw herself upon the protection of the court If she does that the game is up Le Noir against whom we can as yet prove nothing would claim her as his niece and ward and get her into his power for the purpose of making way with her as he did with her father and mother Oh for heaven s sake sir no more of that until we have further evidence said the minister uneasily adding I will see your very interesting protege to morrow Do do to morrow to day this hour any time said Major Warfield as he cordially took leave of the pastor CHAPTER XXV CAP S TRICKS AND PERILS I ll be merry and free I ll be sad for naebody Naebody cares for me I care for naebody Burns The next day according to agreement the pastor came and dined at Hurricane Hall During the dinner he had ample opportunity of observing Capitola In the afternoon Major Warfield took an occasion of leaving him alone with the contumacious young object of his visit Cap with her quick perceptions instantly discovered the drift and purpose of this action which immediately provoked all the mischievous propensities of her elfish spirit Uncle means that I shall be lectured by the good parson If he preaches to me won t I humor him to the top of his bent that s all was her secret resolution as she sat demurely with pursed up lips bending over her needlework The honest and well meaning old country clergyman hitched his chair a little nearer to the perverse young rebel and gingerly for he was half afraid of his questionable subject entered into conversation with her To his surprise and pleasure Capitola replied with the decorum of a young nun Encouraged by her manner the good minister went on to say how much interested he felt in her welfare how deeply he compassionated her lot in never having possessed the advantage of a mother s teaching how anxious he was by his counsels to make up to her as much as possible such a deficiency Here Capitola put up both her hands and dropped her face upon them Still farther encouraged by this exhibition of feeling mister Goodwin went on He told her that it behooved her who was a motherless girl to be even more circumspect than others lest through very ignorance she might err and in particular he warned her against riding or walking out alone or indulging in any freedom of manners that might draw upon her the animadversions of their very strict community Oh sir I know I have been very indiscreet and I am very miserable said Capitola in a heart broken voice My dear child your errors have hitherto been those of ignorance only and I am very much pleased to find how much your good uncle has been mistaken and how ready you are to do strictly right when the way is pointed out said the minister pleased to his honest heart s core that he had made this deep impression A heavy sigh burst from the bosom of Capitola What is the matter my dear child he said kindly Oh sir if I had only known you before exclaimed Capitola bitterly Why my dear I can do just as much good now Oh no sir it is too late it is too late It is never to late to do well Oh yes sir it is for me Oh how I wish I had had your good counsel before it would have saved me from so much trouble My dear child you make me seriously uneasy do explain yourself said the old pastor drawing his chair closer to hers and trying to get a look at the distressed little face that was bowed down upon her hands and veiled with her hair do tell me my dear what is the matter Oh sir I am afraid to tell you you d hate and despise me you d never speak to me again said Capitola keeping her face concealed My dear child said the minister very gravely and sorrowfully whatever your offense has been and you make me fear that it has been a very serious one I invite you to confide it to me and having done so I promise however I may mourn the sin not to hate or despise or forsake the sinner Come confide in me Oh sir I daren t indeed I daren t moaned Capitola My poor girl said the minister if I am to do you any good it is absolutely necessary that you make me your confidant Oh sir I have been a very wicked girl I daren t tell you how wicked I have been Does your good uncle know or suspect this wrongdoing of yours Uncle Oh no sir He d turn me out of doors He d kill me Indeed he would sir Please don t tell him You forget my child that I do not yet know the nature of your offense said the minister in a state of painful anxiety But I am going to inform you sir and oh I hope you will take pity on me and tell me what to do for though I dread to speak I can t keep it on my conscience any longer it is such a heavy weight on my breast Sin always is my poor girl said the pastor with a deep moan But sir you know I had no mother as you said yourself I know it my poor girl and am ready to make every allowance said the old pastor with a deep sigh not knowing what next to expect And and I hope you will forgive me sir but but he was so handsome I couldn t help liking him Miss Black cried the horrified pastor There I knew you d just go and bite my head off the very first thing Oh dear what shall I do sobbed Capitola The good pastor who had started to his feet remained gazing upon her in a panic of consternation murmuring to himself Good angel I am fated to hear more great sins than if I were a prison chaplain Then going up to the sobbing delinquent he said Unhappy girl who is this person of whom you speak H h h him that I met when I went walking in the woods sobbed Capitola Heaven of heavens this is worse than my very worst fears Wretched girl Tell me instantly the name of this base deceiver He he he s no base deceiver he he he s very amiable and good looking and and and that s why I liked him so much it was all my fault not his poor dear fellow His name sternly demanded the pastor Alf Alf Alfred wept Capitola Alfred whom Alfred Blen Blen Blenheim Miserable girl how often have you met this miscreant in the forest I don t know sobbed Capitola Where is the wretch to be found now Oh please don t hurt him sir Please don t He he he s hid in the closet in my room A groan that seemed to have rent his heart in twain burst from the bosom of the minister as he repeated in deepest horror In your room Well I must prevent murder being done Did you not know you poor child the danger you ran by giving this young man private interviews and above all admitting him to your apartment Wretched girl better you d never been born than ever so to have received a man Man man man I d like to know what you mean by that mister Goodwin exclaimed Capitola lifting her eyes flashing through their tears I mean the man with whom you have given these private interviews I I give private interviews to a man Take care what you say mister Goodwin I won t be insulted no not even by you Then if you are not talking of a man who or what in the world are you talking about exclaimed the amazed minister Why Alfred the Blenheim poodle that strayed away from some of the neighbors houses and that I found in the woods and brought home and hid in my closet for fear he would be inquired after or uncle would find it out and make me give him up I knew it was wrong but then he was so pretty Before Capitola had finished her speech mister Goodwin had seized his hat and rushed out of the house in indignation nearly overturning Old Hurricane whom he met on the lawn and to whom he said Thrash that girl as if she were a bay boy for she richly deserves it There what did I say Now you see what a time I have with her she makes me sweat I can tell you said Old Hurricane in triumph Oh oh oh groaned the sorely tried minister What s it now inquired Old Hurricane The pastor took the major s arm and while they walked up and down before the house told how he had been sold by Capitola ending by saying You will have to take her firmly in hand I ll do it said Old Hurricane I ll do it The pastor then called for his horse and resisting all his host s entreaties to stay to tea took his departure Major Warfield re entered the house resolving to say nothing to Capitola for the present but to seize the very first opportunity of punishing her for her flippancy The village fair had commenced on Monday It had been arranged that all Major Warfield s family should go though not all upon the same day It was proposed that on Thursday when the festival should be at its height Major Warfield Capitola and the house servants should go And on Saturday missus Condiment mister Ezy and the farm servants should have a holiday for the same purpose Therefore upon Thursday morning all the household be stirred themselves at an unusually early hour and appeared before breakfast in their best Sunday s suit Capitola came down to breakfast in a rich blue silk carriage dress looking so fresh blooming and joyous that it went to the old man s heart to disappoint her yet Old Hurricane resolved as the pastor had told him to be firm and once for all by inflicting punishment to bring her to a sense of her errors There you need not trouble yourself to get ready Capitola you shall not go to the fair with us he said as Cap took her seat Sir exclaimed the girl in surprise Oh yes you may stare but I m in earnest You have behaved very badly you have deeply offended our pastor you have no reverence no docility no propriety and I mean to bring you to a sense of your position by depriving you of some of your indulgences and in a word to begin I say you shall not go to the fair to day You mean sir that I shall not go with you although you promised that I should said Cap coolly I mean you shall not go at all demmy I d like to know who ll prevent me said Cap I will Miss Vixen Demmy I ll not be set at naught by a beggar missus Condiment leave the room mum and don t be sitting there listening to every word I have to say to my ward Wool be off with yourself sir what do you stand there gaping and staring for Be off or the old man looked around for a missile but before he found one the room was evacuated except by himself and Capitola Now minion he began as soon as he found himself alone with the little rebel I did not choose to mortify you before the servants but once for all I will have you to understand that I intend to be obeyed And Old Hurricane gathered his brows like a gathering storm Sir if you were really my uncle or my father or my legal guardian I should have no choice but obey you but the same fate that made me desolate made me free a freedom that I would not exchange for any gilded slavery said Cap gaily Pish tush pshaw I say I will have no more of this nonsense I say I will be obeyed cried Old Hurricane striking his cane down upon the floor and in proof of it I order you immediately to go and take off that gala dress and settle yourself down to your studies for the day Uncle I will obey you as far as taking off this dress goes for since you won t give me a seat in your carriage I shall have to put on my habit and ride Gyp said Cap good humoredly What Do you dare to hint that you have the slightest idea of going to the fair against my will Yes sir said Cap gaily Sorry it s against your will but can t help it not used to being ordered about and don t know how to submit and so I m going Ungrateful girl actually meditating disobedience on the horse I gave her Easy now uncle fair and easy I did not sell my free will for Gyp I wouldn t for a thousand Gyps He was a free gift said Capitola beginning an impatient little dance about the floor Come here to me come here to me exclaimed the old man peremptorily rapping his cane down upon the floor with every syllable Capitola danced up to him and stood half smiling and fingering and arranging the lace of her under sleeves Listen to me you witch Do you intend to obey me or not Not said Cap good humoredly adjusting her cameo bracelet and holding up her arm to see its effect You will not Then demmy miss I shall know how to make you thundered Old Hurricane bringing the point of his stick down with a sharp rap Eh cried Capitola looking up in astonishment Yes miss that s what I said make you I should like to know how said Cap returning to her cool good humor You would would you Demmy I ll tell you I have broken haughtier spirits than yours in my life Would you know how Yes said Cap indifferently still busied with her bracelets Stoop and I will whisper the mystery Capitola bent her graceful head to hear With the rod hissed Old Hurricane maliciously Capitola sprang up as if she had been shot wave after wave of blood tiding up in burning blushes over neck face and forehead then turning abruptly she walked off to the window Old Hurricane terrified at the effect of his rude rash words stood excommunicating himself for having been provoked to use them nor was the next aspect of Capitola one calculated to reassure his perturbed feelings She turned around Her face was as white as marble excepting her glittering eyes they half sheathed under their long lashes flashed like stilettoes Raising her hand and keeping her eyes fixed upon him with a slow and gliding motion and the deep and measured voice that scarcely seemed to belong to a denizen of earth she approached and stood before him and spoke these words Uncle in all the sorrows shames and sufferings of my destitute childhood no one ever dishonored my person with a blow and if ever you should have the misfortune to forget your manhood so far as to strike me She paused drew her breath hard between her set teeth grew a shade whiter while her dark eyes dilated until a white ring flamed around the iris Oh you perilous witch what then cried Old Hurricane in dismay Why then said Capitola speaking in a low deep and measured tone and keeping her gaze upon his astonished face the first time I should find you asleep I would take a razor and Cut my throat I feel you would you terrible termagant shuddered Old Hurricane Shave your beard off smick smack smoove said Cap bounding off and laughing merrily as she ran out of the room In an instant she came bounding back saying Uncle I will meet you at the fair au revoir au revoir and kissing her hand she dashed away and ran off to her room She ll kill me I know she will If she don t do it one way she will in another Whew I m perspiring at every pore Wool Wool you scoundrel exclaimed the old man jerking the bell rope as if he would have broken the wires Yes sir here I am marse exclaimed that worthy hastening in in a state of perturbation for he dreaded another storm Wool go down to the stables and tell every man there that if either of them allows a horse to be brought out for the use of Miss Black to day I ll flay them alive and break every bone in their skins Away with you Yes sir cried the shocked and terrified Wool hurrying off to convey his panic to the stables Old Hurricane s carriage being ready he entered it and drove off for the fair Next the house servants with the exception of Pitapat who was commanded to remain behind and wait upon her mistress went off in a wagon When they were all gone Capitola dressed herself in her riding habit and sent Pitapat down to the stables to order one of the grooms to saddle Gyp and bring him up for her Now when the little maid delivered this message the unfortunate grooms were filled with dismay they feared their tyrannical little mistress almost as much as their despotic old master who in the next change of his capricious temper might punch all their heads for crossing the will of his favorite even though in doing so they had followed his directions An immediate private consultation was the consequence and the result was that the head groom came to Pitapat told her that he was sorry but that Miss Black s pony had fallen lame The little maid went back with the answer When she was gone the head groom calling to his fellows said That young gal ain t a gwine to be fooled either by ole marse or we She ll be down here herself nex minute and have the horse walked out Now we must make him lame a little Light a match here Jem and I ll burn his foot This was immediately done And sure enough while poor Gyp was still smarting with his burn Capitola came holding up her riding train and hurrying to the scene and asking indignantly Who dares to say that my horse is lame Bring him out here this instant that I may see him The groom immediately took poor Gyp and led him limping to the presence of his mistress At the sight Capitola was almost ready to cry with grief and indignation He was not lame last evening It must have been your carelessness you good for nothing loungers and if he is not well enough to take me to the fair to morrow at least I ll have the whole set of you lamed for life she exclaimed angrily as she turned off and went up to the house not caring so much after all for her own personal disappointment as for Old Hurricane s triumph Cap s ill humor did not last long She soon exchanged her riding habit for a morning wrapper and took her needlework and sat down to sew by the side of missus Condiment in the housekeeper s room The day passed as usual only that just after sunset missus Condiment as a matter of precaution went all over the house securing windows and doors before nightfall Then after an early tea missus Condiment Capitola and the little maid Pitapat gathered around the bright little wood fire that the chilly spring evening made necessary in the housekeeper s room missus Condiment was knitting Capitola stitching a bosom for the major s shirts and Pitapat winding yarn from a reel The conversation of the three females left alone in the old house naturally turned upon subjects of fear ghosts witches and robbers missus Condiment had a formidable collection of accredited stories of apparitions warnings dreams omens et cetera all true as gospel There was a haunted house she said in their own neighborhood The Hidden House It was well authenticated that ever since the mysterious murder of Eugene Le Noir unaccountable sights and sounds had been seen and heard in and about the dwelling A traveler a brother officer of Colonel Le Noir had slept there once and in the dead waste and middle of the night had had his curtains drawn by a lady pale and passing fair dressed in white with flowing hair who as soon as he attempted to speak to her fled And it was well known that there was no lady about the premises Another time old mister Ezy himself when out after coons and coming through the woods near the house had been attracted by seeing a window near the roof lighted up by a strange blue flame drawing near he saw within the lighted room a female clothed in white passing and repassing the window Another time when old Major Warfield was out with his dogs the chase led him past the haunted house and as he swept by he caught a glimpse of a pale wan sorrowful female face pressed against the window pane of an upper room which vanished in an instant But might not that have been some young woman staying at the house asked Capitola No my child it is well ascertained that since the murder of Eugene Le Noir and the disappearance of his lovely young widow no white female has crossed the threshold of that fatal house said missus Condiment Disappearance did you say Can a lady of condition disappear from a neighborhood and no inquiry be made for her No my dear there was inquiry and it was answered plausibly that Madame Eugene was insane and sent off to a lunatic asylum but there are those who believe that the lovely lady was privately made away with whispered missus Condiment How dreadful I did not think such things happened in a quiet country neighborhood Something like that occurred indeed in New York within my own recollection however said Capitola who straightway commenced and related the story of Mary Rogers and all other stories of terror that memory supplied her with As for poor little Pitapat she did not presume to enter into the conversation but with her ball of yarn suspended in her hand her eyes started until they threatened to burst from their sockets and her chin dropped until her mouth gaped wide open she sat and swallowed every word listening with a thousand audience power By the time they had frightened themselves pretty thoroughly the clock struck eleven and they thought it was time to retire Will you be afraid missus Condiment asked Capitola Well my dear if I am I must try to trust in the Lord to overcome it since it is no use to be afraid I have fastened up the house well and I have brought in Growler the bull dog to sleep on the mat outside of my bedroom door so I shall say my prayers and try to go to sleep I dare say there is no danger only it seems lonesome like for us three women to be left in this big house by ourselves Yes said Capitola but as you say there is no danger and as for me if it will give you any comfort or courage to hear me say it I am not the least afraid although I sleep in such a remote room and have no one but Patty who having no more heart that a hare is not near such a powerful protector as Growler And bidding her little maid take up the night lamp Capitola wished missus Condiment good night and left the housekeeper s room CHAPTER XXVI THE PERIL AND THE PLUCK OF CAP Who that had seen her form so light For swiftness only turned Would e er have thought in a thing so slight Such a fiery spirit burned Very dreary looked the dark and silent passages as they went on toward Capitola s distant chamber When at last they reached it however and opened the door the cheerful scene within quite reanimated Capitola s spirits The care of her little maid had prepared a blazing wood fire that lighted up the whole room brightly glowing on the crimson curtains of the bed and the crimson hangings of the windows opposite and flashing upon the high mirror between them Capitola having secured her room in every way stood before her dressing bureau and began to take off her collar under sleeves and other small articles of dress As she stood there her mirror brilliantly lighted up by both lamp and fire reflected clearly the opposite bed with its warm crimson curtains white coverlet and little Pitapat flitting from post to post as she tied back the curtains or smoothed the sheets Capitola stood unclasping her bracelets and smiling to herself at the reflected picture the comfortable nest in which she was so soon to curl herself up in sleep While she was smiling thus she tilted the mirror downwards a little for her better convenience and looking into it again Horror What did she see reflected there Under the bed a pair of glaring eyes watching her from the shadows A sick sensation of fainting came over her but mastering the weakness she tilted the glass a little lower until it reflected all the floor and looked again Horror of horrors there were three stalwart ruffians armed to the teeth lurking in ambush under her bed The deadly inclination to swoon returned upon her but with a heroic effort she controlled her fears and forced herself to look Yes there they were It was no dream no illusion no nightmare there they were three powerful desperadoes armed with bowie knives and revolvers the nearest one crouching low and watching her with his wolfish eyes that shone like phosphorus in the dark What should she do The danger was extreme the necessity of immediate action imminent the need of perfect self control absolute There was Pitapat flitting about the bed in momentary danger of looking under it If she should their lives would not be worth an instant s purchase Their throats would be cut before they should utter a second scream It was necessary therefore to call Pitapat away from the bed where her presence was as dangerous as the proximity of a lighted candle to an open powder barrel But how to trust her voice to do this A single quaver in her tones would betray her consciousness of their presence to the lurking robbers and prove instantly fatal Happily Capitola s pride in her own courage came to her aid Is it possible she said to herself that after all I am a coward and have not even nerve and will enough to command the tones of my own voice Fie on it Cowardice is worse than death And summoning all her resolution she spoke up glibly Patty come here and unhook my dress Yes miss I will just as soon as I get your slippers from unnerneaf of de bed I don t want them Come here this minute and unhook my dress I can t breathe Plague take these country dress makers they think the tighter they screw one up the more fashionable they make one appear Come I say and set my lungs at liberty Yes miss in one minute said Pitapat and to Capitola s unspeakable horror the little maid stooped down and felt along under the side of the bed from the head post to the foot post until she put her hands upon the slippers and brought them forth Providentially the poor little wretch had not for an instant put her stupid head under the bed or used her eyes in the search that was all that saved them from instant massacre Here dey is Caterpillar I knows how yer foots mus be as much out of breaf wid yer tight gaiters as your waist is long of yer tight dress Unhook me said Capitola tilting up the glass lest the child should see what horrors were reflected there The little maid began to obey and Capitola tried to think of some plan to escape their imminent danger To obey the natural impulse to fly from the room would be instantly fatal they would be followed and murdered in the hall before they could possibly give the alarm And to whom could she give the alarm when there was not another creature in the house except missus Condiment While she was turning these things over in her mind it occurred to her that man s extremity is God s opportunity Sending up a silent prayer to heaven for help at need she suddenly thought of a plan it was full of difficulty uncertainty and peril affording not one chance in fifty of success yet the only possible plan of escape It was to find some plausible pretext for leaving the room without exciting suspicion which would be fatal Controlling her tremors and speaking cheerfully she asked Patty do you know whether there were any of those nice quince tarts left from dinner Lor yes miss a heap on em Ole Mis put em away in her cubberd Was there any baked custard left Lor yes Miss Caterpillar dere was nobody but we dens three and think I could eat up all as was left I don t know but you might Well is there any pear sauce Yes miss a big bowl full Well I wish you d go down and bring me up a tart a cup of custard and a spoonful of pear sauce Sitting up so late makes me as hungry as a wolf Come Patty go along Deed miss I se fraid whimpered the little maid Afraid of what you goose Fraid of meeting of a ghose in the dark places Pooh you can take the light with you I can stay here in the dark well enough Deed miss I se fraid What with the candle you blockhead Lors miss de candle wouldn t be no tection I d see de ghoses all de plainer wid de candle What a provoking stupid dolt You re a proper maid afraid to do my bidding Afraid of ghosts forsooth Well I suppose I shall have to go myself plague on you for an aggravating thing There take the candle and come along said Capitola in a tone of impatience Pitapat took up the light and stood ready to accompany her mistress Capitola humming a gay tune went to the door and unlocked and opened it She wished to withdraw the key so as to lock it on the other side and secure the robbers and insure the safety of her own retreat but to do this without betraying her purpose and destroying her own life seemed next to impossible Still singing gayly she ran over in her mind with the quickness of lightning every possible means by which she might withdraw the key silently or without attracting the attention of the watchful robbers It is difficult to say what she would have done had not chance instantly favored her At the same moment that she unlocked and opened the door and held the key in her hand fearful of withdrawing it Pitapat who was hurrying after her with the candle tripped and fell against a chair with a great noise under cover of which Capitola drew forth the key Scolding and pushing Pitapat out before her she closed the door with a bang With the quickness of lightning she slipped the key in the key hole and turned the lock covering the whole with loud and angry railing against poor Pitapat who silently wondered at this unhappy change in her mistress s temper but ascribed it all to hunger muttering to herself I se offen hern tell how people s cross when dere empty Lors knows ef I don t fetch up a whole heap o wittels ebery night for Miss Caterpillar from dis time forred so I will deed me So they went on through the long passages and empty rooms Capitola carefully locking every door behind her until she got down stairs into the great hall Now Miss Caterpillar ef you wants quint tart an pear sass and baked cussets an all dem you ll jest has to go an wake Ole Mis up case dey s in her cubbed an she s got the keys said Pitapat Never mind Patty you follow me said Capitola going to the front hall door and beginning to unlock it and take down the bars and withdraw the bolts Lors miss what is yer a doin of asked the little maid in wonder as Capitola opened the door and looked out I am going out a little way and you must go with me Deed miss I se fraid Very well then stay here in the dark until I come back but don t go to my room because you might meet a ghost on the way Oh Miss I daren t stay here indeed I daren t Then you ll have to come along with me and so no more about it said Capitola sharply as she passed out from the door The poor little maid followed bemoaning the fate that bound her to so capricious a mistress Capitola drew the key from the hall door and locked it on the outside Then clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven she fervently ejaculated Thank God oh thank God that we are safe Lors miss was we in danger We are not now at any rate Pitapat Come along said Capitola hurrying across the lawn toward the open fields Oh my goodness miss where is yer a goin of Don t less us run so fur from home dis lonesome wicked onlawful hour o de night whimpered the distressed little darkey fearing that her mistress was certainly crazed Now then what are you afraid of asked Capitola seeing her hold back Lors miss you knows eberybody knows Brack Dunnel Patty come close listen to me don t scream Black Donald and his men are up there at the house in my chamber under the bed whispered Capitola Pitapat could not scream for though her mouth was wide open her breath was quite gone Shivering with fear she kept close to her mistress s heels as Capitola scampered over the fields A run of a quarter of a mile brought them to the edge of the woods where in its little garden stood the overseer s house Capitola opened the gate hurried through the little front yard and rapped loudly at the door This startled the house dog into furious barking and brought old mister Ezy with his night capped head to the window to see what was the matter It is I Capitola mister Ezy Black Donald and his men are lurking up at the house said our young heroine commencing in an eager and hurried voice and giving the overseer an account of the manner in which she had discovered the presence of the robbers and left the room without alarming them The old man heard with many cries of astonishment ejaculations of prayer and exclamations of thanksgiving And all the while his head was bobbing in and out of the window as he pulled on his pantaloons or buttoned his coat And oh he said at last as he opened the door to Capitola how providential that mister Herbert Greyson is arrove Herbert Greyson Herbert Greyson arrived Where is he then exclaimed Capitola in surprise and joy Yes sartain mister Herbert arrove about an hour ago and thinking you all abed and asleep at the Hall he just stopped in with us all night I ll go and see I doubt if he s gone to bed yet said mister Ezy withdrawing into the house Oh thank heaven thank heaven exclaimed Capitola just as the door opened and Herbert sprang forward to greet her with a Dear Capitola I am so glad to come to see you Dear Herbert just fancy you have said that a hundred times over and that I have replied to the same words a hundred times for we haven t a moment to spare said Capitola shaking his hands and then in an eager vehement manner recounting her discovery and escape from the robbers whom she had locked up in the house Go now she said in conclusion and help mister Ezy to rouse up and arm the farm hands and come immediately to the house I am in agony lest my prolonged absence should excite the robbers suspicion of my ruse and that they should break out and perhaps murder poor missus Condiment Her situation is awful if she did but know it For the love of mercy hasten Not an instant more of time was lost mister Ezy and Herbert Greyson accompanied by Capitola and Patty hurried at once to the negro quarters roused up and armed the men with whatever was at hand and enjoining them to be as stealthy as cats in their approach set out swiftly for the Hall where they soon arrived Take off all your shoes and walk lightly in your stocking feet do not speak do not breathe follow me as silent as death said Herbert Greyson as he softly unlocked the front door and entered the house Silently and stealthily they passed through the middle hall up the broad staircase and through the long narrow passages and steep stairs that led to Capitola s remote chamber There at the door they paused awhile to listen All was still within Herbert Greyson unlocked the door withdrew the key and opened it and entered the room followed by all the men He had scarcely time to close the door and lock it on the inside and withdraw the key before the robbers finding themselves surprised burst out from their hiding place and made a rush for the passage but their means of escape had been already cut off by the forethought of Herbert Greyson A sharp conflict ensued Upon first being summoned to surrender the robbers responded by a hail storm of bullets from their revolvers followed instantly by a charge of bowie knives This was met by an avalanche of blows from pick axes pokers pitchforks sledge hammers spades and rakes beneath which the miscreants were quickly beaten down and overwhelmed They were then set upon and bound with strong ropes brought for the purpose by mister Ezy When they were thus secured hand and foot Capitola who had been a spectator of the whole scene and exposed as much as any other to the rattle of the bullets now approached and looked at the vanquished Black Donald certainly was not one of the party who were no other than our old acquaintances Hal Steve and Dick of the band Each burglar was conveyed to a separate apartment and a strong guard set over him Then Herbert Greyson who had received a flesh wound in his left arm returned to the scene of the conflict to look after the wounded Several of the negroes had received gun shot wounds of more or less importance These were speedily attended to missus Condiment who had slept securely through all the fight was now awakened by Capitola and cautiously informed of what had taken place and assured that all danger was now over The worthy woman as soon as she recovered from the consternation into which the news had plunged her at once set about succoring the wounded Cots and mattresses were made up in one of the empty rooms and bandages and balsams prepared And not until all who had been hurt were made comfortable did Herbert Greyson throw himself upon horseback and ride off to the county seat to summon the authorities and to inform Major Warfield of what had happened No one thought of retiring to bed at Hurricane Hall that night missus Condiment Capitola and Patty sat watching by the bedsides of the wounded Bill Ezy and the men who had escaped injury mounted guard over the prisoners Thus they all remained until sunrise when the Major attended by the Deputy Sheriff and half a dozen constables arrived The night ride of several miles had not sufficed to modify the fury into which Old Hurricane had been thrown by the news Herbert Greyson had aroused him from sleep to communicate He reached Hurricane Hall in a state of excitement that his factotum Wool characterized as boiling But in the very torrent tempest and whirlwind of his passion he remembered that to rail at the vanquished wounded and bound was unmanly and so he did not trust himself to see or speak to the prisoners They were placed in a wagon and under a strong escort of constables were conveyed by the Deputy Sheriff to the county seat where they were securely lodged in jail But Old Hurricane s emotions of one sort or another were a treat to see He bemoaned the sufferings of his poor wounded men he raved at the danger to which his women kind had been exposed and he exulted in the heroism of Capitola catching her up in his arms and crying out Oh my dear Cap My heroine My queen And it was you against whom I was plotting treason ninny that I was You that have saved my house from pillage and my people from slaughter Oh Cap what a jewel you are my dear To all of which Capitola extricating her curly head from his embrace cried only Bother Utterly refusing to be made a lioness of and firmly rejecting the grand triumph The next day Major Warfield went up to the county seat to attend the examination of the three burglars whom he had the satisfaction of seeing fully committed to prison to await their trial at the next term of the Criminal Court which would not sit until October consequently the prisoners had the prospect of remaining in jail some months which Old Hurricane declared to be some satisfaction CHAPTER XXVII SEEKING HIS FORTUNE A wide future smiles before him His heart will beat for fame And he will learn to breathe with love The music of a name Writ on the tablets of his heart In characters of flame Sargent When the winter s course of medical lectures at the Washington College was over late in the spring Traverse Rocke returned to Willow Heights The good doctor gave him a glad welcome congratulating him upon his improved appearance and manly bearing Clara received him with blushing pleasure and Marah Rocke with all the mother s love for her only child He quickly fell into the old pleasant routine of his country life resumed his arduous studies in the doctor s office his work in the flower garden and his morning rides and evening talk with the doctor s lovely child Not the least obstacle was set in the way of his association with Clara yet Traverse grown stronger and wiser than his years would seem to promise controlled both his feelings and his actions and never departed from the most respectful reserve or suffered himself to be drawn into that dangerous familiarity to which their constant companionship might tempt him Marah Rocke with maternal pride witnessed his constant self control and encouraged him to persevere Often in the enthusiasm of her heart when they were alone she would throw her arm around him and push the dark clustering curls from his fine forehead and gazing fondly on his face exclaim That is my noble hearted boy Oh Traverse God will bless you He only tries you now to strengthen you Traverse always understood these vague words and would return her embrace with all his boyish ardor and say God does bless me now mother He blesses me so much in so many many ways that I should be worse than a heathen not to be willing to bear cheerfully one trial And so Traverse would reck his own rede and cultivate cheerful gratitude as a duty to God and man Clara also now with her feminine intuition comprehended her reserved lover honored his motives and rested satisfied with being so deeply loved trusting all their unknown future to heaven The doctor s appreciation and esteem for Traverse increased with every new unfolding of the youth s heart and intellect and never did master take more pains with a favorite pupil or father with a beloved son than did the doctor to push Traverse on in his profession The improvement of the youth was truly surprising Thus passed the summer in healthful alternation of study and exercise When the season waned late in the autumn he went a second time to Washington to attend the winter s course of lectures at the Medical College The doctor gave him letters recommending him as a young man of extraordinary talents and of excellent moral character to the particular attention of several of the most eminent professors His mother bore this second parting with more cheerfulness especially as the separation was enlivened by frequent letters from Traverse full of the history of the present and the hopes of the future The doctor did not forget from time to time to jog the memories of his friends the professors of the medical college that they might afford his protege every facility and assistance in the prosecution of his studies Toward spring Traverse wrote to his friends that his hopes were sanguine of obtaining his diploma at the examination to be held at the end of the session And when Traverse expressed this hope they who knew him so well felt assured that he had made no vain boast And so it proved for early in April Traverse Rocke returned home with a diploma in his pocket Sincere was the joyful sympathy that met him The doctor shook him cordially by the hands declaring that he was the first student he ever knew to get his diploma at the end of only three years study Clara amid smiles and blushes congratulated him And missus Rocke as soon as she had him alone threw her arms around his neck and wept for joy A few days Traverse gave up solely to enjoyment of his friends society and then growing restless he began to talk of opening an office and hanging out a sign in Staunton He consulted the doctor upon this subject The good doctor heard him out and then caressing his own chin and looking over the tops of his spectacles with good humored satire he said My dear boy you have confidence enough in me by this time to bear that I should speak plainly to you Oh Doctor Day just say whatever you like replied the young man fervently Very well then I shall speak very plainly to wit you ll never succeed in Staunton No not if you had the genius of Galen and Esculapius Abernethy and Benjamin Rush put together My dear sir why Because my son it is written that a prophet hath no honor in his own city Of our blessed Lord and Saviour the contemptuous Jews said Is not this Jesus the carpenter s son Oh I understand you sir said Traverse with a deep blush You mean that the people who used some years ago to employ me to put in their coal and saw their wood and run their errands will never trust me to look at their tongues and feel their pulses and write prescriptions That s it my boy You ve defined the difficulty And now I ll tell you what you are to do Traverse You must go to the West my lad Go to the West sir leave my mother leave you leave he hesitated and blushed Clara Yes my son you must go to the West leave your mother leave me and leave Clara It will be best for all parties We managed to live without our lad when he was away at his studies in Washington and we will try to dispense with him longer if it be for his own good Ah sir but then absence had a limitation and the hope of return sweetened every day that passed but if I go to the West to settle it will be without the remotest hope of returning Not so my boy not so for just as soon as Doctor Rocke has established himself in some thriving western town and obtained a good practice gained a high reputation and made himself a home which as he is a fast young man in the best sense of the phrase he can do in a very few years he may come back here and carry to his western home his mother said the doctor with a mischievous twinkle of his eyes Doctor Day I owe you more than a son s honor and obedience I will go wherever you think it best that I should said Traverse earnestly No more than I expected from all my previous knowledge of you Traverse And I on my part will give you only such counsel as I should give my own son had heaven blessed me with one And now Traverse there is no better season for emigration than the spring and no better point to stop and make observations at than saint Louis Of course the place of your final destination must be left for future consideration I have influential friends at saint Louis to whom I will give you letters Dear sir to have matured this plan so well you must have been kindly thinking of my future this long time past said Traverse gratefully Of course of course Who has a better right Now go and break this plan to your mother Traverse pressed the doctor s hand and went to seek his mother He found her in his room busy among his clothing He begged her to stop and sit down while he talked to her And when she had done so he told her the doctor s plan He had almost feared that his mother would meet this proposition with sighs and tears To his surprise and pleasure missus Rocke received the news with an encouraging smile telling him that the doctor had long prepared her to expect that her boy would very properly go and establish himself in the West that she should correspond with him frequently and as soon as he should be settled come and keep house for him Finally she said that anticipating this emergency she had during her three years residence beneath the doctor s roof saved three hundred dollars which she should give her boy to start with The tears rushed to the young man s eyes For your dear sake mother only for yours may they become three hundred thousand in my hands he exclaimed Preparations were immediately commenced for Traverse s journey As before Clara gladly gave her aid in getting ready his wardrobe As he was about to make his debut as a young physician in a strange city his mother was anxious that his dress should be faultless and therefore put the most delicate needlework upon all the little articles of his outfit Clara volunteered to mark them all And one day when Traverse happened to be alone with his mother she showed him his handkerchiefs collars and linen beautifully marked in minute embroidered letters I suppose Traverse that you being a young man cannot appreciate the exquisite beauty of this work she said Indeed but I can mother I did not sit by your side so many years while you worked without knowing something about it This is wonderful The golden thread with which the letters are embroidered is finer than the finest silk I ever saw said Traverse admiringly to please his mother whom he supposed to be the embroideress Well they may be said missus Rocke for that golden thread of which you speak is Clara s golden hair which she herself has drawn out and threaded her needle with and worked into the letters of your name Traverse suddenly looked up his color went and came he had no words to reply I told you because I thought it would give you pleasure to know it and that it would be a comfort to you when you are far away from us for Traverse I hope that by this time you have grown strong and wise enough to have conquered yourself and to enjoy dear Clara s friendship aright Mother he said sorrowfully and then his voice broke down and without another word he turned and left the room To feel how deeply and hopelessly he loved the doctor s sweet daughter to feel sure that she perceived and returned his dumb despairing love and to know that duty gratitude honor commanded him to be silent to tear himself away from her and make no sign was a trial almost too great for the young heart s integrity Scarcely could he prevent the internal struggle betraying itself upon his countenance As the time drew near for his departure self control grew difficult and almost impossible Even Clara lost her joyous spirits and despite all her efforts to be cheerful grew so pensive that her father without seeming to understand the cause gayly rallied her upon her dejection Traverse understood it and almost longed for the day to come when he should leave this scene of his love and his sore trial One afternoon a few days before he was to start Doctor Day sent for Traverse to come to him in his study And as soon as they were seated comfortably together at the table the doctor put into the young man s hand a well filled pocketbook and when Traverse with a deep and painful blush would have given it back he forced it upon him with the old argument It is only a loan my boy Money put out at interest Capital well and satisfactorily invested And now listen to me I am about to speak to you of that which is much nearer your heart Traverse became painfully embarrassed Traverse resumed the doctor I have grown to love you as a son and to esteem you as a man I have lived long enough to value solid integrity far beyond wealth or birth and when that integrity is adorned and enriched by high talents it forms a character of excellence not often met with in this world I have proved both your integrity and your talents Traverse and I am more than satisfied with you I am proud of you my boy Traverse bowed deeply but still blushed You will wonder continued the doctor to what all this talk tends I will tell you Traverse I have long known your unspoken love for Clara and I have honored your scruples in keeping silent when silence must have been so painful Your trial is now over my son Go and open for yourself an honorable career in the profession you have chosen and mastered and return and Clara shall be yours Traverse overwhelmed with surprise and joy at this incredible good fortune seized the doctor s hand and in wild and incoherent language tried to express his gratitude There there said the doctor go and tell Clara all this and bring the roses back to her cheeks and then your parting will be the happier for this hope before you I must speak I must speak first said the young man in a choking voice I must tell you some little of the deep gratitude I feel for you sir Oh when I forget all that you have done for me may my right hand forget her cunning may God and man forget me Doctor Day the Lord helping me for your good sake I will be all that you have prophesied and hope and expect of me For your sake for Clara s and my mother s I will bend every power of my mind soul and body to attain the eminence you desire for me In a word the Lord giving me grace I will become worthy of being your son and Clara s husband There there my dear boy go and tell Clara all that said the doctor pressing the young man s hand and dismissing him Traverse went immediately to seek Clara whom he found sitting alone in the parlor She was bending over some delicate needlework that Traverse knew by instinct was intended for himself Now had Traverse foreseen from the first the success of his love there might possibly have been the usual shyness and hesitation in declaring himself to the object of his affection But although he and Clara had long deeply and silently loved and understood each other yet neither had dared to hope for so improbable an event as the doctor s favoring their attachment and now under the exciting influence of the surprise joy and gratitude with which the doctor s magnanimity had filled his heart Traverse forgot all shyness and hesitation and stepping quickly to Clara s side and dropping gently upon one knee he took her hand and bowing his head upon it said Clara my own own Clara your dear father has given me leave to tell you at last how much and how long I have loved you and then he arose and sat down beside her The blush deepened upon Clara s cheek tears filled her eyes and her voice trembled as she murmured Heaven bless my dear father He is unlike every other man on earth Oh he is he is said Traverse fervently and dear Clara never did a man strive so hard for wealth fame or glory as I shall strive to become worthy to be called his son Do Traverse do dear Traverse I want you to honor even his very highest drafts upon your moral and intellectual capacities I know you are worthy of his high regard now else he never would have chosen you as his son but I am ambitious for you Traverse I would have your motto be Excelsior higher said the doctor s daughter And you dear Clara may I venture to hope that you do not disapprove of your father s choice or reject the hand that he permits me to offer you said Traverse for though he understood Clara well enough yet like all honest men he wanted some definite and practical engagement There is my hand my heart was yours long ago murmured the maiden in a tremulous voice He took and pressed that white hand to his heart looked hesitatingly and pleadingly in her face for an instant and then drawing her gently to his bosom sealed their betrothal on her pure lips Then they sat side by side and hand in hand in a sweet silence for a few moments and then Clara said You have not told your mother yet Go and tell her Traverse it will make her so happy And Traverse I will be a daughter to her while you are gone Tell her that too Dear girl you have always been as kind and loving to my mother as it was possible to be How can you ever be more so than you have been I shall find a way smiled Clara Again he pressed her hand to his heart and to his lips and left the room to find his mother He had a search before he discovered her at last in the drawing room arranging it for their evening fireside gathering Come mother and sit down by me on this sofa for I have glorious tidings for your ear Dear Clara sent me from her own side to tell you Ah still thinking always thinking madly thinking of the doctor s daughter Poor poor boy said missus Rocke Yes and always intend to think of her to the very end of my life and beyond if possible But come dear mother and hear me explain said Traverse and as soon as missus Rocke had taken the indicated seat Traverse commenced and related to her the substance of the conversation between the doctor and himself in the library in which the former authorized his addresses to his daughter and also his own subsequent explanation and engagement with Clara missus Rocke listened to all this in unbroken silence and when at length Traverse had concluded his story she clasped her hands and raised her eyes uttering fervent thanksgivings to the fountain of all mercies You do not congratulate me dear mother Oh Traverse I am returning thanks to heaven on your behalf Oh my son my son but that such things as these are Providential I should tremble to see you so happy So I will not presume to congratulate I will pray for you Dear mother you have suffered so much in your life that you are incredulous of happiness Be more hopeful and confiding The Bible says There remaineth now these three Faith Hope and Charity but the greatest of all is Charity You have Charity enough dear mother try to have more Faith and Hope and you will be happier And look there is Clara coming this way She does not know that we are here I will call her Dear Clara come in and convince my mother she will not believe in our happiness said Traverse going to the door and leading his blushing and smiling betrothed into the room It may be that missus Rocke does not want me for a daughter in law said Clara archly as she approached and put her hand in that of Marah Not want you my own darling said Marah Rocke putting her arm around Clara s waist and drawing her to her bosom not want you You know I am just as much in love with you as Traverse himself can be And I have longed for you my sweet longed for you as an unattainable blessing ever since that day when Traverse first left us and you came and laid your bright head on my bosom and wept with me And now if we must cry a little when Traverse leaves us we can go and take comfort in being miserable together with a better understanding of our relations said Clara with an arch smile Where are you all Where is everybody that I am left wandering about the lonely house like a poor ghost in Hades said the doctor s cheerful voice in the passage without Here father here we are a family party wanting only you to complete it answered his daughter springing to meet him The doctor came in smiling pressed his daughter to his bosom shook Traverse cordially by the hand and kissed Marah Rocke s cheek That was his way of congratulating himself and all others on the betrothal The evening was passed in unalloyed happiness Let them enjoy it It was their last of comfort that bright evening Over that household was already gathering a cloud heavy and dark with calamity calamity that must have overwhelmed the stability of any faith which was not as theirs was stayed upon God CHAPTER XXVIII A PANIC IN THE OUTLAW S DEN Imagination frames events unknown In wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin And what it fears creates Hannah More Dark doubt and fear o er other spirits lower But touch not his who every waking hour Has one fixed hope and always feels its power Crabbe Upon the very same night that the three robbers were surprised and captured by the presence of mind of Capitola at Hurricane Hall Black Donald disguised as a negro was lurking in the woods around the mansion waiting for the coming of his three men with their prize But as hour after hour passed and they came not the desperado began heartily to curse their sloth for to no other cause was he enabled to attribute the delay as he knew the house the destined scene of the outrage to be deserted by all for the night except by the three helpless females As night waned and morning began to dawn in the east the chief grew seriously uneasy at the prolonged absence of his agents a circumstance that he could only account for upon the absurd hypothesis that those stupid brutes had suffered themselves to be overtaken by sleep in their ambuscade While he was cursing their inefficiency and regretting that he had not himself made one of the party he wandered in his restlessness to another part of the woods and the opposite side of the house He had not been long here before his attention was arrested by the tramping of approaching horsemen He withdrew into the shade of the thicket and listened while the travelers went by The party proved to consist of Old Hurricane Herbert Greyson and the Sheriff s officers on their way from the town to Hurricane Hall to take the captured burglars into custody And Black Donald by listening attentively gathered enough from their conversation to know that his men had been discovered and captured by the heroism of Capitola That girl again muttered Black Donald to himself She is doomed to be my destruction or I hers Our fates are evidently connected Poor Steve Poor Dick Poor Hal Little did I think that your devotion to your captain would carry you into the very jaws of death pshaw hang it Let boys and women whine I must act And with this resolution Black Donald dogged the path of the horsemen until he had reached that part of the woods skirting the road opposite the park gate Here he hid himself in the bushes to watch events Soon from his hiding place he saw the wagon approach containing the three men heavily ironed and escorted by a strong guard of county constables and plantation negroes all well armed and under the command of the Sheriff and Herbert Greyson Ha ha ha They must dread an attempt on our part of rescue or they never would think of putting such a formidable guard over three wounded and handcuffed men laughed Black Donald to himself Courage my boys he muttered Your chief will free you from prison or share your captivity I wish I could trumpet that into your ears at this moment but prudence the better part of valor forbids For the same words that would encourage you would warn your captors into greater vigilance And so saying Black Donald let the procession pass and then made tracks for his retreat It was broad daylight when he reached the Old Inn The robbers worn out with waiting and watching for the captain and his men with the fair prize had thrown themselves down upon the kitchen floor and now lay in every sort of awkward attitude stretched out or doubled up in heavy sleep The old beldame had disappeared doubtless she had long since sought her night lair Taking a poker from the corner of the fireplace Black Donald went around among the sleeping robbers and stirred them up with vigorous punches in the ribs and cries of Wake up dolts brutes blockheads Wake up You rest on a volcano about to break out You sleep over a mine about to be exploded Wake up sluggards that you are Your town is taken Your castle is stormed The enemy is at your throats with drawn swords Ah brutes will you wake then or shall I have to lay it on harder What the demon How now What s this were some of the ejaculations of the men as they slowly and sulkily roused themselves from their heavy slumber The house is on fire The ship s sinking The cars have run off the track The boiler s burst and the devil s to pay cried Black Donald accompanying his words with vigorous punches of the poker into the ribs of the recumbent men What the foul fiend ails you captain Have you got the girl and drunk too much liquor on your wedding night asked one of the men No Mac I have not got the girl On the contrary the girl blame her has got three of my best men in custody In one word Hal Dick and Steve are safely lodged in the county jail What Perdition My eye Here s a go were the simultaneous exclamations of the men as they sprang upon their feet In the fiend s name captain tell us all about it said Mac anxiously I have no time to talk much nor you to tarry long It was all along of that blamed witch Capitola said Black Donald who then gave a rapid account of the adventure and the manner in which Capitola entrapped and captured the burglars together with the way in which he himself came by the information I declare one can t help liking that girl I should admire her even if she should put a rope about my neck said Mac She s a brick said another with emphasis She s some pumpkins now I tell you assented a third I am more than ever resolved to get her into my possession But in the mean time lads we must evacuate the Old Inn It is getting too hot to hold us Aye captain Aye lads listen We must talk fast and act promptly the poor fellows up there in jail are game I know They would not willingly peach but they are badly wounded If one of them should have to die and be blessed with a psalm singing parson to attend him no knowing what he may be persuaded to confess Therefore let us quickly decide upon some new rendezvous that will be unsuspected even by our poor caged birds If any of you have any place in your eye speak We would rather hear what you have to say captain said Mac and all the rest assented Well then you all know the Devil s Punch Bowl Aye do we captain Well what you do not know what nobody knows but myself is this that about half way down that awful chasm in the side of the rock is a hole concealed by a clump of evergreens that hole is the entrance to a cavern of enormous extent Let that be our next rendezvous And now avaunt Fly Scatter and meet me in the cavern to night at the usual hour Listen carry away all our arms ammunition disguises and provisions so that no vestige of our presence may be left behind As for dummy if they can make her speak the cutting out of her tongue was lost labor vanish But our pals in prison said Mac They shall be my care We must lie low for a few days so as to put the authorities off their guard Then if our pals recover from their wounds and have proved game against Church and State I shall know what measures to take for their deliverance No more talk now prepare for your flitting and fly The captain s orders were obeyed and within two hours from that time no vestige of the robbers presence remained in the deserted Old Inn If any Sheriff s officer had come there with a search warrant he would have found nothing suspicious he would have seen only a poor old dumb woman busy at her spinning wheel and if he had questioned her would only have got smiles and shakes of the head for an answer or the exhibitions of coarse country gloves and stockings of her own knitting which she would in dumb show beg him to purchase Days and weeks passed and the three imprisoned burglars languished in jail each in a separate cell Bitterly each in his heart complained of the leader that had apparently deserted them in their direst need And if neither betrayed him it was probably because they could not do so without deeply criminating themselves and for no better motive There is said to be honor among thieves It is on the face of it untrue there can be neither honor confidence nor safety among men whose profession is crime The burglars therefore had no confidence in their leader and secretly and bitterly reproached him for his desertion of them Meanwhile the annual camp meeting season approached It was rumored that a camp meeting would be held in the wooded vale below Tip Top and soon this report was confirmed by announcements in all the county papers And all who intended to take part in the religious festival or have a tent on the ground began to prepare provisions cooking meat and poultry baking bread cakes pies et cetera And preachers from all parts of the country were flocking in to the village to be on the spot for the commencement missus Condiment though a member of another church loved in her soul the religious excitement the warming up as she called it to be had at the camp meeting But never in the whole course of her life had she taken part in one except so far as riding to the preaching in the morning and returning home in the evening But Capitola who was as usual in the interval between her adventures bored half to death with the monotony of her life at Hurricane Hall and praying not against but wishing for fire floods or thieves or anything to stir her stagnant blood heard of the camp meeting and expressed a wish to have a tent on the camp ground and remain there from the beginning to the end to see all that was to be seen hear all that was to be heard feel all that was to be felt and learn all that was to be known And as Capitola ever since her victory over the burglars had been the queen regnant of Hurricane Hall she had only to express this wish to have it carried into immediate effect Old Hurricane himself went up to Tip Top and purchased the canvas and set two men to work under his own immediate direction to make the tent And as Major Warfield s campaigning experience was very valuable here it turned out that the Hurricane Hall tent was the largest and best on the camp ground As soon as it was set up under the shade of a grove of oak trees a wagon from Hurricane Hall conveyed to the spot the simple and necessary furniture cooking materials and provisions And the same morning the family carriage driven by Wool brought out Major Warfield missus Condiment Capitola and her little maid Patty The large tent was divided into two compartments one for Major Warfield and his man Wool the other for missus Condiment Capitola and Patty As the family party stepped out of the carriage the novelty freshness and beauty of the scene called forth a simultaneous burst of admiration The little snow white tents were dotted here and there through the woods in beautiful contrast with the greenness of the foliage groups of well dressed and cheerful looking men women and children were walking about over all smiled a morning sky of cloudless splendor The preachings and the prayer meetings had not yet commenced Indeed many of the brethren were hard at work in an extensive clearing setting up a rude pulpit and arranging rough benches to accommodate the women and children of the camp congregation Our party went into their tent delighted with the novelty of the whole thing though Old Hurricane declared that it was nothing new to his experience but reminded him strongly of his campaigning days Wool assented saying that the only difference was there were no ladies in the old military camp I have neither time nor space to give a full account of this camp meeting The services commenced the same evening There were preachers of more or less fervor of piety and eloquence of utterance Old Christians had their first love revived young ones found their zeal kindled and sinners were awakened to a sense of their sin and danger Every Christian there said the season had been a good one In the height of the religious enthusiasm there appeared a new preacher in the field He seemed a man considerably past middle age and broken down with sickness or sorrow His figure was tall thin and stooping his hair white as snow his face pale and emaciated his movements slow and feeble and his voice low and unsteady He wore a solemn suit of black that made his thin form seem of skeleton proportions a snow white neck cloth and a pair of great round iron rimmed spectacles that added nothing to his good looks Yet this old sickly and feeble man seemed one of fervent piety and of burning eloquence Every one sought his society and when it was known that Father Gray was to hold forth the whole camp congregation turned out to hear him It must not be supposed that in the midst of this great revival those poor sinners above all sinners the burglars imprisoned in the neighboring town were forgotten no they were remembered prayed for visited and exhorted And no one took more interest in the fate of these men than good missus Condiment who having seen them all on that great night at Hurricane Hall and having with her own kind hands plastered their heads and given them possets could not drive out of her heart a certain compassion for their miseries No one either admired Father Gray more than did the little old housekeeper of Hurricane Hall and as her table and her accommodations were the best on the camp ground she often invited and pressed good Father Gray to rest and refresh himself in her tent And the old man though a severe ascetic yielded to her repeated solicitations until at length he seemed to live there altogether One day missus Condiment being seriously exercised upon the subject of the imprisoned men said to Father Gray who was reposing himself in the tent Father Gray I wished to speak to you sir upon the subject of those poor wretched men who are to be tried for their lives at the next term of the Criminal Court Our ministers have all been to see them and talked to them but not one of the number can make the least impression on them or bring them to any sense of their awful condition Ah that is dreadful sighed the aged man Yes dreadful Father Gray Now I thought if you would only visit them you could surely bring them to reason My dear friend I would willingly do so but I must confess to you a weakness a great weakness of the flesh I have a natural shrinking from men of blood I know it is sinful but indeed I cannot overcome it But my dear Father Gray a man of your experience knows full well that if you cannot overcome that feeling you should act in direct opposition to it And I assure you there is no danger Why even I should not be at all afraid of a robber when he is double ironed and locked up in a cell and I should enter guarded by a pair of turnkeys I know it my dear lady I know it and I feel that I ought to overcome this weakness or do my duty in its despite Yes and if you would consent to go Father Gray I would not mind going with you myself if that would encourage you any Of course it would my dear friend and if you will go with me and if the brethren think that I could do any good I will certainly endeavor to conquer my repugnance and visit these imprisoned men It was arranged that Father Gray accompanied by missus Condiment should go to the jail upon the following morning and accordingly they set out immediately after breakfast A short ride up the mountain brought them to Tip Top in the center of which stood the jail It was a simple structure of gray stone containing within its own walls the apartments occupied by the warden To these missus Condiment who was the leader in the whole matter first presented herself introducing Father Gray as one of the preachers of the camp meeting a very pious man and very effective in his manner of dealing with hardened offenders I have heard of the reverend mister Gray and his powerful exhortations said the warden with a low bow and I hope he may be able to make some impression on these obdurate men and induce them if possible to make a clean breast of it and give up the retreat of their band Each of them has been offered a free pardon on condition of turning State s evidence and each has refused Indeed have they done so case hardened creatures mildly inquired Father Gray Aye have they but you dear sir may be able to persuade them to do so I shall endeavor I shall endeavor said the mild old man The warden then requested the visitors to follow him and led the way up stairs to the cells I understand that the criminals are confined separately said mister Gray to the warden No sir they were so confined at first for better security but as they have been very quiet and as since those rowdies that disturbed the camp meeting have been sent to prison and filled up our cells we have had to put those three robbers into one cell I m afraid I began the minister hesitating Father Gray is nervous good mister Jailor I hope there s no danger from these dreadful men all of them together for I promised Father Gray that he should be safe myself said missus Condiment Oh ma am undoubtedly they are double ironed said the warden as he unlocked a door and admitted the visitors into rather a darkish cell in which were the three prisoners Steve the mulatto was stretched upon the floor in a deep sleep Hal was sitting on the side of the cot twiddling his fingers Dick sat crouched up in a corner with his head against the wall Peace be with you my poor souls said the mild old man as he entered the cell You go to the demon said Dick with a hideous scowl Nay my poor man I came in the hope of saving you from that enemy of souls Here s another There s three comes reg lar Here s the fourth Go it old fellow We re gettin used to it It s gettin to be entertainin It s the only diversion we have in this blamed hole said Hal Nay friend if you use profane language I cannot stay to hear it said the old man Yaw aw aw ow yawned Steve half rising and stretching himself What s the row I was just dreaming our captain had come to deliver us yow aw aw ooh It s only another parson and with that Steve turned himself over and settled to sleep My dear mister Jailer do you think that these men are safe for if you do I think we had better leave excellent mister Gray to talk to them alone he can do them so much more good if he has them all to himself said missus Condiment who was in spite of all her previous boasting beginning to quail and tremble under the hideous glare of Demon Dick s eyes N no n no n no faltered the preacher nervously taking hold of the coat of the warden You go along out of this the whole of you I m not a wild beast in a cage to be stared at growled Demon Dick with a baleful glare that sent missus Condiment and the preacher shuddering to the cell door mister Gray I do assure you sir there is no danger The men are double ironed and malignant as they may be they can do you no harm And if you would stay and talk to them you might persuade them to confession and do the community much service said the warden I I I m no coward but but but faltered the old man tremblingly approaching the prisoners I understand you sir You are in bad health which makes you nervous Yes yes Heaven forgive me but if you mister Jailer and the good lady here will keep within call in case of accidents I don t mind if I do remain and exhort these men for a short time said the old man Of course we will Come missus Condiment mum There s a good bench in the lobby and I ll send for my old woman and we three can have a good talk while the worthy mister Gray is speaking to the prisoners said the warden conducting the housekeeper from the cell As soon as they had gone the old man went to the door and peeped after them and having seen that they went to the extremity of the lobby to a seat under an open window he turned back to the cell and going up to Hal said in a low voice Now then is it possible that you do not know me Hal stopped twiddling his fingers and looked up at the tall thin stooping figure the gray hair the white eyebrows and the pale face and said gruffly No May the demon fly away with me if I ever saw you before Nor you Dick inquired the old man in a mild voice turning to the one addressed No burn you nor want to see you now Steve Steve said the old man in a pitiful voice waking the sleeper Don t you know me either Don t bother me said that worthy giving himself another turn and another settle to sleep Dolts blockheads brutes Do you know me now growled the visitor changing his voice Our captain Our captain Our captain they simultaneously cried Hush sink your souls Do you want to bring the warden upon us growled Black Donald for it was unquestionably him in a new metamorphosis Then all I have to say captain is that you have left us here a blamed long time And exposed to sore temptation to peach on me Couldn t help it lads Couldn t help it I waited until I could do something to the purpose Now may Satan roast me alive if I know what you have done to turn yourself into an old man Burn my soul if I should know you now captain if it wa n t for your voice grumbled Steve Listen then you ungrateful suspicious wretches I did for you what no captain ever did for his men before I had exhausted all manner of disguises so that the authorities would almost have looked for me in an old woman s gown See then what I did I put myself on a month s regimen of vegetable diet and kept myself in a cavern until I grew as pale and thin as a hermit Then I shaved off my hair beard mustaches and eyebrows Yes blame you I sacrificed all my beauty to your interests Fate helps those who help themselves The camp meeting gathering together hosts of people and preachers gave me the opportunity of appearing without exciting inquiry I put on a gray wig a black suit assumed a feeble voice stooping gait and a devout manner and became a popular preacher at the camp meeting Captain you re a brick You are indeed I do not flatter you said Hal It was a sentiment in which all agreed I had no need of further machination continued the captain they actually gave me the game I was urged to visit you here forced to remain alone and talk with you laughed Black Donald And now captain my jewel my treasure my sweetheart that I love with a love passing the love of woman how is your reverence going to get us out Listen said the captain diving into his pockets you must get yourselves out This prison is by no means strongly fastened or well guarded Here are files to file off your fetters Here are tools to pick the locks and here are three loaded revolvers to use against any of the turnkey who might discover and attempt to stop you To night however is the last of the camp meeting and the two turnkeys are among my hearers I shall keep them all night Now you know what to do I must leave you Dick try to make an assault on me that I may scream but first conceal your tools and arms Hal hid the instruments and Dick with an awful roar sprang at the visitor who ran to the grating crying Help help The warden came hurrying to the spot Take im out o this then muttered Dick sulkily getting back into his corner Oh what a wretch said missus Condiment I shall be glad when he s once hanged said the jailer I I fear that I can do them but little good and and I would rather not come again being sickly and nervous faltered Father Gray No my dear good sir I for one shall not ask you to risk your precious health for such a set of wretches They are Satan s own You shall come home to our tent and lie down to rest and I will make you an egg caudle that will set you up again said missus Condiment tenderly as the whole party left the cell That day the outrageous conduct of the imprisoned burglars was the subject of conversation even dividing the interest of the religious excitement But the next morning the whole community was thrown into a state of consternation by the discovery that the burglars had broken jail and fled and that the notorious outlaw Black Donald had been in their very midst disguised as an elderly field preacher CHAPTER XXIX THE VICTORY OVER DEATH Glory to God to God he saith Knowledge by suffering entereth And life is perfected in death E B Browning One morning in the gladness of his heart Doctor Day mounted his horse and rode down to Staunton gayly refusing to impart the object of his ride to any one and bidding Traverse stay with the women until he should return As soon as the doctor was gone Traverse went into the library to arrange his patron s books and papers missus Rocke and Clara hurried away to attend to some little mystery of their own invention for the surprise and delight of the doctor and Traverse For the more secret accomplishment of their purpose they had dismissed all attendance and were at work alone in missus Rocke s room And here Clara s sweet frank and humble disposition was again manifest for when Marah would arise from her seat to get anything Clara would forestall her purpose and say Tell me tell me to get what you want just as if I were your child and you will make me feel so well do now You are very good dear Miss Clara but I would rather not presume to ask you to wait on me said Marah gravely Presume What a word from you to me Please don t use it ever again nor call me Miss Clara Call me Clara or child do mamma said the doctor s daughter then suddenly pausing she blushed and was silent Marah gently took her hand and drew her into a warm embrace It was while the friends were conversing so kindly in Marah s room and while Traverse was still engaged in arranging the doctor s books and papers that one of the men servants rapped at the library door and without waiting permission to come in entered the room with every mark of terror in his look and manner What is the matter inquired Traverse anxiously rising Oh mister Traverse sir the doctor s horse has just rushed home to the stables all in foam without his rider Good heaven exclaimed Traverse starting up and seizing his hat Follow me immediately Hurry to the stables and saddle my horse and bring him up instantly We must follow on the road the doctor took to see what has happened Stay On your life breathe not a word of what has occurred I would not have Miss Day alarmed for the world he concluded hastening down stairs attended by the servant In five minutes from the time he left the library Traverse was in the saddle galloping toward Staunton and looking attentively along the road as he went Alas he had not gone far when in descending the wooded hill he saw lying doubled up helplessly on the right side of the path the body of the good doctor With an exclamation between a groan and a cry of anguish Traverse threw himself from his saddle and kneeled beside the fallen figure gazing in an agony of anxiety upon the closed eyes pale features and contracted form and crying Oh heaven have mercy Doctor Day oh Doctor Day Can you speak to me The white and quivering eyelids opened and the faltering tongue spoke Traverse get me home that I may see Clara before I die Oh must this be so Must this be so Oh that I could die for you my friend My dear dear friend cried Traverse wringing his hands in such anguish as he had never known before Then feeling the need of self control and the absolute necessity of removing the sufferer Traverse repressed the swelling flood of sorrow in his bosom and cast about for the means of conveying the doctor to his house He dreaded to leave him for an instant and yet it was necessary to do so as the servant whom he had ordered to follow him had not yet come up While he was bathing the doctor s face with water from a little stream beside the path John the groom came riding along and seeing his fallen master with an exclamation of horror sprang from his saddle and ran to the spot John said Traverse in a heart broken tone mount again and ride for your life to the house Have a cart yes that will be the easiest conveyance have a cart got ready instantly with a feather bed placed in it and the gentlest horse harnessed to it and drive it here to the roadside at the head of this path Hasten for your life Say not a word of what has happened lest it should terrify the ladies Quick quick on your life Again as the man was hurrying away the doctor spoke faintly murmuring For heaven s sake do not let poor Clara be shocked No no she shall not be I warned him dear friend How do you feel Can you tell where you are hurt The doctor feebly moved one hand to his chest and whispered There and in my back Traverse controlling his own great mental agony did all that he could to soothe and alleviate the sufferings of the doctor until the arrival of the cart that stopped on the road at the head of the little bridle path where the accident happened Then John jumped from the driver s seat and came to the spot where he tenderly assisted the young man in raising the doctor and conveying him to the cart and laying him upon the bed Notwithstanding all their tender care in lifting and carrying him it was but too evident that he suffered greatly in being moved Slowly as they proceeded at every jolt of the cart his corrugated brows and blanched and quivering lips told how much agony he silently endured Thus at last they reached home He was carefully raised by the bed and borne into the house and up stairs to his own chamber where being undressed he was laid upon his own easy couch Traverse sent off for other medical aid administered a restorative and proceeded to examine his injuries It is useless dear boy useless all You have medical knowledge enough to be as sure of that as I am Cover me up and let me compose myself before seeing Clara and while I do so go you and break this news gently to the poor child said the doctor who being under the influence of the restorative spoke more steadily than at any time since the fall Traverse almost broken hearted obeyed his benefactor and went to seek his betrothed praying the Lord to teach him how to tell her this dreadful calamity and to support her under its crushing weight As he went slowly wringing his hands he suddenly met Clara with her dress in disorder and her hair flying just as she had run from her room while dressing for dinner Hurrying toward him she exclaimed Traverse what has happened For the good Lord s sake tell me quickly the house is all in confusion Every one is pale with affright No one will answer me Your mother just now ran past me out of the store room with her face as white as death Oh what does it all mean Clara love come and sit down you are almost fainting oh heaven support her murmured Traverse as he led the poor girl to the hall sofa Tell me Tell me she said Clara your father My father No no no do not say any harm has happened to my father do not Traverse do not Oh Clara try to be firm dear one My father Oh my father he is dead shrieked Clara starting up wildly to run she knew not whither Traverse sprang up and caught her arm and drawing her gently back to her seat said No dear Clara no not so bad as that he is living Oh thank heaven for so much What is it then Traverse He is ill Oh let me go to him Stay dear Clara compose yourself first You would not go and disturb him with this frightened and distressed face of yours let me get you a glass of water said Traverse starting up and bringing the needed sedative from an adjoining room There Clara drink that and offer a silent prayer to heaven to give you self control I will oh I must for his sake But tell me Traverse is it is it as I fear as he expected apoplexy No dear love no He rode out this morning and his horse got frightened by the van of a circus company that was going into the town and And ran away with him and threw him Oh heaven Oh my dear father exclaimed Clara once more clasping her hands wildly and starting up Again Traverse promptly but gently detained her saying You promised me to be calm dear Clara and you must be so before I can suffer you to see your father Clara sank into her seat and covered her face with her hands murmuring in a broken voice How can I be Oh how can I be when my heart is with grief and fright Traverse Was he was he oh dread to ask you Oh was he much hurt Clara love his injuries are internal Neither he nor I yet know their full extent I have sent off for two old and experienced practitioners from Staunton I expect them every moment In the mean time I have done all that is possible for his relief Traverse said Clara very calmly controlling herself by an almost superhuman effort Traverse I will be composed you shall see that I will take me to my dear father s bedside it is there that I ought to be That is my dear brave dutiful girl Come Clara replied the young man taking her hand and leading her up to the bed chamber of the doctor They met missus Rocke at the door who tearfully signed them to go in as she left it When they entered and approached the bedside Traverse saw that the suffering but heroic father must have made some superlative effort before he could have reduced his haggard face and writhing form to its present state of placid repose to meet his daughter s eyes and spare her feelings She on her part was no less firm Kneeling beside his couch she took his hand and met his eye composedly as she asked Dear father how do you feel now Not just so easy love as if I had laid me down here for an afternoon s nap yet in no more pain than I can very well bear Dear father what can I do for you You may bathe my forehead and lips with cologne my dear said the doctor not so much for the sake of the reviving perfume as because he knew it would comfort Clara to feel that she was doing something however slight for him Traverse stood upon the opposite side of the bed fanning him In a few moments missus Rocke re entered the room announcing that the two old physicians from Staunton Doctor Dawson and Doctor Williams had arrived Show them up missus Rocke Clara love retire while the physicians remain with me said Doctor Day missus Rocke left the room to do his bidding And Clara followed and sought the privacy of her own apartment to give way to the overwhelming grief which she could no longer resist As soon as she was gone the doctor also yielded to the force of the suffering that he had been able to endure silently in her presence and writhed and groaned with agony that wrung the heart of Traverse to behold Presently the two physicians entered the room and approached the bed with expressions of sincere grief at beholding their old friend in such a condition and a hope that they might speedily be able to relieve him To all of which the doctor repressing all exhibitions of pain and holding out his hand in a cheerful manner replied I am happy to see you in a friendly way old friends I am willing also that you should try what you what you can do for me but I warn you that it will be useless A few hours or days of inflammation fever and agony then the ease of mortification then dissolution Tut tut said Doctor Williams cheerfully We never permit a patient to pronounce a prognosis upon his own case Friend my horse ran away stumbled and fell upon me and rolled over me in getting up The viscera is crushed within me breathing is difficult speech painful motion agonizing but you may examine and satisfy yourselves said Doctor Day still speaking cheerfully though with great suffering His old friends proceeded gently to the examination which resulted in their silently and perfectly coinciding in opinion with the patient himself Then with Doctor Day and Traverse they entered into a consultation and agreed upon the best palliatives that could be administered and begging that if in any manner professionally or otherwise they could serve their suffering friend at any hour of the day or night they might be summoned they took leave As soon as they had gone Clara who had given way to a flood of tears and regained her composure rapped for admittance Presently dear daughter presently said the doctor who then beckoning Traverse to stoop low said Do not let Clara sit up with me to night I foresee a night of great anguish which I may not be able to repress and which I would not have her witness Promise you will keep her away I promise faltered the almost broken hearted youth You may admit her now said the doctor composing his convulsed countenance as best he could lest the sight of his sufferings should distress his daughter Clara entered and resumed her post at the side of the bed Traverse left the room to prepare the palliatives for his patient The afternoon waned As evening approached the fever inflammation and pain arose to such a degree that the doctor could no longer forbear betraying his excessive suffering which was besides momentarily increasing so he said to Clara My child you must now leave me and retire to bed I must be watched by Traverse alone to night And Traverse seeing her painful hesitation between her extreme reluctance to leave him and her wish to obey him approached and murmured Dear Clara it would distress him to have you stay he will be much better attended by me alone Clara still hesitated and Traverse beckoning his mother to come and speak to her left her side missus Rocke approached her and said It must be so dear girl for you know that there are some cases in which sick men should be watched by men only and this is one of them I myself shall sit up to night in the next room within call And may I not sit there beside you pleaded Clara No my dear love as you can do your father no good he desires that you should go to bed and rest Do not distress him by refusing Oh and am I to go to bed and sleep while my dear father lies here suffering I cannot oh I cannot My dear yes you must and if you cannot sleep you can lie awake and pray for him Here the doctor whose agony was growing unendurable called out Go Clara go at once my dear She went back to the bedside and pressed her lips to his forehead and put her arms around him and prayed Oh my dear father may the blessed Saviour take you in his pitying embrace and give you ease to night Your poor Clara will pray for you as she never prayed for herself May the Lord bless you my sweet child said the doctor lifting one hand painfully and laying it in benediction on her fair and graceful head Then she arose and left the room saying to missus Rocke as she went Oh missus Rocke only last evening we were so happy But if we have received good things at the hand of God why should we not receive evil Yes my child but remember nothing is really evil that comes from His good hand said missus Rocke as she attended Clara to the door His daughter had no sooner gone out of hearing than the doctor gave way to his irrepressible groans At a sign from Traverse missus Rocke went and took up her position in the adjoining room Then Traverse subdued the light in the sick chamber arranged the pillows of the couch administered a sedative and took up his post beside the bed where he continued to watch and nurse the patient with unwearied devotion At the dawn of day when Clara rapped at the door he was in no condition to be seen by his daughter Clara was put off with some plausible excuse After breakfast his friends the physicians called and spent several hours in his room Clara was told that she must not come in while they were there And so by one means and another the poor girl was spared from witnessing those dreadful agonies which had she seen them must have so bitterly increased her distress In the afternoon during a temporary mitigation of pain Clara was admitted to see her father But in the evening as his sufferings augmented she was again upon the same excuse that had been used the preceding evening dismissed to her chamber Then passed another night of suffering during which Traverse never left him for an instant Toward morning the fever and pain abated and he fell into a sweet sleep About sunrise he awoke quite free from suffering Alas it was the ease that he had predicted the ease preceding dissolution It is gone forever now Traverse my boy thank God my last hours will be sufficiently free from pain to enable me to set my house in order Before calling Clara in I would talk to you alone You will remain here until all is over Oh yes sir yes I would do anything on earth anything for you I would lay down my life this hour if I could do so to save you from this bed of death Nay do not talk so your young life belongs to others to Clara and your mother God doeth all things well Better the ripened ear should fall than the budding germ I do not feel it hard to die dear Traverse Though the journey has been very pleasant the goal is not unwelcome Earth has been very sweet to me but heaven is sweeter Oh but we love you so we love you so you have so much to live for exclaimed Traverse with an irrepressible burst of grief Poor boy life is too hopeful before you to make you a comforter by a death bed Yes Traverse I have much to live for but more to die for Yet not voluntarily would I have left you though I know that I leave you in the hands of the Lord and with every blessing and promise of His bountiful providence Your love will console my child My confidence in you makes me easy in committing her to your charge Oh Doctor Day may the Lord so deal with my soul eternally as I shall discharge this trust said Traverse earnestly I know that you will be true I wish you to remain here with Clara and your mother for a few weeks until the child s first violence of grief shall be over Then you had best pursue the plan we laid out Leave your good mother here to take care of Clara and you go to the West get into practice there and at the end of a few years return and marry Clara Traverse there is one promise I would have of you I give it before it is named dear friend said Traverse fervently My child is but seventeen she is so gentle that her will is subject to that of all she loves especially to yours She will do anything in conscience that you ask her to do Traverse I wish you to promise me that you will not press her to marriage until she shall be at least twenty years old And Oh sir I promise Oh believe me my affection for Clara is so pure and so constant as well as so confiding in her faith and so solicitous for her good that with the assurance of her love and the privilege of visiting her and writing to her I could wait many years if needful I believe you my dear boy And the very promise I have asked of you is as much for your sake as for hers No girl can marry before she is twenty without serious risk of life and almost certain loss of health and beauty that so many do so is one reason why there are such numbers of sickly and faded young wives If Clara s constitution should be broken down by prematurely assuming the cares and burdens of matrimony you would be as unfortunate in having a sickly wife as she would be in losing her health Oh sir I promise you that no matter how much I may wish to do so I will not be tempted to make a wife of Clara until she has attained the age you have prescribed But at the same time I must assure you that such is my love for her that if accident should now make her an invalid for life she would be as dear as dear yes much dearer to me if possible on that very account and if I could not marry her for a wife I should marry her only for the dear privilege of waiting on her night and day Oh believe this of me and leave your dear daughter with an easy mind to my faithful care said Traverse with a boyish blush suffusing his cheeks and tears filling his eyes I do Traverse I do and now to other things Are you not talking too much dear friend No no I must talk while I have time I was about to say that long ago my will was made Clara you know is the heiress of all I possess You as soon as you become her husband will receive her fortune with her I have made no reservation in her favor against you for he to whom I can entrust the higher charge of my daughter s person happiness and honor I can also intrust her fortune Dear sir I am glad for Clara s sake that she has a fortune as for me I hope you will believe me that I would have gladly dispensed with it and worked for dear Clara all the days of my life I do believe it but this will was made Traverse three years ago before any of us anticipated the present relations between you and my daughter and while you were both still children Therefore I appointed my wife s half brother Clara s only male relative Colonel Le Noir as her guardian It is true we have never been very intimate for our paths in life widely diverged nor has my Clara seen him within her recollection for since her mother s death which took place in her infancy he has never been at our house but he is a man of high reputation and excellent character I have already requested Doctor Williams to write for him so that I expect he will be here in a very few days When he comes Traverse you will tell him that it is my desire that my daughter shall continue to reside in her present home retaining missus Rocke as her matronly companion I have also requested Doctor Williams to tell him the same thing so that in the mouths of two witnesses my words may be established Now Traverse had never in his life before heard the name of Colonel Le Noir and therefore was in no position to warn the dying father who placed so much confidence in the high reputation of his brother in law that his trust was miserably misplaced that he was leaving his fair daughter and her large fortune to the tender mercies of an unscrupulous villain and a consummate hypocrite So he merely promised to deliver the message with which he was charged by the dying father for his daughter s guardian and added that he had no doubt but Clara s uncle would consider that message a sacred command and obey it to the letter As the sun was now well up the doctor consented that missus Rocke and his daughter should be admitted Marah brought with her some wine whey that her patient drank and from which he received temporary strength Clara was pale but calm one could see at a glance that the poor girl was prepared for the worst and had nerved her gentle heart to bear it with patience Come hither my little Clara said the doctor as soon as he had been revived by the whey Clara came and kissed his brow and sat beside him with her hands clasped in his My little girl what did our Saviour die for First to redeem us and also to teach us by His burial and resurrection that death is but a falling asleep in this world and an awakening in the next Clara after this when you think of your father do not think of him as lying in the grave for he will not be there in his vacated body no more than he will be in the trunk with his cast off entries As the coat is the body s covering so the body is the soul s garment and it is the soul that is the innermost and real man it is my soul that is me and that will not be in the earth but in heaven therefore do not think of me gloomily as lying in the grave but cheerfully as living in heaven as living there with God and Christ and His saints and with your mother Clara the dear wife of my youth who has been waiting for me these many years Think of me as being happy in that blessed society Do not fancy that it is your duty to grieve but on the contrary know that it is your duty to be as cheerful and happy as possible Do you heed me my daughter Oh yes yes dear father said Clara heroically repressing her grief Seek for yourself dear child a nearer union with Christ and God Seek it Clara until the spirit of God shall bear witness with your spirit that you are as a child of God so shall you as you come to lie where I do now be able to say of your life and death as I say with truth of mine The journey has been pleasant but the goal is blessed The doctor pressed his daughter s hand and dropped suddenly into an easy sleep missus Rocke drew Clara away and the room was very still Sweet beautiful and lovely as is the death bed of a Christian we will not linger too long beside it All day the good man s bodily life ebbed gently away He spoke at intervals as he had strength given him words of affection comfort and counsel to those around him Just as the setting sun was pouring his last rays into the chamber Doctor Day laid his hand upon his child s head and blessed her Then closing his eyes he murmured softly Lord Jesus into thy hands I resign my spirit and with that sweet deep intense smile that had been so lovely in life now so much lovelier in death his pure spirit winged its flight to the realms of eternal bliss CHAPTER XXX THE ORPHAN Let me die father I fear I fear To fall in earth s terrible strife Not so my child for the crown must be won In the battle field of Life Life and Death He has gone to sleep again said Clara with a sigh of relief He has gone to heaven my child said Marah Rocke softly The orphan started gazed wildly on the face of the dead turned ghastly pale and with a low moan and suffocating sob fell fainting into the motherly arms of missus Rocke Marah beckoned Traverse who lifted the insensible girl tenderly in his arms and preceded by his mother bore her to her chamber and laid her upon the bed Then Marah dismissed Traverse to attend to the duties owed to the remains of the beloved departed while she herself stayed with Clara using every means for her restoration Clara opened her eyes at length but in reviving to life also returned to grief Dreadful to witness was the sorrow of the orphan girl She had controlled her grief in the presence of her father and while he lingered in life only to give way now to its overwhelming force Marah remained with her Holding her in her arms weeping with her praying for her doing all that the most tender mother could do to soothe console and strengthen the bleeding young heart The funeral of Doctor Day took place the third day from his decease and was attended by all the gentry of the neighboring town and county in their own carriages and by crowds who came on foot to pay the last tribute of respect to their beloved friend He was interred in the family burial ground situated on a wooded hill up behind the homestead and at the head of his last resting place was afterwards erected a plain obelisk of white marble with his name and the date of his birth and death and the following inscription He is not here but is risen When dear Clara comes to weep at her father s grave these words will send her away comforted and with her faith renewed had been Traverse Rocke s secret thought when giving directions for the inscription of this inspiring text On the morning of the day succeeding the funeral while Clara exhausted by the violence of her grief lay prostrate upon her chamber couch missus Rocke and Traverse sat conversing in that once pleasant now desolate morning reading room You know dear mother that by the doctor s desire which should be considered sacred Clara is still to live here and you are to remain to take care of her I shall defer my journey West until everything is settled to Clara s satisfaction and she has in some degree recovered her equanimity I must also have an interview and a good understanding with her guardian for whom I have a message Who is this guardian of whom I have heard you speak more than once Traverse asked Marah Dear mother will you believe me that I have forgotten the man s name it is an uncommon name that I never heard before in my life and in the pressure of grief upon my mind its exact identity escaped my memory but that does not signify much as he is expected hourly and when he announces himself either by card or word of mouth I shall know for I shall recognize the name the moment I see it written or hear it spoken Let me see it was something like Des Moines De Vaughn De Saule or something of that sort At all events I m sure I shall know it again the instant I see or hear it And now dear mother I must ride up to Staunton to see some of the doctor s poor sick that he left in my charge for as long as I stay here I shall be back by three o clock I need not ask you to take great care of that dear suffering girl up stairs said Traverse taking his hat and gloves for a ride I shall go and stay with her as soon as she awakes answered missus Rocke And Traverse satisfied went his way He had been gone perhaps an hour when the sound of a carriage was heard below in the front of the house followed soon by a loud rapping at the hall door It is dear Clara s guardian said Marah Rocke rising and listening Soon a servant entered and placed a card in her hand saying The gentleman is waiting in the hall below and asked to see the person that was in charge here ma am so I fotch the card to you You did right John Show the gentleman up here said Marah and as soon as the servant had gone she looked at the card but failed to make it out The name was engraved in Old English text and in such a complete labyrinth thicket and network of ornate flourishes that no one who was not familiar at once with the name and the style could possibly have distinguished it I do not think my boy would know this name at sight was Marah s thought as she twirled the card in her hand and stood waiting the entrance of the visitor whose step was now heard coming up the stairs Soon the door was thrown open and the stranger entered Marah habitually shy in the presence of strangers dropped her eyes before she had fairly taken in the figure of a tall handsome dark complexioned distinguished looking man somewhat past middle age and arrayed in a rich military cloak and carrying in his hand a military cap The servant who had admitted him had scarcely retired when Marah looked up and her eyes and those of the stranger met and Marah Rocke Colonel Le Noir Burst simultaneously from the lips of each Le Noir first recovered himself and holding out both hands advanced toward her with a smile as if to greet an old friend But Marah shrinking from him in horror turned and tottered to the farthest window where leaning her head against the sash she moaned Oh my heart my heart Is this the wolf to whom my lamb must be committed As she moaned these words she was aware of a soft step at her side and a low voice murmuring Marah Rocke yes the same beautiful Marah that as a girl of fifteen twenty years ago turned my head led me by her fatal charms into the very jaws of death the same lovely Marah with her beauty only ripened by time and exalted by sorrow With one surprised indignant look but without a word of reply missus Rocke turned and walked composedly toward the door with the intention of quitting the room Colonel Le Noir saw and forestalled her purpose by springing forward turning the key and standing before the door Forgive me Marah but I must have a word with you before we part he said in those soft sweet persuasive tones he knew so well how to assume Marah remembered that she was an honorable matron and an honored mother that as such fears and tremors and self distrust in the presence of a villain would not well become her so calling up all the gentle dignity latent in her nature she resumed her seat and signing to the visitor to follow her example she said composedly Speak on Colonel Le Noir remembering if you please to whom you speak I do remember Marah remember but too well They call me missus Rocke who converse with me sir Marah why this resentment Is it possible that you can still be angry Have I remained true to my attachment all these years and sought you throughout the world to find this reception at last Colonel Le Noir if this is all you had to say it was scarcely worth while to have detained me said missus Rocke calmly But it is not all my Marah Yes I call you mine by virtue of the strongest attachment man ever felt for woman Marah Rocke you are the only woman who ever inspired me with a feeling worthy to be called a passion Colonel Le Noir how dare you blaspheme this house of mourning by such sinful words You forget where you stand and to whom you speak I forget nothing Marah Rocke nor do I violate this sanctuary of sorrow here he sank his voice below his usual low tones when I speak of the passion that maddened my youth and withered my manhood a passion whose intensity was its excuse for all extravagances and whose enduring constancy is its final full justification Before he had finished this sentence Marah Rocke had calmly arisen and pulled the bell rope What mean you by that Marah he inquired Before she replied a servant in answer to the bell came to the door and tried the latch and finding it locked rapped With a blush that mounted to his forehead and with a half suppressed imprecation Colonel Le Noir went and unlocked the door and admitted the man John said missus Rocke quietly show Colonel Le Noir to the apartment prepared for him and wait his orders And with a slight nod to the guest she went calmly from the room Colonel Le Noir unmindful of the presence of the servant stood gazing in angry mortification after her The flush on his brow had given way to the fearful pallor of rage or hate as he muttered inaudibly Insolent beggar contradiction always confirms my half formed resolutions Years ago I swore to possess that woman and I will do it if it be only to keep my oath and humble her insolence She is very handsome still she shall be my slave Then perceiving the presence of John he said Lead the way to my room sirrah and then go and order my fellow to bring up my portmanteau John devoutly pulled his forelocks as he bowed low and then went on followed by Colonel Le Noir Marah Rocke meanwhile had gained the privacy of her own chamber where all her firmness deserted her Throwing herself into a chair she clasped her hands and sat with blanched face and staring eyes like a marble statue of despair Oh what shall I do what shall I do while this miscreant remains here this villain whose very presence desecrates the roof and dishonors me I would instantly leave the house but that I must not abandon poor Clara I cannot claim the protection of Traverse for I would not provoke him to wrath or run him into danger nor indeed would I even permit my son to dream such a thing possible as that his mother could receive insult Nor can I warn Clara of the unprincipled character of her guardian for if she knew him as he is she would surely treat him in such a way as to get his enmity his dangerous fatal enmity doubly fatal since her person and property are legally at his disposal Oh my dove my dove that you should be in the power of this vulture What shall I do oh heaven Marah dropped on her knees and finished her soliloquy with prayer Then feeling composed and strengthened she went to Clara s room She found the poor girl lying awake and quietly weeping Your guardian has arrived love she said sitting down beside the bed and taking Clara s hand Oh must I get up and dress to see a stranger sighed Clara wearily No love you need not stir until it is time to dress for dinner it will answer quite well if you meet your guardian at table said Marah who had particular reasons for wishing that Clara should first see Colonel Le Noir with other company to have an opportunity of observing him well and possibly forming an estimate of his character as a young girl of her fine instincts might well do before she should be exposed in a tete a tete to those deceptive blandishments he knew so well how to bring into play That is a respite Oh dear missus Rocke you don t know how I dread to see any one My dear Clara you must combat grief by prayer which is the only thing that can overcome it said Marah missus Rocke remained with her young charge as long as she possibly could and then she went down stairs to oversee the preparation of the dinner And it was at the dinner table that Marah with the quiet and gentle dignity for which she was distinguished introduced the younger members of the family to the guest in these words Your ward Miss Day Colonel Le Noir The colonel bowed deeply and raised the hand of Clara to his lips murmuring some sweet soft silvery and deferentially inaudible words of condolence sympathy and melancholy pleasure from which Clara with a gentle bend of her head withdrew to take her seat Colonel Le Noir my son Doctor Rocke said Marah presenting Traverse The colonel stared superciliously bowed with ironical depth said he was much honored and turning his back on the young man placed himself at the table During the dinner he exerted himself to be agreeable to Miss Day and missus Rocke but Traverse he affected to treat with supercilious neglect or ironical deference Our young physician had too much self respect to permit himself to be in any degree affected by this rudeness And Marah on her part was glad so that it did not trouble Traverse that Le Noir should behave in this manner so that Clara should be enabled to form some correct idea of his disposition When dinner was over Clara excused herself and retired to her room whither she was soon followed by missus Rocke Well my dear how do you like your guardian asked Marah in a tone as indifferent as she could make it I do not like him at all exclaimed Clara her gentle blue eyes flashing with indignation through her tears I do not like him at all the scornful arrogant supercilious Oh I do not wish to use such strong language or to grow angry when I am in such deep grief but my dear father could not have known this man or he never would have chosen him for my guardian do you think he would missus Rocke My dear your excellent father must have thought well of him or he never would have intrusted him with so precious a charge Whether your father s confidence in this man will be justified as far as you are concerned time will show Meanwhile my love as the guardian appointed by your father you should treat him with respect but so far as reposing any trust in him goes consult your own instincts I shall and I thank heaven that I have not got to go and live with Colonel Le Noir said Clara fervently missus Rocke sighed She remembered that the arrangement that permitted Clara to live at her own home with her chosen friends was but a verbal one not binding upon the guardian and executor unless he chose to consider it so Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a message from Colonel Le Noir expressing a hope that Miss Day felt better from her afternoon s repose and desiring the favor of her company in the library Clara returned an answer pleading indisposition and begging upon that account to be excused At tea however the whole family met again As before Colonel Le Noir exerted himself to please the ladies and treated the young physician with marked neglect This conduct offended Miss Day to such a degree that she being a girl of truth in every thought word and deed could only exhibit toward the guest the most freezing politeness that was consistent with her position as hostess and she longed for the time to come that should deliver their peaceful home and loving little circle from the unwelcome presence of this arrogant intruder How can he imagine that I can be pleased with his deference and courtesy and elaborate compliments when he permits himself to be so rude to Traverse I hope Traverse will tell him of our engagement which will perhaps suggest to him the propriety of reforming his manners while he remains under a roof of which Traverse is destined to be master said Clara to herself as she arose from the table and with a cold bow turned to retire from the room And will not my fair ward give me a few hours of her company this evening inquired Colonel Le Noir in an insinuating voice as he took and pressed the hand of the doctor s orphan daughter Excuse me sir but except at meal times I have not left my room since here her voice broke down she could not speak to him of her bereavement or give way in his presence to her holy sorrow Besides sir she added Doctor Rocke I know has expressed to you his desire for an early interview My fair young friend Doctor Rocke as you style the young man will please to be so condescending as to tarry the leisure of his most humble servant replied the colonel with an ironical bow in the direction of Traverse Perhaps sir when you know that Doctor Rocke is charged with the last uttered will of my dear father and that it is of more importance than you are prepared to anticipate you may be willing to favor us all by granting this young man an early audience said Clara The last uttered will I had supposed that the will of my late brother in law was regularly drawn up and executed and in the hands of his confidential attorney at Staunton Yes sir so it is but I refer to my father s last dying wishes his verbal directions entrusted to his confidential friend Doctor Rocke said Clara Last verbal directions entrusted to Doctor Rocke Humph Humph this would require corroborative evidence said the colonel Such corroborative evidence can be had sir said Clara coldly and as I know that Doctor Rocke has already requested an interview for the sake of an explanation of these subjects I must also join my own request to his and assure you that by giving him an early opportunity of coming to an understanding with you you will greatly oblige me Then undoubtedly my sweet young friend your wishes shall be commands Eh you sir Doctor What s your name meet me in the library at ten o clock to morrow morning said Le Noir insolently I have engagements sir that will occupy me between the hours of ten and three before or after that period I am at your disposal said Traverse coldly Pardieu It seems to me that I am placed at yours replied the colonel lifting his eyebrows but as I am so placed by the orders of my fair little tyrant here so be it at nine to morrow I am your most obedient servant At nine then sir I shall attend you said Traverse with a cold bow Clara slightly curtsied and withdrew from the room attended by missus Rocke Traverse as the only representative of the host remained for a short time with his uncourteous guest who totally regardless of his presence threw himself into an armchair lighted a cigar took up a book and smoked and read Whereupon Traverse seeing this withdrew to the library to employ himself with finishing the arranging and tying up of certain papers left to his charge by Doctor Day END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HIDDEN HAND This file should be named twenty nine thousand eight hundred sixty six txt or twenty nine
